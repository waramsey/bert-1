1	1	a	First non-Valve game on Steam. Bought it when it came out, the dedicated MP servers are long gone but it's worth a play co-op, single player or tunngle/hamachi multiplayer.. worth it just for the cutscenes, theme song and style.. p.s. you can edit the theme song too, change the channels, levels, pitch etc.. funky.
3	1	a	For the time, it was really good. I enjoy playing it now. There's something so satisfying about fighting ninjas with comical weapons, kickflying across the dojo, and unlocking everything just by telling the master that you like sticky rice.
5	1	a	This games awesome.  It takes a little bit to get the hang of the controls but it's a lot of fun.  I usually just play the 'Single Player Game' unlock called Ninja Onslaught, since it's a test of your Kung-Fu prowesse.
7	1	a	Certainly one of the best uses of a skin cap in a game that I have seen! Nothing like rag doll martial arts.
9	1	a	What a rare gem. If only it had made it
11	1	a	I can remember many drunken nights I spent enjoying the $#!+ out of this horribly demented 2d, paper-puppet, kung-fu parody, mushroom trip of a game.
13	1	a	This game was the first indie title on steam.... the dialogue is ridiquolous like when the villain said 'Bring me his pubes.
15	1	a	One Finger Death Punch pales in comparison to this holy grail of ragdoll action. Buy it now, the metascore is lying to you. You play as a guy who wears a cap that makes him look bald. Just buy it now. Please. For the sake of Bruce Lee
17	1	a	weird and funny and worth the money
19	1	a	best of the best
1	0	a	Install it, Tries to play, The game crashes, uninstall, reinstall, still doesn't work Money Wasting Simulator 11/10
21	1	a	Incredible game. You should pay up to $100 for this game.
23	1	a	This game is not worth the effort it takes to learn how to play. I remember being really excited about it when it first came out, but then I didn't buy it until like a year ago and it's pretty dumb, guys.
25	1	a	Its almost worth $10 just for the kung fu music mixer on the title screen that you unlock as you beat the game. It is a bit lacking with the multiplayer down and it's disappointing the main menu still lists features as 'coming soon' after ten years. But still a pretty nice title for the price.
27	1	a	Best game ever. 10/10 thriving community.
29	1	a	Take one part Faerie Solitaire and two parts Puzzle Quest and mix in a little Poker or Yahtzee for good measure and you will get something like Runespell: Overture.   You're a changeling of some sort and you fight monsters and take quests in exchange for coin and buffs (which come in the form of power-up cards). There's a story but it's not the strongest element in the game. Like the Puzzle Quest games, your battles are determined by playing a mini-game. Instead of match-3 though, the game is a card game similar to poker in which making certain combinations of cards (pairs, 5 of a kind, full house, flush, straight) will do a certain amount of damage to your opponent, who is trying to do the same to you. The ability to steal some cards from your opponent, plus the limited number of moves you get per turn to move cards or play power-ups adds just enough strategy to the game to keep it interesting.  Admittedly, the game can get a bit repetitive after a while and I found the dialogue options to be a bit tedious but fortunately the game allows you to skip them if you want. It's an easy game to learn, and it's an entertaining casual game to play. It seems to be pretty short and the achievements don't seem too difficult to collect if that's your thing.    Finding little gems like this is the reason I buy bundles.
31	1	a	Runespell: Overture melds together classic RPG components with Windows Live's player-vs-player solitaire with poker. I obtained Runespell for free in a pile of coal during the Steam Holiday Sale 2011 event. Receiving the game for free, I simply assumed that Runespell was merely a terrible, no-name title that was not worth playing. It was not until the Summer 2013 that I truly realized what I had come across.  Runespell sports a great soundtrack with honestly a decent storyline. Often times, card games that try to incorporate RPG elements (or just a storyline) end up drowning out the added components with the basic mechanics the card game - Runespell does not do this. If you are a cards-only enthusiast, this may stray a little too far from those roots; if you are an RPG-only enthusaist, this may feel more like a card game. However, if you are willing try a game that can have both, Runespell: Overture is for you.  Verdict: While Runespell: Overture is far from a lump of coal turned into a diamond, but it is definitely a gem. Simply put, Runespell is a fun, player-vs-computer, RPG, solitaire, poker game - and it is done very well. The game is so enjoyable that I honestly look forward to a remake or sequel that would incorporated online cooperative and competitive gameplay features. While it is definitely not worth $10, the current sale of $2 at the time of this review is definitely worth looking into. Here you will find a game that successfully feels like an RPG, while feeling like a card game.
33	1	a	Runespell Overture (Card/Poker/RPG/Strategy Hybrid)  For options we have Graphics Quality (Fastest, Fast, Simple, Good, Beautiful, and Fantastic), Windowed or Fullscreen, Drag and Drop or Click and Click (when moving cards around), and Sounds (Music and SFX). You can also choose a screen resolution anywhere from 640x480 to 1920x1080.  The tutorial is very well-done, teaching you the ropes without being annoying.  So what kind of game is this? It looks like an RPG that you play with cards, but that's not it at all. The primary thrust is actually a solitaire game... It's battle-solitaire-poker with RPG elements! *evil grin* Whee~!  How does that work? Looking at the screenshots will help a bit. As you can see, we and our opponent are each dealt a set of cards, solitaire-style. Ours is on top, theirs is on the bottom. We need to create poker hands by grouping cards in sets of five. If you don't know the poker hands, no worries -- the game will show you what groupings are 'legal' to play. Each 'hand' will deliver a certain amount of damage, depending on the cards you've chosen. For instance, a pair of cards (the other three cards in the group would be non-related) will deliver less damage than a flush.   In each round, you have three moves, and then your opponent gets three moves.   But wait, there's more!   You can steal your opponent's cards, and vice versa! If you grab a card from his area (or the other way around,) the card underneath does NOT flip over until it becomes his turn, but whenever you clear a pile on your side, you can immediately have access to whatever card is next in the pile (assuming that it's still your turn.) You CAN'T grab more than a single card from each others' piles -- if something is stacked on the other side (grouped,) it's off-limits to you. You can of course move multiple, grouped cards around on your own side.  Here's an example of how it might work:   You already have three Kings grouped, and take a fourth King to add to the pile, then grab a King from your enemy's cards to make five-of-a-kind (yes, unlike real poker, you can have five of the same card.) You use your third turn to select the five kings and deal damage.  This is where the strategy comes in. Now that it's too late and you've used all of your turns, you see your adversary grab that Jack of Hearts from your cards to complete a Royal Flush! EEEK~!!  Here's what you could have done to prevent it and still get your five Kings:   Forget about your three Kings for right now, grab his king, and place it on your single King, making a pair. Grab the Jack of Hearts and put it on top of another card -- ANY other card! It's better if you can do something with it, of course, but the point is to keep that card AWAY from your opponent. Now you can do one of two things: Do something beneficial (like moving a card to help yourself and/or hurt his progress) or you can move the pair of Kings on top of the three-of-a-kind, and make your attack in an upcoming round.  But wait, there's more!   Along the way we earn (via battles) and find special-use cards that can do anything from give you extra moves before your turn is over to poisoning to shielding yourself, to adding to your hit points, and more! You can only have a certain number of cards with you at the time of each battle, and (most of) the cards have finite-uses. When they run out uses, you can use the money you earn to recharge the cards.  Be sure to SAVE before each battle! You can abandon your progress if you wish -- it's an option to exit or go back to the main menu without saving.  There a bit more to it than that, including a storyline, but I'll let you discover that for yourself. ;)  This game was a huge surprise to me -- I never expected it to be so fun and addictive! A definite thumbs-up from me!
35	1	a	If you like casual games and you like an RPG style twist, then this little game was executed very well. The concept of using a standard card game as a fighting system works very well actually. Solid little game, I like it quite well!
14	0	a	As a fan of poker and Rpgs i thought this would be a pretty interersting and fun game....i was half right  It seems well enough when you begin. You try to get a combintaion of 5 cards, the attack power being determined on how well it corrosponds to to the poker hierarchy and try to wittle down you're opponents hp. simple enough.  You are introduced to spells shortly after, assuming this is where the tactics come in.....well not really.  The main problem with this game is that it is barely like poker at all and barely an RPG. The attack points could be determined by...pretty much anything else..infact it might benifit from this as what happens 90% is you and even the A.I end up making as many pairs and then full house's as you can with usually lower damage if you try anything else in addition to being harder to achieve. There almost no point in making a higher hand than you're opponent as all it does is take off slightly more hp...i mean â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ i some what assumed that it might nullify one of his hands....or something..you know kinda like POKER.  The spells offer SOME varity and tactics but not much, the cost vs reward of most spells make them mostly interchangeable.....its kinda amazing actually how there could be so much varity and yet so little.  Overall the only people i can recommend this game to is to someone who wants a simple card game that has some odd and fairly unique mechanics..........but mostly it is a dissapointment and wasted potiental.
37	1	a	If you enjoy 'poker mechanics' you'll love it ! Would be 10/10 if multiplayer mode was available, sadly you can just face CPU Overall a good &amp; balanced card game
39	1	a	Fun card dueling game. Uses traditional poker cards / hands, along with special abilities. There's not a whole lot to it, but the gameplay is mildly entertaining. The story isn't very good, but I'll still recommend it if you can find it on sale.
41	1	a	Good: - Core concept - Like puzzle quest, but the gameplay is simple, not overcomplicated (there is no sword and other magic artifacts) - Fun gameplay  Bad: - Not to deep game mechanics - Not to long campaign
43	1	a	Runespell is a combination of RPG, Solitaire and Poker, similar in nature to Puzzle Quest. You stack cards like in solitaire to form 5 card poker combos to attack your foes and cast spells. It's fairly simple to play an so is the presentation. The story is based on Norse Mythology and while it's somewhat thin it does has its twists and turns. I found the gameplay enjoyable for the most part and the game doesn't overstay its welcome. Unfortunately, as the Overture in the title says it feels like a first part of something bigger, a second game that may never come out. That didn't upset me but can frustrate some people who got more invested in the story.
45	1	a	Its a card game first, and a fighting game second. Each fight is structured by the cards played. And by 'cards', I mean a 52 card deck.  Your attacks come in the form of stacks of five such cards. Following Yahtzee Croshaw and Poker rules, getting say, a 5-of-a-kind will increase the damage that can be dealt.  The end all goal, of course, is to slay whoever you're fighting. Artwise its beautiful, but the lore of the game is handed to you via text, and wayyyyy too much of it.  8/10
18	0	a	This game is not bad. It does not anger me, disappoint me, or rub me the wrong way. It's just kinda there. The game plays like a cross between poker and solitaire. You see your stacks of cards (top card only per stack, like in solitaire), and you see the same for your opponent. You move cards around like in solitaire, stacking them on other cards, except you're trying to make combinations of five cards, which can be poker combos like flushes, straights, etc. You then use those to attack your enemy, and vice versa. You have bonus card thingies on the side of your screen that you can use to attack when you build up enough rage.  It's an okay premise, but it doesn't really seem to change and the story is just okay. It's one of the least compelling games I've played. I have nothing against this game, which is really saying something. I typically love or hate a game, but this one is just kinda meh. I wouldn't recomment paying more than a Steam sale price, by any means, but I'd recommend you play the demo if you're interested. The gameplay you experience in 20-30 minutes of that is pretty much the entirety of the gameplay from what I've seen thus far. It's not very exciting or interesting, and nothing draws me in to make me want to keep playing. It's an okay game, but that's it.
47	1	a	Love this card game, use poker hands to defeat your enemys, with plenty of spell cards and allies to aid you when things get difficult. Most enemies are easy to start off and you think its a walk in the park but it soon cranks up the difficulty later on and you have to really think ahead and put good hands together to win. If you like card games then this is worth a shot.
49	1	a	This was a fun and reasonably easy game to master. The mythic poker system is more of a cross between solitaire and poker. The layout is solitaire, but the building of hands is very much poker. Royal Flush has the most value at 50 attack points. I like the way your runespells charge by both dealing damage and receiving it from enemy attacks. The story was reasonably engaging for what it was, and they left room for DLC or a sequel. All in all, a good way to kill 8 or 10 hours. On a scale of 1-10, I would give it a 7 for fun, but an 8 or 9 as far as games you can play to kill time whne you are bored. Online play would be a natural evolution for this game. I hope they are considering the development of PvP matches.
19	0	a	Promising start, with really polished UI and tutorial, but game crashes upon leaving the first village, and there's no known solution nor support available. Until I figure it out, or find a computer on which it doesn't crash, I cannot give a better review. But watch out for this if you want to buy the game.
51	1	a	Fun little card game. Nothing special, but try playing this instead of reaching for your solitaire game.
22	0	a	Though i was addicted to it and played maybe 2,5 times to collect all the achievements, can't really recommend it, unless for a big discount. Gameplay is repetitive and becomes stale quickly (collect pocker hands to create attacks). Additional magic spell add a bit flavor. Also the story was interesting. Oh, and the epic music playing all the time becomes annoying after a few minutes :)
53	1	a	I honestly think this is the first computer based card game I have ever played. I have always passed them up thinking I would never enjoy them. Boy was I wrong. This truly is a well developed adventure. You essentially create poker hands against opponents to cause damage. The battle animation sequences keep it interesting to watch plus there are a decent number of card options, including offensive, defensive, and special abilities. As long as you understand how poker hands are ranked, this game is masterfully intuitive. If not, they even have that covered as well with an easy to follow tutorial. It also has a decent story although it's all text based so there is a bit of reading involved (you can skip conversations if you prefer). Do yourself a favor and give this game a shot.
23	0	a	A good game in the beginning but later it gets boring and eventually even frustrating.
24	0	a	Does not work in Mac OS 10.9 or 10.10. No support available from the company.
55	1	a	I've always liked Poker, but this game I like especially well.  The things it adds to the 'combat' like spells and combo chains is really interesting. The RPG elements, quests, and story added on make it pretty interesting as well.  I got it for $3 and it's definitely worth that, and certainly worth at least $10 as well but I'd still say you should get it on sale.  Great game overall, I recommend it.
57	1	a	+Interesting gameplay (same combos as Poker, played more like Solitaire but where you can steal cards from opponent) +Nice music (though gets repetitive by end of campaign) +Easy to learn rules, quick but adequate tutorial +Great interface -Mainly good for one playthrough (approx 10 hours depending on skill) -First Turn Advantage factor is significant -Role-playing/Story is secondary to the card gameplay. (all conversations can be skipped safely)  ?Game will supposedly get free update putting multiplayer in the game (hotseat first). No paid DLC.
59	1	a	its good cuz therse cards an teyy fight guys
27	0	a	6/10  Its a game worth a try but only worth a try.Campaign is not that boring and can be attractive to some players.Also have a unique concept. There are 2 deadly flaws in this title in my opinion: 1.Too many useless battles,so you usually get bored after 2hours 2.The limited times to use skills,for more times?you need to buy at a high price in store.I really dont know why design like this,so the game gets more and more boring because you dont want to try different skills but only want to end every battle fast,its a big failure.But enemies dont,they always have 10+times to use and they only mean to get you stucked one time,so more and more hard battles but looked the same.
61	1	a	 https://youtu.be/v-L9C1_TE8U   In a dark medieval world where danger lurks around every corner, the only way to survive is to play Poker! FOR YOUR LIFE!  Long story short, if you liked Puzzle Quest, but wanted to play it by building poker hands instead this game is for you.
31	0	a	Hard to tell the difference between clubs and spades especially. Sometimes I make the wrong diamonds and hearts also. Fix this, please.
32	0	a	A pretty unique concept but another of the worst games I've ever played. First boss of the tutorial is too overpowered and I can't beat him no matter what I do. There's better things out there to play. I'm done with this frustrating and stupefying game.
63	1	a	Nice twist on poker. I liked it
34	0	a	I've tried on three separate occasions to gain momentum with this game, with no success. It is flat-out boring, in my opinion. Unless you already enjoy card games, you will probably not enjoy Runespell: Overture. The design of the game is actually fairly nice, but gameplay is extremely repetitive.

65	1	a	Although not as good as PuzzleQuest (12500) it's still a fun little game. It's a mix between RPG and Poker, however weird that sounds it works. You earn special cards along the way, spells and followers and follow a storyline as you fight monsters through poker combinations. It could definently be better, more RPG elements and some new functions would liven it up. It it's cheap, it's worth it, or if your a poker and rpg fan!
67	1	a	I do not understand card games. But I won't make a negative review about this game only because it's not my kind of the game. It seems okay... It just does not make my diÑÐº hard enough to play it.
69	1	a	i cant even play i lod it up and it crashed ugh pls fix thx
71	1	a	Puzzle Quest fans need look no further for their next addiction.
73	1	a	The most bad â™¥â™¥â™¥ poker game around. With great music/graphics and gameplay...this game will make you pumped to play poker. Simply awesome.
75	1	a	7/10  A sort of RPG card playing game. A great time-killer and lazy repetitive game. It's one of those games that require one hand and is fun to come back to every once in awhile.
77	1	a	The map is a bit cumbersome, but overall this is a very good game. If you like the original Puzzle Quest, you'll probably like this.
38	0	a	Poker solitaire is simply boring
79	1	a	This game is fairly terrible, but I can't stop playing.
39	0	a	
81	1	a	recommending this random game from my games library. if you dont like it, dont blame me: I havent played it, dont even know what's it about. To be more frank with you guys, I even think this game sucks. Happy playing.
41	0	a	This is one of those games where you play it for a bit and then you get stuck. On the plus side, the main menu music is awesome.
83	1	a	the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is this shet
85	1	a	Runespell is a decent puzzle, nice poker mechanics and visuals. Obviously influenced by Puzzle Quest, but not that deep. It's not very short, you can easily get 15-20 hours out of it, also there are achievements and New Game+. Music is great. all 3 tracks, so it gets quite repetitive. Multiplayer and dlc would be great additions, but apparently this game is abandoned by the developers.
87	1	a	Nice little game, too bad it's way too short and way too easy.
89	1	a	WOW! I mean, this is just an awesome game! It offers the wonderful stragetic aspects of poker, with the bejeweled like rush of just creating attacks and chaining them. Sure, the poker aspect can be offputting for some people, but the liberal moving of the cards makes this game a lot more fun!
91	1	a	Surprisingly interesting game of cards. Though, everything else in it sucks )))
93	1	a	Good game, although about poker, none poker skill require. Kinda half strategic gameplay (make your hands stronger, while prevent opponent from getting stronger hands and using powercards) and half luck (all cards come out ramdonly). Still, the only thing I really hate in this game is some enemies' powercards are cheating.
95	1	a	Surprisingly interesting game of cards. Though, everything else in it sucks )))
97	1	a	One of the things I like about indie games is that they try out unique concepts that more mainstream developers would either never think of or be too scared to try. Runespell: Overture is a Norse themed RPG but is set apart from other RPGs by its unique battle system. You and your oppenent are given a deck of playing cards laid out solitaire-style and the idea is to build poker hands using the face up cards of you and your opponent. The better the hand, the harder it hits! Attacking and taking hits also builds up your rage meter which is used for activating spell cards similar those found in collectible card games to further give you an edge. Over the course of the game you will meet new allies, complete new quests, find new cards and further the story. If the idea of an RPG with poker-style battling and CCG elements appeals to you, get this game! You won't regret it.
99	1	a	Awesome game, much like Puzzle Quest, and really engrossing take on the standard RPG. The card combat may take some getting used to, but it is well worth it. The art, the mechanics, and the feel of this game are highly recommended.
101	1	a	nice little solitare/poker card game. The humor is alright. No bugs. the only complaint i have is there is no autosave but you can save manually so if you computer turns off etc and you for got to save your poop out of luck. (I'm clearly talking from experience.)
103	1	a	A bit of poker mixed with a turn-based RPG feel. Overall, very addictive!
105	1	a	Short game, but interesting gameplay.
43	0	a	Play Solitaire instead.
107	1	a	This game surprised me. It is a fun combination of genres.
109	1	a	Let me ask you one thing! *points at you*   Do you like playing poker?   Do you like playing magic the gathering?   Have you ever wondered what would occur if poker ever got drunk at a party and had sticky awkward unprotected sex with magic (the gathering)?  Then you are in luck you sick â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, this is the game for you! *points at you again*
111	1	a	Really fun and nice twist to the games of solitare and poker with the incorporation of a fantasy storyline.
45	0	a	I've played deeper mobile games. It plays like one of those touch screen dive bar games.  I'm a big fan of the weird RPG-Poker niche subgenre of games so I was pretty excited about this, but it lets down in every way possible.  This game is basically just a battle system, there is very little connecting fight to fight. Simplistic map and boringly presented text and portrait story. That would be fine if the battle system had anything going on... but it doesn't.  The battle system has an interesting idea buried in it, but nothing is done with it. All the magic in the game is just *DO X-Y Damage* *Block X points of Nature Damage* There is no cards for board or number or hand manipulation. This makes collecting cards seem pointless because none of them actually change your play style. The way you play your first battle is how you play your last. There is also zero consequences for death so battles have no tension.  As for the RPG mechanics... well there aren't really any. Your HP and MP go up at set story points and I guess you can choose to cast a spell that does X points fire damage or X points nature damage, but there is so little reason to bother I can't see why you would.   Story is okay, I guess, soundtrack is decent, but I can't imagine that being enough to get you through this mindless slog. If you ever thought 'I wish I had to click through a bunch of text between Freecell games' then this might be for you.
113	1	a	See the hours I've played? Yup, finished, done, a few achievements if I really cared, but I don't. So was it worth the price of entry? Yeah I guess. At it's heart it's a pretty simple game with an interesting and simple battle mechanic. The developers do a good job of dressing it up and making it feel like there's more to it, but there's only so much that can be done to make what's really more of a browser or mobile game seem more substantial. The games saving grace and why I give it a tentative recommendation is the battle system. Over all it's not bad, not bad at all. But once you figure out the optimal strategies it becomes a matter of making sure you've grinded enough to charge your 'spell' cards and your pretty much golden. With a multi-player option this would be a total recommendation, as it is buy if the battle mechanic interests you, if not give it a pass.
115	1	a	This game was a pleasant surprise. Imagine if poker, puzzle quest, and clash of heroes were thrown into a big pot and mixed up. This would be one of the results you could get from that mixture.
117	1	a	The gameplay is very unquie and is great for people who love card games/deck building games. 1 part solitaire, 1 part poker and adds abilties on top of that.  Downside- Game is not really difficult and the achievement Runespell XL: Play all battles once, has to be done during a single campaign. Which is diffcult as certain enemies only appear at certain times.
119	1	a	It's a solid game, very innovative combination of poker and fantasy TCG game style. Unfortunatelly, it lacks multiplayer game mode which would be fun to play. However, the single player storyline is interesting and the whole game atmosphere is very nice. I especially liked the in-game music, I must say I really enjoy listening to it.
121	1	a	Good game, but much too short.  The game has a good premise, good storyline, great mechanics and is fun and at times challenging to play. The only downside is that the main storyline of the game is much too short. I finished the game in two nights and was really left wanting more.  Having said that, if you can find the game on sale it still is a good value. 
123	1	a	I highly recommend this game. Its challenging, and casual. I love it and im not even a poker player.
125	1	a	Cool game. If you like poker, buy this.
127	1	a	Card game rpg? Why not... fun for a little while unless youâ€™re into cards, then you'll have a blast methinks. There should be an 'iffy' button for 'Do you recommend this game?'. More positive than negative so I'll say Yes.
46	0	a	I wouldn't recommend this one. Just play couple of battles and you've pretty much seen it all. The game is tedious even if you manage to play it through in a couple of hours. The story is pretty indefferent: something about fantasy creatures roaming in Dark age Europe and mythic religious references. Sure if you're a fan of new card games, then go ahead and invest. Something new which get old pretty fast.
129	1	a	This game has a simple card playing mechanic where you play poker against an enemy to win. Powerups and collectible cards also help with gameplay and has an RPG style story that's interesting. A casual game that's easy to pick up and get addicted to. Great little game overall.  
47	0	a	it's like solitaire with someone punching you in the face every few minutes and then slapping your cards off the table
131	1	a	Solitaire with magic. Pretty fun. No online though.
133	1	a	Puzzle Quest gets into debt and tries to win a few games of poker.  But seriously though, good game and creating poker hands is a wonderful idea.
135	1	a	Wow! What a great game. Neat take on turn-based strategy. Good story and characters as well. And a great price to boot!
137	1	a	surprisingly fun - something you can play while you have your lunch
48	0	a	Ho hum. Incomplete - a prologue to a vaporware game. The card graphics are simply ordinary playing cards, the story is slight to the point of invisibility and totally linear. The gameplay is mildly amusing, maybe a fraction above playing MS Solitaire, but not complex enough to reward paying it much attention. Worth a dollar or two purely as a solitaire game, but certainly not worth paying even close to full price for.
49	0	a	Neat Concept, but in the end too short and too easy
139	1	a	If you like poker and you like CCG's, do yourself a favor and get this game. Quick battles, just enough strategy to keep from getting boring and an interesting enough storyline to keep you wanting to progress and see what happens next.
141	1	a	If you are even moderatly good at poker, you can beat this game. Still quite a fun game though!
143	1	a	It's like Puzzle Quest, but instead of matching 3 pairs to knock your enemies health down, you play poker! The bigger your hand, the more damage you deal. If you like cards, it's kind of fun, just don't expect a great story or anything like that....
145	1	a	It's like solitaire, except... Oh. Wait. No. Yeah. It's like solitaire. Wait forever for the cards you need to appear to finish one of multiple straight flushes you set up to win the game.
147	1	a	If you like poker and you like CCG's, do yourself a favor and get this game. Quick battles, just enough strategy to keep from getting boring and an interesting enough storyline to keep you wanting to progress and see what happens next.
149	1	a	Fun game. It's not as deep as Puzzle Quest, but it's pretty fun approach to poker.
151	1	a	Imagine Puzzle Quest, except with Poker instead of Match 3. It's a quirky card game with RPG elements. Story is sufficient and doesn't get in the way. Gameplay seems to be balanced so it's not too hard, but not too easy either. The game does seem to go just a bit longer than needed. But it was an enjoyable game considering how different it was.
153	1	a	Although Runespell has a bit of grinding to level up and earn money, the game is really well done. You'll understand the game immediately if you know poker.
155	1	a	If you like Alternative RPGs, this is a greeeeaaat one, as good as puzzle quest 1, different though. cool game,.
157	1	a	Runespell is a decent puzzle, nice poker mechanics and visuals. Obviously influenced by Puzzle Quest, but not that deep. It's not very short, you can easily get 15-20 hours out of it, also there are achievements and New Game+. Music is great. all 3 tracks, so it gets quite repetitive. Multiplayer and dlc would be great additions, but apparently this game is abandoned by the developers.
159	1	a	Nice little game, too bad it's way too short and way too easy.
161	1	a	Solitaire mixed with Poker. Instead of building suits, you're building poker hands and using these hands to beat enemy AI to death. A better hand does more damage, and the more damage you deal (or take), the more spells you can cast with your building rage. This system has some nice subtleties, but the rest of the game lets it down. The AI refuses to use any high power hands at all, and instead resorts to using easily buildable hands and spamming abilities to win. This results in a final boss which has a use 5 rage -&gt; do 30 or so dmg loop which it is not bright enough to use. As for the story dragging you through the adventure, it is lacklustre at best, and is not helped by being left on a cliffhanger at the end to allow for sequels and the 'Overture' in the title. The art style is quite good though. In all, a good idea that becomes tedious because of uninteresting AI, and eventually leads to power-gaming to find no end at the end.
163	1	a	A great game. It is a fantasy combat/ sorta RPG game. Combat is through Poker hands. Kind of like the Puzzlequest games. Same genre as Fairy Solitaire.
165	1	a	Interesting twist on Poker with RPG elements
167	1	a	Runespell Overture is essentially and turn-based RPG with a poker-hand-based combat system. You create combinations with cards that you draw to deal damage or heal. The graphics are good for an independant title, but the game has a lackluster plot and is extremely short (only 3 or 4 hours of gameplay). If you enjoy playing poker, have a love for turn-based combat or have small children who like card games, then you may find this title entertaining for a few hours. Wait for a deep price discount, otherwise you may feel you overpaid for this title.
169	1	a	I highly recommend this game. Its challenging, and casual. I love it and im not even a poker player.
51	0	a	Weird gin rummy game.
171	1	a	Cool game. If you like poker, buy this.
52	0	a	It's a poker game, mixed with an rpg element. Pretty shallow. Difficulty scaling is pretty messed up?
173	1	a	The Game is awesome. A Mix of Magic &amp; Poker with a touch of Fantasy.
175	1	a	Good game and fun to play some poker-like-game. Had fun playing it, but wouldn't pay full price, wait till it's on sale :)
55	0	a	Cannot change volume
177	1	a	Just played it through and left wanting for more. It's a simple game to learn, if you know poker hands. Poker hands are used to do battle against foes. Among poker hands, you get to use spells, allies that have different powers and pet abilities. I love the tactic and mathematic side of winning the battles. Not having much time to play and having to get off the chair before my computer a lot, I'm happy that it's turn based and that you can save between every battle. Hope there's going to be more soon. :)
179	1	a	It's like Puzzlequest with poker! Or if you haven't played that, it's like versus poker!
181	1	a	Poker styled card attacking game...  If that hasn't sold you then i don't know what will.  Definatly a 9/10!
183	1	a	
185	1	a	Really liked this game. I'm a big sucker for card games and have wasted X amout of time on Windows Solitaire so this was a given. If you don't like poker or fantasy you shouldn't bother though.
187	1	a	  Orcs Must Die! is a fun and simple tower defense game:    - Casual and easy to learn: you can play for less than an hour and still have fun! - Lots of different orcs to kill: melee orcs, range orcs, flying orcs, etc. - Lots of different ways to kill orcs: weapons, powers, traps, and guardians
189	1	a	Nice polished fun TD/3PS. Got to finish it sometime. High quality game for cheap, what's not to like?
191	1	a	Fun game which offers a fresh take on the tower-defense genre. By putting you in the middle of the fray there is never a dull moment. The monsters are fun, the traps are fun, the character is fun and the gameplay is challenging and (wait for it) fun. What more could you expect? If you catch this game during a steam-sale you should definately give it a try.
193	1	a	So.Very.Fun  There is nothing more to say, this game is amazing fun and I really don't understand why everyone does not play it.
195	1	a	Orc Must Die is typically one of those indie games that must be in the library of those gamers who a) like the RPG genre b) are fond of indie games. This game is not just an RPG but also a strategy one.  It is a tower defense game, basically, but as opposed to the usual top-down approach this game uses a third person perspective. It is an interesting choice but certainly makes the game convenient to play. The rest is the usual stuff: the orc waves are getting more and more difficult and the player unlocks more types of traps. Oh, and of course, on later levels we have to look out for more areas as the enemies can approach our base from several directions.  If you are bothered by the fact that one single orc reached your base and because of that you lost a couple of points you are free to replay all previous levels for better results. This replayability and the dozens of available levels make sure OMD is a long-lasting experience. At the time of writing this review the game has a 75% discount and its GOTY edition certainly is a catch for just 2 euros.
197	1	a	This is a really great and fun tower defense game mixed with real-time action game... once you get the hang of it. Not to imply that it isn't fun right out of the gate, but it doesn't take very long for you to sort of realize that the game wants to be played in a very particular way, and if you aren't picking up the game's hints, it can get frustrating. There are frankly a lot of things about this game that are VERY USEFUL INFORMATION that it doesn't do a particularly good job of explaining to you. Here are just a few examples of things that are confusing and will drive players to consult ye olde Google:  1. How in the hell does the skull system work...??? 2. I'm kicking a** and no orcs are getting into the rift, but I keep getting low scores...??? 3. I have no idea what I'm supposed to do with this steam trap...???  Here are the short versions to those answers:  1. For 5 skulls, beat the level, get lots of combos, don't lose any rift points, and beat the mysterious 'target time' that you have no idea exists or what the specific target time is unless you finish the level and select 'statistics' from the end-of-level options then look for the fine print.  2. Combos. It's not enough to just kill all the orcs and keep them away from the rift. You have to kill lots of orcs simultaneously, really fast, as much as possible.  3. The steam trap is a worthless piece of crap that does nothing useful (and it's not the only one). Just ignore it.  If you want to head down the path of victory instead of the path of what-the-hell-is-going-on, then here is where you should start:  1. Wind Bracers 2. Archers 3. Tar pits 4. Barricades 6. Ice amulet 7. Steel Weaver -&gt; Death Augmenter  You'll unlock these as you progress, but those are probably the most useful traps in the game. Orcs plodding slowly through a snaking trail of tar while 15 archers fire flaming arrows at them simultaneously? While you simultaneously use the bracers to blow huge crowds of them into a lava/acid pit? Victory.  You'll pick up more tricks and variations as you go. Swinging mace trap + tar pits = virtually unstoppable. Expensive, but heavenly.  Are fliers a problem? Or maybe ogres? Or maybe hunters? ICE AMULET THOSE A-HOLES.  It's really fun once you get the feel for it and find the optimal strategies, but aspects of the game can definitely feel mysterious and frustrating at first.  I'm just three levels away from 5-skulling the entire game. It's been a good time.
199	1	a	Orcs don't have to die, but they keep walking into my traps.
201	1	a	  Originally posted by  The TL,DR Genie :
203	1	a	Stay away...too addictive
205	1	a	Nice tower defense-ish game. Basically you have to control the flow of Orcs in such a way that you manage to kill them all (either with traps or by yourself).  I think it is quite a good game. Also you can get it cheap enough as it currently is in the Humble (Jumbo) Bundle.
207	1	a	This game actually turned out to be a lot more fun than I thought it would be. Stragtigically placing all the wonderfully wicked traps to kill as many Orcs as possible before they get to the point where you have to fend them off is a great challange. Picking your traps is fun considering there are many to choose from. traps are also upgradable which is definatley a nice touch. Would I recommend this game, yes to anyone. So why not go on over and get your copy now and while you are there grab Orcs must die 2 and the DLC....I did!
209	1	a	 1-sentence review :
211	1	a	I hate orcs and this is good for my soul
213	1	a	Wasn't expecting much from this. Wasn't expecting much at all. Then I played the game and slapped myself in the face. Later I looked in the mirror and berated myself for being an idiot. Then I wiped away my self-inflicted tears and went back to my computer with new tears in my eyes... tears of joy brought by this game.
215	1	a	If you've ever had the sadistic urge to kill en masse with a plethora of cruel, innovative, and brutal methods this is the game for you
217	1	a	Nice take on an FPS tower defense. Worth playing just for the hilarious dialogue alone.
219	1	a	Definitely rare, when the entire objective of a game can be put into its title. Very easy to learn, nice build-up 'tutorial' (one thing every round), and funny characters with awesome lines.
221	1	a	Me: God please show me a good TD game. God: Ok son, take this game ''Orcs must die!'' Me: Thanks god.
223	1	a	Orcs Must Die! Is a first-person tower defence game developed and published by Robot Entertainment. It was released in October 2011. You play as a War Mage that defends his rift, or base, against the enemy orcs and fellow allies. In the first-person aspect, your War Mage has weapons that you use against the enemy and you construct defences to defend your Rift. This game is purely single-player. This review will cover the overall concept in regards to story and downloadable content, gameplay, and to a smaller extent, performance.  Orcs Must Die features a simple concept with an easy learning curve. The simple concept is tower defence and there is no tutorial because you place units to defend and should not require assistance. This game features 25 base game missions with 5 separate missions through the Lost Adventures DLC and there is a small story attached to the base game missions. The DLC contained new units and new levels, so while there is a passable amount of content, for $2.99 it does no harm. There is three difficulties so this game has enough replayability for 25 hours. Regarding the story, I did not overly understand the actual story at hand because it was not emphasised. The start of each level had the War Mage advancing the unclear story such as him being alone in the mages and having to defend against the enemy. There were around three cut scenes in the entire base game missions that succulently revealed the story but without those, the attached story was unclear and an afterthought. If the story was emphasised more through cut scenes this game would have been better. Moving on, each level is different and vary in difficulty, providing a new experience with most of the levels. For instance, as one level progressed it increased in difficulty. As the missions progressed, it became harder in difficulty. Therefore, I praise the level designs that are neat and add diversity and fun towards the game. As for enjoyment, I enjoyed the missions and the overall concept and style for the most part, but levels started to become stale and therefore, were becoming boring but luckily I finished all missions on easy difficulty without being burnt out.  The gameplay is basic and has a large amount of variety. The gameplay aspect is a wave begins and your units and your player beat the enemy, gaining income to spend on other units or upgrades. There is a very nice variety of units because there is a total of 30 units and weapons, and while I used the same eight for each mission there were other options at least. One feature is the upgrade tree, which is three different trees with different abilities and the player chooses one per level. You spend your currency you gain from killing enemies on unlocking abilities in the tree through a vertical skillset approach, which is you unlock skill one, then you can unlock skill 2 and so forth. For instance, one skill may be reducing the reload times for timed units. I like this but I believe its unbalanced because for 29 missions I used only one tree and the other mission I used another one, as that particular tree I mainly used drastically improved the powers of my units. Another system is the upgrading of abilities and/or reducing the cost of your units after the levels by using skulls. For instance, upgrading archer guardians would reduce the price from 600 coins to 500 coins. This proves incredibly useful because of the course of the level, as things get harder, you need stronger units. The game makes the little things count, such as witty comments from your War Mage to the sweet killing animations, providing a light-hearted atmosphere. Furthermore, the artwork is very nice with its cartoon approach that freshens the games apperance. The one main issue I had with the gameplay was the generic movements by the AI and their lack of animation in attacking and rushing. For instance, I felt that each unit lacked diversity in movement and animation because the ogres have different clothing and names but all have the same animations and movements. This is the same with the orcs and the flying units. It gets repetitive as well because you get the feeling its like 'oh, the ogre is charging at me again'. The other small issue was the pathfinding bugs with enemies, but not a major issue.  The performance was consistent and is optimised. I could play on max settings at 60+ FPS. This is not a big deal but just thought I would mention it.  Orcs Must Die is a solid game. It benefits from the simplicity and diversity of the game in enemy characters, units and the basic nature of defending against multiple waves of enemies. It suffers from the lack of animation and movement in enemy, that makes the game repetitive and towards staleness. The story is very disappointing as it is an afterthought, though it has its small moments. The artwork and gameplay is neat and light-hearted and the overall atmosphere of the game matches this description. I completed the game in eight hours and this was an appropriate length because I was close to being bored. But, I enjoyed it for the most part because of the simplicity. Furthermore, has its pros and cons and is a solid game, however, it does not stretch into being a good game. At $12.99 for the game of the year edition, I recommend it on sale. Itâ€™s a fun game that is casual and easy to play but there is not enough fresh content to play this for twenty hours.  Ratings system: For this particular game, I will rate the concept and gameplay judging from what I wrote and average those scores. I will then range the score to what I felt it should be given.  Concept: 6.5/10 Gameplay: 5.5/10 Overall: 5.5/10  Thanks for reading my review!

225	1	a	  5 out of 5
227	1	a	Good meat!
229	1	a	This game is a blast it is easy and fun to play. The in game dialouge is funny and the story is understandable  RATE IT 8.5/10
231	1	a	Really fun take on tower defense. good design. AAA art quality.
233	1	a	Exellent twist on the tower defence games, allowing you to control a hero as the waves decend.  funny story easy to control (works with controller) cool puzzels (great challange, not sure if you reference this as a puzzel game) this one is single player, but adds a competitive edge with leader boards, beat your friends.  lots ot fun, would recommend it.
235	1	a	This is a great game. I was hesitant at first, but a third person tower defense game kept me entertained for hours. I managed to get the second one as well. It's a fairly difficult game, depending on your skill level.  
237	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is an outstanding, well done Indie game with excellent, quick and ongoing support in the Steam forums by Robot Entertainment. This game can be played several different ways, so there is great replayability. Examples: 1) you can play just to complete the 24 War Mage mode levels followed by the 24 Nightmare mode levels, followed by 5 levels more for each if you own the DLC, 2) you can playthrough to '5 skull' all the levels, and 3) you can playthrough trying to achieve higher or top scores by using different combinations of traps. You MUST, however, make sure you have at least a dual core processor as this game heavily uses the second core for its animations. I highly recommend this game!
239	1	a	You know from the developer said about Orcs Must Die:  Slice them Burn them Chop them Pound them Freeze them  You can use any methods to kill Orcs in this game, simple concepts but varies of executions. Your war mage is become like one man army, dealing with thousands of orcs every time you play this.  You got traps, guardian, spells and weavers to help you killing the orcs, you'll never regret it how things works out if you play this.   This is a hybrid of 3rd person shooter and Real Time Strategy (RTS) because you need to know what kind of trap that will make orcs unable to enter your rift and don't forget of Big Boys such as Ogres and Bat for the Air units.
241	1	a	I played a lot of tower defence games in Warcraft 3. But Orcs must die sets a new level in this genre. Combining a 3rd person action game with tower defence, it created the ultimate action survival game. Set in a fictional fantasy universe, you have to defend humanity against hordes of orcs from another dimension. For that, they built big fortress' around the portals, you have to defend.  For that, you not only have weapons and spells, but a big arsenal of traps and mechanical defend systems, from ordinary spike traps to big swinging clubs, burning pits and big brutal mechanical grinders. Every level is made of one or several floors with one or several directions the enemys can spawn. You have to defend the rifts to the normal world, so the orcs dont conquer it.  Using the right collection of traps, wisly using your abilitys and being a tactical genius desides about victory and defeat. The game doesnt take you lightly. With the first levels being easily understandable and mostly fast to solve, some maps are difficult beyond everything encountered before. Some maps need tricks you have to find out all by yourself, some just need you to be fast like sonic, defending two rifts at once.  Having a small storyline, mostly living from comedy, the campaign is really fun to play. After one playthrough you unlock another difficulty, that is a serious challenge (and was a real pain for me).  It isnt a real game for casual players, but a good game, for tacticans, that not only want to think but slay their way through their enemys.
243	1	a	This is an awesome game, lots of action, and humor. The best part is you can play this on the crappiest laptops/computers!
245	1	a	 Orcs must die  belongs to a genre that is obviously meant to be have repetitiveness, but in a good way so no reason to explain that . You have to stop horde of ogres from getting into some kind of orb that powers you and the valley. Use traps, weapons, guardians and powers to stop the horde. It may sound boring but trust me you'll love it. It has a bit of story that continues on OMD 2! so it is recommended to buy both on bundle. + Play as you wish. First 2 levels are meant to teach you but after that kill them however you want. + Plenty of creative environment kills available + Increasing difficulty doesn't mean the health bar will just increase. Instead, a lot of varied types of ogres come that requires good knowledge of weapons that you'll pick before starting the stage + Creative weapons + Funny + Really cheap on sale  -Just when you think you have the grip, the game ends -No boss ending, kill the last horde and the game will just end after a cutscene  ~Stages are not sorted according to difficulty well. There are difficult levels and some dead easy levels right after that. But maybe thats how they want it to be.   Overall I give this game 7/10 Nick Cage and a big heeeeehaw!  
247	1	a	This game is quite simple: Shoot, slice and blow up all the orcs. Its a nice mix of TD and a medieval fighting game. WIth the talent-like choices you can personalise how you wanna play each level, going trap heavy, combat heavy or a mix. The story is not bad but is not the strong point. The funny coments you character makes sometimes are quite cool tho. 08/10!  Pros: - Kill orcs (need say more?) - Several diferent levels with diferent kinds of enemies - Choose how you wanna play (TD heavy or slash/shoot heavy) - Smart â™¥â™¥â™¥ coments that can actualy make you giggle (maybe...)  Cons: - Not story rich - Could get repetitive (but really, killing orcs gets boring for you guys??)
249	1	a	Orcs Must Die is just an amazing game, you'll have a smile on my face every moment you're in game.   The title pretty much explains the basics of the game, but without mentioning the best part, the traps!  The game is a tower defence/Third person shooter in which you must defend the rift in each castle. The rift is basically a portal from the orcs world to the human world, if too many orcs make it through the portal, the game is lost.  You start off with a few simple traps, a sword, and the always equipped crossbow. But as you get further into the game you will unlock new traps and eventually upgrade your traps with skulls, which are unlocked depending on how well you do in a level. As you progress through the game you will unlock more slots to equip different traps, these are kept if you go back to a previous level, which you might not have done so well on (or maybe you did really well and are replaying it because it's so much fun).   At the beginning of each level the game tells you where the orcs will come from, the route they will take and the types of enemies you will encounter during that level. The levels are divided into waves, the gap between waves is really a quick break in which you have time to place some traps with the money you have collected protecting that rift.   Levels are only short which makes it a great game to fill in time whilst having fun. The art style is also great and fits perfectly with the gameplay, and some of the cheeky comments the War Mage makes. The soundtrack is really upbeat and part of what makes you so happy playing this game.  The only downside to this game is that, unlike its sequel, it is only single player.  But overall Orc Must Die is a great game for any casual gamer, especially those that are fans of both the action and strategy genres.
251	1	a	I got this game for .99 cents when it was on sale, I thought it wouldn\'t be much fun but the opposite is true. This game is a surprising rendition of a classic TD but has a very unique element to it, You are the Character setting traps and slaying orcs with a crossbow. This game with all its unique trap combos, my favorite the Floor Burner with a spring trap to make them endlessly run through it again and again, makes the gameplay enjoyable, there are a few annoying maps but all in all a great game   Lets take a minute to go through the pros and cons  Pros- The game is surprisingly addictive slaughtering orcs over and over with a trap combo  The game has unique traps and different map levels each time so you don\'t get used to the same strategy  The headshot feature is my personal favorite   Archers on a bridge are OP  The Graphics are suprisingly great   Cons- The music for the orcs is a bit redundant but fun  I wish OGRES weren\'t so OP as well as the Fliers if you get caught offguard   Overview- I would recommend this game for someone who likes TD\'s and Strategy   PS. Or slaughtering orcs :D
253	1	a	WTF is it? - Orcs Must Die! is a third-person trap laying orc slaying monster delaying tower defense game. It is the second game made by Robot Entertainment whose studio is made up of people from the now defunct Ensemble Studios. Why is that significant? Well at one point in my life I was a console gamer, I won't go into specifics because those were dark times filled with low framerates, but I digress. The game that I played the most on xbox was Halo Wars which was developed by Ensemble. Being the amazing devs they are, they have yet again impressed me with Orcs Must Die! The objective of the game is to stop orcs from reaching the rift(s) on each level by placing traps and using weapons. Each level has multiple waves of orcs that increase in difficulty over the rounds and if enough orcs enter the rift(s) the rift score drops to zero and you lose. The plot of the game is surprisingly interesting aswell since you play as a War Mage who is the last member of an order dedicated to defending the rifts which are sources of magic for the two worlds. I think they could have gone more in depth with the story even though this is a somewhat silly game.  Verdict - Well worth the time and money.  BTW - This is better than that Rift mmo.
255	1	a	Better than i thought it would be. 10/10
257	1	a	I have very fond memories of this funny and polished third-person tower defense game. Slaughtering orcs, trolls, goblins, and other mobs is hugely satisfying, especially when racking up combos and abusing skill trees and environmental traps.  The game's only flaw is that the hardest difficulty, Nightmare mode, is a bit on the unfun side, as it immediately starts all attack waves automatically, removing the element of careful planning. If you're a completionist aiming to 5-star every level, be prepared for the tedium of restarting every single level dozens and dozens of times from scratch until that one magical run where nothing goes wrong.  Aside from that, highly recommended game. If you've never played Orcs Must Die 2, get this one on sale and play it first, and see if you get as hooked as I did.
259	1	a	Must have !
261	1	a	Very fun tower defence game
263	1	a	How does a TD (tower defense) sound combined with a third person shooter? combine it with crazy enemies and you've got Orcs Must Die! This game and its second version have small differences like the enchanters(or whatever they called themselves) OMD2 is more polished and has multiplayer but isn't as good for 1 person so get this if you have no real friends(like me)   If you're interested look up some gameplay videos on youtube :D
265	1	a	I'm enjoying this game a lot at the moment and it reminds me a lot of Dungeon Defenders. I purchased this and Orcs Must Die 2 in a Steam sale around a year ago I think and i definitely see myself replaying the game on Nightmare difficulty.  Your character is a funny war mage tasked with defending the various dungeons and bastions from an onslaught of ogres, kobolds and orcs. You get to control the war mage in third person as well as actively managing your traps.  Unlike some games you have to wait for a break or stoppage in waves to replace or build traps. In this game you can sell, and lay traps whilst the waves are happening (as long as you or an enemy aren't in the place you want to place your trap).  I felt like they could of expanded the story each level to give a sense of immersion, but the gameplay makes up for this flaw.  If you love tower defense games but want an alternative to your standard one then give this a try.  Pros:  - Fun Gameplay - Nice Assortment of Enemies - Quirky Main Protagonist - Plethora of Traps - Dynamic Trap Management - Cool Looking Artwork/Graphics  Cons:  - Not a very in-depth Storyline - Short Campaign - Graphics May not Appeal To Some - No Coop or Multiplayer Aspect. 
267	1	a	A nice little take on the tower defense and the third person shooter genres. The only draw back outside of the weapon DLC being a bit overpriced for what it gives you is that the main charecters limited repitor of speech files can get a bit grating after a few levels. But if you like tower defense games or even Dungeon Defenders but wished it's single player was better you will like this game.

271	1	a	Most Tower Defense games are a fairly hands-off genre; you build towers and they do their thing, with your involvement being where to put them and when to upgrade. But lately there have been some that let the player get into the action more personally, and Orcs Must Die is a great example of that. Compared to the nameless protagonists of the last two games, OMD puts you in the shoes of the Apprentice, one of many War Mages tasked with defending rifts to the human world from bands of invading orcs. His tutelage has come to an end though, thanks to his master taking a fatal tumble, forcing him into the role completely. As the Apprentice is a combination of Gaston from Beauty and the Beast and Groose from Skyward Sword, this isn't necessarily a good thing, especially not when the orcs seem to be getting more organized suddenly.  Instead of defending whole territories like other games, each level in Orcs Must Die takes place in a different fort, with a rift on one end and the orcs (as well as other enemies) charging in through the other. So rather than towers, you'll be placing down booby traps instead: spike traps on the floor, walls that shoot out arrows, even swinging maces you can put on low ceilings. It's not too hard to create a total death course enemies will futilely try to wade through. The game's combo system, the ragdoll physics, and the orcs' voice clips as they're being pulverized all help encourage this very well. The Apprentice also has some weapons of his own for crowd control, or the odd enemy that manages to get through your traps.  Each level offers up to five skulls, four for not taking any damage and one for speed, which you can use to upgrade your traps permanently. These range from extra damage on some, to slowing enemies, to dramatically increasing speed. It can make many traps much more useful, although what you spend can't be refunded. The game has 24 levels, which I beat in about ten hours. That unlocks the Nightmare difficulty, which offers tougher enemy placement and much less time to prepare between waves. I didn't find the base game that difficult, so it's a nice option if you want it. There's also some cheap DLC, which offers a few extra tools and some new levels; nothing necessary, but good if you want to get a bit more out of the game. And with one this well-made, there's not much reason you wouldn't.
273	1	a	Overall a good game for slaughtering Orcs. Being a fan of the Orc race myself in video games, it was enjoyable to slaughter thousands of goofy Orcs as they rushed towards you in the many different levels this game's storyline had. Many different games these days have vast differences in graphical designs, yet this game struck a good balance between keeping it simple and looking good at the same time. The same goes for the different skins and models available throughout the game.  The cutscenes explaining the storyline are a bit short, and lacking information at times, but the idea of this game is pretty straightforward; you kill Orcs. Lots and lots of Orcs. You've got many different ways to do it, all ending up in the brutal slaughter of Orcs. There are many different contrapments and weapons to help you along the way. Considering the purpose of this game, I would say this is one of the best Indie games I've played in a while and I look forward to playing Orcs Must Die! 2 as well.
275	1	a	a nice little tower defense game with lots of gibs! only thing bad is no co-op.
277	1	a	FPS meets Defend-Your-Castle-style play. On top of fun and demanding gameplay, this game also has a fantastic soundtrack and a great sense of humor.
279	1	a	Hours of orc-killing fun.
281	1	a	Orcs Must Die is a third person, action, tower defense game. You play as the War Mage, who's job is to kill Orcs, often in rather comical ways. In each level, the Orcs will spawn in waves and try to enter the rift and it's your job to kill them. This done via laying traps, using weapons, or placing guardians to fight by your side. After each level, you will be given a new power to use and skulls based on how well you did; the less Orcs that make it through the rift and the faster you do it, the more skulls you earn. These skulls can then be spent on upgrades for your traps and guardians.   After many hours of gameplay and tens of thousands of Orcs slain, I can safety say that this game IS FREAKING AWESOME. I've sunk about 45 hours into this game (counting the dlc missions). Let that sink in: 45 hours of gameplay! There are triple A games out there that give a fraction of gametime with several times the cost. It's a steal, esspecially if you can get on sale.   However, this game is about exactly one thing: killing Orcs. Beyond that, there's really nothing else to do, but for its price, its a hard deal to beat. If your own the fence, try the demo or watch some clips on youtube. And if you like what you see, buy it. Especially if you can get the entire series bundled and discounted.   TLDR: 10/10   Disclaimer: No Orcs were harmed in the writing of this review. Harmed before, oh hell yes!
283	1	a	This game helped me discover something important about myself. The fact that I apparently can never get tired of watching orcs die on traps.
285	1	a	Sometimes I almost feel bad for the orcs. Except, not really
287	1	a	Very addictive!
289	1	a	Super awesome game where you do tower defense while attacking stuff. You get to kill hoards of orcs!
291	1	a	There is: -Deadly Orcs -Some really deadly Orcs -Orc friends to are trying to kill you -Lots of killing -Lots of traps for said killing -Lots of ways to lay said traps -Lots of options for said ways And lastly, -One crazy witch  Need I say more?  GET IT.
293	1	a	So many mangled/slashed/stabbed/burnt/crushed/melted orcs
295	1	a	This is a really enjoyable game.
297	1	a	Some games you can tell are going to be good from the first 10 minutes of playing them. Orcs Must Die is one of those games. From the moment you start playing, its slick presentation becomes very apparent, ranging from a charming artstyle, to nice fast-paced music, and a comedic tone.   But presentation is not the only thing where the game shines. As a tower defence game it has some pretty ingenious trap ideas, such as trapdoors that release scorching flames, spring pads that launch orcs into the air, as well as acid bombs and even knights and archers. The level designs are also very well made, at times providing very obvious spots for where traps are ideal. And in addition to traps, you also unlock weavers, which are sorceresses that provide you with passive skills for the duration of the level. Upgrading these skills makes either your abilities or your traps/guardians more effective at what they do.  At the end of each level, you get a score (which is shown against scores of people on your friends list) and a rating out of 5 skulls. You can then use the skulls to upgrade some of your traps.  Overall the game was loads of fun. I've had a blast. Perhaps the only minor criticism I have is that when starting a new level that has more than 1 enemy entrances, it's often impossible to tell where the enemy is going to come through first. But it's a very small nitpick. The game is fun. If you like tower defence genre, get it now.
299	1	a	A solid 7/5 this was probably how I got a rollie coastie headache. I'm sure though that this game will be fun. I promise.
301	1	a	âœ“ Good graphics and design âœ“ Humour âœ“ Nice animations âœ“ Good game engine and special effect âœ“ Overall nice presentation  âœ˜ No Linux support.
303	1	a	It's very fun, but I'm mostly just writing this for the coal.
305	1	a	Great game with nice humour
307	1	a	Not sure if this is a third-person tower defense game or a shooter game on steroids. Either way, ORCS  MUST  DIE!
309	1	a	Very fun action/tower defense game. The dialog and animations are funny, the music is catchy, and the gameplay is thrilling. Not like any other TD I have ever played.
311	1	a	Ok so this game represents everything wrong with society in my opinion, What the actual â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is so bad about Orcs that we just need to keep killing them and killing them and killing them. Like I bet if we just treated them fairly they would be just really chilled out and help us out and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ but noooo just because they are stronger than us (Insecurity much?) and have different colour skin (Racism much?) we have to spike them and shoot them and smash them up. Y'know what? â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this. I wanna be an Orc.  10/10 would think I'm playing Sanctum again.
313	1	a	Really enjoyed playing this game.  Applying third person shooter with a tower defense element was like a match made in heaven with me, the variety of maps, weapons, traps and etc. really made for various types of strategies.  Absolute fun game and was one of the first games i completed for 100% achievements due to the amount of fun I had playing it =]
315	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is a nice twist on the traditional tower defence genre. Instead of building towers to defeat creeps (orcs), you set traps along their path. The game is played in third person view, so you can also kill orcs with your own spells and weapons too (similarly to Sanctum). OMD is exactly what it says on the box. You kill orcs in hundreds of different ways as they make their way to the end of the level. The premise is simple and it's fun to work out various strategies to kill orcs. Items, weapons, spells and weavers (special abilities) can all be used. Some levels are frustrating, though a bit of logical thinking goes a long way. The visuals are very smooth and fit into the laid back, humourous style of the game. The storyline and voice acting are a bit cheesy, but OMD doesn't take itself too seriously, which adds to the charm. Great game to play casually.
317	1	a	KINDA REMINDIN ME OF MY DAWG RUFUS WHO GOT HIT BY A TRUCK NIQQA LOOKED LIKE A FKN ORC YA DONT WANNA NO  GAMES GUD CEPT FOR THE BICH @SS MAIN GUY WHO LOOK LIKE HE TAKING A GIANT TURD ALL OF THE FKN TIME  WE STILL HERE NEFF MARCH 2K14 HOOD
319	1	a	fun and entertaining, worth getting if on sale. all around good game 
321	1	a	Combining a tower defense game with a shooter.... awesome! It is also a highly polished and humurous game with tons of replayability.
323	1	a	Is good game. Play very well orc kills. Recommended in holiday children times.
325	1	a	'You go first'
327	1	a	It's the sorely needed missing link between Tecmo's Deception and mainstream appeal. No satan worshipping, though :/
329	1	a	I'll keep this short and sweet. This game was a great mash-up between strategy and tower defense. Only took me about 4 hours to beat the whole game. Would have been nice to have some multiplayer/co-op, but for that I'm am looking forward to the sequel. Grab it when it's on sale and spend an afternoon or weekend enjoying this game. Excellent replay value as well.
331	1	a	Do yourself a favour and get the frickin game!!!!!
333	1	a	This is actualy a really neat game :D the hurmor so far is pretty funny, the gameplay is exceedingly fun, and really makes for a good mix of stratagy and action! so if you like tower defense, violance, and action (run around and shashing up stuff/shooting stuff..) games this is a fun game to get :D
335	1	a	Ultimate time-eater. Probably even better then Plants vs. Zombies in this aspect. Get it and you won't regret it.
337	1	a	Orc's must die and Orc's must die 2 is an addictive, fast bpaced and incredibly fun game. It's easy to pick up the game play and the UI is intuitive and well made. The Graphics and color is Awesome !! The music really sets the mode and is really cool. I would recemend this game to anyone... ( 5 out of 5 stars) BO
339	1	a	This was my first steam game! And its good.
341	1	a	This is one hell of a fun reverse-tower-defense game, mixed in with a FPS. Great stuff. If you like battling orcs, then you'll love Orcs Must Die!
343	1	a	One of my favorite games. Loads of fun in a strategy/puzzle FPS.
345	1	a	Get this game. Kill orcs. Have fun. Get extra maps for the sequel.
347	1	a	This game... the most fun I've had in ages!
349	1	a	This game is amaizing! Worth every penny! Can't wait for more DLC's to come out.
351	1	a	Awesome game!Unique gameplay and defense tactics, very nice upgrades. Lots of humor and you get to kill LOTS OF ORCS! :D I recommend this game, it's playable by all ages, no matter whether you are 12, 20, 40, 70... :D You will like it! It's lots of fun. I would give it a 10/10! :)
353	1	a	Fun game full of orcy destruction.
355	1	a	Looks childish, but it is amazingly fun! Hours of gameplay and quite addicting! And it's not like one of those games where once you have good stuff everything is easy, the levels get super challenging. The downloadable content (DLC) is incredible, it makes the game 10 times better. I definately suggest buying this game AND the DLCs. Awesome game, and I highly recommend it!
357	1	a	The most fun you can have without signing a waiver.
359	1	a	Epic Fun with a unique twist. An original game concept done well.
361	1	a	Easy to learn and hard to master. Very fun and flexible to meet a lot of different play styles.
363	1	a	Fun game love all the trap, wepaons and spells variations. Great game in my eyes worth the buy.
365	1	a	It's a trap! Well, quite a few of them actually. And you can upgrade them. Orcs Must Die! puts a proactive spin on the tower defense genre. Different enemy types require tactical thinking and you'll find yourself going back to older levels to try new stregies. Fun!
367	1	a	Got to love this game. Tower defense, FPS, Story progression, hilarious... This game has it all. This is a great goto game when you have a few mins to kill.
369	1	a	Super-fun 1-player beat-em-up / tower-defence game.
371	1	a	Quality tower defense game (minus the towers). It's got traps, it's got shootan, it's got pretty funny jokes, and a buttload of content really.  Mindless fun.
373	1	a	Horrendously good fun. My main grievance is that the Warmage (the protagonist) is a complete idiot and the game takes every opportunity to beat you over the head with that fact. Fortunately you can mute the game so you don't have to listen to him. Another small issue I had was that there are occasionally little nuggets of exposition during the game, but you can barely hear them over the sound of orc giblets spraying across the level.  Putting those issues aside the game rewards you with an army of orcs and associates to slaughter your way through with a variety of pokey, burny, zappy and crushy things. The score system gives you an incentive to go back to earlier levels with your new toys and make orcs die in new and interesting ways. You can approach each level in a variety of ways, so if you prefer setting up a death alley and watching the carnage from afar you can do so. But if you prefer getting up close and personal with a blade whilst a tar pit slows your enemies down, that's a valid option. Later in the game you unlock 'Weavers', giving you mid-game temporary upgrades for your traps and skills which add to the number of strategies you can use.  I didn't have any technical issues with the game although on an older machine the game did slow down a little when a lot of enemies were around, but otherwise it runs well.  Overall I'd recommend it to tower defense fanatics as well as action or strategy game fans.
375	1	a	Brutal all the way. Must try
377	1	a	Hey ORCS MUUUUUUST DIE ... and u will kill the Orcs or they will kill u ... nice TD Game for Soloplayer ... many funny traps and gadgeds
379	1	a	Awesome game. very fun. Recommended!
381	1	a	PC Gamer is right. This game has a limited scope but within that scope it does it's thing extremely well. It's like an action puzzle, how to lay your traps and fight so that no orcs get through. The cartoony 3D environments are pretty and the variety of approaches to each scenario are a blast.
383	1	a	surprisingly deep and addicting. Giddy up before the sequel releases!
385	1	a	If you haven't got this game yet, get it! It's simple but fun, and challenging to get 5 skulls on each level. Truly a great find in 2011 gaming!
387	1	a	who wants more traps? I do! I do!
389	1	a	I really like this game. It's a charming 3rd person action tower defense score-chaser that doesn't take itself too seriously.   You set traps and kill things (sometimes even without the traps). There are lots of traps and lots of ways to play. This game uses a fairly simple scoring mechanism of kill steaks and combos (#of things hitting something as it dies) that is easy to understand, but tough to master so topping the leaderboards is quite the trick.  The price is affordable, the game has 24 levels that can be played on any of the 3 (only the last 2 matter) difficulty settings + a few more levels in the Lost Adventures DLC and I find it to be worth every penny.
391	1	a	It was alright
393	1	a	Definitely worth buying.
395	1	a	For eveyone who likes WC3 TD, this game is a must have! Awesome settings and you can now run around with your own charachter. I had a lot of fun! Tip: if you notice you did the wrong placement of traps within the first few rounds, just recreate the game and try a difference tactic.
397	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is a tower defense game where you are in control of the hero who will be fighting off Orcs and planting traps. The game plays like a 3rd person action game mixed in with the traditional tower defense formula. The player plays an extremely active role and your crossbow will be needed just as much as wall arrow traps. There are numerous traps at your disposal and you unlock more as you go along. By the end of my play through I ended up using just about every single trap. They are all designed very well and most of them work well with each other to produce great kill boxes.  The game features three difficulties but you'll want to start on War Mage as you don't gain many skulls (the currency used to upgrade traps) on Apprentice (the easiest). At the end of each map you are awarded between 1 and 5 skulls based on your performance. Getting 5 skulls will require a significant amount of strategy (especially on Nightmare, although there's no achievement for getting all 5 skulls on all stages on Nightmare, just War Mage). You'll need to pretty much know what is going to come out and during what wave so that you can prepare adequately. YouTube is an excellent reference if you're having trouble and is great for learning new strategies that you may not have figured out on your own.  There's not much more to the game outside of the general story mode but getting all 5 skulls on War Mage and Nightmare will take a while, making the game a great value considering it's already quite cheap. The game features leader boards so you can always go back one you've fully upgraded your traps and go for a better score on the global rankings or among your friends. Overall this is a great tower defense game that is well worth your time if you have any love for the genre.   8/10
399	1	a	Orcs Must Die! 2 is one of my all time favourite games. So when I checked out the original Orcs Must Die!, I was pleasantly surprised. This game is pretty much just Orcs Must Die! 2 singleplayer, and if you're a fan of the sequel, you should definently check this game out. 9\10, and yes I am a fanboy.
401	1	a	Trap defense game that pits you against hordes of orcs with each their unique abilities. At your disposal you have a number of traps and spells to keep them at bay. One of the best things I liked about this game is that on other tower defense games when that one straggler makes it past your defenses you have to just sit and watch as it wakes right into your nexus. On OMD you have the option to run over there and kill that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ yourself! Very child friendly but also mature and challenging enough for older audiences without seeming unfair.  4/5 One of the best tower defense games I've had the chance to play!
403	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is third person a hilarious sit-game-com settled in fantasy medieval theme.  Technically:    the game is a fantasy / medievial 'tower' defence + third person 'shoot everything that survived trap lines',    30 traps, spells and weapons (total), mostly upgradable    20 (24?) levels to beat + a few in DLC, approx 10h of gameplay,    nightmare difficulty, another 10h of gameplay,    challanges - max score per level - 5-10h,   Gameplay notes:    The difficulty per wave grows with number and setup of enemies, and shrinking space for traps,     The enemies do not seem to have increased HP per wave,    Most of levels are balanced so that the Mage needs both traps, spells and wepons to hold the line,    Weapons require item slot, there are two in the game: sniping crossbow and melee blade staff,    Spells require equipment slots and to use in the mission and mana to cast,    Defender minions require item slot, and gold to place them,    During a level the Mage can buy upgrade from one of three 'weavers': generic trap upgrade, spell upgrade, mixed upgrade.    Traps cannot be directly upgraded during the level. They can be upgraded during the story.    Some levels have two or more distanced attack paths, of which at least one must be fully secured with traps,    No endless mode (can be found in OMD!2),    It is possible to replay old levels with improved trap set for better score.    All of the characters are stereotypic to the point of lunacy.    The main hero, 'The Warmage' is a young, dumb lad. Blindly convinced of his own awesomeness. He needs to prevent orcs from enering portals to our world (at which he is good)... and to figure out (at which he is terribly bad) a more permament solution.     His (former) Master shows up in the story by his memories. He was the last (failed) hope for the world, spare his student, but the only thing greater then his apprentice's ignorance, is his stupidity.    The Sorceress (the prime enemy in the game), does not show up directly, but magically takes quarrels with the Warmage.    Most of her arguments are attempts to insult the Warmage so that he can't figure that out (which is not that hard afterall). Most of Warmage's speech are (futile) attempts flirt up the Sorceress, and show that he is the most handsome and awesome man in the area (which if of course true, as he is the only one).    The orcs are main competitors for the price for The Best Cannon Fodder in video games: dumb, ugly, run and die in hundreds, have hilarious (though still dumb) speach lines, can be headshot-ed.   General info    OMD is settled in medieval-themed bastions / castle / dungeons. There is only one level theme.    Forget about cinematics. The storyline is presended via semi-animated drawings. This is a great idea and fits great into the game.    The orcs, the Warmage and the traps have a bit grotesque, comic design. Again, this suits the overall game mood, and slows down graphics 'aging'.    Amazing music. If you run into game OST, do buy it. I managed to get one from Humble Bundle.   Any problems?    Trap balance - some traps are simply better, some are just useless (Hint: use traps with large AOE and fast or no reload),    Since trap upgrades are permament, The Warmage usually sticks with favourite set with little room for experiment.    No co-op game (solved in OMD2)    The super-arogant hero can be hard to get used to. The humor can be sometimes percieved as primitive.    High emphasise placed on combat, it is not possible / extremly difficult to play only with the economy.    First two levels in nightmate are... too nightmareish, the difficulty seems to be easier further.    there are two levels in the game (including final), which must be simply learnt and played by hearth. In each wave the  Mage must build traps in particular area, buy a proper upgrade and solo secure another corridor.  Mispacing traps will leave the attacked corridor unsecured.     Strong sides    humor,    nice character design,    good overall ballance in map design,    good balance of strategic / economic components in gameplay (unless you don't like action in tower defences),    interesting maps,    high 'replayablity', level score to be maxed.   You should avoid the game, if you:    dislike action in tower defence and prefer them to be purely economic,    dislike arrogant and dumb protagonists   Do play if:    don't mind thinking / action hybrid,    look for a lot of fun,    tend to max each level  
405	1	a	Like tower defense games? How about in third person? Also do you like killing lots of orcs? Well then Orcs Must Die is the game for you as it has all 3. It's a really fun and addictive third person tower shooter game with really good gadgets and varied and tough enemies. You get to be really creative with the defense using all the neat gadgets in your arsenal. Also, the A.I is good in this game. Overall, if you like tower defense games, you'll have plenty of fun times in this game.

409	1	a	I wanted to give this game a legitimate chance before I wrote my review. I am an avid tower defense gamer; there is just something undeniably satisfying about stoping someone from reaching their goal.... its actually kind of sick really. This brings an intresting change of pace. The humor is pretty engaging, I find myself eager with each new level to hear what kind of quip the War Mage will say. The traps are creative and encourage you to find new ways to supress the Orcs. Will your bombard them with Archers while they are arduously walking through a tar pit, or perhaps you would like to take them on yourself while cattle them into a grinder. Whatever menacingly creative way you wish to protect the rift, this game has something for you.  Play it if : You love tower defense (I assure you, you won't be dissapointed) Avoid it if: You are an Orc Lover, You are not creative, or obviously if you don't like tower defense   9/10 in my book The only thing holding it back is no mutiplayer, but the second game remedied that issue
411	1	a	+) I liked how the game was. Your view, aim, the battle, sound and effects, etc.  +) Various types of enemies were interesting.  +) The fact that basic traps don't become obsolete was good.   -) It would've been more nice if we could fight the witch or was it mage?.  -) They make you click a lot. They should've made it auto so you can just press on. Not everyone is using game pads.  -) Having passive skills or upgrade for personal improvement would've been amazing but there was no such thing. There is a similar one but that's a choice and you have to spend defense money so NO to that.
413	1	a	Good game! It can get challenging and have you truly under pressure but good strategy and using some basic evil intuition will have you mulching orcs into a pleasant and nutritional sauce! Bathe in that stuff youngster... it'll keep you sharp and youthful inside long past the point where hope and happiness fades into a bitter diy tincture that doesn't heal the wound that won't close... yes.... a most excellent orc genocide simulator! Bonus creatures included for happy end!! and it had a very good sequel also! :D
415	1	a	Dunno what to say. If you like tower defence, play it. If you like OTS madness, play it. If you like crude humor with soho accents, play it.
417	1	a	Loved it! Funny challenging and engaging.    
419	1	a	It was alright
421	1	a	Definitely worth buying.
423	1	a	Most fun I have had in a while. Consistant gameplay with little twists.

431	1	a	What it says on a tin.  Fun!  Fun-fun-fun. Polished game, smooth action. Game feels fluid and responsive Enjoyable. Challenging enough, nice pacing, has character progression.
433	1	a	Great game.
435	1	a	Orcs Must Die is an incredible new take on tower defense and full of action packed strategy!   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTYqMiAfe7w 
437	1	a	Veridict: 9.0  The protagonist will make you laugh your *ss off, while the tower defense style of this game will turn you into a fan of the genre. And if you are already a 'tower defense guy', then this title is a must have.  Despite it tower defense style, you can defeat most of the levels using only spells and weapons like a fire crossbow, a magic sword, bottles of acid and many other apparatus, just like a FPS/action game. Or even better, why not both? After you spread your vicious traps throughout the fortress' hallways you can equip one of your weapons of choice and slay any orc that pass through your killing machines.  Orcs Must Die! have a wide variety of traps, weapons and spells that you can use to stop the hordes of orcs from entering the rifts, you'll play it on the role of the last (and funnier/dumber) War Mage alive, and your duty is to defend the order and protect the land of man from being invaded through the rifts.  Fun is the only word capable of defining this game. And if you ended it and liked it, don't get emotional.. there's a sequel for this: Orcs Must Die! 2, so you can keep playing and slaying more and more orcs.
439	1	a	Really fun game, reminds me of the days of dungeon keeper and setting up traps for the invasion of the good guys, Well in orcs must die, you are the good guys, doing it the other way round, setting traps for the bad guys.   Great game to play, can't recommend enough.
441	1	a	Love this game! :D Got it for my B-day years ago.
443	1	a	A very fun third-person tower defense/strategy game from a person point of view. Great humor, fun story, goofy voice acting and atmosphere, later levels can provide a solid challenge to the more skilled players.
445	1	a	The name of the game is defend teleportation rifts from onslaughts of hundreds of orcs with hilarious lines. You can do this with several weapons, spells and strategically placed traps, all of which are unlocked one by one for completing each of 24 different levels. While the game probably won't keep you glued for hours at a time due to its repetitive nature, it's at least 8 hours in length or more if you hope to achieve 5 stars (or skulls in this case) on every map to get the most out of your trap upgrades. I for one love traps and defensive structures in games, so needless to say, it got all the more amusing watching my traps grow to an un-escapeable nature by the last few waves of growing orc numbers and other varying monster types. It's great casual fun with a nice challenge and I reccomend it to anyone, as long as you can get past the fact that the options menu is quite limited. Oh, and no re-bindable keys. For shame!
447	1	a	One of the better tower defense games I have played. I'm more of a co-op gamer though, but when there is no one to play Orcs 2 with then this is a nice alternative, considering Orcs 2 is impossible solo.
449	1	a	Very addicting
451	1	a	Greate Game!  Much better than the sequel, because in the sequel you get the feeling, that the traps are ineffective.
453	1	a	This is the orginal, it is better than the sequel (OMD2).
455	1	a	Got it on sale, it is a great game to play when you are frustrated and need to calm down. I have 9 hours and am not even half way through, but I think I might be because I will only go to the next level if I get a perfect score.   I got it on sale, but I'd say it is worth the $10.
457	1	a	One of the best single player Action / Tower Defence games money can buy. Cheap and extremely fun, highly recomended.
459	1	a	Pretty fun fps/tower defense game.
461	1	a	Orcs must die! is fun to play and has epic music.The warmage also has some funny things to say during gameplay.
463	1	a	Not as good as Orcs Must Die 2! But still a really good game overall :)
465	1	a	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIztLKgtlNQ 
467	1	a	It was really fun to play, story is kind of good, graphics and gameplay are really nice.
469	1	a	Really fun single player game, you should check it out if you get the chance. Very addictive, and the constant mayhem and slaughter makes it a game I couldn't put down until I beat it.
471	1	a	Something about the fact that the orcs die purely for my own entertainment creeps me out a little. And also makes me a little giddy on the inside like my big brother just won me a prize at the carnival by throwing baseballs at sad clowns.
473	1	a	I had to stop because I had to click too much and it was annoying Chris on skype.
475	1	a	It took me cce 8 hours to complete first run on standard (not low) difficulty. Game offers variety of traps to serve one's 'style' - are you a direct damage dealer, tricky tactician, do you like traps to do all the work or do you like being engaged in a fight? These and many more options are offered. The variety of monsters, their stregnth, number in comparison with your abilities, traps and magic is well balanced. There are points in game where player must be very flexible. When you finish game, you can start with all upgrades and traps unlocked from previous run and do campaign from scratch. There are tougher monsters coming in already at start. This is sad, because I would welcome ability to play new game already on highest. I am not going to play again. Not because I wouldnt enjoy it, but because I have no time and want to finish other games, too. In short - great chillout game.
477	1	a	Orcs Must Die is a tower defens / shooter video game.  I'm personal really big fan of this games. You not only try to defens yourself and the portal with traps and towers. Because you have the option to fight your own. Charcter has a small amount of upgrades and new weapons to unlock and choice. It's has a very big number of challanges to complete to clear the full game. Very nice to play alone.. and alone because there is no freaking multiplayer... for this buy part 2. Easy to control video game and playing it with a controller plays very nice.  No co-op multiplay still.. a must have game for the tower defense / shooter lovers. I give this game a 8/10.
479	1	a	Good strategy game, nice set of traps and skill to play with. levels and be completed in different ways to get most points or just to have fun, tho on normal story can be completed in 3 hours.
481	1	a	This game is just fun. The gameplay is straight forward yet offers complexity as well. It doesn't take itself too seriously (this should have been obvious from the get go). Overall a good game especially if you can pick it up on sale.
483	1	a	Must orcs die!? And why is the death of ogres and gnolls a foregone conclusion of this? The title's inherent racism is not really questioned at any point. The only option towards a peaceful resolution is to buy drugs that become available late in the game and which you can never afford enough of to avoid bloodshed anyway. The player character is a smug, chauvinistic jock who relishes in the slaugher of people of different skin tones. Utterly disgusting. Servicable gameplay though if you can look past the developer's obviously politically inspired agenda behind this game.
485	1	a	Simple but very enjoyable. The main character is grand enough.
487	1	a	Guys this game so funny ) try it )
489	1	a	I am an avid FPS gamer, and despite my tendency to skimp on other genres, I have to say, this game is excellent! Great for killing time. Lots of colours and goofy traps.   It doesn't however feature a coop mode, but fortunately that was introduced in OMD2.  A solid package all around :)
491	1	a	Really fun, I love it :) 8/10
493	1	a	This is one of very best tower defense game
495	1	a	its a incredibly goooooood game
497	1	a	Bullet Point Review :  + Action packed and fast paced + Challenging when reaching the endgame + Cool soundtrack + Witty humor + Smooth looking graphics + The game really motivates you to finish it, which immediately sets it aside from 9 out of 10 games.  - Danger of getting stuck, especially for casual gamers. ( Real casual gamers, not the term 'casual' hardcore gamers like to use for the average gamer ) - Repetitive to a certain degree - Bullet projectiles make no sense ( you have to aim above the head to get a headshot )  Conclusion : 9/10
499	1	a	I wasn't expecting this to be so outrageously fun. I bought it in a sale and was not disappointed at all.  Very fun!
501	1	a	Orkmobslashing headshotspreading corpsestomping greenskinshredding gnollstunning fun. Seriously. Try the demo, if you don't believe my supreme Opinion of supremeness, which is supreme.... by superiority! ;D
503	1	a	Crazy fun action tower defense style game, you'l be hooked within one level. Funny and enjoyable.  It's a healthy blend of Shooter with Tower Defense, allowing you to build traps on the walls, ceilings, and floors to create unique kill zones. But also letting you equip spells and weapons to fight off the Orcs that way if you'd like.
505	1	a	Great looks, performance, humor, MUSIC and action!! Do not miss this game!
507	1	a	gut busters
509	1	a	Wow this game is addicting! Part shooter, part tower defense, this game is AMAZING! Not to mention hilarious! The point of the game is to defend Rifts, and to do this you must place traps on the floors, use magic, and your trusty crossbow. But the funny part comes with the way you can defeat the opposing Orcs. One way is to place Spring Boards on the floor that launch the orcs whereever you aim the board. This can result in humorous and deadly outcomes. Another example is the dialogue, just plain goofy! Plus....drum roll please....ACHIEVEMENTS!!! Yup another game with achievements to keep the gamer coming back for more slightly-stoopid bragging rights! Pick this game up! Its unique, funny, fun, and OMG FUN!!!
511	1	a	I like this game! This is basically a tower defense + third person shooter, similar to Sanctum, but with a much better sense of humor and style, and doesn't give me motion sickness. Within the first five minutes of playing, I quickly felt inclined to play through the rest, which is a rare experience these days.   There's a good progression, as the game starts to get noticeably harder in the final levels. There is a nightmare difficulty once you beat the game on normal, for an even harder challenge. Every level you're presented with a new trap or item, but I found myself not using most of them, having tried them out and finding them less effective than existing gear. Since every level offers up to 5 stars, replay is fairly good for those striving for the most reward out of each level.  Well worth the asking price, especially on a sale. I hear the recently released sequel is even better, so I look forward to that.
513	1	a	One of the most fun 'tower defence' games ever.
515	1	a	I liked Dungeon Defenders a lot, but Orcs Must Die is even better. There is just something so incredibly satisfying to watch hordes of Orcs get blended in a maze of traps. From spikes on the ground or the walls, massive popup furnaces that churn walls of fire, milling barrels, rotating axes and the most epic weapon of them all in my opinion, the swinging mace. Or if you want to have some fun, the spring trap that makes them go airborn. You can either make them fly over the halls from one side to another using spring traps that face each other (it's just funny to do that :D ) or you simply throw them in lava or acid. Don't feel like blending the orcs? No problem, you can shoot them yourself with crossbow or use various other powers on them as well as place archers and knights that will fight for you. And when you think you exploited all the options, there are also powerup cards that give you special abilities like stronger player characteristics, stronger and faster traps or more powerful weapons. You invest some of the funds you have to buy traps into them and make yourself or the traps more efficient. Just awesome blend of FPS, lite RPG and tower defense. It's brilliant and i can't wait to play Orcs Must Die 2. Just have 3 more missions in the first game, but so far i'm totally in love with this game. Oh and unlike in the Dungeon Defenders, you can re-route their paths with barriers, so you can funnel them through one hallway to make your defending job easier, create a choking point where they all clutter together. It gives the game a proper tower defense feel and a lot more options to exploit on for maximum Orc blending power!  The game engine is also fantastic. From what i can tell they are using their own engine, but it's super fast, looks really good and has really nice character physics (really love the way how player's dress is affected by the movement) as well as physics that affect the orcs. And they achieved all this without the stupid PhysX. Thumbs up for that! And all this packed with quite well placed humor and player character making fun of himself and the orcs. And the way how developers presented the main character as the most stupid person in the world. It's just really funny game as a whole and love it for that.  And since there are so many different options to play through the maps with various approaches to horde control you can have countless hours of fun with the game. Highly recommended as i guarantee you countless hours of insane fun!
517	1	a	Nice game, I want to try Orcs Must Die 2 :D
519	1	a	Tower defense and first person action blend incredibly well in this masterpiece. Aside from a hilarious cartoonish humor, the challenges are diffcult enough to keep you playing for dozens of hours. The music score is fantastic and the graphics are colorful. I suggest this game to anybody who enjoys tower defense games!
521	1	a	This game is an absolute riot and blast to play. No MP support, but the SP game is a ton of fun and some of it is extremely challenging.
523	1	a	I definatley recommand this game and I hope u have extra cash cause your going to want part 2 after playing this!
525	1	a	Gives perfectionists high blood pressure.
527	1	a	I have wanted this game for a long time..Thanks steam for a wonderful sale!!! Let the killing begin!
529	1	a	One of the most fun tower defense games I have ever played! The controls are perfect, the humor is spot on, the character animations reek with personality, there's lots of replayability if you want to get the highest scores and ratings per stage, the story is hilarious and the soundtrack is absolutely amazing! What also makes a great tower defense game is freedom in how you accomplish your goal. This game definitely leaves room for success via various strategies. Definitely a must buy!
531	1	a	Probably the best tower defence/trap defence game ever.
533	1	a	When I was young, I played a lot of tower defence games in Warcraft 3. But Orcs must die sets a new level in this genre. Combining a 3rd person action game with tower defence, it created the ultimate action survival game. Set in a fictional fantasy universe, you have to defend humanity against hordes of orcs from another dimension. For that, they built big fortress' around the portals, you have to defend.  For that, you not only have weapons and spells, but a big arsenal of traps and mechanical defend systems, from ordinary spike traps to big swinging clubs, burning pits and big brutal mechanical grinders. Every level is made of one or several floors with one or several directions the enemys can spawn. You have to defend the rifts to the normal world, so the orcs dont conquer it.  Using the right collection of traps, wisly using your abilitys and being a tactical genius desides about victory and defeat. The game doesnt take you lightly. With the first levels being easily understandable and mostly fast to solve, some maps are difficult beyond everything encountered before. Some maps need tricks you have to find out all by yourself, some just need you to be fast like sonic, defending two rifts at once.  Having a small storyline, mostly living from comedy, the campaign is really fun to play. After one playthrough you unlock another difficulty, that is a serious challenge (and was a real pain for me).  It isnt a real game for casual players, but a good game, for tacticans, that not only want to think but slay their way through their enemys.
535	1	a	Blow off some steam and embark on a journey whose purpose is the total slaughter of orcs seeking a better homeland. Crush their dreams. 
537	1	a	Jean Kirstein strongly approves of this game.
539	1	a	Blow off some steam and embark on a journey whose purpose is the total slaughter of orcs seeking a better homeland. Crush their dreams. 
541	1	a	I iz an Orc and I fink dis game is inkredibly rood.
543	1	a	Fun. Try out OMD 2.
545	1	a	addictive game!! really awesome arcadish kindo' game graphics but really superb!! While playing the game its intensity and quickness makes me too much impulsive!
547	1	a	This is like a tower defense game, in which you build catapults, and traps to kill ogres to prevent them from reaching their objective. Really entertaining and challenging.
549	1	a	I feel sorry for the female orcs..........
551	1	a	this is very fun and unique, played through it many times and it encourages you to go back and perfect the game. Reminds me of plants vs zombies in its addictiveness.
553	1	a	Excellent Tower Defense with a 3rd person fighter twist. So addicting.
555	1	a	This is one of the best and engaging Tower Defense games I have ever played. It mixes third person shooting and trap placing strategy so well it couldn't be done any better.  ÐžÑ‡ÐµÐ½ÑŒ ÐºÑ€ÑƒÑ‚Ð°Ñ Ñ‚Ð°ÑƒÑÑ€ Ð´Ð¸Ñ„ÐµÐ½Ñ Ð¸Ð³Ñ€Ð°, ÑÐ½ÐµÑ€Ð³Ð¸Ñ‡Ð½Ð°Ñ, Ð±Ñ‹ÑÑ‚Ñ€Ð°Ñ Ð¸ ÑÐ¾Ð²ÐµÑ€ÑˆÐµÐ½Ð½Ð¾ Ð½ÐµÑÐºÑƒÑ‡Ð½Ð°Ñ. Ð­Ñ‚Ð° Ð¸Ð³Ñ€Ð° â€” ÑÐºÐ°Ð¹Ñ€Ð¸Ð¼ ÑÐ²Ð¾ÐµÐ³Ð¾ Ð¶Ð°Ð½Ñ€Ð°.
557	1	a	Hands up who wants to die!
559	1	a	A very biased piece that criminally neglects to show the staggering number of grieving mother orcs and countless baby orcs now forced to grow up in a single parent household. White man strikes again...
561	1	a	When I play Orcs I feel my iq plummet like TV viewership around election time.  Building killboxes then listening to the orcs scream in pain brings tears to my eyes as I laugh at their terminal one-liners. I am a sick sick man.
563	1	a	+1
565	1	a	Orcs Must Die, what are you waiting for? buy the game, or no, hold on, now that hte second one is out buy the second one.
567	1	a	Great combination of tower defense, rpg, and physics = amazing orc killing pc game!!
569	1	a	This game is AWESOMENESS
571	1	a	Great game ,easy at first but harder at the end ,  lots of cool items and traps , the only thing i miss in a multipalayer mode/map
573	1	a	A Great Singlepayer Third Person Tower Defence, If that's what you're looking for and If that's not what you want then buy it anyways
575	1	a	Really fun game, well worth the money paid for.
577	1	a	I've never had this much fun killing orcs!
579	1	a	Great physics game that gets progressively harder in single player tower defense action. Weilding your crossbow, you fight a army of orcs attempting to survive them and find out what is happening. Owning this game and the second gives you classic levels in the first one as well. Recommend if you get the second orcs must die for the complete story and extra levels with friends.
581	1	a	Wow, the tower defense titles these days actually improve on what is already a fun game genre. In Orcs Must Die you control a warmage, in third person view. So instead of building traps in an isometric sort of view, you now run around setting up traps and actively killing enemies with your character. There's never a dull moment and the fact that you gain new traps after finishing a level gives incentive to keep playing. You'll want to come back for more, it's THAT fun. Other than that, the game mechanics are pretty much the same as any other tower defense game; you kill enemies, earn cash, upgrade traps, and try to prevent enemies from taking over your rifts. Only downside, in my opinion, is that it's a single-player affair. I'm sure it would've been more fun when played in co-op mode but maybe that's something for the sequel. Don't let that stop you from buying it though !  [Rating: 87/100]
583	1	a	This is the perfect game.  Demands both strategy and skill. Action packed, challenging and funny. 
585	1	a	I want a present.
587	1	a	This game is so much fun, a combination of tactics and action that combines pretty well.   8/10
589	1	a	Pretty accurate marketing.
591	1	a	Addictive.
593	1	a	I'd let those damn orcs win if they stop running straight in to arrow traps and spike traps and falling in to acid pits the damn orcs got â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing rocks for brains
595	1	a	Though there barely ain't any, the plot is quite ok and VERY FUNNY. Stuff you can use without DLC is ok, but with DLC it's just amazing. Main Char is nice.   Get it with the DLC and it will be epic awesome despite the lack of co-op or any kind of multiplayer mode.   P.S. So much fun making catapults combos.
597	1	a	A little rough around the edges but a fun little td type action game.
599	1	a	The polish on this game is uncanny. The art is fantastic, the gameplay is loads of fun, and there's excellent balance between the tower defense style play and the hack 'n slash aspect. You can't be good at just one, and you really need to use them together. Story is amusing too. Love the juvenile humor.
601	1	a	Lay traps and keep killing orcs and their allies, bit like a zombie game except more fun!!!!!
603	1	a	Good game !! but once completed its boringg D: ! Recommended
605	1	a	Boring too quick
607	1	a	awsome fun filled game made me forget my girlfriend a must buy if you want to divert your mind into funcoholic!!
609	1	a	Best TPP defence/shooter game, a must-have!
611	1	a	As much as I hate Tower Defense I just love this game! It's very simple: build traps, lure the orcs in, if some orcs miss traps and live you just need to finish the job with your weapon or magic. And as primitive as it sounds it is crazy fun. So get this game and enjoy it! And then get part 2 and enjoy it even more in coop with a friend.
613	1	a	Orcs and more need to die.  Traps traps traps, kill kill kill Good fun.
615	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is an orc racism simulation. You play as a white guy, the apprentice of another white guy, and spend literally the entire game killing orcs. That's super racist! I mean, it's not like it's sort of racist or anything like that. The name of the game is 'Orcs Must Die!' It's not 'Orcs Must Die if Convicted of a Capital Crime' or 'Orcs Must Die if it is Necessary to Employ Lethal Force in the Course of Self Defense' or 'Orcs Must Die if they are Soldiers in a Justly Fought War' or anything like that. Replace 'Orcs' with any other race in the title and you'd have a lawsuit on your hands! The only reason this game isn't banned in Germany is because nobody cares about orcs. I give this game 13 out of 16 race riots.
617	1	a	A highly addictive 3D tower defense game that simply feels right; the game is just long enough, the trap and enemy variety feel diverse without feeling bloated, and the pacing feels perfect too.
619	1	a	Without a doubt, one of the finest and most engaging games out there.
621	1	a	Its actually not bad
623	1	a	Love this game, so much fun. Just buy it already.
625	1	a	Its a must buy because:  - game is cheap - game is cool - game is fun - achievements are reasonable - can be play as casual or more hardcore
627	1	a	Incredibly stress relieving fun. Build â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, kill orcs. Cest tous. :-)
629	1	a	A great Tower Defence + FPS, must have!
631	1	a	Okay, so how come it starts off easy, then suddenly a few levels in, BLAM, I can't get through it?? All the previous levels took me one go, then I get hit by a level I cannot pass. I am NOT going to YouTube for a solution. That is dumb. That is for Candy Crush Saga. Frustrating, and I should blame myself. But I won't, I blame the developers. Anyway, if you like tower defense games, this is one. But up close in 3D.
633	1	a	Meh. Good for a while.
635	1	a	Orcs. They must die. DIE! DIE! DIE! DIE! DIE! DIE! DIE!!
637	1	a	Theese
639	1	a	Killing orcs have never been this fun!  P.S. Also you can kill kobolds, gnols, ogres and other nasties.
641	1	a	With a title like that how is one supposed to refuse? Ok it's actually rather fun. For the seasoned tower defense expert it's a rather fun 3D variation. Tower Defense for the uninitiated is at it's best a grid based puzzler. Choose how and where to defend utilising resources you earn. The more experianced you become, the more traps and defenses you can place. It's biggest failing is that there is no autofire. Constantly having to slam the mouse button to fire an arrow or whack a sword becomes a little tiring. Would I reccommend it? Yes I would on a steam sale, simply for the fun sounds and indie humour, dotted around endearing orcy goodness. A quick level now and again, is what makes a solid indie hit. Without the 'just one more go' deliciousnous of games like this, we'd forget the simple pleasure of gaming.
643	1	a	I love this game, it's a beautiful tower defense game, when i bought it, i played it till the end. 6 hours of game in a row 
645	1	a	there be goblins
647	1	a	Super fun game and all but Orcs Must Die 2 is out so just buy that unless this is mega on sale. Also buying this game will unlock some more levels in omd2. (7/10)
649	1	a	The best 'tower defense' game I ever played.

653	1	a	Great game, great times! Funny easily enjoyable game.
655	1	a	Well polished, funny and addictive. One of the better releases of 2011 that takes the tedium out of the Tower Defense genre.
657	1	a	Best 'Tower Defence' game what I have played sofar!
659	1	a	8/10 - Kill a couple of Orcs, then kill more of them and repeat the cycle. Sounds boring? Tell me how it can sounds boring, because it sounds epic.
661	1	a	awesome game for lovers of third person 
663	1	a	its dungeon defenders but it doesnt make you want to kill yourself when you play it
665	1	a	A superb 'Tower Defense' game that will have you coming back for more.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJRtNMrV-PY   Slice them, burn them, skewer them, and launch them - no matter how you get it done, orcs must die in this fantasy action-strategy game from Robot Entertainment.   As a powerful War Mage with dozens of deadly weapons, spells, and traps at your fingertips, defend twenty-four fortresses from a rampaging mob of beastly enemies, including ogres, hellbats, and of course, a whole bunch of ugly orcs. Battle your enemies through a story-based campaign across multiple difficulty levels, including brutal Nightmare mode!   Will you roast orcs in pits of lava, pound them flat with a ceiling trap, or freeze and shatter them with a slash? No matter the weapons and traps you choose, youâ€™re sure to have an orc-killing blast! - Highly Recommended! 
667	1	a	best played multiplayer though
669	1	a	Highly recommended for the fans of the genre.
671	1	a	Best tower defense / hack and slash i have ever played. Worth it's price and more.
673	1	a	I Love the game
675	1	a	Killing Orks! Not as Spacemarine this time, but still with a Warhammer, if you preordered.  The Game is comparable to Sanctum, but has a lot more levels and depth. You get an insane amount of Traps, Levels and also Perks later in Act 2. I really enjoy it.  Could have more Achievements though :p.
677	1	a	it's like skyrim with orcs
679	1	a	OMD is an entertaining, furiously addictive mixture of 3rd person shooter and tower defense, with a splendid soundtrack that perfectly compliments the frantic action. You play as the rather dense but â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ure Warmage, who must defend the magical Rifts from untold numbers of marauding orcs, using an array of traps, guardians, spells and weapons. The main game of achieving a 5-skull rating (no orcs escaping, within a par-time) on all maps is a good challenge - which further fuels your abilities at large-scale orc maiming, as skulls can then be spent to upgrade your equipment. Slaying the hordes is plenty fun enough, however therein also lies a complex combo-system adding much further depth of play, where the more traps and their afflictions hit an orc, the higher the combo-points, thus making every map replayable to experiment and chase that higher score. Crisp graphics, great voicing, music, humour and still packed with pure, fun gameplay that's as good on a pad as with a mouse. Quality arcade action that's only surpassed by it's more content heavy sequel, yet still worth playing first.
681	1	a	Battle waves after wave of Orcs in this funny fun filled highly addictive content packed Cartoony Action / Tower Defense / Strategy hybrid Indie game.
683	1	a	 This game is like Tower Defense except you get to be a part of it! A third person shooter game where you set up defenses to prevent trolls and other troll variety from getting too many to the exit. While you also shoot and stop them ontop of it! While trying not to get killed by them. Sad part is it's only Single Player, that's why I only play the second game with my friend.  9/10
685	1	a	6/10 It's a pretty dull Tower Defense game (replace Tower with Trap), but at least the opportunities grow with your inventory. Still, it's fun every now and then. But not as much fun as Plants vs. Zombies. *hint hint*
85	0	a	Spent about an hour with it. Read how good it was in the reviews but this got way too old way too fast. Bought it on a sale so it wasn't that big of a deal for a dollar. I've spent more on worse.
86	0	a	I emailed Robot Entertainment to report a bug in the game because some creatures didn't die when they landed in lava. They simply said to buy the sequel because they didn't want to release any more bug fixes. Avoid like the plague.
87	0	a	This is a great, really fun game. Do yourself a favor though and get Orcs Must Die 2. It has everything this game has (including most the maps) and a whole lot more.
88	0	a	That was a nice game but boring as hell. Sequel is much better.
89	0	a	Yet again, this is NOT a recommendation. More like a warning to steer clear and spend your money elsewhere on more worthy titles.  The game has some very nice video's that hype the game up to levels if completely fails to reach when you finally start playing the game. And while this is not appearant at first. It slowly start sinking in after about 2 - 3 levels of this non-stop ogre killing.  To be honest, it's trying to be a tower-defence game but utterly fails at it as there are worse looking titles out there that are more fun and more challenging.  The game runs on most computers, looks nice, has some funny animations at times, but utterly fails at delivering any type of gameplay that was promised. Well, to correct myself, fails to deliver any type of gameplay that is FUN and was promised.  Recommandation is to go buy warcraft 3 and play tower defence there.  Rating 9 of 100
90	0	a	repetitive and boring
91	0	a	It's like Dugeon Defenders, But not fun
92	0	a	Original, Fast Paced and Damn Addictive.  All 3 describe this game to maximum precision. It is such a fun game, hours can be eaten away form your hands playing through the extensive single player campaign. It does lack the single most important thing that would make this game more fun.   Multiplayer.  Seriously, without it, this game is bland, you want to experience the Orc mayhem with your buddies. Skip this one, go for the sequel.  WompWompWommmmmp/10
93	0	a	It looks fun doesn't it? yeah thats what I thought too. But that was before I got it.   The concept of being able to attack yourself and use towers is nice and when executed properly works well. Orcs Must Die did not execute it well. Its problem is that if you don't attack you fail and on most every map there are 2 points the orcs come from and there are not 2 of you so you kill 1 side while the other gets through then you go to push back the other side meanwhile the side you were protecting gets up and then your at the very end of the map trying to shoot 2 ways at 1 time and it doesn't work. The only tower to make your enemys stop (at least as far as I played) is not even a tower its a KILLABLE Paladin. So unless you make like 3 of those at each side they all die. Even with 3 they die. Even with lots of support from ranged towers they die. Without using them the enemys move too fast and your towers can't hit them for long enough to kill them and you die.  Another big problem is that they tryed to make too many towers. You get a tower after each level and they were probably running out of ideas and were just making stupid things. What I really don't like is that 90% of the towers have almost no difference except look or wether its on the wall or the floor or the ceiling. And alot of them just push the orcs so they are only usefull in certain levels where they can push the orcs off the level. Also the ceiling mounted ones alot are useless because the level will have too high ceilings and they won't hit anything.  It was fun for the first 8ish levels but overall I give it a 5/10. I would recommend you go buy Sanctum 2
94	0	a	Nah. It's not a terrible game, but it's clunky and awkward. Micro-managing the camera angle is half of what you'll do when playing. Go look for a better tower defense game.
95	0	a	Worst of money it just work for week &amp; its going to stop working people, this game is a mistake any mad man who buys orcs must dead is going to Acer of Yo any one who going this country Ok!!!!   :- v
96	0	a	ERROR:Failed to load 'shaders\FixedFunctionShaders.ShaderLib' Engine will not run.
97	0	a	Didn't do it for me at all. Part of the joy of tower defense is watching your little machine devour enemies. I didn't enjoy running around inside the machine in some kind of mediocre 1st-person shooter. This made the game less fun for me.
98	0	a	I'm not a huge fan of tower defense games to begin with, so meh. In this style, Dungeon Defenders was far more enjoyable.
99	0	a	Felt like this was more of a game to be played on my Smartphone then PC.  
100	0	a	I played a few hours and got bored.
101	0	a	Life is too short, Don't waste it.
102	0	a	Fun idea for a game but i'm finding it to be very glitchy. The opening cinematic freezes after about the fourth word the old man says and the third level refuses to load.
103	0	a	Definitely not one I'll play very often; but then I'm more about startegy &amp; tactics than brute force.
104	0	a	Orcs Must Die is one of my least favorite games. I think this would be a great game if it was sort of like Torchlight II. You really need a pet or an ally to help you. This game reminds me of an old game called Lemmings. It was impossible for me to prevent the Orcs from destroying everything. I never could master the gameplay. The demo was fun to play. The rest of the game was a nightmare.
105	0	a	God dammit, you can't remap the keys AT â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING ALL. Even at the sale price, I want my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing money back.
106	0	a	Unfunny; floaty and inaccurate gameplay; and forced mouse acceleration.
107	0	a	This game is all about killing orcs with traps, no big deal.
108	0	a	Poor controller support and lack of autofire made playing this game physically impossible for me.
109	0	a	Happy plus ONE.Less in an hour,think I'm not that naive.
110	0	a	Tedious garbage. I could have eaten at Arby's and been laid up with food poisoning for a week, and still have had a better time than I have with the time and money I have invested in this. I don't want a refund, I wish I had never played it.
111	0	a	â˜‘ Nice TPS Defence Trap concept â˜‘ Good price (2â‚¬) in Biedronka Store  â˜’ Only WSAD â˜’ No Tutorial â˜’ More shooter then Defence Tower â˜’ Sanctum series are much much better then this one â˜’ Very difficult
112	0	a	I hate this.
113	0	a	I like dugeon defenders better than this game
114	0	a	Bad game. Not worth any money.
115	0	a	The sequel is better in every way possible. Avoid this.
116	0	a	While OMD is a very cute game, it suffers from some fairly crippling design flaws. Firstly, most of the levels' difficulty results directly from one decision the devs made; instead of allowing choke-points or open spaces or a single path, the people who made this game decided that each level be bifurcated, but provided portals to allow us to traverse the two. Pick one, devs. Difficulty or ease. As well, barricades are among the most expensive single buildables. In this vein, it is much more economically viable to murder all the monsters yourself, as traps are A) very expensive and B) reset much too slowly. So why, for the love of Atheismo, is there only a 'cash bonus to trap kills' purchaseable!? Why can't we simply rely on weapons? Oh, right-- because the devs decided to split each level in two, so we can't simply use one route or the other. You're forced to use both the (mandatory) crossbow and (shoddy, unreliable) traps. Still, it's a fun romp, even for its faults and flaws.
117	0	a	buy number orcs must die 2 if you want to join friends
118	0	a	really fun game but i cant get past the first wave becouse  1: MY COMPUTER CANT LOAD THE PLAYED MODEL SO IM A FLOATING CROSS BOW 2: MY GAME CRASHES (sometimes even my computer) WHEN I CALL THE FIST WAVE 
119	0	a	This looked like it might be a good game. Bought it, and spent an hour in the menu trying to get it to work. Mouse won't show up no matter what I did. Tried every forum and fix I could find.  To bad. :/ 
120	0	a	Why continue to propagation of the wide misconception in our society that orcs are intrinsically evil and therefore must be slain. It is this kind of hatred propaganda that we need to have removed from our society and place out of reach of the impressionable minds of our youth.
687	1	a	Fun trap/tower defense type game Fast paced, easy controls, funny and engaging story line, without feeling too heavy. A great game to sit down and waste time playing and having fun, without having to make those long term commitments, and planning out your future needs for characters etc.
689	1	a	no funny one liner here, just a whole-hearted recommendation. buy this game. then, if you still havent had enough, buy the second one,.. but this one is better.
691	1	a	Very fun 3rd person tower defense game - plays out a lot like team fortress 2's MvM mode without the co-op. Just enough variation in the levels to keep it interesting and the option for nightmare mode with all of the unlocked upgrades boosts its replayability. Expect about 10 hours for the first run through and if you're a perfectionist, ample more after that on nightmare mode trying to obtain 5 skulls. Definitely recommended, especially since it can be founds cheap.
693	1	a	Orcs Must Die is a dating simulator based on actual events, about a guy who lives in a castle and joins a shady online dating service. He then spends the rest of his life attempting to interview these would-be green suitors to find the love of his life. Sadly, his dates often rush the gates and fall victim to the castle's insanely jealous defense system. It's up to our fair prince to use his trusty Crossbow of Love and his Sword of Choosing to place that special touch on the suitors that meet his fancy, and who aren't grieviously injured by the castle.  All in all, I found this to be a very tragic tale, as well as a cautious reminder of the horrors of online dating. It's also a really great game, even if you don't usually happen to like historical-based dating simulators.
695	1	a	Great combination of action and tower defense.
697	1	a	
699	1	a	It's a fast paced Dungeon Defenders with a little Sanctum mixed in. Reminds me of Dungeon Keepers (a really old game) where you get to make your own dungeons and set up traps. This has that same feel to it as you're essentially laying traps (some straight forward, others are interesting) and shooting/attacking the baddies before they make it to the end of the level. It's actually quite fun and I'd highly suggest to buy it even if you've already played DD and/or Sanctum a bunch. =3
701	1	a	I played this game through in fifteen hours. That's a bit short, but every hour was good fun. Definitely one of the most fun tower defense games I've tried.
703	1	a	Very fun with cheat engine. Im not a cheater. Cheat engine doesn't count
705	1	a	Fantastic game. Overwhelmingly positive critics are well deserved indeed. From all the games where killing is fun and creative, this is pretty much as good as it gets: OMD does not flatter finests instincts, but after over 2 gazillions of dead orcs, you may still find the resources to find it hilarious.
707	1	a	I wasn't sure what to think of this, but the price was right, so I bought it. Fantastic game. I bought the DLC as well, which is not like me at all. Loving the game so far.
709	1	a	Great game. Bought on steam sale so it was certainly a bargain. The keyboard can be rebound using a custom cfg - search online for directions.
711	1	a	Perfect blend of third-person action and tower defense. Plus, you get to kill thousands of Orcs. Seriously, F*ck Orcs. They are like wanna be Hulks, and are about as smart as the Jersey Shore crew.
713	1	a	Simply put, this game is huge amount of fun. It's an excellent blend of tower defense and action, with an almost comedic atmosphere. If you like hack &amp; slash and/or tower defense, I highly recommend you take a look at this game. Actually, I recommend picking up the franchise pack since both the first and second games are a blast to play.  Comparing this game with its sequel, I liked the levels better in general in this first game, but the second just has a lot more stuff including a second playable character with different traps and abilities, more monster types, and best of all, coop. So do yourself a favor and just get the franchise pack.
715	1	a	Very fun and challenging. A great choice if you enjoy strategy and tower defense.
717	1	a	Nice one.
719	1	a	Unique game. Totally worth the money and will suck you in.
721	1	a	Awesome tower defense style game - blast to play on the ground
723	1	a	Gameplay : easy Atmosphere : good A wonderful tower defense game
725	1	a	This is an immensely fun game that successfully blends frantic action with the need to pay attention to your environment and to plan ahead. It'sgood for hours of fun - pick it up as soon as you can!
727	1	a	The orcs must die, painfuly and at my pleasure.
729	1	a	The game is hilariously fun. Wanton destruction in the most tasteful way, a veg game without being a veg game.
731	1	a	If you have the money buy the game its amazing. Lots of games time trying to get a 5  skull rating on evrey level. If not at least try the demo for it.
733	1	a	You grin with malignant satisfaction as you watch the Horde of Orcs slog through tar, pelted by arrows, dying in scores, whilst their numbers are also gradually being decimated by wall mounted blades, crushed by crushers, knowing that, should one of the kobolds manage to survive this, the lava awaits.  (cue maniacal laughter)  MUHUHAHAHA...!
735	1	a	Great fun and a nice combination of strategicly planing your defense and bashing away orcs in direct combat.
737	1	a	Slice, dice, crush, smash, fling, shatter, stab and shoot all the orcs you can. How much better can it get?
739	1	a	Great! Pretty tempted to buy the second one too.
741	1	a	The only critism is the lack of some sort of multiplayer/Co-op. This game is awesome!!!!!!
743	1	a	Very fun and underrated game.
745	1	a	Try it In MasterMode thats a GAME! of slash slash and BOOM! HEADSHOT! really worht it!
747	1	a	One of the funnest Tower Defense games to be had outside of WC3 / SC2 mods.
749	1	a	This game is REALLY fun.
751	1	a	Great Game, the people who made Shadow of Mordor make they're own version!
753	1	a	This is probably my favorite iteration of tower defense, save for the sequel, because it takes what's too often a genre where it's an impersonal enemy grinder and forces you to be an active participant at all times. Combining traps is crazy fun when you get it right, and the game itself is irreverent in just the right doses to not be too winky or tiresome. Very solid, though the main campaign is almost a bit too long and difficult, and this game is hampered a little bit by the fact that the sequel surpasses it in a lot of ways, so if you're not looking to dive in too deep, just grab the sequel.
755	1	a	An entertaining and comedy-oriented trap dungeon defense game.  It took me a bit to get used to the trap difference vs the usual tower defense games I play - but it pans out well in a very entertaining, challenging and rewarding way. The traps set up have a limited area of effect and react on a reset timer for most of them, so its a mixture of combinations of traps and your own wits with weapons and the enviroment to pull it off well.  It proves to be a good game that is well worth its value.
757	1	a	Another hidden gem on Steam, bought for less than Â£3 it is terrific value for money. An interesting twist on the tower defence games (a firm favourite of mine) it sees you stopping orcs using an elabarate range of traps and defences. A great buy at a great price.
759	1	a	This is a good game to kill time with. Classic tower defense type of game.
761	1	a	The voice actor of the War Mage Apprentice (the player) in this game is Robert McCollum! He voice-acted Wataru Akiyama from the anime Initial D!  Oh My gosh this game is cool, one of the best tower defence games I've ever played, or even enjoyed for that matter.
763	1	a	Orcs Must Die's formula is simple, but what little it does it does very, very well and is a riot to play. The traps are a ton of fun to use and trap deaths look fantastic and satisfying. The later additions of simplistic spell trees and spells round the game up nicely and killing orcs was never this much fun xD. If you get into the competitive nature of the game you'll find out how surprisingly deep it is as customizing your character and traps and selecting the 'right' ones can greatly impact your final stage score and the speed at which you move and place your traps can mean all the difference.  8.5/10
765	1	a	Does what it says on the tin.
767	1	a	Fun game to play in between the deeper games. I would NOT pay $15 for it. Pick it up if it is on sale.
769	1	a	Even once you beat the game, it's loads of fun to play!
771	1	a	A lot of games try to blend tower defense and action-based gameplay. This is one of the few titles that actually pulls it off, with a quirky sense of humor to boot.  On the other hand, the game is rather short, and could use moddability and/or custom levels. Replayability is, accordingly, rather limited.
773	1	a	amazingly fun. very hard to put down
775	1	a	Pretty fun game. It's a tower defense game, but it's also a 3rd person action game. I do not like regular tower defense games, as they are all about setting up a defense and then waiting for the wave to end. In this one, you get to pick various weapons to fight off the enemies, while setting traps and defenses. Definitely give this game a try, and buy it if it goes on sale again!
777	1	a	Hello, Gamers.  Look at your Steam Library, now back to mine, now back at your Library, now back to mine. Sadly, yours isn't mine.  Why? Because if you stopped for a moment with all of your other games, you could be bisecting, stabbing, flaming and otherwise giving hordes of Orcs a very bad day, all while having an absolute blast of a time.  Okay, I'm horrible at copying Old Spice commercials... Orcs Must Die! is a game that describes itself right in its title, there's you, there's the Orcs, the latter must die. The fun is in how you have them die. The game is blindingly simple, the 'plot' is idiotically brilliant, and it's fun all around.  Kind of like Warhammer Fantasy.
779	1	a	Good stuff, well worth the money and a lot of fun. A new spin on tower defense.
781	1	a	I haven't played many tower defense games (TF2 playing as engineer counts, right?), but this is the only one I've played that I've actually enjoyed. Tower defense from third person action-game perspective. Good times
783	1	a	A neat game that I would recommend picking up on sale if you're looking at it. The overall quality is surprisingly polished and the game is challenging, particularly in Nightmare mode. Takes ~12 hours to complete in Normal mode and ~24 hours to complete in Nightmare mode.
785	1	a	With Orcs Must Die!, the game starts off slow and seems to get quicker and more faster paced as you gain experience and get access to more abilities. Graphics are nice in this game as well. It Does seem to get a bit tedious after a long while and the pace at which the orcs spawn and rush in increases.   If you do not have a lot of time to be able to play because of work, schooling or family schedules but would like to spend 15 min, 30 min or an hour just relaxing, I would recommend this game.   So overall this game is enjoyable, especially if you dont always have tons of time on your hands.
787	1	a	Hours of fun, recommend especially if you enjoy tower defense games.
789	1	a	Its a Nice TD With a twist. ITS SO FUNNY XD and mass killing is fun fun fun 
791	1	a	Very fun game, simple but great visuals. Tower defence-ish but with an 'in the field' style gameplay makes the challenge in running around to different areas of the map on foot to lay down traps as well as taking on the fight yourself with the orc horde. Very addicting with short levels that just keep comming one after another. Traps are varied as are the enemy types, fun to be had by all.
793	1	a	Fantasic mix of tower defense and shooter.  Great humor and wonderful story. A must for strategy fans looks for something new.  Highly recommended.
795	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is a hell'o'va game. Its fun and frustrating, easy and challenging, you kick its â™¥â™¥â™¥ or it will kick your â™¥â™¥â™¥.   I totally recommend this game.
797	1	a	Brilliant game - really addictive!!! :)
799	1	a	Hilarious as hell, yet very challenging and rewarding, a must have if you like orcs chopped up!
801	1	a	Very addictive I love it !
803	1	a	It's a kind of game that you want to play it more and more! I also liked it because there is ranking system so I always try to win my friends. The best tower defense I've ever played...
805	1	a	I originally only got this for the Steam winter holiday achievement, but this game is one of the most original and clever I've seen in a while. It's pretty simple, but sometimes, that's just fine.
807	1	a	Great game, fun if you want to waste some time or blow some steam. Not serious at all, and tons of fun.
809	1	a	Quite fun game, but rather short. Beat the Normal difficult within 10 hours or so. Even then, the hardest difficulty proves very challenging and I can see beating it taking a lot longer. I'd give it a 85/100 or so, but if it's on sale, grab it for sure.
811	1	a	Are you a racist scumbag who believes orcs must die? If so, then buy Orcs Must Die!
813	1	a	Strangely addictive - and it's funny!
815	1	a	Surprisingly fun cross between Tower Defense style gameplay, Dungeon Keeper, and a first person shooter like Serious Sam.
817	1	a	First-person tower defense, similar to Sanctum, but less serious and more fun.
819	1	a	OH MY GOD. I didn't think that I was gonna enjoy this game as I'm enjoying it! I've seen a trailer once, and I thought it was an okay game. Now, I think this game is AMAZING! There are some cons to, but I think it's worth it! Any chance for a second one?
821	1	a	Better than tower wars!
823	1	a	
825	1	a	A rather fun and fast-paced 'trap defense' game. It can feel a bit repetitive over time, though.
827	1	a	A very entertaining tower defense game with a lot of action and a little bit of humor.
829	1	a	With a sequel on its way, giving the first a play is a must, tower defense, with a first person twist, presented with PERFECTION, bloody good game =D
831	1	a	It's a fun game, lots of ways to kill things!
833	1	a	This game is really fun! You start of with a funny intro comic thing giving you the story, and from then on it's orc slaying action! You unlock more traps with every level you beat resulting in more fun ways to kill the orcs! This game is a must have! 10/10
835	1	a	Recommended, a nice twist on the tower defence genre
837	1	a	pretty sweet game...to bad u missed out on the 75%off sale!
839	1	a	Great game - marries tower defence and third person shooter mechanics in a nice, polished package.   Recommended!
841	1	a	If you like tower defeance games its for you protect you portal from the ugly cretures!
843	1	a	You may think this game looks boring and is pretty one sided but the moment I saw the trailer this definately looked fun. And then I won the game and later bought the DLC on a sale.  This game is hilarious. I'm loving it. You pretty much have to fight against waves and waves of orcs but you get all these brilliant contraptions such as flip tiles, wall arrows, your own archers, floor spikes, explosive barrels so you can build up your defences and hold off against the enemy waves. It gets really challenging when you have a few entry points but if you think well and have a good defence structure, it's a breeze. Endless action, a very funny protagonist and visuals that make you feel like your in a cartoon, it's awesome. 9/10!
845	1	a	AWESOME. there really isn't another word for it. crazy addictive, fun, rewarding with a little bit of carnage thrown in. if you like the 'tower defense' type of games you're going to love this game. On top of that its crazy cheap for what you get. I highly reccomend it to everyone
847	1	a	Fun TD Game with orc's!
849	1	a	A fun game with a variety of interesting ways to make those orcs die.
851	1	a	One of the most addictive Tower Defense games out there! Packed with action, with a variety of traps, spells and weapons to dispose of the Orcish hordes. The game leaves it's tools in our hands and the result is immensely rewarding!
853	1	a	Quasi-Tower Defense meets Hack 'n' Slash in such a way thats incredibly fun. If you enjoy either genre to ANY degree, you're missing out if you don't get this game. It is amazing.
855	1	a	pretty fun little game, wish it was multiplayer
857	1	a	The nearly simultaneous release of this game and Dungeon Defenders has led to inevitable comparisons between the two games, and rightly so. Both games are Tower Defense games played on a personal level rather than a top down perspective. Both have the player control a character that can run the course of maps, place a number of defenses and traps, use different abilities and go toe to toe with the advancing mobs with melee and ranged weapons. The difference comes in the approach. Dungeon Defenders distributes the different abilities among different classes making the game virtually unplayable in single player especially if youâ€™re playing a support class. Orcs Must Die has no multiplayer but gives all the abilities to one character with new abilities with each successful mission. Orcs Must Die also feels much more action oriented. If youâ€™re looking for a good tower defense game that you can play by yourself, look no further than this game!
859	1	a	Welcome to customs, please follow the sparking lines here and here, they'll lead you to your death... filthy immigrants. Yet the game raises actual questions of modern society... it's still fun.
861	1	a	Everyone should check this out. Really great gameplay, really addicting and a lot of fun.
863	1	a	Really nice Tower Defense Game, that let's you take a very active fighting role, if you want! Don't make the mistake of thinking: 'meh, another TD game'!
865	1	a	I have to recommend this just based on the hilarious dance animations the main character does after clearing a stage. Great tower defense game.
867	1	a	I'm loving all these games that take the defense genre and make it a bit more interesting. So much so that I can't even call the category 'tower defense' any more.  Orcs Mus Die is a third-person shooter defense game. You lay traps for the orcs, then once they start coming, you use your sword and crossbow to kill the ones that get past the traps. Solid conttrols, good gameplay, quirky humor and an interesting spin on the genre.
869	1	a	A cross between a third-person shooter/Tower Defense game, it also features amusing dialogue and a lot of room for creativity. This game is a ludicrous amount of fun. Buy it, right now. No, seriously, buy it right â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing now.
871	1	a	Hilarious! A must buy for anyone who likes Bruce Campbell films or Duke Nukem!  The extra missions that you can buy are also good but lack the hilarious storyline and the new traps you get seem a bit too powerful.  The follow up game Orcs Must Die 2 is terrible! Don't waste any money on it.
873	1	a	Good game. Worth the 5$ I spent at the time. It'll get frustrating, though. Buy it for the lolz.
875	1	a	awesome fun cant wait for multiplayer on orcs must die 2
877	1	a	This game is fun! The combat is clunky, but very nice and meaty. The variety in enemies, traps and weaponry is also quite impressive. Also, it's a pretty good challenge. It is kinda repetitive, though, and the campaign will only really take you about 12-15 hours. For what you get, though, it's definitely worth the $10/Â£7.
879	1	a	A TD game with a FPS Element, slick controlls, fun houmor and great gameplay. Everything you want in a good TD/FPS combo.
881	1	a	Fantastic blend of action and Tower Defense. Best one I've seem in this genre yet. Can last very long if the player is at least a little bit perfectionist. Also, this game gets bonus points from me for not taking itself too seriously. It even comes packed with cheesy hurmor and a lovable goofy protagonist.
883	1	a	If you want to fight hordes of Orcs and can't afford Warhammer 40k then this is your game! this game is fun with an awsome soundtrack that causes cavities of the brain.
885	1	a	Most awesome tower defense game ever. There is a tough difficulty curve, but I've never felt cheated or forced into buying the DLC. In fact, I've beaten all the levels (even on Nightmare) without it. There is tons of replay value with this game due to the sheer number of weapons and traps and maps available.   I love this game from the humor to the artwork to the gameplay.  The only thing I felt it was lacking was co-op, something that the second game brings in.
887	1	a	A simple action game about fighting hordes and lasting in a contention zone (a la Delta 8 Nova Prospekt in Half Life 2), with the twist of putting a lot of crazy defenses. A game for only fun and laughs, but that usually enough for a great time.
889	1	a	Very easy to get into. EXTREAMLY FUN! As casual games go there few that can offer you this much fun. Killing the hordes of orcs and vile creatures that storm your castles never gets old. The maps gets very interesting as you move truought the campaign and your unlocked traps and upgrades are persistent so you can use them all the time anywhere.  ORCS MUST DIE  MUST BUY!
891	1	a	I got this on a whim a few weeks back. It's one of the best tower defense games that I have ever played, hands down. Great voice acting. Humorous story. Tight controls. Excellent gameplay. A worthy addition to any steam library.
893	1	a	Hilariously fun.
895	1	a	Orc stomping fun!
897	1	a	Great fun game! If you enjoy Tower Defence games, then you will like this!
899	1	a	This game was the reason I came back to steam after four years of not using it. It's an absolute blast! It's a mix of Tower Defense and First Person Shooter with some good comedy thrown in. It's a must-play for any Tower Defense fans.
901	1	a	Orcs Must Die: a Haiku  I shoot the orc dead.  I burn, crush, smash, throw, and stab.  I know: Orcs must die!     10/10 Would load up to shoot orcs again....stupid orcs.
903	1	a	This game is great!!!
905	1	a	co-op 1st person tower defense with a sense of humor, very well executed, does all it says on the tin, a great game
907	1	a	A unique twist in the tower defense genre, charming character design and personality, amazing gameplay and it's just too damn fun to play. Buy this now
909	1	a	You dont always find a mix gendered tower defense so well done.
911	1	a	Possibly one of the greatest tower defence games i have ever played.
913	1	a	Does not suck, much fun had by myself and others.
915	1	a	No orcs were hurt in the making of this game - oh, wait...
917	1	a	Kill orcs.
919	1	a	'I really like the game, but I couldnâ€™t find the stupid cake.' a lot of fun with these game
921	1	a	Incredibly fun! It's plants vs. zombies on overdrive! Set your traps and watch the fun!
923	1	a	I have never been the biggest fan of Tower Defense games. But after playing a good 7 hours of Orcs Must Die over the last 2 days, I can honestly say that this title gets a spot on my favorites list. Robot Entertainment has produced a challengeing, trhrilling, laugh out loud chaotic little gem. Nothing quite equals the satisfying feeling of frantically rushing around, strategically lining the corridors of a fortress with implements of death, and then watching your assailants fall in droves under hails of arrows, floor spikes, wall blades, and brimstone tiles. The 3rd person over the shoulder camera puts you smack in the middle of the chaos, immediatley lending the game a sense of urgency you don't feel in other TDG's simply because your character's life is in peril because your character is THERE. Humor, depth, and white knuckled pacing set the tone for a well made, fun game that is worth picking up. (Especially at such a low price.)
925	1	a	It was fun killing endless waves of orcs thats all there is to say. 
927	1	a	Follow my curation :  http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9273374-exorio   Awesome single-player 'tower defense' (change 'tower' to 'trap'), very polished, balanced, real pure fun and very charming characters.
929	1	a	Charming.  8/10, would get thrust awkwardly into a position of overwhelming responsibility again.
931	1	a	A Tower Defense pretty fun recommanded if you like that style of game !
933	1	a	A simple game with loads of fun and a whacky style. The title says it all ;-)
935	1	a	I absolutely love this game! It clearly did not have a huge budget. There are no super expensive intros and the graphics are rather simple (but effective and not bad in any way). But it is the concept that is so much fun. Building traps for the Orcs to run into and get killed in the most hillarious of ways is incredibly satisfying. The dialogue and voice acting are well done. The music fits the theme (but is a bit repetitive). The animation is great. The story is funny. The hero is likeable. My only critique would be that it is a bit short if you paid the full price. It feels like the game only just started when it is already over. You really want to make use of the last few types of traps more often before the game ends. And I never really got to ues the Weavers that much either (there never really is that much money). I wished there had been more levels to explore this upgrade mechanic and the last few traps a bit more.  Because of its shortness, best wait until it is on sale.  8 out of 10
937	1	a	Before I had my own steam account, I played this game all the time on my brother's account. I loved playing this game, endless upon endless hordes of orcs slaughtered at the hands of an 8 year old.
939	1	a	Frantic, hectic fun. Nothing is more fun than watching you trap layout eat up orcs like a well oiled machine. Oiled with Blood.
941	1	a	8/10  A great tower defence game, with the addition of an FPS side it makes for a great game.  Making traps for orcs is great, the difficulty isnt overly hard, theres a wide range of weapons, levels and traps to keep the game interesting.  Worth a pickup.
943	1	a	I'm a little surprised about liking this game. Usually I'm not big on action type games, but I found myself enjoying the mix of action and strategy. Placing the traps correctly is a major part of the game, but wading into a bunch of orcs breaking thru your defenses is the icing on the cake.  I'm not far into the game yet and have found the dificulty to be hit or misss on the levels. Some seem really hard, but the next level is very easy. I can see myself finishing the game as long as the last few levels don't go over the top in difficulty.  Overall a game worth playing, especially if you catch it on sale.
945	1	a	Awsome game, puts dungeon defenders to shame even without the multiplayer.
947	1	a	really a lot of fun if you like tower defence/shooter/'strategy' games
949	1	a	very fun and very addicting if you love tower defense games and first person advencture/action games this is the game for you as it takes both those genres and blends it into awesome
951	1	a	Castle defense for the sole sake of Orc bashing fun. It's entertaining.
953	1	a	Good fun... easy to understand and many hours of enjoyment
955	1	a	Good combination of tower defence, strategy and action. The levels are great and doesn't get me bored. I also recommend playing Orcs must die 2!.
957	1	a	before I was a lad i killed the orkish folk.
959	1	a	i hate tower defence games, but this game is amazing.  this is the best tower defence game ever made, hands down.  the goal is simple, keep enemies from getting from point a to point b. you use elements to help you do such, like place and remove all sorts of different traps that do all sorts of different things. use all sorts of different weapons and spells/magic.  if you have never played or seen this game before, buy it. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!  i have over 1000+ games that i own and play...not to mention games ive owned in the past on consoles. this is by far in my top 3 favorites, maybe even number 1.  so even if you are like me, and hate tower defence games, give this a try.
961	1	a	So first off, got this game during a Steam Sale for cheap, didn't think I would like it. Boy was I wrong! Finished the first game in a good amount of time, got addicted, bought the second one NOT on sale, finished that one too. Excellent game mechanics, gameplay is smooth on my rig, and I really enjoyed the humour and storyline. All in all 10/10
963	1	a	Awesome tower defence game. lots of fun and very original.
965	1	a	Pretty fun tower defence with comical story.
967	1	a	This is honestly one of the funnest games i have EVER played. A smart man with $15.00 would buy it. Good story, GREAT gameplay. Awesome visuals. This game is a 10/10 in my book. Will be buying any sequals.
969	1	a	I'm a big Bloon Tower Defense player, so I thought that I had the end all of tower defense games on my iphone already. Oh how wrong I was. This is a great tower defense game, with a nice bit of hack-and-slash thrown in. I'm about halfway through the first act ( I think) and while some towers I have now seem to serve no purpose, and although I keep picking them when I first get them (eg steam trap without a combo for it) I'm sure later in the game they'll have a great combo (certain trap seem to be designed to be put together).  The only thing I wish is that I could choose from any trap/weapon whenever I want, instead of picking and choosing a certain amount at the start of a round. It's just something I'm used to from playing Bloons, but I've gotten over it already. Thats part of the challenge.  I'd give this a 8/10
971	1	a	Awesome mix between Tower Defense games and action/RPG game (not that RPG-ish though)
973	1	a	This game is so dam fun it really challanges you too think outside the box and can be a little crazy with weapons
975	1	a	Great game. Addictive tower defense style-game with a decent amount of variation between weapons, towers, maps, and mobs. Recommend for any tower defense lover.
977	1	a	Put down some traps and rip thousands of orcs apart in this awesome game. Not exactly tower defence, but its something similar.
979	1	a	It is a good game, but you should skip it and go to #2.
981	1	a	Woo! I love tower defense!
983	1	a	Finally, a high budget TD! And it kicks a$$!
985	1	a	Really love the mix of tower defense and action :) And the humor makes it pretty funny. If you have seen the trailer of the game and you are hyped, then i most definatly recommend this game :D
987	1	a	Incredibly fun, but takes a little while to get into. At first it seems like you just plow away with your crossbow, but it quickly becomes about strategy. Very entertaining graphics and physics. Gameplay is very fun, and yet still challenging. I highly recommend this game if you're into Tower Defense games.  Other games like this are Sanctum (1 and 2) and Dungeon Defenders. All of these are great games, and the FPS/TPS slash Tower Defense genre really needs more games.
989	1	a	A new twist on tower defense games and I feel like it's the best out there. Great diffculity
991	1	a	Orcs Must Die is a critically acclaimed mix between acion adventure and tower defense. The game has some beautiful artwork, a vast amount of weapons and traps, and most importantly a band of lovable over the top characters. Although it is a large amount of fun to play I will say that not once on my playthrough did I think 'Wow I've never seen anything like this before' and that ends up being a fatal flaw of the game, however that does not make it a bad game. If you're in the mood for a lovable and charismatic adventure similar in spirit to a game like Borderlands then look no further. I would give Orcs Must Die a solid 7/10
993	1	a	It's an enjoyable tower defense game with a good amount of humor. Gameplay is intuitive and fun with unique abilities allowing for creative 'deaths.'
995	1	a	Great game. Killing the orcs, ogres and the other momsters is fun using the variety of weapons, spells and traps. yeye! I have such good high scores too yeye!!!
997	1	a	Pros: +music +dialoge +so much orcs to kill +lot of traps, multiple ways to beat same levels +3 build paths in lategame +storyline &amp; main character Cons: -short (took 7 hours to complete and I think it's not the fastest time out there) -some levels were too easy to complete when other were somewhat challenging (last 3 maybe)
999	1	a	Very refreshing combo of Tower Defense, Hack and Slash and a tiny bit of RPG. The style's also very cool. Orc-hating cartoonish stuff. Looks great
1001	1	a	An excellent game, it combines tower defense with action...Thumbs up!!!
1003	1	a	Single-player FPS Tower Defense Game. Pick it up when on sale. Easy fun!
1005	1	a	Great twist on tower defense! Funny too!
1007	1	a	good if you want a timekiller
1009	1	a	awesome tower defence based game.
1011	1	a	For me this is the best first person / tower defense hybrid there is. Beats Sanctum IMO. Set the Standard.
1013	1	a	Orcs must Die! is a third person action Tower defense game and probably the best when its about the gameplay. You play as a War Mage who needs to defend Gates from ugly Orcs. To do this task you can use Traps and Weapons as well as some envoirmental stuff.   The Gameplay is pretty straight forward. The first Wave and every 5 Waves you have unlimited Time to decide what to Build. Between each other wave you have a time limit until the next wave starts. You can purchase Traps with money. You get money for killing Orcs and you get even more money if you kill Orcs with more than one Trap. The trick is to get as many traps on one place as possible. You need of course something to fight for yourself. For that you can use a magical crossbow that can shoot bolts very fast or a Sword. You can also use magical items to shoot fire or ice and with the DLC you get some interesting items like a pot full of acid which you can throw on the orcs to kill loads of orcs with one attack. All items have a secondary attack that uses mana (In case of the Acid pot it always costs mana to balance it). You can refill your mana at the Gate that you need to defend. Or you can use a magical contraption that refills your mana if you stand next to it. Later in the game you get the wavers, which sell upgrades if you have a spare coin for them.   The grafics are nothing special but the artstyle is great. I always considered that the artstyle is more important than the grafics of a game and Orcs Must Die! is the best example for that. The medival comic look fits nicely with the theme of the game.  The Soundtrack is pretty good. It is mostly medival rock music and fits perfect to the artstyle and the Gameplay.    If you like or dont like this review than please tell me why. If there are grammar problems in the text please let me know.
1015	1	a	Definitely one of the coolest tower defense-like games. It didn't take long before the levels started getting a little more difficult (in terms of trying to achieve all 5 skulls per level). There's also a Nightmare mode that is even more difficult.
1017	1	a	If you win, you feel good having beaten up derpy orcs. If you lose, you feel good watching the over confident main character die. You can't lose unless you don't buy.
1019	1	a	A great game if you have a cheap laptop, trying to perfect it is addicting.
1021	1	a	Started playing because I got this as a gift from my friend. CAN'T STAHP PLAING. I THINK I HAVE ORC-BOLA PLES SOMEONE HELP ME! (This game is amazing, in a shortened version of those last couple of sentences. lol, good game, guys!)
1023	1	a	A frighteningly addictive game with a real sense of humour, the DLC is a sharp learning curve but the whole game is masses of fun
1025	1	a	Picked this up at 75% off for the steam achievement for the holidays, but quickly ended up spending an hour in it. And then another... and another. The game is just really clean and does what it sets out to do really well. This puts a ton of creativity back into the bland 'tower defense' style genre and plays to different strengths. If you're confident with a crossbow or a sword, you can dump money and items into improving that. If your trap strategy is top notch, dump all your money into a maze of tricks and traps designed to do only one thing; Kill. All. The Orcs.  Would have paid full price if I knew what I was getting into. It's got great gameplay, a smooth engine, just the right dash of humor and a lot of things to kill in a bunch of different ways. And if you ever find yourself with nothing to do, scratch your chin at the leaderboards and fine tune your strategy to not only survive the orcs - but kill them efficiently and brutally.
1027	1	a	Great fun for a few bucks, Probably shortlived but who cares for 10 euro? 1001 ways to kill a orc, you can probably find more :D
1029	1	a	Bought for achievement in Orcs Must Die! 2, but now i think its much better for single player. It is a shame there is no co-op version for this game, but i still reccomend it!
1031	1	a	The fact that, with all the games I could be playing at this point, I've been going back to this one repeatedly to finish a new level, says a decent amount about it alone. I love classic Tower Defense style games, which this most resembles, and it does those parts well. Even if it was just setting the traps and watching the Orcs gib, that would probably be enough, but the FPS aspects (with which you can win without setting a trap at all on some levels) and are also well done and fun to use or (as I tend to do) supplement your traps by stunning orcs in range.
1033	1	a	Very fun and well made tower defense!
1035	1	a	You know, the condom is the glass slipper of our generation. You slip it on when you meet a stranger. You dance all night, then you throw it away. The condom, I mean. Not the stranger.
1037	1	a	
1039	1	a	Great gameplay, a lot of humour and very interesting concept of a game.
1041	1	a	There are sooo many ways you can complete the levels, I'm almost done finishing the game on hardest difficulty. Its lots of fun and i recommend it to everyone who likes a challenge but doesn't want days and days of content before finishing the game.
1043	1	a	AWESOME game but it's a little short finished it on 5 hour's ;D 
1045	1	a	I did the happy dance when i first played this game. Do you wanna do the happy dance?
1047	1	a	If you're a tower defence/wave defence fan and enjoy ridiculous humour then I couldn't recommend this more. Sequel coming out soon - worth grabbing this before it does!
1049	1	a	A whole lot of manic fun, you wont mind how repetative it actually is under its shiny cell-shaded surface and you will have completed it several times long before you ever wanna stop playing it.  One of those games that Does Exactly What It Says on the Tin  Orcs Must Die!  4/5 (mash em, boil em, stick em in a stew.)
1051	1	a	Challanging game! but a really nice tower defense!!! RECOMMENDE!!!
1053	1	a	Fun game. can't say much for replay value as I didn't try to play it again ever. still worth one play through.
1055	1	a	Tower defense game that's just straight up FUN.
1057	1	a	I got a recommendation for this game, I RECOMMEND that you just forget it exists because it's the worst pile of doo doo butter that has ever stained itself upon the steam library. Every time I think of this game I want to vomit until I die. Final Score: 8/10
1059	1	a	Grandslam Homerun for me. Tower Defense concept, humor, graphics, music, and sound are all top notch. I buy and try a lot of games -- this and Defense Grid 2 are far and away the best. Not even close. Other games are just dull right now.
1061	1	a	I love this and the sequel. I love building, placing and managing the traps and seeing the mayhem happen and knowing where to assist the traps just constantly improving my 'dungeon'.
1063	1	a	That's just too much fun for 4 bucks.
1065	1	a	If you love trap games + tower defense, or just miss the old 'Dungeon Keeper' franchise, this is one game you should not miss playing! 'Hands-on' Dungeon Keeper!
1067	1	a	Only bought this due to being cheap... would have paid full price. Super addicting
1069	1	a	Good game, gotta kill those orcs!
1071	1	a	So much fun playing it. recommend game to play
1073	1	a	For The Following People Who Is Not A Tower Deffence Game Fan Then Don't Bother Being Negative Because People Like Me Are Fans Of Tower Deffence Games And It Mkaes Me Mad When People Thinks Its â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ But Clearly They Are Not TD Fans So Grow Up And Move On  I Understand Its Your Opinion Everyone Is Aloud An Opinion But Your Only Saying Your Reasons From Your Perspective
1075	1	a	Love the game. Keep up the good work :)
1077	1	a	One of the best games in 2011, I recommend!
1079	1	a	The first 3 levels were boring as hell, and should have been a 'tutorial'. After that it got much better.  It's ultimately a Tower Defense game, but the 3rd Person Shooter perspective makes it more fun. Being able to fight manually gives something extra to do between placing traps, and gives you a nice perspective to watch all the orcs die.
1081	1	a	First off: Play this, even if its just the demo; don't be fooled by how easy the demo is --this game gets fairly difficult pretty quickly. And when you finish the story mode, you unlock Nightmare Mode, which involves hard versions of every level with more, tougher enemies, next-to-no downtime between waves, and no breather 'Unleash the Horde!' events. Great art, fantastic gameplay, witty dialogue. Completely worth its low price point.
1083	1	a	one comment were mentioning that game as  'hidden gem'  ought to buy now 'hidden gem 2' 
1085	1	a	It is a relly fun game ^-^
1087	1	a	Great Game!!
1089	1	a	I bought the franchise pack and debated starting with the 2nd game or the first. I decided to start with the 1st one. I love it, I found my self thinking about different strategies at work even :) I like to use different strategies all the time, so I never just stick to one. It is easy to beat this game using only 1 type of strategy but the fun lies in tinkering about.  Stability: 8/10 - can hang for extended periods of time during loading screens Art: 9/10 - Suits the atmosphere of the game and is consistent through out Sound: 8/10 - Fits the mood the game tries to portray. Fire crossbow sound get's messed up if you strafe shoot. Gameplay: 9.5/10 - fluid and responsive, a joy to play. One downside is that orc attacks will hit you even if you are out side their attack animation. Story: 4/10 - interesting potential but is very sparse and lacks any detail Replayability: 9/10 - I love going back to get higher combo's and 5 skulls  If, like me, you bought both games, start with the first 1, it's extremely fun and the story does carry over to the 2nd game
1091	1	a	This is a great game and I am really enjoying playing it. It's basically a FPS &amp; Tower Defense game. Your job is to prevent the orcs from reaching the rift. If too many do, you lose the level.  The orcs come at you in 'waves' and you have different ways of defending yourself. From traps to extra support (guardians). The key to success in the game is choosing the right traps in the level as well as placing them strategically.   
1093	1	a	sauron hates this game
1095	1	a	I got this on sale for less than the price of a piece of cheese at the local convenience store.  Pros: For a game released in 2011 the graphics are still holding up strong Solid Third Person Shooter/Tower Defense game with a challenge that doesn't feel intimidating. Simple, fun, seemingly arcade style gameplay. Music is basic, appropriate, and not annoying. Better than cheese, and I really like cheese.  Cons: I waited to long to find out that Orcs Must Die! I still want a piece of cheese.
1097	1	a	A Very addictive game from where I have played it. The controls are simple and the maps are different and fun. A must-have
1099	1	a	this is a great tower defense game. good music, maps are quite challenging, many weapon (I missed the gunbow when moved to Orcs must die 2), traps ....and interesting winning pose.
1101	1	a	-Addicting Gameplay  -Nice Creature -I Like Cartoonize graphics Video games -Its Extended Verison of PvZ garden warfare maybe ;)
1103	1	a	Killing orcs is so much fahn.
1105	1	a	
1107	1	a	This game is a fun tower defense game, because not only you build things to defend but you can control and customize your character on how you defend the stage, the stages are challenging and different in variety. I like the cartoonish graphics and the very comedic vibe that it has. For over all verdict I'd say that this game is fun and challenging, and I would like to recommend it to everyone.
1109	1	a	After playing some OMD Unchained I decided to replay the first one and it's still as good as I remember. Sure, the second one has more stuff, a more interesting upgrade system, 2 player co-op and is overall the better game but the first one is still fun.  It has a better feel to kill orcs than Unchained and the progression pacing is more fluid. Maybe not worth the 10 bucks anymore as OMD2 is out for years but owning OMD1 gets you 10 extra levels in OMD2 so alone for this it's worth at least the sale price.
1111	1	a	Pretty nice game if you have little time. :)
1113	1	a	It has great replayability You have to constantly re-think best strategy to pass the level and to maximize the number of skulls It has several improvements on magic, devices as you level up Story is fun and is refreshing to hear the funny comments with those voices. It doesnt stuck me to the computer hour after hour,because passing each level is so rewarding that  I can play one level and have all the fun that I need for a long time in which I can work , talk with my family and other everyday thing  It a simply superb game , dont count the hours you can waste on it but all the satisfaction you will have with it
1115	1	a	Best TD there is.
1117	1	a	Hands down the most fun I've ever had playing a tower defense game. Got this on sale for $0.99 and it is definitely worth every penny!
1119	1	a	At first glance of hearing a third person tower defense threw me of, made it think it wasnt worth my time, as soon as i bought due to the sale i know its worth the full price itself. the total destruction of orcs is amazing.
1121	1	a	I normally hate tower defense games but this one is amazing!
1123	1	a	very fun if you are fun of games like ballon tower defence and all that 
1125	1	a	love this game TD &amp; TPS Shooter= Exelent game Bravo
1127	1	a	I think this game is not only strategy but also need a speed to click your mouse to defeat the ORCS
1129	1	a	Very cool and good planned TD action/game
1131	1	a	Many Orcs died making this game.
1133	1	a	actually amazing, I thought it might be basic garbage but the story is nice, the main character is fun, it feels really good to watch him get down when you get a perfect score, it is actually very well made and thought out and I loved it, some of the traps were stupid useless but all of them were pretty dam cool
1135	1	a	Lot's of fun. I enjoy it a lot.
1137	1	a	Just bought this game on sale for $3.74, and it was worth it. I've only played 10 minutes to get a christmas achievement, and I want to play more. Headshots are so easy, and killing orcs is pretty fun!
1139	1	a	Very addictive, gotta beat those top scores.
1141	1	a	This game is ridiculously fun. A bit short, I finished the game in about two days. Orcs Must Die! Definitely has the best twist on tower defense: third person.
1143	1	a	The RPG!
1145	1	a	Kill some orcs
1147	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is a very nice take on the tower defense genre. Seeing as I only played through the Single Player portion of the game and on Warmage difficulty my review will be based on that.  The game starts out with a short cinematic of an old archmage who meets his untimely demise at the hand of some stairs. As he falls Orcs are about to storm the portals into our world with one last obstacle in their way, the archmage his terribly unskilled apprentice, you.  Throughout the campaign the game slowly expands your arsenal of weapons and traps that you can use to slaughter the oncoming horde as they attempt to break through. At no point are you overwhelmed with choice or are you left with few options on how to handle a given situation.  While some strategies are more effective in certain situations you are always free to take the hard path. The difficulty level is not too high in this game and greatly depends on your preffered play style. Once I developed a certain preffered trap combo I found myself using it over and over with great effect until certain maps came along where the combo was entirely useless forcing me to adapt my playstyle.  The only shortcoming in this game is that while the difficulty is okayish in most levels there are certain spikes that can come as a complety suprise and force you to figure out some mechanics without being informed about them so this might be frustrating for some players who prefer to casualy walk through a game.  The only noticeable bugs I encountered were with flying enemies going straight through walls in some stages and in another some enemies managed to get stuck at the bottom of an acid swamp without dying. Overal these encounters were few and once you were aware of the possibility of them occuring not all that problematic.  Overal score of 8/10, Would totally recommend this to fans of the genre.
1149	1	a	Orcs must die is a tower defence game and third person shooter wrapped up into one.  The plot is as simple as it gets. There are two worlds, our world, and the orc world (insert warcraft joke here). They are connected by rifts, which allow travel between the two worlds, and for magic to flow into both worlds. An order has been set up to protect these rifts at all costs, using massive forts filled with traps to stem the hordes. You are a thick beefcake trained by the best old man the order had, before he died, it is your task to defend the rifts and keep back the hordes.  The meat of the game is wave based tower defence, where in you spend mana to set up defences along lanes in order to protect the rift from any nasties trying to get through. You yourself are loaded with weapons as well which allow you to take an active roll in the defence of the rift. You have a set amount of slots with which to select your tools of death and are locked into those until the end of the level. Weapons and traps both take up a single slot, so choose wisely.  Its a difficult but extremely satisfying process, going through each wave and being careful with how you plan everything out, from basic trap set up to the shooting mechanics, every enemy is dealt with in a slightly different way, with no true stratagy to perfectly stop the incoming hordes, you're always moving, always setting up new traps, always doing something. Its chaotic, but rarely overwhelming to the point where its impossible to handle right up until the end when you've failed to make the optimal trap set up somewhere or haven't been active enough in your own personal combat against the creeps.   Visually the game is very cartoonish, everything is very clean and it goes well with the cheesy comedy aspect, really hammering home the fact the game is light hearted, which is fine. The music scores, while not the greatest pieces, are memorable and even weeks later i can perfectly remember the main theme, i personally found them fantastic, but your tastes may differ.  The game overall was a wonderful experience from start to finish, being one of the most addictive games i've ever played in my life, and it was also the first game i ever played on PC, forever bringing me into the folds of the PC master race. I whole heartedly recommend this game to anyone looking for a fast paced tower defence game, or third person shooter with heavy focus on not doing all the work by yourself.
1151	1	a	Very addicting game, well made, good for killing time.
1153	1	a	Mega funny game to burn hours of time into, highly reccommended!
1155	1	a	This is a great example of how to combine action and tower defense gameplay.  Gameplay is very fun; the variety of weapons and traps gives you plenty of ways to complete most levels. However, some traps/weapons need to be upgraded before they're useful IMO.  The art style, soundtrack and story (what little story there is) are all fun and upbeat, and make a very fun atmosphere. The little amount of dialogue is gold, too.  Nightmare mode is exactly what is says on the tin.  Absolutely recommended.
1157	1	a	A good game.I like it so much...i want to buy the Orcs must die 2.
1159	1	a	Orc and goblin oh my this is a fun tower defense game
1161	1	a	Few games are tight and cohesive as OMD. The presentation is perfectly suited to the game mechanics.
1163	1	a	 Spike reviews his 100%-ed games    In one sentenceâ€¦
1165	1	a	Great fun. I enjoy the main character's wisecracks. And slicing, dicing, skewering, burning, flinging, and exploding Orcs never gets dull!
1167	1	a	Really enjoyed it. Incredibly addcitive. Its nice to see that the ex-ensemble guys are still doing good work. If you like third person action or tower defense you should pick it up. its only 15 bucks. totally worth the buy.
1169	1	a	Def a game I would recommend getting if you like RTS.
1171	1	a	Great game, only wish it it had more levels and mutiplayer support. Very satisfying to setup a great defense and watch the orcs get slaughtered.
1173	1	a	Fun. Addicting. Fun achievements and significant skill level changes increase replay value.
1175	1	a	Fun in that it becomes addictive, and you get satisfaction out of getting your fix.
1177	1	a	Not as good as the first.
1179	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is one of those really great indie-titles that deserves more attention than it has got. Sure the second game is way better, but nonetheless the first game rocks too! A first-person tower defence, Orcs Must Die! finds the perfect balance between tactical setups and mindless killing action. The game becomes quite challenging later - which can be good for some I bet. I, for one, can have a hard time controlling the battlefield, when enemies swarm from every side.  The designs of traps, levels and enemies are classic, but great, and the game offers hours of fun. The variety of traps are remarkable, and fighting alongside your tactical setup is a great way of playing this kind of game. Though the game lacks co-op, which thankfully has been addressed in the sequel.  DIE!!! .... After you have bought the game.
1181	1	a	Very fun game for the first 2 hours, then the difficulty falls off a cliff and most people stop playing. I've been back to push through a few times but the novelty is gone. A good buy, just know ahead of time that you will probably only get 2-3 hours gaming from it.
1183	1	a	I found the game pretty addictive. It's a tower defense game with a wide variety of traps and weapons to choose from. Negotiate with orcs? No! Orcs Must Die!
1185	1	a	Orcs Must Die!   That's a pretty dumb name.   Although I ended spending way too much time on this silly little game. Orcs Must Die would fall in the 'Tower Defense' Genre but it has so many different twists. Firstly being, there's a pretty funny story and hilarious characters. You not only make traps, you also run around with a sword or gun or frost magic and fight as well. It's entirely possible to win the game without a single trap. It's also entirely possible to win without a single sword swing but both would be incredible difficult. I loved wasting time on this game.
1187	1	a	BOOM GOES THE DYNAMITE!
1189	1	a	Totally nuts. If you like tower defense and/or action games, this game is for you. Not much story in it, but hey! Who needs a story, if you can build all kinds of traps and participate in the action?
1191	1	a	Pretty Cool Tower Defence! Its a little bit challenging i love that!Can't wait to try Orcs Must Die 2 :D
1193	1	a	Tower defense with humor and an attitude. The music keeps pumping, orcs keep coming and you have a growing arsenal of traps and weapons to keep them at bay. Lots of fun!
1195	1	a	very fun its a must buy
1197	1	a	Its been years since ive played a game as entertaining as this!! the large amount of traps(allowing many combinations) and the large variation of fortresses(where in each you can find a certain advantage) allows one to play them over and over,another bonus is that every trap you unlock and every upgrade you buy is persistant so you can go to an earlier level to experiment with the new traps. the 'Nightmare' difficulty also picks up nicely where the war-mage dificulty ends. this game is all about making facing hordes of orcs fun and they have done a excellent job with that!!  the Quotes that the orcs spill are also funny. the Normal difficultty campaign took me about 8 hours to complete.
1199	1	a	good 3rd person tower defence
1201	1	a	This is one of the best action tower defence games I have played. really fun traps and combos and freedom to run around fighting makes this a nice gem. lack of multiplayer or co-op is the only bad thing, but even solo is still alot of fun
1203	1	a	Play the first one, tons of fun. Do NOT buy the second one, omg snooze-fest almost immediately. Complete and utter sequel fail. So crushingly dissappointed.
1205	1	a	I know it's not a new game, but like way to many games these days, the inability to customize you input settings really limit the playability...  Fortunately I got this as a part of a humble bundle or I would have been rather upset with it... At the very least include a way to set inverse mouse in the menu..
1207	1	a	What I learned from this game: Orcs can get pierced, slashed, crushed, burnt, frosted, exploded, desintegrated ... and the really nice cartoony graphics make this look even funny. Recommended!
1209	1	a	ORCS MUST DIE! Kil them how u want!
1211	1	a	By far the most entertaining and inventive ego-shootish game I have played in the last couple of years.   Players having a knack for frantic, challenging, but nevertheless highly strategic action, HAVE TO GIVE IT A TRY.
1213	1	a	Orcs Must Die embellishes your devious side, encouraging you to devise clever ways of fulfilling the command of the title. For the not-so-clever, mowing down invaders with an automatic crossbow is also a great time. Whatever your approach, an orc's pain is your gain. You must download, because Orcs Must Die.
1215	1	a	A very fun game. It's kind of like Sanctum but with a fantasy setting instead of a science fiction setting. Build traps, unleash the horde and kill waves of orcs with your crossbow/sword and the traps you've build. At first I thought it was a little easy, but obviously the further you progress teh harder the levels become. I recommend this game to everyone that likes towerdefense-shooter hybrids. The only downside is the lack of multiplayer, but that's what Dungeon Defenders is for I guess.
1217	1	a	This game's a blast. Overall, it's more of a 'management' type of game rather than ur basic hack-n-slash. Bonus are the little funny comments from the orcs whenever they start attacking. Even for an old game, it's still fun.
1219	1	a	Orcs Must Die! That is all that is to be said about this game it is amaze balls
1221	1	a	The best game where you play a Bruce Campbellian jockhead wizard hero and fight orcs in a 3rd person shooter tower defense game.
1223	1	a	Loved Orcs Must Die! So much fun and very satisfying setting up your traps for the orcs. Can be quite challenging in parts. Really looking forward now to Orcs Must Die! 2...
1225	1	a	This is just dirty, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed fun. Gotta think, gotta react, and most of all - gotta stay calm. Definitely worth the lucre.
1227	1	a	One of the most helarious tower defence games Iâ€™ve played. I do very much enjoy this genre and orcs must die does shine as one of the best. Even though the gore and the graphics design is 'cartoony'; mowing down the hord with well placed traps or jumping into the frey with a meele weapon is still extremely satisfying. The humor is well done but taylored for younger players with reasonably subtle hints to more adult subjects. The plot is simple but entertaining non the less. The maps can be quite fendish but once you work out the best arrangement it all falls into place and you can work on that high score.
1229	1	a	Fast, fun and easy to pick up.
1231	1	a	Totally addictive, very easy to start, but after a while it starts to test your skills. It's a very fun game to play, really worth the price  100 out of 100 of course ;)
1233	1	a	Holy crap this game is addicting. Now at the time of writing this recommendation, I haven't beaten it yet...BUT...man this game is just sooooo good. It's just...cuz...like....URRRGGHH! Tower defense gameplay, with third person shooter gameplay. GReAT mix. The graphics are awesome, sound/music is great, and level design hits the sweet spot. You've GOT to get this game. I was able to get this when it was on sale and MAN what a steal that was. HIGHLY recommend this game. Lot's of fun ^_^
1235	1	a	Who doesnt love killin' orcs? This game is amazing! i really recommend this to all people who like fighting in generally  You will love this game  
1237	1	a	Gotta love mass genocide! Set the language to German to get the full experience.
1239	1	a	Gameplay is similar to tower defense games, but instead of towers, you defend rifts. You prevent orcs from crossing the rifts by setting up traps AND fighting them using your crossbow/blade/spells (3rd Person). You can also customize your warmage (minor spoiler) by using the weavers, which give specific boosts whether you prefer casting spells or being crafty with traps.  Highly recommended for the casual gamer, it's easy to pick up and go. Maps typically has 15 rounds which take no more than 3-5 minutes each (much faster if you are good)
1241	1	a	A very fun and enjoyable game. Played at friends house and knew it was a must have.
1243	1	a	Simple and fun tower defence game. Solid and stylised graphics with a slick sense of humour. Difficulty curve is a bit all-over-the-place but the gameplay and enjoyment shine through
1245	1	a	Already got it on the Xbox but had to buy it on PC as well. Besides the fact that it's so good I just want to throw money at these guys, I also prefer the prettier graphics on PC :D
1247	1	a	You like orcs? Plenty of them! You hate orcs? What are you waiting for, slaughter them!
1249	1	a	a damn good game that anyone who likes tower defense and/or FPS games should get, definetly in my all time top 10 games absolutly excellent, alot to do and a huge variety of traps and weapons to keep you amused for hours. only shortcoming is its only single players but then theres OMD2 so go get that aswell!!!!!
1251	1	a	one of the best games i have ever played
1253	1	a	Cool Indie game :D 7/10 Stars *******
1255	1	a	A fun, cartoony, tower defense/FPS hybrid game. The controls are fluid and easy to pick up. There's a satisfaction that doesn't come with normal tower defense games where you just sit back and watch. If you liked Sanctum, this is better.
1257	1	a	My god this game is perfect, needs a co-op though, luckilt the second one has it. But holy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, this game is the funnest 3 hours ive spent procrastinating an essay in ages   GET IT.
1259	1	a	WAY fun and very addicting!
1261	1	a	Awesome, and addicting, Great DLC, great gameplay, and it's really fun figuring out a good way to lay things out. If you like tower defense games, like DD, then this is the game for you!
1263	1	a	Not only is it one of the best tower defense games ever, but you get to join in the action first-person. And there are so many ways to do it, the maps have a great deal of replay value. I've logged on 100+ hours already, and I'm not done yet.
1265	1	a	great game, a lot of fun
1267	1	a	Great game for the price. I even picked it up on sale. It will give you a lot of game play IF you want to get all five skulls and the achievements. Get ready to be frustratied (unless you play on easy) However, the challenge is part of the game. Remember this is a short game but it's worth the low price.
1269	1	a	Fun game with good strategy components, but with an overall action feel. It allows the player to choose a field control, crowd control or more basic hack and slash approach to the level. Not a lot of replayability, but worth a couple of bucks to play.
1271	1	a	This game has one liners and orcs, I laugh my â™¥â™¥â™¥ off every level.  Hwever, if you DON'T want a main character that quips every time he puts a trap down (Step right this way, mister orc.) or when you get a kill streak (Awwwwws, look who has no arms...) You'll probably hate it.
1273	1	a	Does a really good job of combining Tower Defense with third person FPS elements. Difficulty curve goes way up halfway through, but it's worth seeing through to the end. Definately recommend for Tower Defense fans.
1275	1	a	Great little game of Tower Defense against countless Orcs where you are right in the action 3d person. Just replace the word Tower with Trap...
1277	1	a	What tower defence looks like in the future, but now...
1279	1	a	This is the perfect game to just start blasting away at every once in a while. Don't expect to get caught up in it for more than a few days, but while you do, it's great. Plain old orc-blasting ogre-hacking fun. Classic hack n' slash that's simply good at what it does.
1281	1	a	Such an amazingly awesome &amp; addictive game, love it!!!
1283	1	a	Awesome...a proper blaster with some turret style tactics and humour thats reminiscent of Evil dead' Ash...recommend it 100%
1285	1	a	Tower defense game for people who hate tower defense games.   I hate tower defense games.
1287	1	a	My favorite tower-defense game as of now. No co op unlike others, but it doesn't spoil the fun.  Approximately 20 levels with 3 different difficulty settings, nice graphics and charme. Wide variety of traps/spells/npcs to help you kill ALL the orcs!
1289	1	a	I used to like orcs...
1291	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is an extremely fun Tower Defense game, with a very nice mix of tower (trap) defense and third person action game.  While there are clearly some traps which are much more useful than others and you will tend to gravitate towards them, there is still a large amount to choose from, so you can easily set up some deadly combinations to defeat the invading orcs.  The gameplay is where the game really shines, while the level design is so-so, the sheer amount of variety in the game compensates for that.  The only major fault of the game is that it appears personal abilities are very strong and can overshadow the traps themselves, so if you are strategy minded you might be disappointed since, especially in the early waves, you will have to rely heavily on your character to do most of the work.  Great game let down by balance issues and level design.  8 / 10
1293	1	a	Pure Simple FUN! Can't miss with this one!
1295	1	a	Great tower defense, but it may get repetitive.  Rating: â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜† 
1297	1	a	If you like third-person shooters with a mix of tower defense, then 'Orcs Must Die!' is something you'll probably enjoy. Play as the former wizard's apprentice, the War Mage, as you strive to protect magical rifts to the protagonist's homeworld. Those gateways set in various fortresses, you build a variety of traps or even fight head-on with various weapons/abilities to keep hordes of orcs and other monsters from reaching their goal. The game is so fun that will have you hecticly thinking on your virtual feet to plan the many ways to dispatch the onslaught. Replay levels several times after you manage to unlock all the traps, weapons and upgrades to see if you can make it to the top of the leaderboards amongst your friends or the rest of the world. Seriously, you'll have lots of fun.
1299	1	a	Tower defense meets 3rd person shooters. Most excellent, highly recommend it.
1301	1	a	More fun than I bargained for. Worth the purchase 100%!!!!
1303	1	a	Quirky, easy to play, fun for anyone tower defense game. KILL THEM ORCS!
1305	1	a	An excellent game for a reasonnabnle price ! Jump into this action tower defense with loads of fun !
1307	1	a	I bought this game expecting to maybe play it for an hour and move on, but I ended up marathoning it from start to end. The gameplay is fun and innovative (you get a feeling of reward for creating complex traps and you really develop your own playstyle as you go), and the characters (that is, yourself, the mage, the enemy leader and the orcs) are easily likeable. I recommend it to anyone who's ever liked a tower defense game.
1309	1	a	this is worth it. its tower defence but fun like irongrip warlords. unfortunately not multiplay. :_(
1311	1	a	This is an awesome game!!!! MUST HAVE!!! 
1313	1	a	Good for wasting 10 minutes in between doing other stuff.
1315	1	a	The most fun game about genocide ever made.
1317	1	a	Christmas and New Year 2011 was written off because of this game. It was well worth it too!
1319	1	a	This game is HIGHLY addicting. If you're a fan of Tower Defense games then this is for you. You just want to see Orcs getting slaughtered by the thousands!!!
1321	1	a	Now this is a fun game! Combining stragegy and planning with frantic combat and dark humor this is easily one of the indie games I've enjoyed the most over the past few years. I could easily see this doing well on PSN or Xbox Live (if it isn't already).
1323	1	a	Good orginal.. innovative game.. and cheap if on sale.
1325	1	a	Best tower defense game I ever played. Setting traps is fun, especially once you unlock flingers and pushers, and having to mix it up yourself keeps it from getting slow or tedious. Plus if you like peons or Warhammer orcs, you'll love these too.
1327	1	a	This game is simply a must-play for anyone even remotely interested in the tower defense genre. Orcs Must Die blends together strategic trap placement and 3rd person action seamlessly as it delivers a short but sweet experience that you will not soon forget.
1329	1	a	Yes they must.
1331	1	a	The ultimate Tower Defense 3rd person shooter; I would have payed $60 for this game!
1333	1	a	Loads of fun! Not a very long experience, unless you try to perfect every level, but totally worth it!
1335	1	a	What do you need to know that the title doesn't tell you?  This is a great introduction into what is quickly becoming one of my favorite series of games.
1337	1	a	Awesome FPS/TD game. Like Dungeon Defenders, but less monotonous (but also only one-player)
1339	1	a	I get why the Orcs need to die, I really do. But do they HAVE to die? The game never explains why they have to die, or why the wan't to capture the time portal's so badly. Surely their primitive hierarchy of wants and needs can be satisfied with the help of some magic. We don't even know the full story, maybe the portals are Samuri-Jack style way to the past before evil mages took over the orcis agricultural utopia that once existed before hand. We just cant know for certain and for that reason I am a consiencous objector to killing orcs as a TF2 inspired scout-mage until the developers explain why the orcs absolutely 100% MUST die.
1341	1	a	Great game, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you coal and coupons.
1343	1	a	there is only one word to describe this game..... AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!
1345	1	a	A fun game of tower defense and FPS
1347	1	a	Great tower defense style shooter.
1349	1	a	Great Game! Fun to play and easy to learn!
1351	1	a	Burst the orcs into pieces! Quite a few weapons and tons of traps promise orc-slashing fun. Nice mechanics, pretty good overview, and a funny background story (which is not all too important, I claim :P ).  All in all a rather nice game to play.
1353	1	a	fun and hard (sometimes) and addicting game, that i can't stop playing. my type of humor too.
1355	1	a	First Person 'Trap' Defense at its finest. Slaying hordes of orcs is so much fun. 8/10
1357	1	a	Honestly one of the best indie game i have had the chance to play, simple premices and tons of fun, the closest thing u'll find to a dungeon keeper, one of the rare games i just play after a bad day :) just makes me laugth and relaxes me, only thing i would say agaisnt it would be it's too bad they didn't addedd a coop mode, many dungeons you play woulda been perfect for a 2 man team, also it's too bad they didn't added a loot system, the game lends itself to collecting loot to upgrade ur war mage but unfortunatly they didn't go for that aspect, oh well can't have everything.
1359	1	a	Surprisingly fun and well put together tower defense game. In a similar fashion to Sanctum, you place traps in the path of your enemies to protect the gate from every wave of increasingly stronger Orcs. You can also use multiple spells and weapons at your disposal to help even the odds. Managed to get 15 hours on my first play through so lots of good gameplay there for the price!  TL;DR: Game is good n' â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Go buy it.
1361	1	a	Great mindless fun for the whole family. But really, buy this game!
1363	1	a	Surprisingly fun and addictive First Player Perspective Tower Defence game. Creative level and trap design lets you experiment with different ways of clearing them. Oh. and once you get weavers you can be a mass-slaughterer of orcs personally. Good times!
1365	1	a	I first tried Orcs Must Die! 2 at RTX and loved it. So I get the first one. Solo is a lot of fun but playing it with a friend is the best way to play this game.
1367	1	a	Amazingly addictive and fun to play.
1369	1	a	Orky Orky times! = Fun times!
1371	1	a	Awesome Trap-Defense / Third Person Shooter. Excellent art, good balance. Lots of gameplay.
1373	1	a	Its not the most 'serious' looking game, and does look rather idiotic, I've enjoyed every second I've put into this game. Its got a great playthrough value, and the replay value is solid as well. If your looking for a fun semi-tower defense game, then this is worth checking out. Its all single player, but check out the second one for co-op!
1375	1	a	what can we say, splendid splendid stuff, great fun that we keep coming back to and it's damned hard at times too!
1377	1	a	A very fun and satisfying tower defense / shooter type game. You have an array of traps and some basic spells to choose from to slice, burn, crush, and explode the Orcs from entering the Rift. Sounds are excellent to make you feel like you are actually doing damage and the visuals aren't the best but still pretty awesome. Tons of voice acting to keep you smiling. There are plenty of Tower Defense / Shooter types out there, but this is the most satisfying one yet.
1379	1	a	Shoot all the orcs!! Set traps for orcs!!! Oooooorcs!
1381	1	a	Tower defense based concept, and great if you're looking for instant action. Choose your character/weapons/traps; kill Orcs and keep them away from the rift!
1383	1	a	A really good, entertaining and challenging game with a lot of replay value that will test your true abilities in the tower defense genre. It is a game that doesn't hold your hand at all and can only be truly mastered by practicing and playing the game through trial and error, how it should be in my opinion. A definite buy for any lover or tower defense games.
1385	1	a	Not bad, about 10 hours of campaign game play in it.
1387	1	a	Funny, hectic, the first time I've seen someone manage to make a first person tower defence game worth playing.
1389	1	a	Nothing beats watching the stupid greenskins fall into your traps of doom.
1391	1	a	It's like tower defense meets action RPG. Orcs Must Die! is quite fun.
1393	1	a	Genuine, 100% organic, sincere, long-forgotten fun with a dash of dark humor. Best buy-2011.
1395	1	a	As I Write This Very Review....And I hear The Gates being seiged by the foul Hourde. I look around at my Current Defences simi confident that they will hold againts the comming storm. Even though I have a storm of emotions rolling inside me I determine one thing............ORS MUST DIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1397	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
1399	1	a	DEff one of the best indie games ive played this year!!!
1401	1	a	'I really like this game'
1403	1	a	There's so many positive things I can say about Orcs Must Die. It's a game which won't disappoint even the most hard to please gamer, as It's packed with so much fun, humour, and thought.  Orcs Must Die is more or less the same as Plants vs Zombies. It's a game where you must place traps in order to stop the horde of enemies from reaching their goal, and every new level brings a new trap. With every new trap of course brings a new enemy, so be prepared for this when organising your traps. Aswell as traps you can also use magic, and choose upgrades through-out the various levels through a card system.  Being as this is the first game from Robot Entertainment, I give this game a big 10/10. There isn't many people who won't enjoy this game. It's pretty hard to find weak points. There's few bugs, has good graphics, and overall perfect gameplay.  Pick this awesome game up at any opportunity. You won't regret it.
1405	1	a	Think of a tower defence game with a controlable hero. Now replace towers with 100 other cool ways to kill an orc. (like a bladed vacuum that tears fools to shreds) Boom there ya go.  No real story, but that's not really the aim of the game. Just kill â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
1407	1	a	fun game...plays smoothly...not overly hard but some maps you do have to plan accordingly or you might let a few get through
1409	1	a	Funny as hell, DLC is a must though, especially when you want to complete the starter levels without any trouble...
1411	1	a	I saw a friend of mine playing a game like this a long time ago on PS1, I never got to try it myself, forgot what it was called, but ever since then Ive been wanting a game where you could spawn all sorts of gorey traps on the walls of a castle and then let the invaders run through them. This game gives me all that, and more, more as in comedy, badassery, archery, when in doubt use fire. This is the first recommendation I've ever done, so I hope that tells you something, it's just a game for pure fun and slaughter of evil orcs.
1413	1	a	Great game for easy fun in first levels, challenging in later ones. Great action-strategy with absurd humor... What more can you ask for?
1415	1	a	Damn, this is some great tower defence meets FPS meets rivers of orc blood.
1417	1	a	10/10 would kill orc again
1419	1	a	cool game, better then i expected, can't remember if i got it for 10$ with the 2 dlc's or what. Game reminds me of torchlight, the colors, architecture &amp; music is ALL very pleasant &amp; i would reccomend this game + dlc for 10$ without much question. I have played it for like 4 hrs so i don't know how much better it will get but i do NOT regret getting it though i never really wanted to begin with. Can't give a out of 10 since i haven't completed at least 50%. Fun game it is.
1421	1	a	It's a good game, but it gets pretty hard towards the end. The sequel is better.
1423	1	a	Awesome tower defense game combined with a third person shooter. Super addicting!
1425	1	a	Just plain simple gory fun
1427	1	a	Orcs Must Die is a great mash up of action and strategy. The game can be played with either an action bent or a more strategic mind. As you unlock more weapons and traps, new strategies will become available making old levels fresh again.
1429	1	a	Wicked fun, and honestly AMAZING value for the money. Even if you don't like tower-defense style games, I would recommend giving this a try!
1431	1	a	Very fun game, give the demo a try!
1433	1	a	pretty good game if you just want to mess around and enjoy funny dialogue. theres worse things you could spend 15 bucks on
1435	1	a	Great and addictive game. Worth to buy it.
1437	1	a	Great blend of FPS and tower defense with fast paced fragging and some good laughs. Two thumbs up!
1439	1	a	A great mix of Tower Defence and Shooter .
1441	1	a	What games used to be. Simple in concept, fun to play and very addictive. The orcs must die!!! Bit of strategy with FPS action a great stress reliever. Don't take it too seriously and you'll love it.   The easy levels are just that easy, the harder ones are much much harder and will make you work for it.   Never knew there were so many way's to kill orcs.
1443	1	a	Ostensibly a Tower Defense game, Orcs Must Die is a downright fantastic take on the genre. With an art style reminiscent of Torchlight and a light-hearted sense of humour revolving around all the myriad ways to kill Orcs, OMD is as fun to watch and listen to as it is to play. The game offers a lot of options, and it does a good job of making them all viable. You can be just as effective using traps to decimate Orcs as you can be wading in with Crossbow and Bladestaff. You can use traps to deal direct damage, or take advantage of physics and fling the Orcs around like ragdolls. You can also opt to be a weapon-wielder, lopping heads and shooting faces, or you can load up with spells and lay all kinds of elemental smackdown. Or any combination of the above.   Orcs Must Die is an aesthetically pleasing game that transcends its origins and does not disappoint in living up to its namesake. This game is excellent.
1445	1	a	At the beginning of each level the characters have some lines. On one of the last levels I was rolling. Just a funny â™¥â™¥â™¥ line.   Fun game to play.
1447	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is a very enjoyable mix of the tower defense and third-person shooter genres with plenty of comedy mixed in. The objective of the game is to place traps in order to prevent waves of orcs from making their way through to your world. As you progress, you unlock more traps which you can also upgrade. Furthermore, you can supplement your traps by attacking the orcs directly.  I highly recommend this game. The gameplay and comedy are highly enjoyable. For those looking for a co-op experience, you'll want to check out Orcs Must Die! 2. Which as a bonus includes levels from Orcs Must Die! in addition to it's own, new, levels.
1449	1	a	ONE HELL OF A GAME,  you are missing out if you donâ€™t get this game, with varied levels, weapons/traps and enemies all combined into this small but brilliant game.  itâ€™s a game you can just relax to, set traps and watch your enemies die or get stuck in killing as many Orcs as you can.  Well worth the buy even at full price.
1451	1	a	I took a chance buying this game and i'm glad i did, It's fun and addictive, The beauty of this game is that theres no specific way to set up the traps, Set them up your way, The joy of watching your perfectly arranged traps mowing down hordes of Orcs like a well oiled machine is wonderful to behold, With good graphics, sound and humor, I totally recommend this game, you'll almost feel sorry for the Orcs, Almost.
1453	1	a	Fun game, average graphics; from me 7/10.
1455	1	a	Most of us have a collection of games that we bought for low prices and have never installed. I know I have probably two dozen. This was one of them until today. If it's one of your 'someday' games, change it. Now.
1457	1	a	I picked this game up cheap in a bundle and was very surprised at how very awesome it is. It combines FPS, tower strategy, and humor in delicious proportions. I find it hard to quit. Each level requires its own analysis to determine the best defense, the options are endless, and I don't always get it 'right' and get overwhelmed the first time through. A perfectly played map leads to total personal satisfaction. Orcs Must Die can be played casually in 15 minute bursts, but it is easy to get sucked into multi-hour sessions that leave you tense, sweatry, and carple-tunneled out.
1459	1	a	Tower Defense done right. Well is it really tower defense? It's a yes and no. Towers in this case are traps and you can place them during waves as well if you have money. However you yourself can also defend (much like Sanctum, in fact these two are simliar in more ways then one). Some of the early levels you can beat without usinga single trap but later you'd have a very hard if not impossible time (in my opinion) to beat the levels without using traps. Traps vary from simple floor spikes and wall arrows to flame spitting floor traps and tar pits. It's not your traditional tower defense but it fits enough for me to put it in this genre. Upgrades to the traps comes outside of the levels and are permanent. No need to worry about which one to upgrade, you do it once and it's for good. There are a lot of traps and weapons in this game, a great variety for many different strategys and plenty of replay value.
1461	1	a	This is the greatest orc massive murder of All Time.
1463	1	a	Are you a MASSIVE racist that hates orcs for no rational reason? CONGRATULATIONS! Play this game, and you will have your reason, because they're being bad and invading your rift. You are a loveable idiot (So just like real life), who can dance like nobody's business, and he's humanity's LAST HOPE against the incoming Orc threat. Set traps, headshot orcs, and become the orc-discriminatory hero that the Rift needs.
1465	1	a	When i first played Orcs Must Die i thought what is with all the hype. Recently i've been playing more and more of it, and finally understanding what all the hype is about. Great game for relaxing and just killing things. Turn on some music, and have a great time killing orcs.
1467	1	a	10+ hours.. Awsome TD/HD game.. Lots of jokes.. No multiplayer.. 9 of 10..
1469	1	a	There are a lot of orcs in this game. They all need to die.  The story isn't great but the game itself certainly is. The game is challenging but can also be played in an easier mode if that is more your cuppa tea. For the die-hards, there is also a nightmare mode. Finishing the game for the first time should take a reasonable amount of time (&lt;10h). The replayability is good though, the achievements are fun to try and get, and generally not of the grinding type. Since the way to play a level will completely depend on how you approach it (which traps you use, which weaver, etc) you can do a level multiple types without feeling like it's always the same thing.  It's a lot of fun to find and try out new methods of making Orc-paste (a)
1471	1	a	Great tower defense style of game with a large variety of traps to get you through the levels. Having a third person character to aid your traps adds to the fun.
1473	1	a	I highly reccomend if you're the sort that loves to 'turtle' playing RTS. The entire game is about making crunch points and traps so devious I giggled like a four-year-old mad genius. The dialogue is witty and goofy in a perfectly comic way, and I just love forcing them into narrow pathways and grimacing as bits of Orcs go flying everywhere.
1475	1	a	This game is great. You should play it.
1477	1	a	Best TD game I've ever played.
1479	1	a	I played the crap out of this game on my friends xbox 360 and loved every minute of it.  Pros: Orcs Must Die is just witty, funny, entertaining, strategy driven tower defense with a 3rd person shooter slapped on top of it, utilitizing traps to push back hordes of orcs and other monsters . This game is just great 100%.  Cons: Honestly there is no cons to this game that I find worth mentioning.  Overall: 9.9/10 because on warmaster this game is intense.
1481	1	a	LOTS AND LOTS OF FUN... always love td games, this is a great lighthearted one with lots of very funny one liners like.. well wait and see and you will be 'Winning!'  Seriously worth a tenner considering that would last u 20 mins in a pub. Had over 20 hrs play time on it and not nrly finished everything yet.. then i suck anyway lol!
1483	1	a	Similar to Sanctum, but more addictive with better presentation but no multiplayer. A bargain at any price under $15
1485	1	a	Fantastic game for playing solo, if you want co op then go for the Orcs must die 2
1487	1	a	This game is incredibley fun if you love seting up your on personal sen's funhouse and killing orcs like its an average day at the office. So have fun commiting genicide.
1489	1	a	Great tower defense game. If you haven't played this, you're an asshat.
1491	1	a	Simple and addictive, set traps and shoot big green bad guys. Brilliant.
1493	1	a	Another great spin on tower defense. You can create elaborate traps - lots of very fun trap types that work well together, each one upgradeable for a small meta game (each trap type can be upgraded once). You can also take on orcs by making yourself more powerful (upgrading spells, damage, etc). And of course, you can do both. The main campaign has 24 levels, which take anywhere from 5-15 minutes each. Took me about 8-10 hrs to complete the campaign. Then if you enjoyed it, there's leaderboards and some DLC that give you reasons to play more.
1495	1	a	I did not expect this to be anywhere near as stupidly fun as it is!
1497	1	a	A solid orc-killing tower-defending good time. Funny, sharp, and fun. Not really too long though. 4/5
1499	1	a	MORE SPIKE TRAPS!
1501	1	a	Loads of Orcs, Traps, and Maps make for a great 'Tower Defense' style game. The game doesn't take itself seriously at all which makes it even more fun &amp; the cartoon-ish Art Style gives the added benefit of some pretty awsome Death Faces on the Orcs! Go for it, especially on Sale!
1503	1	a	If you have played Dungeon Defenders, this feels just like it expect it's single player. It is a great game, all the traps and weapons feel really nice and the game will always give you a challenge.
1505	1	a	This is a fun two player experience and is rather unique in its approach. I'd call this a good game if you are not expecting more than it has to offer. It is good at what it does offer.
1507	1	a	This game is, simply put, fantastic. It is basically a Third Person Action/Tower Defense game hybrid. I loved it. It is very humorous, but the story is not where it shines. In fact, the story is somewhat forgettable. The gameplay is what makes this game so great. It is challenging, unique, and most importantly, VERY fun. It also has a pretty decent replay value. However, I would recommend just getting Orcs Must Die! 2 instead, since it has moar weapons, traps, maps. OMD2 also has co-op which is great.. But if you want the classic maps from this game to play in Co-Op in OMD2, then you want to buy this one too. Treat it like a DLC to OMD2 that adds 10 maps.   9/10 (Buy OMD2 instead, or buy it on sale)
1509	1	a	This game has soul. A 3rd person shooter/tower defense mix, the traps are neat, the levels are fun, and the dialogue is frikkin hilarious. It has a moderate learning curve, so dont expect to get perfect scores on your first play through, but it grows on you. A high level of polish, great sounds, animations, and design make this a great game worth the price. 9/10
1511	1	a	An action oriented tower defence game, where you are right in the midst of the battle, tossing down traps, casting fireballs and building crazy trap combos. Good mechanics, cheerful aesthetics, funny lines... The comboing mechanic is cool, but a bit under used. Especially if you don't care about getting the high score and would rather concentrate on getting a perfect run.
1513	1	a	buy game very good plz
1515	1	a	Similar to Dungeon Defenders but not a grindfest, no item drops or multiplayer either, but the gameplay itself is much more fun, interesting, and challenging in the right ways. The traps/upgrades are creative and diverse enough to allow for tons of different ways to conquer each level. The sequel is gonna have co-op.
1517	1	a	Game of the Year! ;) (Y)
1519	1	a	Not quite tower defense, not quite action game, but it is definitely awesome. It's fast-paced, quite replayable, very humorous, pretty challenging. Music's pretty cool as well. I love this game to pieces... with traps.
1521	1	a	Fun and hilarious!! Worth every penny.
1523	1	a	Stupid fun, but it gets really hard down the road. Army of Darkness feeling, and full of cheesy lines.
1525	1	a	This is a pretty awesome game, don't let the Orcs invade your Castle
1527	1	a	Lots of traps, even more orcs, rifts, egocentric and big-headed apprentice. Funny taunts and dialogues in the midst of flying spare body orc parts everywhere. Yes, that's this game. Silly thing it is =]
1529	1	a	Very cool little indie gem right here! :) Got awesome graphics and it's pretty chalenging!! 8/10 for me ;) I definatelly recomend it
1531	1	a	This game is a great tower defence game, really cool design and nice graphics... absolute steal on the humble bundle I got it from.
1533	1	a	This game is really fresh and original. Everything about it is great. Highly recommend it!
1535	1	a	A fun and awesome Tower Defense game, has plenty of strategic oppertunities and is really fun 10/10
1537	1	a	A very good game,nice visuals,great soundtrack!
1539	1	a	A tower defense game mixed with RPG elements and a 3rd person perspective on your hero. A really enjoyable game where you are a young wizard defending the onslaught of orcs. You set up each mission by placing your 'towers' (in this games case, traps) to slow the orcs down. This is only your first line of defense as you control the young wizard once the round starts. Cast magic, go melee, fix traps, and much more.  I would recommend getting this game before purchasing the sequel. Sure the second one has two player co-op, but this will be cheaper and allow you to get a feel for the game. If you really enjoy the game and, like myself, find yourself wanting co-op play to add new deminsions and strategy, grab the second one. If you are quick, grab both games from Humble Bundle (as of this posting 12/10/13) and get both games, all DLC, for $4.25.  I highly recommend giving it a try. Watch the video/trailer to see if the playing style is what you are wanting too. If not, then don't waste your time because you will not be satisfied. If you are intrigued or thinking, 'yeah I will give it a try. looks fun!' then you should buy this right away.
1541	1	a	9 out of 10. It took me about 12 hours to get through the 18 map campaign, and I've spent at least another 12 going back and replaying the levels to try to get more achievements and better level scores. Each map probalby takes 10 minutes to play. You run around setting up traps (kind of tower defense-like) to kill the orcs, kobolds and ogres as they try to make their way through the map from the gate to your rift. You have weapons as spells for direct combat. It's fun to see if you can build the best configuration of traps to stop all the monsters. Single player only. Very stable, I only noticed one very minor bug with a monster getting stuck in lava and not dieing, but I was able to work around it. The character you play is very humorous in the things he says and does, as are the orcs.
1543	1	a	A rather fun and whacky game where you defend and let no orc pass thru.. Use a dozen of different traps, weapons to slay and mutilate orcs hahah... Fun and very challenging! :D
1545	1	a	Really enjoying this game, Great amount of traps to play with and great selection of weapons. If you enjoy tower defence games but wanna also play a character on them this is for you.
1547	1	a	Overall I did enjoy Orcs during the short time I spent with it, and it is a great game. However, it generally didn't stand out of the pack for me, and came at the end of a long winded era of tower defense games.
1549	1	a	Didn't play much of it but was fun while I did.
1551	1	a	Best orc-slaying experience youÂ´ll get, besides the second part of course. Building traps and getting the best rating on the highest difficulty in every level got me quite some time but damn, worth it, so much fun!
1553	1	a	A fantastic frantically paced tower defense/action hybrid done right. Good for hours upon hours of simple orc and ogre slaying delight.
1555	1	a	This game is pure fun. It strikes a tough balance between having traps that are underpowered making the player do all the work, and the traps being overpowered leaving the player with nothing to do but sit back and dodge the bloodsplats. It's always a frantic rush around the level picking off the few stragglers and strategically thinning the ranks with a crossbow or magic spell.
1557	1	a	I was genuinely surprised by this game. I like killing Orcs, (thank you Warhammer: Space Marine) so I decided to pick this up. It is simply a great game. The dialogue knows its place, the graphics are beautiful, the gameplay is absolutely solid. A great balance between combat and defensive strategy. The maps ramp in difficulty quite nicely, and the creators were smart to add enemies that will mess with tactics that worked a few maps ago. Forcing the player to really think about each map is something that shows good game design and I really admire it. If you like tower defense games and are looking for something a bit different, definitely check this out.
1559	1	a	What do you get when you combine tower defense and action? Here it is - Orcs Must Die! An innovative twist to tower denfence genre is what you can look forward here. The use of a variety of traps and your action skills are a must to survive each wave of orcs. It's comical to watch how the orcs suffer from your well placed traps, flying through the air and meeting to their ultimate end with a lovely Ode to Joy BGM as the icing (BGM imagined in your head). And you can unlock gifts in Orcs Must Die 2 if you have Orcs Must Die. Surely a must have for those who love tower defence with a sadistic sense of humor. =)
1561	1	a	great single player game
1563	1	a	Who could find the killing of orcs en masse dissatisfying!? Not me, thatâ€™s for sure. Thatâ€™s why I liked this game very much. You will like it very much too.
1565	1	a	Orcs, Orcs, Orcs and did I mention there are orcs ? This game is all about orcs! You are the last defender of the magic in your world, but you are kinda stupid and not very good at your job! So jump right into the action and kill orcs, orcs and orcs (sometimes a few oger)
1567	1	a	Insanely fun game to play! All I can really say is that ORCS MUST DIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1569	1	a	More awesome than you could possibly imagine.  
1571	1	a	Loved it!
1573	1	a	Very Fun 3rd Person Tower Defense!  Tony Seal of Approval
1575	1	a	This game is amazingly addicting. Fast paced castle defense and shooter mix-up kind of thing. It's a unique blend of awesome.
1577	1	a	Surprisingly fun and captivating, this game will surely keep you entertained for a few hours
1579	1	a	its the best game on earth
1581	1	a	Interesting game~
1583	1	a	I...I think I just realized I don't like tower defense games after all the ones I've tried. I can recognize this as being a well made hybrid of that and a third-person shooter, and there are definitely things about it I can appreciate, but even after trying it twice a couple years apart, I've bounced off it both times. Thanks, Orcs Must Die. You seem like a good game...for someone else.
1585	1	a	Fun and simple, with lots of jokes, this game is a MUST buy, this and the sequel!
1587	1	a	Awesome Defense - type game. It has lots of replayality.
1589	1	a	Awsm Game!
1591	1	a	They must all die.
1593	1	a	Cool because its a First person tower defense
1595	1	a	Best story ever. Needs movie adaptation. 12/10 Would bang again.
1597	1	a	A nice little break from Skyrim
1599	1	a	The best rgp 3ird person Tower defance I hav eevery played well the only one I have played but still worth it the sequal is comming out soon also worth it the only bad thing is you will get tired half why through need commitment
1601	1	a	Wicked fun, Time waster Helps relieve the stress of TMH!!!
1603	1	a	Alright, I gotta admit, there's a perverse sort of classic Tom &amp; Jerry fun to be had with this game and I have had quite a bit of that fun with this game. Not the best 'action tower defense' game mind (it's dying for a co-op mode), but it's twists in the formula are lotsa fun.
1605	1	a	Army of Darkness meets Plants vs. Zombies. Auf Englisch extrem gut!
1607	1	a	This game is a blast, fun form the get go.. and it only gets better. Its tower deffence on setroids. Bored with those 2D tower deffence games, then give this a try..
1609	1	a	I felt like dungeon defenders was a cooler version of this game, orcs were kinda lifeless and the traps and weapons didn't offer much satisfaction when slaughtering the enemy.. for me a game needs solid foundation and this one didn't hold any emotional connection to the mindless action.. but theres more action goin on in yer parents bedroom. I'd have to say this crap is wack, and the second game might have improved to a better standard. the intro video got one good laugh and that I will never forget, but I have moved on from this heaping pile of dog fecal.. to better things. 1/10
1611	1	a	Very addicting and fun.
1613	1	a	This game runs face-first into the same problem that Sanctum did - that success relies on one correct strategy from the beginning. Not only that, but you get to upgrade your traps, and if you mess that up by putting them in the wrong areas, there's no refunds - you actually have to start a new profile.  The graphics, music, sound and concept all receive an A, but the number of flawed tower defense games on this planet are as innumerable as the stars.
1615	1	a	funny story lines and hillraious character.
1617	1	a	It's Lord of the Rings meets Sanctum in this brilliant action/tower defense game. From the moment you lay your first trap you will be drawn in by the distinctive characters. As the title implies there is only one objective, you must kill every last orc that charges into your keep. The myriad of traps at your disposal, as well as your keen sword and spells, get this task done with prejudice. It's wickedly entertaing and slightly demented watching the orcs hurl themselves into spinning blades and explosive barrels, all the while taunting you and laughing about their impending victory. I had childish glee when the hero started trash talking back. For a game with only one hero and a handful of enemy types it is dripping with charm and style. However it is not without minor issues. The animations could use a little more work and the single minded gameplay won't last forever, but these are barely worth mentioning. The dark sense of humor and the variety of death mark this as a must play8/10
1619	1	a	Stop hesitating and start building .
1621	1	a	  Strategy with action!
1623	1	a	Good game, but short.
1625	1	a	Amusing, mindless fun. Slaughtering orcs makes for good gameplay and a great way to unwind after work. The third-person perspective offers a different approach to tower defense games.
1627	1	a	Entertainingly Epic
1629	1	a	Traps, weapons, minions, towers, and (of course) orcs abound in this third-person tower defence game. The dialogue is surprisingly funny and adds a bit of zest to the already-fun task of creating the world's least orc-friendly castle hallways.  Tip: Use a row of wall blades and tar pits (with some barricades, if necessary) to create a single-file orc slaugherhouse. It's as much fun to build as it is to watch in action.
1631	1	a	Orcs Must Die. Just Orcs Must Die. This game got me hooked since the moment I put a feet on the world of rifts, as the successor of the 'Old Man'. The different waves of orcs and different abilities you get after each level encourages playing, the graphics are amazing, the music is epic and I think I found one of my favorite all-time games. Can't wait to play the sequel. 9.5/10
1633	1	a	If you hate orcs, this is the game for you
1635	1	a	Incredibly fun, witty, and challenging. Not your typical tower defense game; with gorgeous graphics, fun dialogue, and a soundtrack that sounds like Mastadon did a Gregorian Chant album. Addictive gameplay that is absolutely worth the price!
1637	1	a	i killed a lot of orcs. it was pretty fun. definitely worth a few dollars. give green to kill green. orc are scum kill all orc.
1639	1	a	Tower defense with strategy. Rather, it's strategy using tower defense. The 'towers' aren't so much towers as they are traps. Oil traps, impaling traps, arrow traps, launcher traps, and so on. Set them up at the right spots, and watch the orcs go flying back the way they came, or dying on the spot.  Oh, and don't forget to listen to what they say while you're killing them, or what your character says while he's killing them. That's always amusing.
1641	1	a	Really great Game! Its ratehr addicting and loads of fun. Sadly this one is only single player but OMD2 is multiplayer so i would suggest getting that 1 to play with friends, but this is still an awesome game totally worth 10$. You'll get your moneys worth if you like Tower Defense games with a 3rd person shooter/melee/magic twist.
1643	1	a	This is a SUPER fun game to play!
1645	1	a	Ever played a tower defense game and thought to yourself; if only I could go and intervene when â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ happens. Well if so then this is the game for you. Funny and chaotic. Its addictive as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, much like most tower defense games. I had tons of fun with it.
1647	1	a	One of my favourites in 2011
1649	1	a	This is by far one of the most entertaining mindless games I've played for a very long time. I feel like a warning to new players is in order, your fingers will hurt if you mash the attack button to much. Once you got a general feel for the game and only aimed at their heads the game was much more bareable.  Mainly comedy and random orc genocide all in one game.
1651	1	a	excellent tower defence game.
1653	1	a	Ridiculously fun game. Easy to lose track of time and actually quite challenging!
1655	1	a	This is a game that I consistently come back to.  Orcs Must Die is a 3rd person action tower defense game. You are given a countdown timer to run and place your objects, road blocks, and towers before the doors break down and a horde of Orcs, Goblins, Kobalds, Ogres and more come storming through. It's up to you a battlemage to use your spells and wepaons to stop them from running into a portal that takes them into your kingdom.   After a certain level, you unlock Weavers which give your character special bonuses and skill trees. To an extent it's a level-by-level RPG as well. You choose from a backpack of skills and utilities that you have hot keyed to your 1-9 keys.   I got this game for $3.74 during a special, but I'd recommend it at full price no matter what. It's really worth it.  This game has no multi-player, however Orcs Must Die 2 is multi-player.
1657	1	a	There are these orcs. They must die. ALL OF THEM.  This game owns. (also I wrote this recommendation so I'd get a steam gift thingie achievement)
1659	1	a	This game is ridiculous.
1661	1	a	This is an awesome game. And this is coming from someone who despises tower defense games.
1663	1	a	An instant classic. Shame it's only single player - we hope that OMD 2 will have a coop feature.
1665	1	a	Orcs, Must, DIE! that is a fact of life, challenging game, tower defense style that can frustrate you for hours.
1667	1	a	This game is a super fun hack-and-slash and easily runs! There's not even a storyline to get in the way.
1669	1	a	Remember, you are the hero, but they see you as the final boss of a dungeon crawl. Its you, and your traps. Against hundreds or orcs. Now, if it was thousands, Then maybe, just maybe, it would be a fair fight.
1671	1	a	Decent Game. The second one is better in my opinion.
1673	1	a	A cool tower defense with a twist, namely first person shooter. this makes placing traps and countering waves from different points tougher, but it also lets you counter the ones that slip through. Relatively cool graphics with lots of blood and ork bodyparts doesnt hurt either.
1675	1	a	Fun! Fast paced Mayhem! With a great sense of humor!
1677	1	a	I thought this was just a silly little same but for as simple as the idea is i find it really enjoyable.
1679	1	a	This game is incredible!! Tower defense + realtime action + comedic humor = HOURS of great mindless entertainment. Highly recommend this to anyone!!
1681	1	a	Very Fun mix of a Castle Defense and 3rd person Action game.Can play a round in 20 minutes or less or play for hours. Lots of replay-ability and fun combos with the traps.
1683	1	a	I'm hooked on this game. It has the right blend of puzzle solving and shooter gameplay to keep me coming back for more. There are variable solutions (aka trap combinations) to deal with the endless orcs, gnolls, kobolds and hellbats which keeps me coming back trying to get that last elusive skull. The main character apprentice war-mage is great; it's like Charlie Sheen playing Harry Potter (he even says 'Winning' in the game). The difficulty curve does get steep about 3/4 of the way through the game, where it starts to feel impossible to get perfection on a level. Would be cool if there was some form of co-op multiplayer on this, but I'm hopeful that this game will have DLCs in the future to include new traps, levels, player-characters.
1685	1	a	This game is cute. Good personality, good graphics, satisfying traps. challenging to build an optimal route. Only a few kinds of enemies, the 'gotta shoot them in the head' thing gets annoying after a while.
1687	1	a	Killing Orcs in a FPS/Stragedy world.. How does it get any better.
1689	1	a	This is a great tower defense style game with 3rd person shooter elements. Its pitfall is that it has no multiplayer support, but this is an issue solved in the sequel. You can upgrade your traps or your character's weapons, depending on your play style. Each map is unique and interesting, sometimes with the inclusion of environmental hazards.
1691	1	a	Know about tower defense games? Know about fantasy creatures? Know about humour? Know about shooters? You'll see all of them combined in this amazing action-strategy game by Robot Entertainment.  The main objective is that all orcs must die. But in order to complete that objective, you'll need to place traps and learn spells and forge weapons and train an army and... use your head. And your muscles. Because there are many ways to finish a level. If an orc or one of their allies (kobolds, ogres, goblins) lives long enough to reach the rift you're bound to protect, then it's over. Remeber: you're a War Mage, and War Mages need to protect the rifts at all cost.  You can use the environment, hire troops, place traps, engage them with your weapons, do as you please, as long as you get to carry your objective.  Slice them, burn them, skewer them, and launch them - no matter how you get it done, orcs must die!  
1693	1	a	great game, just smash zombies in many ways, 10 out of 10 :)
1695	1	a	A fun game with orcs that must die
1697	1	a	Have you noticed how Tower Defense has become like FPS used to be? A new one launches every week. This game sets itself out from the pack by having you play over the shoulder or first person. Good amount of comedy. Nice graphics. You get to kill, maime, and roast Orcs. What isn't there to like?
1699	1	a	Best fun you can have killing Orcs...EVER!  If you don't download the demo and stop reading this...I'll send an orc army to make you!!!  Great title, excellent graphics, very polished. Runs well on even low end hardware/laptops.
1701	1	a	A very fun game that has the best sense of humor since Portal! I first thought OMD! was a low-quality indie game, but it is actually a fantastically made, very well-presented title! The graphics and art style are gorgeous, the animations are flowing, the controls are super smooth, and the traps and sound effects are very impactful (pun intended). Basically, the art, sound, and controls outdo many AAA titles! Plus the humor, wow, this game is truly hilarious. I laughed so many times at the quirky humor. Although the defense aspect isn't super strategic and does rely on trial and error, it is very fun nevertheless. Plus, I love that I can employ my quick reflexes and twitch gaming skills to headshot Orcs left and right. Unlike other defense games where you often indirectly fight, there's always something to set up, shoot, or blow up. Overall, OMD! is nonstop carnage, mayhem, and hilarity! A true gem for fans of defense games, third-person action, and quality humor!
1703	1	a	While writing this review, I have not yet beaten this game. In fact, I'm pretty sure I still have ways to go. However, after quite a bit of anticipation, I'm glad to say that this game is worth its weight. Its a unique spin to a genre that is getting more popular and offers a ton of variety. Without having to due any calculation whatsoever in terms of placing down this or that, I simply go with what I prefer. There is plenty of choice and strategy.    The flow of the game goes quite well with its style of humor and aesthetics. It reminds me a bit of Heretic/Hexen in terms of weaponry/magic and the music strikes a resembling similarity to Warcraft 2.   My only complaint is the lack of multiplayer. While a great game on its own, having the ability to play with someone else would make it much much more entertaining. However, one can only hope that it will be future content... otherwise I'll just get Dungeon Defenders when it is released.  5/5 Rating
1705	1	a	It's tower defense, but without all the boring.
1707	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is a beautiful game. That's not just the graphics, though the art is highly stylized and very fitting of the game's comical atmosphere. OMD takes the addictive mechanics of the tower defense genre and the fast-paced gameplay of an action RPG and creates a hybrid that works far better then would be expected. At first it just gives you a new tower every level, but then you get magic gauntlets and paladins and skill tree and meta-upgrades; there's a tremendous amount of content in OMD, and a tremendous number of orcs waiting to break through your defenses and charge your portals. If only you had aimed that fireball a little more accurately or placed those tar traps a bit further apart...  Oh well, 'Retry Level.'
1709	1	a	This is the only tower defense game other than Revenge of the Titans that has held my interest for more than a few minutes. You'd think I'd like Sanctum better due to my preference for sci-fi over fantasy settings, but I couldn't get into Sanctum at all.
1711	1	a	It might be singleplayer only, but I haven't had this much fun with a game since I first played Team Fortress.
1713	1	a	Orcs MUST die! Just as the title states! 5/10
1715	1	a	Great hero TD
1717	1	a	It's the kind of power fantasy your insecure â™¥â™¥â™¥ could really use to help you get through the day! Buy it and feel like a man, manly woman, more manly mandroid, or other-gendered being with a sudden infusion of manity.
1719	1	a	All the same things from Orcs Must Die 2 apply to Orcs Must Die. If you own both games, the levels from the first can be played from within the second game. I'd recommend playing it from the second game as all the new customisation features will apply to first game's levels, and you'll be able to play as the sorceress.  If playing this from the first game there are a couple of things to note:  * Its customisation system is not nearly as good as the second game. * There isn't as much variety as there is in the second game. Applies to weapons, characters, traps and monsters. 
1721	1	a	This or Dungeon Defenders or Monday Night Combat or... well, approach the notion with this question: do I have ANY friends at all? If the echoing response happens to be a sheepish '...no...' then call Orcs Must Die your newest and only bud.  Orcs Must Die shares more in common with the likes of Lock's Quest than any of the previously mentioned seige-style titles. You, as the Apprentice, are the sole line of defense for a series of interdimensional whatsits. Good, hands-on slaughter earns bonuses; creative execution of traps earn you multipliers. This set up should dispell for you where the focus of Orcs Must Die sits: action first, clever second.
1723	1	a	This game is quite unique perhaps on the PC because whilst it is a tower defence game, this is a tower defence game built on pure action. It is a fast, fluid third person game with a high frame rate and a frenetic pace that never lets up. The controls are responsive and easy to get used to, and the gameplay is as tactically deep as it is fast and furious. Add to that just a lot of great humour that is expressed in the hero's opening lines to each level and this is definitely one of the best indie action games of recent years.
1725	1	a	Just another tower defense? Think again. This game is great, spamable crossbow, hack-and-slash, quick magic spells, orcs torn to pieces, sliced orcs, impailed orcs, burnt orcs, electrocuted orcs, orcs swimming in acid and lava pits, flying orcs, orcs flying into one another because of your catapults. This game is awesome and you can be too if you buy it. The only downside: it's with orcs.
1727	1	a	Excelent game, highly recommended, try the demo.
1729	1	a	An execellent tower defense/strategy game with a little humor. Great graphics, lots of things to built, lots of magic to cast; and lots of maps to test your skills on. Most importantly, it's good fun.
1731	1	a	it's ok  buy the second 1.  (&gt; -.- )&gt; / 5
1733	1	a	Fun game. I guess I'd describe it as defense with traps instead of towers. Very similar to Dungeon Defenders, but where DD succeeded in its multiplayer, this game succeeds in its silly nature and delicious traps of death.
1735	1	a	A great combination of strategy and real time FPS. Your maze making, and trap combinations will either save your bacon, or doom you to difficult last second battles against hoards of Orcs and other nasties. The balance is great, the visuals fresh and smooth, and thereâ€™s more of a story than it first seems, (Cocky apprentice takes over for crotchety old wizard. How many times have we seen that right?) with actual character development. This is 'must buy' in my opinion.
1737	1	a	This game is worth all the money you'll ever put into hospital and electiricy bills.
1739	1	a	This is a really clever and fun TPS tower defense strategy game. The dungeon atmosphere really makes it stand out from the growing crowd. Lots of weapon and trap unlocks give the right incentive to want to push further in the campaign missions. It does get quite difficult as a single player game because the monsters often attack from opposite sides of the map and it's hard to be fighting two places at once--they do provide portals to shorten the journey but they always seem to be poorly positioned (would have been nicer if you got to place the portals yourself). There is also a high dependence on your shooter skills because the trap reload times take forever in the heat of battle, although it is possible I haven't figured out the right mix. So far, I've only seen upgrades for traps, not weapons which is a bummer.    No coop is the game's major weakness, but it is enjoyable despite.
1741	1	a	Quite fun game of a first person shooter/tower defense hybrid, and lots of possible combinations for causing mayhem!
1743	1	a	Play Orcs Must Die! It's a good game.
1745	1	a	It's strangely addicting to set up diabolical traps for hundreds of orcs to meet their collective doom.
1747	1	a	Tower defense is really growing on me lately and this is essential massacre fun. The traps require lots of strategy and many games will leave you on edge taking out the few who make it through everything. Later on you focus on traps on increasing your own power to deal with the invasions yourself! Nice variety of orcs too.
1749	1	a	Mindless fun. Buy it on sale.
1751	1	a	It's a great, fast-paced point(s) defense game with oodles of ways to dispatch your enemies! So spice!
1753	1	a	Highly addicting game that feels part RPG, part tower defense. Fully recommended!
1755	1	a	Very entertaining game with lots of traps/weapons strategies and abilities to kill poor innocent orcs. Also I like game style and humour. Additional weapons in DLC may help too. Try it!
1757	1	a	Until LvL 18 this game is quite ok. Then the difficulty level starts to rise without any sign or reason. A level that you cannot beat without looking into a guide on youtube or s.th. like that. Bad gameplay-design sucks. Game deinstalled. Not to recommend!
1759	1	a	this feels like a Disney cartoon gone horribly wrong. which is a good thing. probably the most fun I had with an action game all year.
1761	1	a	A combination of tower defense and 3rd person action/shooting. This light hearted title asks you to not only strategize your defensive layouts but to also throw yourself into the thick of the combat in order to kill thousands upon thousands of bloodthirsty Orcs.
1763	1	a	This game is awesome - I haven't had this much fun since my wife got her hair caught in the tumble dryer.
1765	1	a	The game can easily be summed up by its title. Orcs Must Die is about making a large amount of orcs into a large amount of dead orcs (and orc pieces). Of course, there's more to it than simply 'Use crossbow on orc' as there are a number of fiendish traps, magic, and AI guardians that you can employ, making it something akin to a tower-defence game. There's more focus on action, though, as you're encouraged to jump in and do your part in causing a bit of death and dismemberment of your own. On top of it all is a somewhat basic story, though there is so much character and humor packed in that it still seems fresh and entertaining. To call the game 'mindless fun' would be a little misleading as there is some strategy involved in trap placement and personal upgrades, but the real fun lies in watching a group of clueless orcs wandering towards a corridor full of all manner of blades and spikes and being reduced to 'orc salsa' while you giggle softly to yourself.
1767	1	a	Hell O' Game!! Definate replay value here. Reminds me of what Plants Vs Zombies would look like in 3D.
1769	1	a	Great game, fun, entertaining. What could be better than roll over some overgrown orcs!
1771	1	a	Awesome game! - Many fun hours spent =)
1773	1	a	Loved. Every. Moment.
1775	1	a	If you are a fan of tower defense, third person shooting, headshots, and Orcs then this is a must buy. Also look into the sequel.
1777	1	a	A tower defence game that's all kinds of entertaining, engaging, and challenging. And while it has all of the usual trappings of a tower defence game, it also functions as a third-person shoter, allowing you to get in on the carnage. Use your traps and spells/weapons to liquify, crush, scorch, grind, and perforate thousands of orcs as they try vainly to infiltrate your castle. If watching orcs be electrocuted and set on fire while being sucked into a meat grinder is your thing, then this might just be the game for you!
1779	1	a	Even if you don't reach for scoring, it's a very nice game to play. I'm not in tower-defence but this TPS-ish version of it is much fun.
1781	1	a	Excellent tower defense game, I recommend!
1783	1	a	The launch trailer was made to 'The Hall of the Mountain King', performed by Apocalyptica. If you need any other incentive, you are a strange man indeed!
1785	1	a	Tremendous fun and way way better than most of the offerings of the oversaturated hero/tower defense genre. Lovely physics gimmicks.
1787	1	a	And oh how they must die. And by so many methods! A great game that tests the ingenuity of your trap placement to maximize the rate of destructive carnage against many enemy types. It's also very accessible for those with limited time, as levels usually lasts less than 15 minutes.
1789	1	a	Never thought that this was just a indie game. Add some tower defence with some Shooter elements and you get Orcs must die. Simple and fascinating. Sometimes it was hard but never unfair. But if you upgrades the units/traps, you will probably stick to the same strategy. So even when I finished the game, I didnt try out every trap.
1791	1	a	Quite nice TPP tower defense game. A bit like Dungeon Defenders but less spammy, and no local multi.
1793	1	a	Orcs Must Die is pure fun. I've sunk over 40 hrs into this game and loved every minute of it. I really hope they make a sequel.
1795	1	a	This game can puzzle you since there are so many ways you can finish each level, but a good game nonetheless, I guess you can really test your creativity here. You better have a fast clicking ffinger because you're going to left click a lot lol.
1797	1	a	Fun as hell and addictive. The voiceovers are great too with the right amount of humor.
1799	1	a	Dead Orc = Good Orc
1801	1	a	Starts out slow - boring, even. But the more new abilities, traps, enemies and levels you unlock, the more addictive it gets!
1803	1	a	Two words best describe this game: fun and addictive. Few things are quite as satisfying as defeating wave after wave of orcs with all sorts of traps and spells.
1805	1	a	It's very well-made, and fun to play. The traps are pretty interesting and varied, although some are kinda useless.
1807	1	a	very short, but sweet none the less  good balanced gameplay, strategy is used, but it could be expanded a lot
1809	1	a	Crazy fun action, with fun weapons, and a nice strategy element from the trap placement aspect. Also, a decent story that mostly takes a backseat to the action, but is enough to be interesting.
1811	1	a	'WINNING' man this games so much fun it's a mix of pre strag and real time it's has some funny one linners.
1813	1	a	This game is incredibly satisfying. The character is hilarious and the traps are really fun to watch as they slaughter millions of orcs. Some later maps get very hard and there is no endless mode.
1815	1	a	Verry nice, and fun game, the best game to come down if you are mad :D
1817	1	a	Damn, this game is fun. I'd play a lot more Tower Defense if there were more like thisâ€” just the right balance of strategy and fast-paced action, especially on Nightmare difficulty; also, the dumb humor hits just the right note.
1819	1	a	The combination of tower defense action and kickass music is what makes this game awesome!
1821	1	a	Great game. Makes a whole new meaning to tower defense.
1823	1	a	You get a nice amount of choice of style in this Defense game, balancing between the amount of damage you do yourself and the amount of damage your traps do. And it's nice to see orcs explode in tiny bits or run screaming while they are on fire.  I would like it if there were more different lines of combad shouting. Perhaps in a DLC?
1825	1	a	Hate Orcs? and want to kill them with traps and spells...then this game is for you!
1827	1	a	For me, more outright fun than Sanctum or Dungeon Defenders. Dungeon Defenders suffers from a Sisyphean feeling of level and item grinding common to MMO's, and Sanctum feels too prescriptive in what approach you need to take to win like more traditional tower defense games. Orcs Must Die avoids this rewarding you with a new toy on each level, and only requiring grinding to beat highscores. Gaining access to new combinations, and highscore tracking, keeps replaying earlier levels interesting.
1829	1	a	It is like dungeon defenders if you played it, but yuo are alone, there is more fun and there isn't the multiplayer.  7/10
1831	1	a	Awesome game! One of the best in Hero Tower Defense genre.
1833	1	a	It is rare that a game remembers what games are all about and remembers it the entire way through the game. Orcs Must Die! keeps its eye on the prize: fun. Every aspect of the game is designed around fun. Orcs exploding: fun. Death traps: fun. The player figuring their own ways through levels, not being restricted to a certain type of approach: fun. There's little in the way of plot, but just enough to keep it...fun. Until this game, I never felt the need to get every achievement just to eek out more playtime, but this game was good enough that I did so. It can be quite frustrating, but that mostly happens through challenges you make yourself - you don't have to 5 star every level, you don't have to play through nightmare mode, but you'll want to. It's a fantastic game that is just long enough, with just enough plot, to make every single section fun.
1835	1	a	Highly responsive (UI, sound, controls) FPS tower defense game with a great art style and direction. Leaderboards incite long-term commitment and replay of already consumed content, and the death animations are hilariously fun. Highly recommended for anyone looking for an easy to pick up and fun short game session.
1837	1	a	More then only funny game... This game is awesome, you can't stop play... :)
1839	1	a	Get this game. It's got a great art style, cartoony - but not excessively so, bloody - but not excessively so, and fun - excessively so (sic).   The DLC is worth every cent as well, the few new traps and spells are great fun, and the new missions are challenging as heck. Turn it up to Nightmare for additional fun and frustration.   This game makes me feel like the defense of Helms Deep, every single mission. It's you against hundreds, thousands of orcs. Cannot recommend this game enough.
1841	1	a	OMD plays a little like Sanctum, but with a greater focus on personal power and less on mazing. The engine also has several physics based traps enabling you to reposition the creeps, enabling fun things like flinging orcs back to the beginning of your kill corridor or tossing them up to the top of a wall covered in instruments death to tumble back down it in bloody chunks. The only bad thing I can really say about this game is that there's no co-op.  Highly reccommended if you even have only a passing interest in TD games.
1843	1	a	There are Tower Defence games, and then there are games like Ork's Must Die. I very action packed game with a major focus on letting the player getting some insane kill counts and the like along with some brutal animations to follow. It ramps up the challanges as you progress, and offers allot of tools for you to pick, choose, and play around with to figure out what stratergys go best with your play style. This game also never once holds your hand, expecting you to figure things out on your own and run with it.   If there are any real flaws towards this game, it's base price at times feels a wee steep in my pocket for a 20 stage ( x2 if you count nightmare mode's alt mob waves ) single player experance with maxing out skulls, and climbing the leaderboards the only thing left once done with it. But admittily for $15, you are getting something that looks and plays like a full buget game as well, and that's pretty nice for a new devloper.  Regardless highly recommended.
1845	1	a	Nice game to waste some time. The challenges can be realy hard depending on the equipment you chose. I recommend you get the DLC 'Artifacts of Power' as it contains 2 very powerfull items. Overall its a realy good tower defence game where you sometimes have to fight on more than one frontline at the same time.
1847	1	a	Fun, quirky tower defense game that is simple to pick up, and allows you to defend your castle the way you want to. With all of the DLC(new weapons/traps), you are given a wide array of weapons and traps to set up to help you kill invading orcs. Just take a look around your map, learn the path the orcs are going to be taking to get to your Rift(the 'main base' you're trying to protect, if you will), pick your arsenal for the map, and let it begin! Each Rift will allow only a certain number of orcs to be let through, but let any more than the maximum run through it and it's game over. Campaign lasts a good 7-11 hours depending on how fast you play and how good you become at the game, and then the rest is just playing the game because it is a fun way to pass the time. Recommended for those who enjoy strategical games.
1849	1	a	Is there better way to spend night than slice hordes of orcs? Probably yes, but it wouldnâ€™t be so fun. This is one of games which gave me most fun of all games I played. It has proper mixture of action, fun, creativity and humour. It is not too hard to finish, but same time enough challenging. It has great replayability because offers almost endless possibilities to combine traps and spells to get better score. Game is cheap even at full price, and if you get it on sale as I was it is bargain.
1851	1	a	If you enjoy tower defense, you should dive into this very interactive 3D mass murder, the feeling of having set up a heap of traps to the limit of an unstoppable force, is priceless.
1853	1	a	Tower Defense meets Hack'n Slay Really funny to play and a tip for fans of Sanctum and Dungeon Defenders, traps can be a lot more difficult to choose and place cause each level requires different strategies. But compared to Dungeon Defenders too less possibilities to upgrade stuff and gain new one.
1855	1	a	A truly awesome tower defense style game. Incredibly addictive and can also be a fun party game, hours and hours of fun. The difficulty level actually means something in this game, I would recommend to anyone 95/100 one of the best games in 2011 in my opinion.
1857	1	a	really good action based tower defense games with dark humor and many dead orcs
1859	1	a	Very addictive tower defense game. Easy to play, hard to master. One of the best fun/cost ratio of the year. You must at least try it.
1861	1	a	Highly entertaining at the cost of little time and effort.
1863	1	a	A fun tower-defense/third-person-action game. The story is just a vehicle for funny voice overs and different maps, but the gameplay is great.
1865	1	a	Killing Orcs has never been more satisfying
1867	1	a	Awesome, fun, simple yet strategic. Fast action. Great game!
1869	1	a	an awesome tower defense that has you killing countless orcs in over the top ways you can shoot them burn em melt them crush em how ever you want to do it and the game has humor and personality and its just over the top fun to play this game and its only 15$ as of the time of this review so if your a fan of tower defense games or some one who loves indie games you should give this game a try
1871	1	a	I downloaded the demo on both Steam and XBLA and was so blown away that I jumped at the first sale of the game on Steam and fully intend to get it on XBLA whenever it goes on sale there as well. Definitely one of those 'must own' titles for me.
1873	1	a	this game is a tower defense with some perks too it. dope
1875	1	a	Wacky, wonky and tons of fun. easy to pick up, hard to finish.
1877	1	a	Crazy fun, totally worth it
1879	1	a	Humorous, entertaining and great replayability. A must have for the sequal to unlock the classic levels. (9/10)
1881	1	a	Very Very Fun Game ! ! ! If you are a fan of defence games, action games, or just like dismembering hordes of orcs. This game is for you. Plenty of traps and spells to keep you busy and entertained for hours on end. I love it and can't keep away.  -SirFrontsalot  aka TurboPreston aka Reaper
1883	1	a	Hilarious, fun, wonderful. Worth every penny, action packed and strategic.
1885	1	a	Nice, mindless fun. In the game you play as a war mage that kills orcs. You get cool traps and a few weapons. It's quite satisfying to play too. Only downside is lack of multiplayer, which is present in the second installment - Orcs Must Die! 2. If this game is on sale, I reccoment getting it. Also, getting this game will grant you 10 extra co-op levels in OMD2, however you have to note that both players need this game for them to be playable in the co-op mode.
1887	1	a	I never thought towerdefence and third person mixed well until now
1889	1	a	Great game, lots of fun while killing monsters :)
1891	1	a	This was a very well done action/defence game.   The game has a really nice art stlye and the graphics are nice. I just like the look of the game.  The gameplay Is fluid and well done. The controls are easy to learn. There is a good amount of traps and abilities for you to use on the vast amount of orcs you will be slaying.   Overall the game is fun. I would recommend giving the game a try.
1893	1	a	Fun, inventive tower defense with a wide variety of build paths--not just in terms of the towers and other defensive implements that you deploy, but also the RPG-like paths for upgrading your player character and your ability to participate in the defense first hand. Very satisfying, although the game's 'humor' wears thin almost immediately. Definitely pick this up on a fire sale if you enjoy novel takes on tower defense.
1895	1	a	So much fun! Seriously, no â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ jokes, this is an excellent game that might be one of the most fun out there. Unique weapons, characters and it's also pretty funny.
1897	1	a	Epic first person tower defense fiery crossbow sword wielding flame roasting orc slaying madness. Good Times.
1899	1	a	+ Pretty good fun  - But little bit short  80/100
1901	1	a	This game is very addicting and stessful at times but it is a lot of fun.
1903	1	a	This game is great to play when you want to have a quick fun. Each party does not last more than 20 minutes, so you can play it every now and then.   The gameplay is easy to grasp and the challenge is well balanced so you get the incentive to start over some levels to get all the points.  I'm going for 100% achievements for this game, because it makes me feel like I can do it.  I will do it at my pace, one play at a time, every now and then.  And when I'm done with it, I'll download the sequel to keep the fun going.  That makes for a fun game, that I recommend.
1905	1	a	Tower defensive game with a sense of humour, good fun!
1907	1	a	both strategic and hilarious. great game. I absolutely loved it. Hoping for orcs must die 3
1909	1	a	An addictive 3rd person strategy defense romp. This game throws you into the role of the last warmage defending rift portals against waves of orcs, ogres, goblins and more. The maps make you think carefully about where to place your arsenal of various traps. Traps such as brimstone which scorches the ground or your very own army of elven archers. Some clever cutscenes placed here and there give emphasis on a story, uncommon in this genre. To add to longevity each map has 3 difficulties, leaderboards, and skulls you must earn to improve your traps.  A fantastic game for any fan of action or strategy games!
1911	1	a	If you are looking to have a lot of fun with great humor and no hard thinking, this game is for you! :-)
1913	1	a	A bit repetitive but quite funny. I wasn't expecting much so I was pleasantly surprised. Don't expect any deep strategy here, just lots of lightweight mayhem :-)
1915	1	a	An outstanding take on the tower defense genre. The game offers genuine choice as to how to complete levels, and the variety of levels as well as the decent challenge will keep you drawn in. It takes 8-10 hours to finish the campaign with good scores, and then there's Nightmare mode to contend with. Highly recommended.
1917	1	a	This game is surprisinglly addictive. Far superior to Sanctum in my opinion. This game is definately a sleeper hit of this year.
1919	1	a	Fast paced, arcade-y yet surprisingly deep tactical game play. This is 1 to keep.
1921	1	a	Orcs Must Die has, for me, devolved into a 'Must get and retain high score Vs my friends'.... still gotta get that for the first map...  As a fan of both FPS and TD, I very much enjoy this hybrid. Thanks to Kruel Handlebar for introducing me to this....
1923	1	a	Great Tower defense/strategy game, Great fun killing many orcs!
1925	1	a	A very simple premise of a game - stop a whorde of orcs from making it from one end of a maze to another utilizing a couple of weapons and a variety of 'semi-humorous traps.' The orcs come in a series of waves, and those waves get longer and more difficult until the end of each level. As you complete levels, you gain additional types of traps, and the more you succeed, you gain points to spend to upgrade those traps to make them more powerful.  Overall, this is a very simplistic game... first person shooter meets tower strategy. But, it's kind of addicting, as the traps lend a bit of humor in to the fray, often being used to knock orcs around the maze and off ledges - and a variety of other things that aren't worth spoiling for anyone.  Wait for a good Steam Sales (such as the weekend one presently going on) and add the entire franchise to your collection for less than $10. It's definitely worth that for some nearly-mindless entertainment! And, with a Steam-based leaderboard, you can compete with your friends.
1927	1	a	If you are looking for a Insanely fun and bloody TD/TPS,If you like killing orcs,Then this is the game for you! Orcs must die! 1 has many unique traps,weapons,trinkets and spells which you can experiment or play with,I recommend that you play this before you play the sequel because it has a story to it,If you don't like singleplayer tower defense/third person shooters then go over to the sequel if you like :P I want you to grab you're money and buy the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out of the game because it is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing worth it and i like you to play the game for yourself because i don't want to spoil all the stuff it has :P
1929	1	a	Really an amazing game. Various traps, various abilities, various unlockables, and TONS of replayability. So many levels, difficulties, scores, orcs,... Stop reading this and get it.
1931	1	a	this is a fun game that incolces a lot of mayhen and highjinxes but can also challenge your skill.
1933	1	a	A interactive Tower Defense Game that doesn't have you standing around watching the enemies die to your traps. Countless traps are available, use your sword and bow for direct and ranged combat or use powerful trinkets that give you the ability to control certain elements. Examine your surroundings and build the best death trap possible to hold back the Orcish Horde.  Highly addictive and endless amounts of fun. Well worth the $15.
1935	1	a	This is so ace
1937	1	a	Orcs Must Die! GOTY Edition: BRILLIANT! Quippy one-liners, squishy orcs; what more can you ask for? For the extra Â£3, it's worth getting the GOTY version. It's a 2Gb download, which might take a few hours; but worth it. Graphics: good. Voice acting: Good (the one-liners are quite funny). The game is GOOD! A great defence game. GET IT! 
1939	1	a	Sometimes, I almost feel bad for the Orcs. Except, not really.
1941	1	a	An excellent single player indie game.  Has 3 game modes - warmage, nightmare and high scoring. Played within that order. Once you have completed the game on nightmare you can aim for the highscore tables, but high scores are achieved by getting combo kills, so require entirely different tactics.   The traps are interesting, there are a handful that you will never use and others you will use in some levels. The swinging mace is one of the most deadly traps you can use.  2 DLCs - Lost adventures adds 5 maps, 1 is a map already in the game played in reverse (a very unique map and a very entertaining map, playing in reverse does make it harder). They also added a handful of new monsters, like the frost bat. Well worth getting.   - the second DLC is not as worth while, contains a few new traps and weapons. Accessable from the start of the game as well, which makes the first few levels extremely easy if used.   However, both DLCs are worthing picking up when on offer.
1943	1	a	Now this game I spent hours on my crapy labtop, Just killing the dam orcs all day made my own day.
1945	1	a	its a nice game
1947	1	a	Tower defense meets FPS, really fun.
1949	1	a	Solid twist on the Tower Defense Genre. Good introduction to the series if you get the whole franchise pack. Personally, I prefer the second game because there is significantly more flexibility in your game experience, more weapons, more traps, more levels, and more longevity, but the game is still money well spent. Like killing things with traps and weapons? Check. Like good solid humor? Check Interesting and motivating game soundtrack? Check Like a game that requires strategy and thinking? Check Like mass chaos that puts constant pressure on you? Check Like a overall solid game design concept? Double Check (You will get the partial joke here, if you have ever finished the sequel). Just get the game and play it, and you will understand in less than 5 minutes. Lightning in a bottle.
1951	1	a	It's really fun, definitely worth playing.
1953	1	a	One of the best games I have ever played... No, I'm lying about that, it isn't... But it is a nice idea for a game and hell yeah it's funny. The only thing that is missing - level creator. I would probably have around 200 hours of it right now if it did.
1955	1	a	Extremely fun and addictive. Also a good way to improve your 'thinking outside the box'.
1957	1	a	fun good game... not worth 15 bucks but not so bad for 5-10
1959	1	a	I love this game!  It has lots of levels which will supply you with hours of gameplay.   Every level you get a new spell or trap to use against orcs.  The game has very good graphics and dosn't lag on my $400 computer.  Over all I give it a 10 of 10.
1961	1	a	Perfect casual game. Kick back, relax with your Xbox360 controller and kill some orcs. Whether you decide to build an army of archers and paladins, mine the whole dungeon with spear and arrow traps, become a powerful elemental mage or mix these tactics up - gameplay is always balanced and fair, smooth and fast and addictive.
1963	1	a	Beautiful indie game, if a indie company can make this and charge only 15 dollars, it proves the mass market gaming industry is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up. This game plays smoother, looks better, and is more fun than most of the crap being released today. did i mention its only 15$ compared to what? 60$ for a average game? 9/10 (-1 point cause they say infinite replayability, but thats only cause of a leaderboard, if it had a survival mode it would be 10/10 definately)
1965	1	a	Great tower defence game.
1967	1	a	Tower Defence game that has a significant Third Person action combat. Just to give you a gauge of how much the action combat impacts the game, it usually makes up 1/4 to 1/3 of my kill count. Makes build and wait a thing of the past.
1969	1	a	A fun fast-paced tower defense
1971	1	a	Almost no replayability and a pretty short game, but it was bloody fun.
1973	1	a	Good tower defense game.
1975	1	a	This game is fun and yet suprisingly stratigic compared to what it looks like upon first glance. While I am only partialy through the game, I have to say that this is a must get if it is on sale.
1977	1	a	Very fun! Very cheap!
1979	1	a	Fantastic game. It's like playing a tower defense in first person. Challenging enough but not so difficult you can't master it and 5 skull every level even on Nightmare mode.
1981	1	a	Delightful, dorky, rambunctious fun. It can get frustrating at times when you lose â€“ but naturally thatâ€™s part of the game. I will admit I am disappointed that levels I am doing exceptionally well on seem to be over in a few heartbeats, so thatâ€™s somewhat disappointing. Nonetheless (and particularly when on sale), itâ€™s worth considering.
1983	1	a	Not since Lemmings has a game so seamlessly mixed engaging mechanics, humor, cuteness, and gleeful cruelty.â€ 90/100 â€“ PCGamer   I AGREE!
1985	1	a	Good game if you are into tower defense, fps, bruce campbell and dead orcs.
1987	1	a	Orcs Must Die! offers a unique perspective to the tower defense genere. Build your defenses and fight yoru way through swarms of orcs in this 3rd person behind the shoulder tower defense / beat 'em up hybrid game.
1989	1	a	An enjoyable strategy/action game of a single war mage against an orc army. Quite short, but I enjoyed the challenges and uniqueness that came with it.
1991	1	a	This is a brutal TD, Hack n Slash game that blew my mind. Its so damn badass that you cant even imagine it! I bought it for 5 Euros (MediaMarket) plus all dlcs. It runs well and fast on my kind of old computer and its MUST BUY FOR ALL OF YOU TD, STRADEGY AND Hack n slash FANS  9.5/10
1993	1	a	Not to be confused with 'Goblins Must Die' ' Kobolds Must Die' 'Bugbears Must Die' and 'All Dire-Celestial-Vampiric Chairs Must Be Dismantled' Orcs Must Die is a game where I'm awesome. Yes, I am awesome, thank you for asking. The orcs come at me and they must die because I'm awesome. I also don't want to massage corn so there's that too.  I have spinny-whirly dealies and spikey things and make things go BOOM! to make orcs go deader. Because orcs being alive are not being dead enough. They don't like it when you slice and dice them and shoot them and burn them and crush them and fling them and feed them to ogres and get other people to shoot them or slice them. I suggest lightly steamed with a dip of tar as a good option, or maybe filled with bolts. It's really up to you, who is me in this case, and awesome.
1995	1	a	Nice tower defense,with funny voice acting :-) 7/10
1997	1	a	Excellent game, one of the best trap / tower defense type games i've yet to play.  The graphics are good for what it is, the game runs very smooth and is nice and fast paced. Excellent game, certainly worth looking at.
1999	1	a	This â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is just some GOOD CLEAN FUN. Must play!  Seriously, great game. Guess you could say it's RPG trap defense. Third person shooter, puzzle, whatev. Damn good gameplay. Smooth as a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s â™¥â™¥â™¥. The sequel is even better!  10 / 12
2001	1	a	Loads of fun.
2003	1	a	Great game, highly recommended!
2005	1	a	Hate Orcs? Then this game is for you! A mixture of third person hero control, and tower placement. Hectic and insane, funny and cartoony. Orcs will hate this game.
2007	1	a	great game
2009	1	a	Great game. Must-have tower defense game that incorporates third-person shooter very well. Strategy is very necessary then again so is character control. Sweeet!
2011	1	a	One of the best tower defense games out there. It has a lot of variety and you feel rewarded for progressing through the game.  10/10
2013	1	a	This game is AWESOME. Extremely well-polished singleplayer experience full of humor and fun.  The art, the audio, the gameplay, it's all quite solid and well-executed. The maps are significantly varied in layout (though not so much in art style) and all leave room for different strategies and play styles. The game really starts to open up as you unlock more abilities as you progress through the campaign.  I would highly recommend this game if you enjoy singleplayer, action games, and/or tower defense games. There are some pretty crazy sales for it, but honestly I would still feel like I've gotten my money's worth at full price.  The DLC is definitely worth buying if it's on sale, but maybe hold off if it's full price and you haven't fallen in love with the game yet.
2015	1	a	The mechanics for this game are truly brilliant. Animation, interface, sounds, visuals, balancing of weapons...not a whole lot of thinking for the user, but enough to be satisfying. Kudos to the developers for creating something pleasing to both the thinking man and the non-thinking man, and every man in between.
2017	1	a	The main character looks like a cross between Wreck-It Ralph and Jack Black  10/10
2019	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is a tower defense game that takes the point of view behind the actor to be apart of the mayhem. With the rise in popularity in such games in the console market, Orcs Must Die! is a nice addition that brings some new gameplay mechanics to the genre to keep it fresh. Itâ€™s fierce, fast paced, and thereâ€™s nothing better than killing orcs. Man, orcs are stupid.   http://iamericm.com/2014/04/orcs-must-die-indie-game-review/ 
2021	1	a	Hilarious game pretty much the best part is what the guy is saying. He keeps the mood light so I'm not gnashing my teeth on those hard levels. Buy if you're into FPTower defense things
2023	1	a	Awesome defense plus action game, and amazing soundtrack.
2025	1	a	Probably the most addicting game I have ever played, up there with Star Ocean 2. It's a combination tower defense/3rd person shooter, in which you kill thousands and thousands of Orcs, along with Ogres, Kobolds, Hellbats, etc. Best of all it's extremely cheap, and will give you countless hours of entertainment!
2027	1	a	This game is surprisingly fun.
2029	1	a	this game is like a tower defence on crack, its exstremely fast paced wilst most other TD allow you to take your time and think things out, this one gives you a chance to think out at the beginning but as soon as you start it you gotta run around and spend your points on the fly and it can make you panic at times, which is alot of fun at times
2031	1	a	It's a fairly simple game with a fairly simple concept, but it's fun as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. You play as a mage killing orcs in numerous tower defense styled maps, that's it. I give this game a 3/5.
2033	1	a	This is such a great tower defense game. The only thing that is missing is multiplayer, it's well worth the price if you like tower defense / 3rd person defense.
2035	1	a	[]V[]ega-worth getting. Fun, challenging, quick, and easy to play. Challenge yourself and compare to me!!! Buy this game!
2037	1	a	this game it the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ its a must buy
2039	1	a	Hordes of Orcs and unlimited traps
2041	1	a	One of the most fun defense games out
2043	1	a	Slaughter at it's best!
2045	1	a	This game is epic! It's so much fun! :) Totally recommended!
2047	1	a	this game is so much fun.
2049	1	a	Leave those poor orcs alone damn it !
2051	1	a	Best Tower Defence game ever
2053	1	a	Very fun take on the castle defense genre. Fans of Dungeon Defender will likely find this to be a must-play.
2055	1	a	great game, challenging, but not impossible :)
2057	1	a	An awesome take on the tower defense genre, and challenging to boot. The graphics are decent, the gameplay is solid, and the traps are fun.
2059	1	a	Very fun and entertaining game! I will definitely buy OMD 2!
2061	1	a	I was hesitant about this game as I find 3rd person views to be very console'ish but was pleasantly surprised. The PC controls are solid and the traps are very satisfying. I wish the levels were longer or you started with more money because it seems like just as you get a really good chain of traps setup then the level is over. That's a minor complaint--overall the game is great.
2063	1	a	Funny game Must buy on sale
2065	1	a	Great tower defense game with lots of action.
2067	1	a	Its a cool game my friend gave it for my bd :D 
2069	1	a	Funny, nice visuals and satisfying combat and trap setting.
2071	1	a	Awesome game for any and all pc gamers.
2073	1	a	
2075	1	a	Very fun game, with a nice sense of humor and a good amount of challenge. Very reccomendable.
2077	1	a	good and fun game. * * * *
2079	1	a	A very amusing and well conceived strategy defense game. Definitely ranks highly on satisfaction. Nothing better than killing thousands and thousands of orcs in very non-repetitive scenarios.
2081	1	a	All kinds of fun - good strategy game with a big leap in dificulty and a nice sprinkle of humor.  Easliy the best Â£2.99 I ever spent.
2083	1	a	This game is so much fun!!! I highly recommend for some Orc pwnage!
2085	1	a	Surprisingly fun and addictive!
2087	1	a	Seriously the BEST TOWER DEFENCE game out there. A whole lot of fun.
2089	1	a	This is a brilliant core defence/tower defence mixed with action combat. With the well thought out ability to upgrade perks within the levels, high customisation of object placement and damaging objects already built into the maps ready for you to trigger; this is a must have title for any core defence lovers.  The only downside I have found so far is the inability to foresee what is coming on the next wave so you can plan accordingly.
2091	1	a	What a fantastic game. I really love it. Fast paced action combined with some strategic thinking, a healthy dose of Bruce 'Ash' Cambell style humour. Devilish traps and some well thought out weapons. This game has also really has made me laugh a lot. A very enjoyable and polished game that you can have a quick game of or spend hours playing. So much fun to be had and lots of replay value.
2093	1	a	i got this for 3â‚¬ and spend 40 hours of tactical orc slashing, optimizing my trap arrangement. it's fun, buy it. if you like tower defense, this is what you want.
2095	1	a	Great game, bizzaro but awesome mix of FPS and tower defense, definitely worth the sale price!
2097	1	a	A nice tower defence game that makes you scream ORCS MUST DIE!!!!
2099	1	a	This is a fun, action-oriented tower defense game with crisp graphics and good action. I recommend this to anyone.
2101	1	a	I bought this for the Steam Holiday Sale to do the achievement, and found that it was very fun to play. If you're looking for something a little less intenstive than Dungeon Defenders, this is your game.
2103	1	a	I loved this game. Just loved it, can't wait to play the sequal.
2105	1	a	Good game, would recommend!
2107	1	a	very addicting!
2109	1	a	It is very fun. You can hear the Orcs say 'It's my last day before retirement' and than give him a headshot. But if you have (hopefully) friends that play video games i highly recommend you Orcs Must Die! 2, because this is a lot more fun in co-op!
2111	1	a	Had more fun playing this than I've had gaming in some time.  It's fast paced, creative and very funny.  And lets face it, who doesn't like killing orcs with everything from floor spikes to tipping them into acid...
2113	1	a	Better as OMD 2. worth a price.
2115	1	a	OMD1 and OMD2 are great games!   Generally i don't like 3rd person games but have for this series to be a ton of fun.  OMD2 is better of cause with more options, traps and maps.  Good replayablity as i keep coming back for weekly bashes and always keen to try differant trap combos.   Can't think of and negitives, but a first person view would be a nice touch. maybe something for OMD3 Ha!  Highly recomend! 
2117	1	a	Strategy and killing orcs, what more can you ask for?
2119	1	a	This game is very, very entertaining, the objective of the game is to kill orcs, gnolls, kobolds and ogres before they reach the end of the level. We could say this is a light game as is easy to win, however, for getting the perfect mark is another history. Is a strategy game as you can choose which traps, spells and special guardians to use for each level and you can upgrade them as you got better marks in each level. However, if you play in the nightmare mode, the strategy gives places to your skills as everything will change and will be very challenging to finish the game, and worse if you try to get a perfect mark in each level.  More is not enough to say, the game is very addictive, sarcastic history, and probably will be enjoyed by everyone. Thought is a good idea to get all the DLC in one single bundle as will help you. 
2121	1	a	wow what a good game
2123	1	a	Very fun tower defense / action mix! Even for people less enthusiastic about the genre. Very satisfying trap effects, simple but good graphics. Trap diversity ir rarely used though. You can use alot, but often a concentration of 2-3 are the best.
2125	1	a	BOSS this game is BOSS. 
2127	1	a	Great game that offers a lot of fun for a price you wouldn't expect it!  ... and killing Orcs never gets boring!
2129	1	a	Pretty Bad â™¥â™¥â™¥
2131	1	a	I don't know why orcs have to die :'( . It makes me sad...
2133	1	a	Low price but hours of fun. Great game! 3D tower defense category with lot of very original traps and action!
2135	1	a	Amazing!! I played this on my friends PC and bought it without a single thought!! lol
2137	1	a	It's like lemmings, except instead of babying them along you kill them in a creative way. Oh it's tower defense too.
2139	1	a	Kill Orcs NOAW!!!!!!!!  Lovely game if you like some melee/range combat fused with traps. It's a bit of a tower defense if you ask me.
2141	1	a	This is a fun game but it's definitely quirky.  + Interesting level design + Configurable upgrades with Weavers  - Some levels way too open with too few options to build defenses - You can't refund skulls; so you anticipation/guessing plays into unlocking items - You can't redefine keys (defaults to WASD) which is ... short-sighted - No option to create your own maps 
2143	1	a	This is the kind of game that you can find yourself losing hours to because it is just so much fun to watch the carnage! A great combination of FPS and tower defense strategy, with a sense of humor that is rare in most games. From the first voice-over, it doesn't take itself too seriously and rather enjoys the absurd action for what it is. 
2145	1	a	Approved!
2147	1	a	If you like Tower defense games, this is worth the $15!! Quoting one of the Orcs 'I'm just a day away from retiring!' LOL!
2149	1	a	
2151	1	a	its a medevil game and also a magical game Its preaty awsome and is a survival sort of game i recommend the game 10/9.6
2153	1	a	The most fun i've had playing a game in ages. Great for pick-up-and-play after a long day by just chunking orcs to bits, but the nightmare mode and leaderboard rankings actually require a lot of strategy and forethought. Have played it for countless hours (well, ok... 33 in two weeks) and have gotten 5 skulls on every level on NIGHTMARE... and that this is from a guy who can't even be bothered togo back and finish the last level in MGS4 because it would require fiddling around behind the TV to plug it in which should tell you all about how addictive and enjoyable it is.
2155	1	a	Very fun mix of combat and tower defence, very funny humor, and challenging. Great game aside from not having multiplayer (the 2nd one will).
2157	1	a	So much fun. Wish I could have more orcs and more money.
2159	1	a	Orcs + Traps = Bloody Fun
2161	1	a	Great game
2163	1	a	Tons of Orcs, tons of fun, plays like dream â€” get this one!
2165	1	a	Fun but very challenging, or maybe I'm just bad at it.
2167	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is a real gem of an indie game. It offers a creative take on the tower defense genre with plenty of options to approach each challenge. The mixture of strategy and action game elements coupled with tight controls flow together very well, leaving you with one very satisfying experience. The game also has a good sense of dark humor that, while it may get repetitive at some points, has yet to come across as annoying.  All in all, I highly recommend this game. If you love the tower defense genre you shouldn't think twice about getting it. The game offers a great experience that is well worth the price and is still fun to play again and again.
2169	1	a	It you like tower defence action games, you have to play this one!
2171	1	a	Great fun and easily worth 14â‚¬ . Easy to play and just the right amount of challenge.
2173	1	a	Kind of a Tower Defense game. Except you use traps, and you attack yourself too. Running around, shooting, stabbing, and exploding stuff.  It is a ton of fun, a crap ton of unique levels. At least try the demo!  WARNING: EXTREMELY FRIGGN ADDICTING
2175	1	a	kinda like Lord of the Rings 
2177	1	a	This game is seriously addictive and very fun. If you enjoy tower defense games and always wished you could be down there to get that damn last straggler, this is your game. Tons of replay value, and quite funny to boot. Make sure you get the artifacts of power DLC though, that stuff is great!
2179	1	a	+ Great story ! + Awesome art and characters ! + Great weapons and traps ! + hours of story  + The only tower of defence game i like &lt; trust me thats an achivement !  ------- IF YOU GRAB THIS BE SURE TO GET GOTY OR ALL DLC --------- without them its just a little less fun but all those are worth your money !
2181	1	a	Fun, but has DLC...so I'd give it 6/10
2183	1	a	If killing orcs is wrong I don't want to be right.
2185	1	a	Murdering thousand of stupid orcs with gory traps? What's not to love?
2187	1	a	Yo dawg I heard you like killin' orcs so we put some traps in your fortress so you can kill orcs while you kill orcs.
2189	1	a	Orcs Must Die is an incredibly fun, fast paced tower defense game with emphasis on action. You play a War Mage just out of his apprentice training, who must stop orcs from reaching the rifts into your world.  With your old master dead, a cocky attitude, and not the greatest intelligence your kind has ever seen. The world is surely doomed.
2191	1	a	A masterpiece, must have !
2193	1	a	This game's a cult hit, and it deserves to be. Vibrant graphics (though you're indoors all the time), great humor, great gameplay (exactly what you expect) and enough of a challenge for anyone.
2195	1	a	What a great twist on the tower defense genre. This game will have you killin orcs for hours
2197	1	a	I didn't exspect this game to be this good boy was i wrong! Buy this game now ,trust me on this one
2199	1	a	love the game
2201	1	a	pretty good.
2203	1	a	If you can pick this up cheap, its worth a weekend of fun. 3rd person shooter with Tower Defense style gameplay. Set traps and use them to stop the horde from comming through.
2205	1	a	Extremely fun and well polished game. Must have for any Tower Defence player who also enjoys being in the thick of the action.
2207	1	a	I, for one, do not condone the genocide of these orcian refugees, but these radical orc terrorists keep trying to cross into our land! We can't have that, now can we?
2209	1	a	This is my new personal favorite amongst all 3rd-person tower defense games!!! Great fun, but unfortunately only singleplayer.
2211	1	a	A great time consumer! Poor Orcs... Not! :) +like this game
2213	1	a	Too hard. Have to be MLG like me to have any fun whatsoever.
2215	1	a	Forget the later OMD games, this is the one you want.
2217	1	a	If you watch the trailer you know what you are getting. Cartoonish entertainment and high speed action. If you like the trailer, you`ll like the game. At least I did
2219	1	a	FANTASTIC, simple, tower defense game. Upgrading your tools/traps leads you to replay levels and dominate the levels more efficiently to get better ratings for more upgrades. It's an addicting formula with a great sense of humor mixed with gratuitous violence. If only there were more levels out there..
2221	1	a	when you like RPG titles,you must buy this game 10/10(i never see game like this)
2223	1	a	really addicting tower defense game and can really get u thinking
2225	1	a	BLANK TIME KILLER.
2227	1	a	Watch 'em dyin'
2229	1	a	This is without a doubt the best tower defense game I've played. Lots of fun, and the one liners add a lot of humour.
2231	1	a	While I admit this game is quite fun, it's just not as enjoyable as it would be if it had multiplayer. Worth it? If you don't mind doing everything by your lonesome.
2233	1	a	Great Indie Tower Def game. Havent had this much fun and laughed at game in a long time!
2235	1	a	You can kill Orcs, IGN 9/10
2237	1	a	An absolute gem! Tower defence mixed with 3rd person shooter and rpg elements. The game is also hilarious, seemless, and the mechanics are fluid and easy to grasp, yet hard to master. There is more than one way to pass each level.   A friend bought me this game as a joke when it was on sale, and it ended up taking over our lives for a few months! Think about how much fun your $10 will buy you at a movie theater or a coffee shop... I guarantee this game will give you way more fun for less money.
2239	1	a	This game is fun and awesome.
2241	1	a	Funny, and fill the time, when i need some crazy destruction
2243	1	a	Traps, fast thinking, lot of fun, good humor. It's a must have in your library. Get it when it's on special at worst you won't regret it.
2245	1	a	Just some pure, unadulterated fun. One of those games where you say you'll do one level then it turns out to be three hours later. It's tons of fun and the fact that you unlock a new trap or ability after every level just makes it that much better. Only gripe might be that I can't seem to be able to control my computer's volume while in game. But it is still loads of fun.
2247	1	a	Who wants to have fun killing orcs? Everyone, that's who. Few things are more satisfying that setting up deadly traps and watching orcs be violently ripped apart, sliced and crushed with wonderful cartoony blood and guts splattering everywhere. And who doesn't love cartoon gore? No one, that's who. I'm not really into the tower defense genre myself, but this game is not one to pass up. Fast paced action and dasterdly traps await you. It's also the first game that allowed me the pleasure of hearing a ten year old girl cackle madly after filling her spellbook with nasty traps and proclaim, 'It's so easy to be evil!'  Yes it is, small female human. Yes it is.
2249	1	a	A ton of fun and so much satisfaction after a Victory! Not very difficult. The hardest Wave is mostly the first. But still challenging with a Nightmare Mode I haven't tested yet.
2251	1	a	1 time i played i could not stop its like abc mouse if you have seen the comercials they say there child just can not stop and i can not stop so its a great game in all i just got a regular computer and its smoother than jazz.I love this game!!!!!!!  :) :)
2253	1	a	Awesome and fun game! Killing orcs is simply amazing!
2255	1	a	bought on sell for 1$, best deal ever. great fun for a 1$
2257	1	a	If you're after a fun casual challenging but not serious game this is for you! Writing this review I'm only 3hrs into it and love it I definitely recommend this game purely just off how fun it is.   8/10
2259	1	a	extra fun with controller
2261	1	a	Killing orcs. What's not to like?
2263	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
2265	1	a	Serious fun! Fantasy genre meets Plants vs. Zombies. Lay traps to destroy orcs! Fight orcs! Smash! I can't believe I got this game on sale for so cheap! Fast paced good times!
2267	1	a	Great game - exactly what I had hoped Dungeon Defeneders would be. Just the right weight of game for me - not too heavy/long, but not so light/simple that it isn't fun.
2269	1	a	'I could do this all day!' says the hero and it's true!
2271	1	a	So addictive!!!!
2273	1	a	Buy this, for ze Toxo recommends slaying of orcs with traps and spells.
2275	1	a	This is awesome! Only thing it is lacking, whish is a major thing.. is cooperative gameplay!
2277	1	a	These orcs must die, will you aid us?
2279	1	a	Fun game if you have nothing to do, haven't touched in a while though ^_^
2281	1	a	Fun, clever, and just the right amount of arcady. I hope they make more like it.
2283	1	a	This game is much more fun than it has any right to be. It's a blend of the Tower Defense and First Person Shooter genres, it's extremely frenetic, and the main character is an entertainingly over-the-top â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. If you're not sure about it, grab it when it's on sale; it's a pretty minor investment for a solid game.
2285	1	a	4 out of 5... cool traps, decent different types of enemys. NOT MANY LEVELS... you can get many more from dlc I think u should try this game
2287	1	a	Tower defense game mixed with first person shooter. Funny comments in game. Plays really well. Three difficulty levels provide great challenge.  [my ranking: 6.5/10]
2289	1	a	Nice change up from the Tower Defense genre with the added fun of an FPS! I've spent plenty of hours on this already.
2291	1	a	+nice graphics &amp; art style +well optimised and constant frame rate +simple game premise well executed +cheap +can fling orcs onto spears to impale them +replay value - trying different tactics   -repetitive
2293	1	a	Very fun game with a good variety of towers to choose from.
2295	1	a	Fun game, tower defense w/FPS twist. I wish it was multiplayer though. Still worth it.
2297	1	a	What a refreshing taste of Castle Defence. If you are a Castle Defence fan, this will be an amazing experience. 5/5 for sure.
2299	1	a	Simple gameplay but very enjoyable and replayable.
2301	1	a	Not a good port, seems better suited to xbox arcade or something. Still liked it however. Get it cheap.
2303	1	a	Very good and fun 3rd person tower defense game. I love it.
2305	1	a	It's a good game if you like to place traps and have several options to win.
2307	1	a	I've never killed so many orcs in my life!
2309	1	a	An educational game for the entire family.
2311	1	a	no one get this game
2313	1	a	
2315	1	a	Amazing Bruce Campbell-esk main character? Check. Mindblowing trap combinations? Double check. Lots of Orcs? Like you have to ask...
2317	1	a	This game is surprisingly clever, and a fantastic tower defense game.
2319	1	a	Funny as all living hell.
2321	1	a	It\'s hard but fun.
2323	1	a	Great game. Has enough trap/weapons to make replaying levels interesting by trying different strategies each time. Character dialog is funny.
2325	1	a	This game is vomiting painful but enjoyable
2327	1	a	Achievement Hunter Review: An incredibly fun tower defense/third-person hybrid. Took me around 20 hours to 100% as the first game of its style that I've played.
2329	1	a	If you don't like this game, you do not like having fun. Get it, it's worth every penny. The DLC is pretty good too.
2331	1	a	Tower defence in a nutshell. You protect a portal from invading orcs that come via air or ground. You have several traps at defending this portal at your disposal. As you progress in the game you can upgrade these traps and gain access to more. As the hero, you are capable of assisting the traps with a crossbow, a sword, or magic which can also be upgraded as you progress.
2333	1	a	My all time favorite tower defense type game. The price is too cheap for it's worth. Love the style and the humor in the game. The only flaw that I can find on this game, there's no Co-Op.
2335	1	a	ÐšÐ»Ð°ÑÑÐ½Ð°Ñ Ð¸Ð³Ñ€ÑƒÑ…Ð°.   Awesome tower defense game. Strict but fun balance. Lots of traps weapons and spells. Highly recommend it.
2337	1	a	so whats the point of this game you ask? duh. kill everything the combat? you just shoot and slice EVERYTHING you see thats soon-to-not-be-alive! the traps. omg the traps are sssssssssoooooooooo AWESOME at killing stuff!   ...but...   the story (sigh) the story in ssssssssssssooooooooo awful but this is still a great game so 9/10
2339	1	a	Surprisingly funny game. You're a young battlemage, who uses his crossbow and tons of traps, to hold back incomming waves of orcs. Though it sounds like a standard Tower-Denfese game, it personally reminded me of Dungeon Keeper 2. I approve!
2341	1	a	This game ts like Dungeon Defenders but i kinda consider this game much better since you have the ability to place traps pretty much anywhere (ceiling, walls, and floors).   What this game dosent have though is co-op and can make the game quite boring after awhile of playing it...still fun though...  you also can't remap the controls for this game  ---My Rating--- 7.3/10
2343	1	a	If you are debating whether to get the 1st or 2nd game, get the 2nd or the 2nd and the 1st. If you get both (get them on sale and it'll only be around $4 total), you get extra levels and DLC.   Also be warned that the first game has super high mouse sensitivity, so if you don't have a very small mousepad or super slow mouse DPI, get the 2nd game.
2345	1	a	OMG, best game ever you will like it so much, just buy the game you will not regret buying this game
2347	1	a	Pretty much a 3d version of those 2d flash games where you upgrade and progress through endless waves of killing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. It also has some strategic challenges, so its fun to play on a rainy day
2349	1	a	Fun little game. Easy to pick up and just play. Snag it if its on sale.
2351	1	a	Fun new take on TD games.
2353	1	a	An utterly fun game, Orcs Must Die! combines FPS with placing down traps. Probably not a new idea, but that doesn't in any way, shape, or form detract from the enjoyability, so let's get into some pros and cons.  Pros -It has some story elements (a big thing with me). This game could have gone without story altogether and still been fun, but the developers decided to spice it up! I mean, sure it's a pretty basic story, but, considering the game genre, I'll consider it a pro. -Responsive and intuitive controls that are easy to learn and get the hang of. -Normal (Warmage) difficulty getting boring? Try Nightmare difficulty for the challenge you crave. -Great music and graphics. -Great replayability across most levels (I say most because the first level, even on Nightmare, will get easy pretty quick). -Funny commentary from the characters. -DLC adds new weapons, traps, and levels.  Cons -No multiplayer. If you're not into that then this point is moot. -Only one character and set of weapons/traps. -DLC costs money. Might be a con to some. I wasn't personally bothered by it, but, then again, I probably got it on sale 'cause I'm cheap like that.  So, yeah, that's all I got. So go get it. It's worth its full price, but if you want to get it on sale, that's understandable. Anyways, it's a great game I would recommend to just about everyone.
2355	1	a	Got this game in the sale, would have been worth it full price though.   Simple and fun.
2357	1	a	Best tower defense-style game ever. Still holds true to this day.
2359	1	a	fun tower defence game
2361	1	a	This is where it all started, Orcs fighting rpg tower defence type of story yaq know.
2363	1	a	A hidden gem on Steam. Definitely worth the 4 bucks I paid to play it.
2365	1	a	Still one of the best 'tower defense' out there. Solid gameplay with equal hilarity to match. I highly recommend giving this game a shot :)
2367	1	a	I am having a blast. planning and shooting required, fun granted
2369	1	a	Very orc
2371	1	a	ORCS ARE HUGE, THAT MEANS THEY HAVE HUGE GUTS! SPIKES AND TAR, SPIKES AND TAR!
2373	1	a	Easily the best 15 bucks I've ever spent :)
2375	1	a	This game is not a casual game. OMD is deceptively challenging and ramps in difficulty pretty quickly in only a few levels; it's nothing rage inducing unless you are a perfectionist seeking a perfect skull score on each level (compare it to getting full stars in Angry Birds).   At it's core it's an ultra-competitive score attack arcade game and is best played as a marathon rather than in short bursts as you'll have time to warm up and eventually play at your best.   Pros: - Smooth gameplay - No spoonfeeding - Great balance between budgetting, planning, setting up traps and commencing the action - Replay value  Cons: The game has a number of annoyances but nothing worthy of including in this review. Simply put they could have tweaked certain things a bit more for my taste.  Note: If you don't have a strong fan for your PC be wary of overheating.
2377	1	a	dumbass war mage+orcs+traps+magick crossbow+magick sword+more rediculous traps=â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥tons of dead orcs  but seriously this game is awesome, its a hero defense game, stop orcs getting from a to b using traps soldiers or slaughter them yourself, i had lots of fun playing it
2379	1	a	Very entertaining. You can lose several hours easily with this games.  As a mix of TPS, tower defense (but with traps) and strategy its a game where you have to think a bit which traps are best and where is the best place to use it.  If your not a tower defense player this game might get a bit boring after a few lvls.  But overall its a very nice game.
2381	1	a	This was a really great game; dynamic gameplay, somewhat developed characters, and a variety of mobs to slice and dice. The traps are good, but I definitly fell into a pattern of which to use/which were the most useful. Definitly good, pick it up!
2383	1	a	The Orcs jut nedz moar dakka WWWAAARRRGGG!!!!
2385	1	a	My pick for Orc murder simulator GotY. Smooth, polished, and tons of fun.
2387	1	a	Really enjoyed this game, even more than it's sequel.
2389	1	a	uhh you kill orcs... funny ways... do it..... buy it.... now....  I am hobo and I approve this message
2391	1	a	This game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing awesome. No, really. Try the demo. Awesome tower defense gameplay coupled with great hack 'n' slash, burn 'n' bash combat.  If you think the demo is awesome, wait until you hear this: a little less than one third of the way into the campaign, you unlock the Weavers, performance enhancing mages who let you choose a tree of enhancements: your weapons, or your traps (this includes guardians and soldiers). Personally I'm a fan of the combat enhancements. With the double ended bladestaff, and all the melee enhancements, you'lll tear through the orc hordes like a hurricane of blood.   I've tried the Trap tree, but because both traps and the perks cost money, where as with the combat you only have to pay for the perks, I find that the trap tree often takes longer to upgrade, and even with the perks you'll often still have to depend on weapons a fair amount.  All in all, this game kicks â™¥â™¥â™¥. Buy it.
2393	1	a	Great mix of action and tower defense! Music is awesome and it's just plain hilarious!
2395	1	a	Do you like killing orcs? what about gnolls, ogres and kobolds? what about using traps to cut them, pinch, burn, slice, throw, and crush them, all that sprinkled with some magic spells; kill orcs, be creative doing it, have fun.
2397	1	a	It's like a tower defense, but you play it as a third person game. You still build up various types of defensive mechanisms that help you prevent the enemy from getting to your base. It feels fresh and innovative, while not consuming too much of your time if you don't want it to. Good for a simple time passer or playing for a long time.
2399	1	a	Fantastic Gameplay with great tactical elements, a tower defense masterpiece without the towers, where the sole objective is to use the myrid arsenal of traps and weapons to stop waves of half brained, one liner spouting Orcs.  
2401	1	a	I rate the game 9 out of 10, 10 if there was a multiplayer option. Must buy!
2403	1	a	Orcs Must Die!, another game I got AFTER the 2nd in the series.  Guess what?  I'm doing it wrong.  But anyway, great story with amazing voice acting, especially the effects of the sorceresse's voice. Another Gr8 r8 8/8 m8. Thx! :D
2405	1	a	This game is great!!!
2407	1	a	Robot Entertainment have produced a slick action game here based around the popular tower defence genre. This game follows the traditional tower defence script of building traps to stop a constant stream of enemy foe but introduces player spells and weapons to assist. Far from becoming confused the game merges the 2 styles effortlessly, there are occasions when building an intricate series of diversions and traps is the order of the day and other times when equipping your poking stick and some fire gauntlets is required to smite the raging hordes. The game follows a steady learning curve, those new to tower defense games will be handheld throughout the first stages and with the game introducing new skills and abilities as you go along you will never feel overwhelmed at the pace. The games real charm rests in the war mage himself, the character story is developed via cut scenes between levels, he's equipped with a few witty one liners that he will dole out at various times and you cant help but like the guy! The graphics are good, the music is solid and atmospheric . Some people will play through it once but with the introduction of the 'skull ranking' system many will replay the levels in order to 5 skull them. In this game skulls mean upgrades and upgrades means more dead orcs! ... This game takes its place as one of the best tower defence games available today. With the announcement of a sequel on the way things are looking good for Robot Entertainment.
2409	1	a	Overhead Mech Twin Stick Shooter with gorgeous graphics, bullet hell inspiration, coop and plenty of content. Leaderboards, 3 difficulty levels, cloud saves via Origin through Steam o_0 and an ace presentation. Picked this up in the EA 'indie' bundle and this one shooter is just about worth the cost of the whole bundle.
2411	1	a	A solid isometric action game of the mech kind that's challenging and fun enough to demand a sequel. There's a 25 level campaign with three difficulties, and a three map arena challenge with three difficulties. There's also mech upgrades, aesthetic upgrades and pets. It's over five years old, and with all the isometric garbage out nowadays, I petition for The Butler to return!
2413	1	a	A solid twin-stick shooter set in a mech/steampunk world. You can upgrade your vehicle's weapons and armor, and even get a cool pet to follow you on your dangerous exploits.
2415	1	a	Gatling gears is an oldie. but goldie. i have to be honest they just dont make games this good anymore. you remember the days when there was a big buzz about games. and massive interest not just by gamers but by the guys making the games. and the way they was describes in demo mags. they use to love showing off what they done. showing you how much better there games had got and giving you demos etc so you could see for yourself how good it was. those days was golden. its just not the same anymore.   i definatley recommend this game. its an arcade shooter platformy type. you run around in what they called a walker back then. and you can modify it build it up improve it get better weapons and even change the way the walker looks.  its just one of those games that got a lot of love and attension. and its so easy to see. as soon as you pick up the controller the movements feel great, everything is very well put together. its also a really nice looking game. with nice lighting and shadows and sun glare. black smoke effects that look great. nice explosiojns. and so much more to enjoy.   i promise you this is a game you wont regret buying and its so good value now. a must buy ive loved this game for years. its kinda special. and big.
2417	1	a	I received this game as a gift and after playing it for a while I'll have to buy my friend a drink, tap him on his back and forgive him his foolishnes.
2419	1	a	Major fun especially on a HDTV with a controller. The game is so fun and the graphics are quite good for a game of this price. I'd definitely recommend this game. I'd like to see a sequel.
2421	1	a	A non auto scrolling shoot em up, you can upgrade your walker and the overall artstyle is just wonderful!   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFxigQPjygk 
2423	1	a	 https://youtu.be/OsnaGt0NXbA   Fire up your engines and tighten your twin sticks for 'Gatling Gears'. Overall a very solid game with minor flaws of aggressive forced scrolling and a little sluggish turning on your character.
2425	1	a	I really love this game.First hours in and I am in love with the game.The graphics are just okay-ish. The campaign has a decent story, overall this game is almost worth your money.
2427	1	a	Great top-down shooter....cool graphics....xbox 360 controller works great also...best of all it is 9.99....8/10
2429	1	a	Great graphics, great gameplay, balance, controls and amazing soundtrack. This is definitely one of the best schmups ever made. They really need to make Gattling Gears 2 soon!   5 Stars!
2431	1	a	fan game ant goot game ant 9/10
125	0	a	For me, this Shoot'em Up lacks of that 'chaotic' feeling of the genre. Is a little slow for my taste and poor on the variation of the situations so is very probably to fall on monotony. Have some customization for your ship and challenges to take on but nothing special to recomend it.  Requires EA activation.
126	0	a	Its good fun, and not too hard. The only problem I have is the game getting stuck at a point (for me, the end of the first level on Katharsis) with no way to progress. It seems to be common and it's quite frustrating.
2433	1	a	
2435	1	a	A decent, but safe and familiar, twin stick shooter that takes a little while to get interesting. The later levels are more fun and provide enough of a challenge to entertain me.  6.5/10
2437	1	a	Very nice co-op. Was a bit shame that it was only for 2-players but still... funny game. Maybe wouldn''t play singe player though.
2439	1	a	Judging by its cover, one wouldn't immediately assume Gatling Gears to be a bullet hell shooter. Features familiar to this genre include dodging insane amounts of enemies and projectiles mid-combat as the camera forcefully pans horizontally or vertically.   Gatling Gears mixes the formula up by letting the player drive a ground-based machine. This not only heightens the player's maneuverability, but it also allows him to control the pace of the camera - a nice addition that aids the less hardcore audience.  For combat, there are a total of four different weapons at the player's disposal, three of which are upgradeable by collecting gold scattered through the levels. Using them skillfully is pivotal to maintaining a high multiplier which will boost your ranks in the leaderboards and unlock aesthetics.  In terms of a bullet hell shooter, Gatling Gears is arguably the most beautiful. However, it is neither the most challenging nor the most memorable. It's also pretty repetitive.  Grade: C
2441	1	a	Fun little twin stick shooter. Campaign is about 5 hrs long. It's enjoyable if you have time to burn.
2443	1	a	Excellent co-op experience. Ranks up there with Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light.
2445	1	a	If Gatling Gears didn't require the absurd Origin login and require an internet connection every time you try to boot up the singleplayer game, I would probably more highly recommend this game. It's a hell of a lot of fun if you're a fan of any modern twin stick shooter and it really challenges you early on. If you can look past the terrible DRM, you'll have a lot of fun with this one.
2447	1	a	Nothing will give you the shooting satisfaction of this game. The graphics are beutiful. Lots of explotions and different weapons.
2449	1	a	Reminds me of polished Amiga titles like Chaos Engine and Disposable Heroes. Noisy 3D shoot-em-up that gets quite difficult but challenges in a good way, best played with twin analog stick controller.
2451	1	a	Very good, polished and dissestressing
2453	1	a	Shank 2 its very good game, like shadows dancer, metal slug, final fight or other retro games but with more best graphics design,best game play.... very good time..so cool...so fun..
2455	1	a	Shank 2 is a cheap game in every way, its hard, and occasionaly unfair. Its hard for me to recommend it. But still, I cant be unfair just because I've lost my nerves playing it. When you make it work it offers decent fun, interesting cartoon-network-like design, and some nice music.  Before you start, however, you better be playing this on the controller. Don't you even dare to play this on the mouse and keyboard, because you'll be cursing the day when you were born. I had to because my controller was working in one part of the day, and stopped in another (I dont have problems with other games). With the mouse and keyboard you are controlling your movement on the keyboard (also throwing grenades/molotovs/knives), and attacking with the mouse. The problem is that your character is following mouse cursor, so he attacks and shoots in the way where the pointer is, and if you don't pay attention you will swing/shoot/throw grenade in the wrong direction.  Another problem with controlls is that they are going nuts in co-op mode after you call-in menu window on 'esc' and close it, or Steam overlay on 'shift+tab'. Your character is dodging instead of moving (or even completelly stopping), using heavy instead of light attacks,... The only way to fix this is to press 'esc' again and then close menu window.  Boss battles are epic, especially the last two, that is - if you know how to dance... Just as with all other bosses in the game early fight is relatively easy. When their health comes near the first half you are getting an opportunity to perform some special attack that trigers a cutscene. Afterwards 5#!t hits the fan; since they are considerably larger than your character you can be damn sure they are going to exploit that in every possible way: they are going to grab you and squeeze like a lemon, throw you around like a rock, burn you, slice you in pieces, call their minions to help them, and generaly just make your life as miserable as they can.  By accomplishing certain tasks in the game you will unlock other characters with their own bonuses, and you can also use them in the co-op survival mode. You can play it alone or with the friend, and you have to survive 30 waves of enemies. With their elimination you are getting gold which you can spend in the shop (items are unlocking progressively), on healing, decoys, turrets, all of those will come in handy vs bosses (and zombies too).  I also have to say that playing hard mode of this game (no checkpoints in levels, once you die you have to start all over again) reminded me on the past when I have played, as a kid, NES games and throwed my controllers in anger....    
2457	1	a	The campaign is fun, but the real beautiful core of this game is in the survival mode, which is one of the most delightful co-op experiences I've ever had. It's tough but fair. Get a co-op partner and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ some mooks up
2459	1	a	Pros  * Great gameplay, tight controls. * Tons of enemy and weapon variety. * Really satisfying combat, very meaty, natural and robust. * Really hard, start in normal difficulty.  Cons  * Checkpoints are few and far between, it's very frustrating to have to replay the last 20 minutes because you died near the end of the level. Sometimes the only checkpoint in a level is just before you get to the boss. * The game is cruel, if you die it gimps you by removing two ammo from your explosive weapons (you have three in total). It sucks because it often means you have to kill the boss without the often much needed help from grenades/mines/molotov, especially in hard mode.
2461	1	a	Such a fantastic and affordable game. Great story lines with over the top action and mayhem! Harkens to the games on my yesteryears (I'm 40!) when you knew an epic boss battle was just around the corner! I discovered this game first and must go back to pay the original Shank. I can't wait! Full controller support is a bonus too. Highly recommended!
2463	1	a	Do you wanna gut your way through a variety of foes continuously with your shank until they drop to the floor? Or Would you prefer to juggle them in the air with your machete? No?...Well then how about shredding them to bits with your chainsaw? Still not satisfied? Ok, lets throw a handgun or two into the mix? Nawww...What you really want is a shotgun, right? And maybe a grenade to go with your molotove cocktail? If you still aint smiling at the thought of all this, well, then...you my friend dont know what a REAL game is...  Shank 2 is an awesomely fun, yet challenging game; a veritable mesh of some of the more old-school platforming experiences mixed with the new. And if the campaign aint enough for you, and you have a friend that has some free time, then crank up the Survival mode and try and protect yo stash together against countless waves of enemies...and uh...zombies from time to time. Watch as you quickly lose track of time being sucked in by the thrill and enjoyment :D  Oh...and I forgot to mention that there is also a female character, complete with her own set of weapons and arsenal too? Yeah, thats right, and she's hawt...so go and spend that $9.99 you cheap â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Cause there aint many games out there that deliver the same punch as this one for such a low price. Peace :D  
2465	1	a	Shank 2 is not a thing to remember for long, but the things it brings are undoubtedly bloody, crazy, weird and, best of all, entertaining like the first game. Although it's a slightly crippled remake of Shank, it's still good, but the gameplay just seems icky when compared to its superior predecessor.        Shank 2 - Ad&nbsp;
2467	1	a	Great 2D beat-em-up  PROS +Big Arsenal +Great Battle System +Nice artstyle +Big amount of skins +Nice storyline +Survival Mode with coop  CONS -NO coop for campaign -A bit short  Nice and enjoyable beat-em-up=)
2469	1	a	THIS GAME IS AMAZING!! Mark of the Ninja without stealth, this Commando-esque game is worth every penny. Very fun and challenging at times, just like Mark of the Ninja is. The creators have really shown their talent with this game. Get this game!!
2471	1	a	Interestingly enough, I ended up picking up Shank 2 before the original. Don't ask why, I honestly don't remember other than it was somewhat of an impulse buy as I loved the demo. If you've played the original Shank, you know what you're getting into. If you haven't, Shank is a grind house style 2D action game where you shoot, slash, and sometimes shank your way through waves of enemies. The artwork is all 2D in a hand drawn style and looks beautiful. Excellent character animations (especially death animations) really bring the game to life. While the original Shank was relatively bare bones in terms of level presentation Shank 2 has a lot going on in these levels. It's not exactly Rayman Origins but it does look pretty great.  In terms of game play this is a huge step up from the original. There is a much better counter system, the grab system is a little more robust, and the game actually encourages you to try different weapons as there are far more enemy types in this game compared to the original. In the original, I made it through the entire game using the starter weapons, which is not how Shank 2 plays. Shank 2's levels are longer, more challenging, and require you to really think about your load out before each mission as you can't change on the fly like in the original Shank. Whereas in the original Shank the game was divided into bite sized levels (which helps a ton when attempting hard mode by the way), Shank 2's levels are fuller, longer, and always feature a boss battle at the end. While most bosses are actually quite more challenging than the original Shank there are a few that are pretty cheap and winning takes more luck than skill. Fortunately, once you get to a boss you have a checkpoint (even on hard mode) so you really get a chance to learn what you are doing wrong and how to overcome the enemy.  As far as controls go, however, I can't recommend playing this game with a keyboard and mouse. I never even attempted it but as with most 2D, side scrolling games a controller is almost necessary for success. Fortunately, if you have a controller, the game controls beautifully. Actions are very responsive which helps when dealing with swarms.  In addition to the main story mode (which has two difficulties that don't stack with achievements) there is an online co-op survival mode. This is a welcome addition as the original Shank only had local co-op (which was fun, if a bit easy). This mode, however, is VERY difficult. There are a number of different stages and you are dealing with almost every type of enemy in the game. It takes practice, but with another player it's doable.   Regarding achievements there are far more than the first Shank (almost twice as many). Most of these are kill grinds with different weapons or level specific actions in addition to difficulty modes as well. The survival mode achievements are tough, but definitely possible if you have someone else. Trying it solo is not recommended.  Although I hadn't played the original Shank until after the sequel I thoroughly enjoyed this game. The visual style is amazing, the game play is fun and challenging, and even the soundtrack is pretty great. I would highly recommend playing the original Shank (even if it is an inferior game overall) as it will get you used to the play style. Even though it's not as good as the sequel it's still definitely worth playing and if you have a friend and two controllers, you can do the co-op campaign which is short and easy but still fun with two people).  I highly recommend Shank 2 to any action fans out there. The action is fast, fun, and extremely violent. There are a wide variety of enemies to fight (most requiring different strategies or weapon load outs) and some great boss battles.  8.5/10
2473	1	a	A good game, improves on the predecessor on all aspects except maybe the campaign is still short, also is less frustrating than the first one on hard difficulty! Rating: â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…
2475	1	a	So good ,I like game cartoon graphic!  10/10 In the BEST â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
2477	1	a	This game ought to have more attention. Side scrolling hack and slash, manly death heterosexual warfare. The only game I can think of in which a solution to a shark attack is ripping its jaws out from its mouth. Over the top violence without being lol edgy.
2479	1	a	This game is great. You run around, brutally dismembering the minions of the end boss, Magnus, through the use of your shanks, your heavy weapons (machetes, chainsaw, and sledge), ranged weapons (throwing knives, shotgun, and dual handguns), and explosives (grenades, molotovs, and landmines). The combat itself, regardless of weapon, is also immersive.  Also, you will die. A LOT.  In addition to the campaign, there's a survival mode where you need to work alone or with a partner to survive 30 waves of enemies by both not dying (a quite obvious aspect) and protecting three points on a small map from bombers, who put timed explosives on these points. There are many characters to unlock, including Shank's outfit from the first game.  This is an excellent game for those who like side-scrolling games.
2481	1	a	The edgier version of Shank 1. The gameplay got some upgrade that is both good and bad (why would you leave out block just to give me more dodging moves when Shank 1 gave me both) and most of the game is just you killing people for no real reason so no good story that goes well with the gameplay this time around. This time the Co-op action was moved to a new mode called survival; in survival you'll have to kill whatever comes at you for 30 waves and thats all, no Co-op story mode this time. Shank 2 is an okay beat em up that loses points when compared to Shank 1 but works more than fine if you look it as a standalone game, get it if you want some mashy mashy gorey edgey action
2483	1	a	Shank 2 is a great game, so much fun! remind me old time arcades! and you know, it has STEAM TRADING CARDS !! yeap.. even in the store page dont say it , it has !
2485	1	a	If you enjoy retrostyle sidescrollers with a modern feel, along with some dark humor and awesome game mechanics then this is for you. I've been playing this game since it came out in 2012 and I've been playing it since. Before this I used to play the first Shank. I usually play on the PS3, but this is for my gaming on the go =P
2487	1	a	The same as Shank 1: cubic tons of blood, cartoon characters, more violence than in the Venezuelan newspaper, short but with enough replay value, etc. Virtually nothing was improved, and feels more like an expansion, but if you liked the first one, I did, go for it
2489	1	a	Shank is like ramboo.  -fast paced game thats full of action , story is too short and quick to be judged , you feel that theres no story at all. -the artwork in this game is fairly decent. -this game is sort of too short , you may finish up with the main story in 4 hours~ -if you're intersted in action combos , trying different weapons and moves , you may like this game. -well , theres also multiplayer in it , which may extend the fun from this game to afew more hours.  In general , this game is not bad , not worth the full price i recommend buying it during sales or bundles. 6/10.
2491	1	a	Great game, nice graphics and works very good on controller. The survival mode is really good, even offline playing with your little brother, the fun is guaranteed.
2493	1	a	Shank 2 is a great sequel and in my opinion, better than the first game in basically every way.   The visuals are definitely an improvement over the first game, and one of the very first things I noticed was the larger variety in locations you visited. The first game suffered a bit from repetitive areas that didn't change very much, but in 2 you're always fighting in a different area from level to level which is a nice addition.   Another improvement is the weapon variety. You still have the signature weapons Shank uses in the first game, but there is a lot more to choose from this time around, and also you're able to pick up quite a few weapons that the enemies drop for a limited amount of uses until they break and they usually do fairly good damage. You can also change weapon loadouts in the middle of playing which is extremely useful, especially when you're on a boss fight and you don't have the optimal weapons equipped to do the most amount of damage.  Everything else in the game is quite similar with not much change. There are quite a few boss fights which are all fun and some are fairly challenging, especially when other enemies come out to join the fight. My only complaint of the game would probably be the length. It seems to be shorter than the first game, but it could be because I didn't die as often as I did in the first game. It's an action packed few hours, but it's a minor gripe. I didn't get to the play the multiplayer section of the game, but it would definitely add more replay value to make up for the shorter single player campaign.  Overall, definitely worth the money if you're into the genre.
2495	1	a	Must-have. Awesome single player story mode &amp; VERY challenging co-op mode that's just tons of fun. Took us about 40 hours to beat Wave 30 and it was worth every minute :)
2497	1	a	Bloody good time, side scroller with tons of blood, action and just fun to play. Using a controller makes for a more enjoyable game.
2499	1	a	Surprisingly an extremely fun game once you get past some of the control problems. Makes me want to buy the first one...
2501	1	a	Is realy good game but,is hard,VERY HARD
2503	1	a	Amazing game + need players to play with.. in survival mode
2505	1	a	A Fun, simple, throw back of a Beat Em'Up. It has wonderful animation and is somewhat of a challege. Fun for the whole family.....except for toddlers...
2507	1	a	A great sequel to the first Shank installment, which is also pretty good. I love the visual style and the animations in this game, its definitely one of most entertaining platformers i've played.  The length of the game is also good, controls are solid and easy to learn. Survival mode can be really fun, too bad i could not find anyone to play online. I should have played this back when it was released, but oh well. :/  The only thing this game lacks is online and local co-op for the Campaign, which could have been a great addition to the game, but still. I highly recommend both games if you still haven't played it. The first Shank did have local co-op, i don't know why they removed it.  Also, try Mark Of The Ninja, another epic platformer from the same creators  Score: 8,5/10
2509	1	a	Fast, bloody and hard beat-em-up sequel of Shank. Basically, it has the same gameplay as the first game with some tweaks like dodging system.  The most (and I would say the only) significant difference from the original game is the difficulty. Encounters are longer and tougher, but there are more interactive environment elements like turrets to help you. Health/damage balance was improved to make your life harder and shorter. And there is no more trigger hunting on bosses. Only pure skill of dodging their attack patterns may help to defeat them. So, even normal mode became a very good challenge.  Anyway, it's great example of modern beat-em-up game.
2511	1	a	I never play the first Shank, regardless, I don't feel I'm missing anything playing the second installment. In terms of story, Shank goes around making bad people go away by asking them nicely with blades, guns, and a chainsaw. The gameplay is fun and looks great in terms of style if you like the cartoon-comic look. You run around performing combos, grabs, and exchange blows with three weapon types with various weapons. There is a great feeling a versatility when fighting and its fun to be creative and make custom combos.  My biggest gripe with this game is it's difficulty. I'm not one to devalue a game because its hard but damn this game feels difficult in some places for no reason. Wether it is a large abundance of projectile/heavy enemies attacking you at once, small health (or enemies that do a ton of damage), the game will have you contastly reseting until the one time you get mad/lucky enough to push through to the next screen.... only to run into the same situation.  There is a local/online co op survival mode where you take on hordes of enemies as long as you can. I find this mode my favorite, aside from playing it with a friend, it doesn't feel as nearly ridiculous when a second person is carving mayhem alongside you. Overall despite it's frustration level, it is still a solid game I wouldn't pass up on a sale.
2513	1	a	Amazing game. Fluid controls, visceral combat. and best of all, great couch co-op!
2515	1	a	Great fun, good game if you just wanna slice â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ up.
2517	1	a	This is a fun game as well, finished the 1st game a couple of days ago, gotta say this sequal adds for the Combat and follows the story, it plays well with a gamepad, used a X360 controller, also works with a K&amp;M, but you might not be comfortable K&amp;M. I found no matchs online, its ok, asI played it a while back, and it was fun. If you have a friend to play the game with, i suggest you play MP. It supports both local and online MP. So you can play MP localy with K&amp;M + Controller.
2519	1	a	Single-player is a blast. Beat it on Normal, and then beat it on Hard. THEN, beat the survival mode by yourself. Oh how I love this game. I AM a glutton for punishment, however.

2523	1	a	OK, to be honest, they added simple nothing with this game and I can say first one was better than Shank 2 in almost every way. Story was terrible for me. It's all about going after someone called 'Helena' which we know almost nothing about her. Well, he raised Shank and some other guys from Rebellion that's all we know but we don't know why he goes after her. Apart from the story, they added some things like counter attack, using dropped weapons from enemies etc. They also messed up controls. Blocking is gone and you can only dodge now with the right analog stick. The old blocking button is pounce now and you can pounce fat enemies too. They added more epic soundtracks and animations but I still prefer first one's animations. They also added 'Survival Mode' and you can play online co-op, too. We couldn't because of annoying connection problems. Long story short, buy it if you really want to play Shank 2.
2525	1	a	If you have played the first one, there is no need to recommend this one. But if you haven't play the first one - play it! And then you'll come for more here!
2527	1	a	first game was really nice piece of fresh air for me in gaming, i was blown away with spaghetti western revenge theme and atmosphere, anti-hero and bunch of similar things.... i also highly recommend this second instalement in the series but in my opinion it is too identical to the first game. i assume i would be equaly amused with it as i was when i played shank for the first time, but to me it seems like some extra levels for the first game, it really does not add anything to feel like new game. i found nothing new in sp part but challenges are fun to play with friends i guess.
2529	1	a	A good sequel, but not so good as the first game...
2531	1	a	Buy the game. There's a part in it where you rip out the jaws of a SHARK!!!!?!&gt;?!??!?!?!??!@#&gt;?@!&gt;?#?@!?$@ !#$
2533	1	a	'Shank is back!' From this words a new chapter of Shank's story has begun. After his revenge, Robert 'Shank' Torres returns to his homeland, to orphan house, where he was raised. But there are new threat. A military force called 'Militia' takes over everything what's left from destroyed narcotic cartels. Murder and kidnapping is spreading across the land. And now Shank wants to take care about this problem by his own style. The fighting system was completely remastered. Becomes more comfortable, more dynamic. New weapons and a large number of pickup weapons from baseball bat to various Miniguns and Grenade Launchers. 10/10 Plot is nice, but not so breathtaking as Shank 1. 9/10 Music and Sound - of course it's great. Music is epic, no doubt. 10/10 Graphics - more gore and blood)) 10/10 Cooperative in Shank 1 was showed by extra campaign. Shank 2 have a new mode for single and coop - Survival. Can you defend yourself and important ammo from enemies?  I have to say. It's a great comic-styled, dynamic and bloody slasher. 10/10
2535	1	a	Klei done it again! I love Shank 1 even with all the hate.. Shank 2 follow the mechanics that made his predecesor fun and bring a new level to it! Lots of achivements, hard game and a survival mode will keep you sweating your controller!
2537	1	a	awseome story.. but KB/mouse controls ruined the gameplay
2539	1	a	If you see this dude, just stay away from him or he will shred you to pieces.
2541	1	a	Very short and mediocre side-scrolling brawler. Well put together with no particularly good or bad elements. Nice graphics though. There isn't really much more to say about this one. Would play if nothing better.
2543	1	a	This game is awesome. Test yourself to see if you like it. One point for every question you answer with yes: Do you like 2d scrollers? Do you like monstrous combo moves? Do you like a good story?  1. You may or may like this 2. You will probably like this 3. You need this game 4+ Stop cheating. This is why we can't have nice things!
2545	1	a	If you liked Shank 1, you gotta buy Shank 2. People often talk about the commands, I see no problem with them, of course they are more complicated, but you can rebind the keys, also, the most complex commands let you do more complex attacks, tricks and such, not to mention its another challenge to be added to the game, it isn't hard, but still very entertaining, the graphics are amazing, now heading to the Story. Most people say the story sucks, in fact, it does not, if you pay attention to the storyline, tips hidden in the levels themselves and the secrets(called rebel intel)you can know much better about the story, and it isn't a bad one, you can acctually understand what happened, what is going on and why. There are games with better storylines, but this one isn't a bad one, its just a matter of perception. You can unlock new characters that have an utility instead of just reskins. The weapons and Multiplayer mode are also very nice, I recommend that game.
2547	1	a	Play it if you are a fan of side scrolling beat-em-ups.
2549	1	a	Very fun game with an intuitive and simple gameplay. If you like the genre of 2D kill 'em all you'll definately will like Shank 2.
2551	1	a	Only played the 1st level so far, it was FREE for the weekend, and I flipping LOVED it.
2553	1	a	This game has it all, its one of them arcade games but with a great story to it. Shank 2 reminds me of 'Commando' which was on miniclip and Shank 2 made it like that, but on steroids. The art is great the becuase it is like a comic feature. The combo system and the combat brilliant, Everything is great. The best Â£3 ive spent, its been a while since ive played a fast pace action video game and this is one i'd reccomend to people. :)
2555	1	a	Awesome game go for it
2557	1	a	Fast, responsive, quick, deadly  SHANK 2 M O T H E R â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ E R
2559	1	a	you have knives. they have knives. knives.

2563	1	a	If you ever played the first Shank, then you pretty much know what to expect from this sequel. It improves on some of the frustrations the first one had, but unfortunately not all. First of all there are more weapons included in this Shank adventure, which makes killing more fun overall.  Second, they have included counter-attacks, meaning you can press a button when a red exclamation mark appears above your enemy. It looks cool in motion and works really well.  On to the stuff that isn't quite alright... it's short. But I don't see that as a downside. When you finish the game (about 4 hours) you've probably seen it all. The game doesn't overstay its welcome, thankfully. And then we have the difficulty. One moment it's easy as I-don't-know-what, and the other moment (which can be seconds later) the difficulty ramps up making it practically unplayable.  It's a good game nonetheless, and if you love beat 'em ups you'll love this one as well, I'm sure.  [Rating: 73/100]
2565	1	a	Nice beat 'em up sequel 'directed' by Quentin Tarantino :)
2567	1	a	Great Platformer and time-shoter :D
2569	1	a	Named Shank 2 for a reason. Other possible names: Knives 2, Machettes 2, A lot of Blood and Badassness 2  +: woo hoo it's a fun game. Nice graphics, great gameplay, gamepad supp, intel to collect, difficulty is balanced, story, cutscenes, blood, blood, enemies, bosses, weapons  - : sometimes annoying deaths but that's because wasn't good enough :(  overall GG, 8/10 would slice through peeps again
2571	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ 10/10
2573	1	a	  7.5/10 TJBs
2575	1	a	good game, had a lot of fun smashing things and destroying people
2577	1	a	It should be illegal for things to be as fun as Shank 2 is
2579	1	a	What a butt.
2581	1	a	Better than Shank 1.
2583	1	a	6
2585	1	a	I liked the first one more but that's probably because this one is really anal about using a 360 controller.
2587	1	a	Shank 2 is the bomb, quite literally. Itâ€™s an action packed title, filled to the brim with tons of gratification, a beautiful outline, tight controls and great replay value. Cynics can argue that it doesnâ€™t offer a ton more than the first game, but itâ€™s still just as appealing as it ever was, now with more stuff.   Full Review  [www.noobfeed.com] .
2589	1	a	This game is extremely fun but the survival mode is damn near impossible alone.
2591	1	a	good game, had a lot of fun smashing things and destroying people
2593	1	a	Entertaining
2595	1	a	It's just good clean... well not so clean, beat em' up murder and mahem. This reminds me of a classic sidescrolling beatemup game that you would find in an arcade, except it's on my compter, and it oozes blood from every orifice.
2597	1	a	Entertaining
2599	1	a	Mutch harder than the first but its good. 12/10 would rage on hard mode again.
2601	1	a	2D brawler with sense of humor. Kick some â™¥â™¥â™¥'s with this very well made game.
2603	1	a	This game kinda reminds me of Metal Slug
2605	1	a	Some ok 2D action
2607	1	a	This game should have been called Shank 2:The Real Chuck Norris simulator. After the events of first game Shank returns to his home village which he finds outruned by bad guys. And so another epic adventure begins for Shank. Shank 2 is a 2d side-scroller beat'em up game where you can kick some butt and break sculls of your enemies. Devastating arsenal of weapons including pistols chainsaws and ending with brutal sledgehammers. Game also introduces new 2 player coop survival mode which is actually fun and challenging. Awesome bosses fights, numerous goons to kill in different ways, and cool comic style landscapes. So everything is great here and it's full of badass-ery even though game is short but it's worth it low price. One of the best downloadeable games of 2012.
2609	1	a	Shank is back and hes more dangerous then ever. Shank starts a few years after the first game. Hes on his way to see hes orphanage keeper but to find out shes taken away by army people. So Shank joins the resistance to fight against the army and get her back. This game is way better then the first one and is down right awesome. The game has tight controls which work smooth. The combat stay almost the same. You have new guns to youre arsenal like Molotovs, mines, throwing knive, sledgehammers and a bunch of weapons that youre fallen enemys drop. The game has some awesome boss fights which to get pretty epic and the cutscenes are awesome to look at because the art style is still amazing. The game is also hard as nails and some parts do get annoying. Also the survival mode is pretty fun. In it you play as a charecter of your choice and you have to protect three supply boxes while people try to destroy them. Overall the games is fun as hell and you really need to check out the whole franschie and i hope Klei make part 3 soon i give this game a 8.5/10
2611	1	a	I shanked a mexican and he died 10/5
2613	1	a	I want Shank 3 plxxx
2615	1	a	The most fun co-op mode I've ever played. End of discussion!
2617	1	a	Liked the first game?? Then you gotta buy Shank 2, too!!
2619	1	a	Beat it on PS3. Even better than the first.
2621	1	a	One of the greatest 2D games to be used with a controller
2623	1	a	Actually rather entertaining, if not a bit short. Gory but fun!
2625	1	a	Really nice game! The Co-op survival mode is really fun! You can get many hours of playtime when trying to unlock all of the characters.
2627	1	a	I love this game, just to play casual between things. Or you can really competetive with friends in co-op or by comparing campaign scores.
2629	1	a	A smooth, slick, and rather gruesome beat-em-up, but nothing more than that. Also hard difficulty is freaking ridiculously hard.
2631	1	a	Avoid this one, it's inferior to the first game in every way. Weapon loadout is more restricted, the difficulty ramp up is enourmous (even on Normal), and it doesn't have a co-op mode (IMO the most fun way to play the first one). Even the story is much worse: the first one is pure Robert RodrÃ­guez/Tarantino, while this one has zombies, cannibals and other supernatural elements. A real letdown, because the first Shank is a great game.
2633	1	a	One of the best 2d brawlers I have ever played
2635	1	a	Shank 2 puts you in the role of shank , looking for redemption and justice you fight countless enemies in your path with brutal weapons, machetes,shanks,pistols,shotguns and even grenades. The game lacks on enemy variety and combos you're pretty much doing the same attacks every single time. The graphics of this game are like it's predecesor very well done but not great. The story is pretty dull and the characters involved barely have any personality or screen time to develop themselves. There's a ton of unlockables which mainly consists of costumes for single player. The co-op of this game is enjoyable at first but unless you're really into being a perfectionist you won't even care for a second run.
2637	1	a	ITS LIKE MEXICAN CARTELS BUT WITH KNIVES NO WAIT IT IS JUST A â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING MEXICAN CARTEL
2639	1	a	Actually rather entertaining, if not a bit short. Gory but fun!
2641	1	a	Beat it on PS3. Even better than the first.
2643	1	a	The Shank2 coop mode has been my top couch coop game with my girlfriend to date.
2645	1	a	Awesome game, i enjoyed the first one very much, so it was a no brainer to get this one. Visually it looks better, the art style is still the same as the first but more refined. The single player campaign is cool, but not very long. In my opinion the single player was just enough, because the Survival mode co-op is tonnes of fun.   Highly recommended and if you get it during a steam sale then its a win, win.   Make Shank 3!  10/10
2647	1	a	10/10.  That's it. Just 10/10.
2649	1	a	Just as fun, if not more so, than the first game.
2651	1	a	A really nice game with brutal animations :=)
2653	1	a	First just to get it out there i did buy this game while it was on sale for 2 buck so take that into consideration. Anyways, i feel that the comments of the repetitive nature of the game are not truly deserving. In my opinion beat em ups should never overstay their welcome and should be fun pick up and play games. Throughout the game Shank comes across different weapons that will help him on his adventure and provide a change in how you approach different situations. While not game changing, they provide enough intensive to play around with the options. This combined with the extremely addicting survival mode makes this game well worth the buy, discount or not.
2655	1	a	Great game, very fun!
2657	1	a	Play this if you just want to have some senseless violence
2659	1	a	Klei Entertainment did not disappoint with Shank 2. Inspired by Grindhouse flicks (from what I've read) Shank 2 places you in the shoes of Shank. I don't really know much about Shank since I didn't play the first game but I will give my 2 cents on the story and gameplay.  Story:  The story is kind of weak. Shank goes to his hometown to see his mother figure Helena. In between the 2 games a new military government has taken over and they are bad dudes/dudettes. Shank only starts fighting them because one of them makes him mad. After that he just mellows out on some booze before he goes to see Helena. The military sets the town on fire while he is drinking. When he attempts to get to Helena he sees her along with other villagers being hauled away by the military. So begins Shank's quest to save his mama.  You don't need to know much about Shank except that he is a cool dude. It would've been nice if he smiled or cracked a joke or did not sound like an old man in the restroom when he got hurt but that is just my opinion. You can also play as Corina, Shank's foster sister, in a level along with the multiplayer. She is a determined rebel member who is probably not a drunk. But you don't get to know her much either.  Gameplay:  The gameplay is excellent. You have a light attack, heavy attack, bombs, and guns. You can juggle people around using the light attacks. You can also pick up weapons on the road that are super powerful but only have a few uses like a bat, a pipe, an IV pole, and a sink. There is also a dodge mechanic which works really well. You can dodge at any point in your attacks. The dodge function will cancel out your attack so you wonâ€™t get hit because you are in the middle of one. There are also environmental traps you can activate to kill your enemies. There are a variety of enemies that will keep the game fresh. You have quick grenade throwers, regular dudes, fat dudes that laugh like Scooby Doo, and heavy dudes that go 'hoo rah!' when they do a spin attack. Each game has a boss as well.  If you like beat em ups then this is a game you will not want to miss. A coop survival mode (I have not played) will add replay value and there are also leaderboards, a hard mode, and intel to collect. Getting achievements also unlocks skins.  Buy it!
2661	1	a	Alot of fun :)
2663	1	a	Quick Brawler - 4 hours to complete. Couldn't get the hang of all the button presses. B-
2665	1	a	Same as first one, only little longer but still funny action game...and you will still think that script wrote Tarantino/Rodriguez but didn't have enough of red color and limbs of all kind. :D
2667	1	a	This game is really awesome  Sometimes its really hard to catch because many details on a 2D games
2669	1	a	It may doesn't look like good game, but it's great.
2671	1	a	One of the best games I've played the past couple of years. A bit short, but nice replay value on other difficulties.
2673	1	a	Hard to get into but very rewarding combat.
2675	1	a	this game is boss buy it and feel the power of tequila
2677	1	a	Excellent game with very good action and, ofcurse, violence! Very bad Shank's sequel, one of the greatest disadvantages of this perfect game. Shame...
2679	1	a	I â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing loved Shank. Iâ€™m putting that out there up front. I loved every minute of playing it. It was really really hard. Itâ€™s been a while since Iâ€™ve played a game like that. Now, when I say â€œreally really hard,â€ I donâ€™t mean impossible. Super Meat Boy is impossible. I mean really â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ challenging. Shank is by no means a perfect game, but itâ€™s so much fun. Even if you arenâ€™t a fan of beat-â€˜em-ups, I still recommend giving Shank 2 a shot.  Weâ€™re going to pretend like I know what happened in the original Shank. Right? Right. Whatâ€™s research?  Shank 2 is, as previously stated, a beat-â€˜em-up game in which you play as (appropriately) Shank. Shank is a member of a rebel group who is defying the warlord, General Magnus. Magnus and his militia have taken over the government, essentially throwing the entire system out of whack. The militia is tearing the cities the government controls apart, taking in slave labor, burning entire villages, the whole shebang. For a game whose story is completely unimportant, Shank has a considerable amount of thought put into it. I mean, donâ€™t get me wrong, the story is a tired tale thatâ€™s been done a million times over, but it sets up an excellent backstory for Shank.  Shankâ€™s mentor, Elena, has been captured by the militia. Not only does she mean to world to Shank, but she also is the leader of the alliance group. Itâ€™s up to Shank and his partner Corina to save Elena and take down Magnus once and for all.  The first thing you can note about Shank is that he is BADASS. He uses a flipping chainsaw and shotgun to take out hordes of enemies, cranes, superhumans, and airplanes. His weapons actually range from machetes to molotovs. Yeah, how flipping cool is that? Unfortunately, Shank isnâ€™t a relatable character in the slightest. I know that the game wasnâ€™t going for an emotional tale, but whatâ€™s the point in having a backstory at all when you canâ€™t feel any emotions toward the characters? Shank, and even Corina, to an extent, were too Gears of War-like for me to actually care about why I was killing all of these deranged lunatics.  Putting the stupid characterization aside for a moment, Iâ€™d like to discuss the flashback I was continuously having during my playthrough. There was a game made for the SNES called Blackthorne. Maybe you have heard of it. In, a badass character runs around shooting a shotgun to save prisoners, etc. I havenâ€™t personally played the game, so I canâ€™t attest to how good it is, but Iâ€™ve seen in played and learned about it. There are so many callbacks to Blackthorne that it isnâ€™t even funny.  Let me give you some examples. Blackthorneâ€™s signature move was shooting with a shotgunâ€¦ one handed and backwards. Guess what Shank can do? Of course, there is the obvious saving prisoners from the bad guysâ€¦ I could go on, but I think you get the picture. Before you go calling Shank and Blackthorne the same game, though, recognize that Blackthorne was actually a cinematic platformer. This is a genre that isnâ€™t really touched on as much nowadays, with the exception of the recent re-release of Flashback. My point is, whether they meant to or not, the developers of Shank made Blackthorne cool again.  Before we dive into the gameplay, letâ€™s talk about the art of the game. The animations are all very comic-book-like, which Iâ€™ve always been a fan of. The animations are simple and cartoony for such a violent game, but this is hardly detrimental. What isnâ€™t the best part of the game is the music which isâ€¦ bland. Sure, it sounds epicâ€¦ at firstâ€¦ and then it gets repetitive and fades into the background. There isnâ€™t anything wrong with it, per say, but it isnâ€™t as good as I would like it to be.  Shank is hard. I know Iâ€™ve said that a lot, but Iâ€™m trying to ingrain this into your mind. There are two modes of the story: Normal and Hard modes. Normal mode is doable, but Hard isâ€¦ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing hard. In Normal mode, you get plenty of health powerups, checkpoints, infinite lives, etc. In hard mode, you get very few powerups, next to no checkpoints, and infinite lives. To give you a quick perspective, I beat Normal in about four hours, give or take. I have yet to get past the third level in Hard.  Some of the better things about Shank are his weapons. You see, there are a variety of weapons, like I said earlier. Each weapon has a different amount of damage, speed, and some variation of stun. You will be able to find which weapons work best for you as you play the game. You donâ€™t unlock all of the weapons until the last few levels, and by this point youâ€™ve probably already figured out what you wanted. For instance, my lineup was the Chainsaw, the Shotgun, and the Grenades.  I like that the game balances out the weapons. You have a real chance to figure out which weapons are best for your playstyle. If youâ€™re like me, you like to deal with one problem at a time. This is where the Chainsaw and the Shotgun came in handy. If you like to take on lots of enemies at once, you may find that the Pistols and Machetes work better for you. Even when it seems like a weapon is unbalanced, youâ€™ll find that it has a certain ability, like leaving enemies burning in your wake. The weapons are arguably the best part about the game.  The gameplay is pretty straightforward. Itâ€™s almost, but not quite, button mashing. The enemies range quite a bit in size and power, so some weapons will work better on them than others. For example, when I was in close quarters with several enemies, Iâ€™d end up flailing about and murdering all of them with my Shotgun. If I needed to clear the field and make space, Iâ€™d use the Chainsaw. Youâ€™ll find that just using one will not work. Youâ€™ll need to chain combos together to help you take down the multitudes of enemies.  Speaking of multitudes of enemies, there are quite a bit of them. These basic enemies range from swordsmen, to female ninjas, to guys with pistols, to guys with machine guns, to guys with axes, to midget bomber, to gigantic â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing cretinsâ€¦ There are so many. Each level may or may not present you with different enemies. Occasionally, this could just mean the same enemy reskinned, but some levels do include zone-specific enemies.  The best enemies are the bosses. And there are not as many as I would like. The levels in Shank only end up being about 20-30 minutes long apiece, and there are only eight levels. This does mean there is variety in bosses, but there arenâ€™t enough. For such a BA guy, youâ€™d think heâ€™d constantly be taking on guys three or four times his size.  That being said, the bosses are awesome and also not. Each one of the focuses on a different aspect. For example, there is a psychic boss, and thereâ€™s fire boss, and thereâ€™s a strength boss. Each of these bosses seem perfectly fit for their levels. Alternatively, there are minibosses in some stages. For example, the crane I mentioned earlier. It has been a long time since Iâ€™ve had this much rage towards a boss in a gameâ€¦ You canâ€™t hit the crane unless youâ€™re using your gun. The crane repeatedly tries to smash you with a boat that takes up a third of the screen while guys with pistols try to take you out from a mile away. Itâ€™s tough. But I beat it. I canâ€™t get past in on the Hard mode, but I got in Normal.  The bosses are not awesome in some partsâ€¦ Mostly because they all use the same tactics. To a degree. They have a predetermined moveset that consists of maybe five moves at the most. Once you take out about a third of their health, they all call backup. Itâ€™s the same thing every battle. On top of that, once you figure out the movesets of each boss, they arenâ€™t that hard to beat. Hell, even the final battle against Magnum I beat on my second try. For a game that can be as challenging as Shank, the bosses arenâ€™t hard enough.  ......read more of this review at  http://theoblivianstudios.com/post/62088773680/review-shank-2 
2681	1	a	good way to kill some time
2683	1	a	Challenging but fun game with an interesting art style.
2685	1	a	It's fun with very good graphics. Funny violence, marvelous scenes. But it's too short, I could do it in 4 hours in normal mode :(
2687	1	a	not too easy not too hard  has simple controls and very good gameplay
2689	1	a	The gameplay is very good :D
2691	1	a	Hell yes. Works great with gamepad, fun campaign, and great graphics.
2693	1	a	Fun and crap.
2695	1	a	A decent sequel with good graphics and music, lots of blood, co-op survival mode (not many players though), weak story and bad controls (untill you get used to them).
2697	1	a	Great beat-em-up platformer. Put on the Pendulum In Silico album in the background and it's perfect.
2699	1	a	Like a great grindhouse action movie turned into a 2D platform. Just like its predecesor Shank 2 has been infused with awesome fighting mechanics, soaked in blood and sweat, and left to bake in the hot desert sun. As all sequels should be, Shank 2 turns everything up to 11, trumping its predecessor on all levels. Klei would only continue to outdo itself with Mark of the Ninja
2701	1	a	fun to play and great gameplay
2703	1	a	Very fun and controller friendly, an overall decent button masher and I love it :D
2705	1	a	Very fun and addicting!
2707	1	a	Super fun brawler. Lots of really gratifying combos and button mashing. Combat is simple, but complex enough to keep it interesting throughout. Campaign is only about 3.5 hrs. Also has a co-op survival mode that seems cool if you like that sort of thing. The art style and violence are both over the top and a lot of fun!
2709	1	a	Not a prison â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ simulator, I was disappointed.
2711	1	a	Shank is back with more brutal style combat animations. Action platform is rised to more deadly and overall are harder than the origin. The story is about conflict between rebels and militia. It's shorten and less interest than origin. For the combat, there're variaty of melee weapons, but some are cut and limited in your inventory. Enemy now can do damage even you're fell on the ground, so be careful! I'm really disappoint that developers cut co-op campaign mode off. But replace with survival mode as tradition. Well, it pretty fun with various characters. But they should maintain the old ones, not just cut them off including team combo. By the way, it's good game and great Maxican art style. I hope Shank 3 would be focused on both story and gamemodes.
2713	1	a	Very good game! Fun and fast
2715	1	a	Festival of blood and gore...
2717	1	a	The cutscenes are terrible, the story was â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, the 5th boss is a massive pain in the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, but somehow I still throuoghly enjoyed it all the way through. The level design was great, the combat quite fun and overall its a fantastic short game.
2719	1	a	Rip and tear through these weeklings all while having a vast array of badass costumes you can use! SO MUCH FUN!
2721	1	a	It's the kind of game you want to play with friends in your spare time.
2723	1	a	This game ROCKS as the first part.
2725	1	a	Not as good as the first one, but a nice addition nonetheless.  Story is non-existent and the shotgun is still overpowered. Art is good, obviously. I mean y'know, KLEI ent. Co-op campaign is replaced by survival mode, pretty neat in it's own way (if you can get a friend to play), but again, not as good as the first installment.  So if you want to try a Shank game, go for 1 first.
2727	1	a	Combo potentional bonanza, loved this game, shank 3 please!
2729	1	a	Hard to get into but very rewarding combat.
2731	1	a	This game is really fun. Shank is he toughest guy around. If a shark attacks him he rips its jaw out.
2733	1	a	A decent sequel with good graphics and music, lots of blood, co-op survival mode (not many players though), weak story and bad controls (untill you get used to them).
2735	1	a	Not as good as the first game, but fine nevertheless. Beware: it's as hard as the first one. Even harder. :)
2737	1	a	Good refinement of the fun gameplay of the previous game. A bit short and lacks co-op story mode, but worth the price for me.
2739	1	a	Even better than the first! Awesome!
2741	1	a	The original Shank and Shank 2 are fundamentally the same game. You will be doing the same combos with the same weapons on the same enemies.   They did add some fun tidbits such as weapons enemies drop that you can then pick up and beat other enemies with. Some of those weapons are insanely powerfull which only adds to the fun. However, I did not find myself using most of weaker pickups because the gameâ€™s balance was more focused on Shankâ€™s default weapons so you cannot combo as well or as quick.  Bosses are considerably more enjoyable than the original Shank. While they are fundamentally repetitive, they feel challenging. Add that to the bosses are no longer tanking you with their health pool and you have a very enjoyable experience that will leave you screaming at your screen with excitement.  Another definite positive is enemy animations. Though it might be unimportant to game play, it defiantly adds to atmosphere. After a brutally insane and satisfying combo, it is fun to watch your beaten enemies roll around on fire or with limbs missing.  However the biggest negative is the story. If the story was bad in the first Shank, it is even worse in Shank 2. The story seems to have no point what so ever and you will find yourself wishing it was not there. The ability to skip cut scenes is the greatest thing I could hope for while playing Shank 2.
2743	1	a	Shank 2 is a great followup to the original boasting good action and a fun amount of fighting. The story and theme is set more around a tropical place as Shank tries to help overthrow the corrupt mafia with some help from others. The cutscenes usually boast more amounts of action and bloody gore than dialogue fromo the first, fitting for a good action movie. The fighting mechanics have also been beefed up with a more robust system enabling longer combos and more launchers along with new weapons along with some returning ones. Visually the game looks as great as the first with its animated style along with a great backing soundtrack. With an action movie charm, Shank 2 is great for players of the first or those wanting a fun beat em up experience.
2745	1	a	A good platforming blast with humour.
2747	1	a	This game is really fun and fast pased, the co-op is really fun. i really enjoyed playing the single player mode. this game is fun and if u enjoy indie games u should get this game.
2749	1	a	Had so much fun playing the first that I picked up the second one. So much fun too! Hoping there's a third, forth and fifth!
2751	1	a	Try out this bad boy while waiting for an update on your favorite game.  It has it all and only for 9.99.
2753	1	a	The follow up on Shank... also a good (side scrolling) brawler!
2755	1	a	Just Wow !  10/10 ...If you're a Metal Slug Fan ! what r u waiting for ! go ahead and buy it xD ...
2757	1	a	Even better visuals and re-invented, more fluid combat. About as short as the first one, but the co-op survival mode adds longevity and is a lot of fun, especially with a friend. If you liked the first one, you'll love the sequel.
2759	1	a	Another great successor of Klei Interactive (creators of first Shank and Mark of the Ninja). Great visuals, Amazing Soundtrack and Unbelievably enjoyable gameplay. If you are a hack-n-slash fan, pick it! beat-em-up fan? pick it! Like to chainsaw someone's face? Pick it! This game was intended for you! If you have a bloodlust desire, this game can grant your wishes :3 p.s. It's also have a co-op survival mode, worth checking out too
2761	1	a	Excellent game with very good action and, ofcurse, violence! Very bad Shank's sequel, one of the greatest disadvantages of this perfect game. Shame...
2763	1	a	This game is great. I just started it, but I mean I just have to write a review about sooner or later. Right? If you like games where you walk and fight enemies on your way, this is what you need to get. I like the idea that you can range attack and hand to hand combat and the story makes a great first impression. Like, Shank (I hope that's his name), he started as a prisoner and they start to get hi-jacked by these goons and everyone leaves. Except for one person, Shank. He sat there, stood up to them and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed them up. Can't wait to finish this game.  That's a great way to show that you can face your fear right there.
2765	1	a	This is a decent, button-mashing time-waster. It's worth it if you can pick it up for cheap.
2767	1	a	A very good game, cheap and easy to learn. The style of the games great and I love the gameplay. Controls are can be a little hard to get used to, but after the first 20 minutes or so you'll have them down. One of the few rare games when the 'Hard' mode is genuinely hard. Would recommend to all friends. 
2769	1	a	Alot of fun :)
2771	1	a	This is a good side scroller, 2D combat game. I think it is unique and if its on sale, I would reccommend it for a fun Indie game
2773	1	a	LOVED Shank 2, never played Shank (Is there a Shank). Oh well this game was fun and action packed from beginning to end and it was a great difficultly level for this 40 year old gamer. I have really been enjoying these side scroller games alot as I enjoyed Ninja Scroll just as much. This one was a lot less on the stealth and much more on the action. As an 80's kid who grew up on kick @ss action movies like Rambo this one was right up my alley!
2775	1	a	A funny arcade style beat em up.
2777	1	a	16.5/20
2779	1	a	Still damn fun!. But sadly the story is so bad compare to the first one.
2781	1	a	Even better than the first! Awesome!
2783	1	a	Although Shank 2 will last you somewhat longer than its predecessor, it is mainly due to, at times, frustrating encounter design where you'll struggle to differentiate enemies from the background and enemies who are perfectly capable of stunlocking you in certain group compositions. Also worth noting is that already simple but effective story structure from the original is further diluted and merely serves as framing device to move you from location to location without any personal involvement. That's not to say all is bad in Shank 2, though. On the contrary; game plays to its old strengths - more cosmetic unlocks were added, scoreboard bragging rights are still around and combat is still as satisfying as ever. It almost evens things out. Almost.
2785	1	a	The art style and gameplay is just amazing. I love it so far, very action-packed, good platformer. Good job Klei!
2787	1	a	ITS LIKE MEXICAN CARTELS BUT WITH KNIVES NO WAIT IT IS JUST A â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING MEXICAN CARTEL
2789	1	a	10/10.  That's it. Just 10/10.
2791	1	a	A really nice game with brutal animations :=)
2793	1	a	Fast pace, 2 dimensions game. And good story line.
2795	1	a	Rip and tear through these weeklings all while having a vast array of badass costumes you can use! SO MUCH FUN!
2797	1	a	Not as good as the first one, but a nice addition nonetheless.  Story is non-existent and the shotgun is still overpowered. Art is good, obviously. I mean y'know, KLEI ent. Co-op campaign is replaced by survival mode, pretty neat in it's own way (if you can get a friend to play), but again, not as good as the first installment.  So if you want to try a Shank game, go for 1 first.
2799	1	a	Shank... What a gaming jewel...  Great game, great gameplay, wonderful graphics and good enough story for this kind of game.   10/10
2801	1	a	I havnt spent alot of time playing Shank 2 and havnt played Shank but its a fun game and reminds me when I used to play metal slug in the arcade. Fun game.
2803	1	a	I have not played shank 1 A really competent brawler with quite sophisticated fighting mechanics that might be slightly overwhelming in the beginning, but feels really satiesfying once you've mastered it. Tight and fair controls - It is mostly your own fault when things go bad. I recommend a controlled for a better experience even though keyboard and mouse works well.   Great art style and animation, similar to other klei titles. Perhaps a bit too bloody for my taste but it fits the theme. It is animated in a cartoony style but perhaps not the best game for the yonger audience due to gore and violence. The story is otherwise completely forgetable.   You have two fighters that you get to play through the story. They vary slightly in play-style are based on the same mechanics. What matters more is what weapon-load you choose - I spent quite a lot of time on a certain bosses until I realized I could do much better with different weapons. Bosses are otherwise just right and are easily beaten once you've figured out what patterns they have and what weapons work best.  Campaign mode is just right timewise, and then you can unlock outfits for the two characters and also play survival mode.  Probably one of the better brawlers I have tried.
2805	1	a	I like this game even more than the first one. The violence is even more satisfying (I'm not crazy. My mother had me checked.) and the extra weapons &amp; characters are a nice addition. It still has a nice challenge to it. I only beat it on the easiest setting and was still pretty challenged to finish some levels.   Here are some videos I did of my play through of Shank 2:         YouTubeâ„¢ Video:  Shank 2 Ep1 - The Dark Road Home&nbsp;
2807	1	a	Awesome sequel, this game is everything the first was with just a little bit of updating and better animation. Survival mode is addictive , fun and challenging. Really hoping for a 3rd game in the series.
2809	1	a	Great game! A Hack and Slash at its best! I started a blind lets play/first look on my YouTube Channel. Below is the link to my channel! Thanks for watching and let me know what you think!          YouTubeâ„¢ Video:  &nbsp;
2811	1	a	Shank 2 is a beat em up sequel of Shank from the developer Klei who makes Mark of The Ninja. like Mark of The Ninja, Shank 2 has a really good animations and presentation. the humor, cutscenes and the gameplay really makes this game so enjoyable to play. the combinations of melee attacks, heavy attacks and range weapons are really good that it makes the players free to experiment with a combo that works best in certain situation. Shank 2 is a fast-paced game but it also has some slow motions that works well, it makes the players rest a little from its fast-paced world and come back again. Shank 2 successfully blends beat em up with strategy because if you play just to keep attacking, you'll end up dead. Shank 2 is a really hard game which forces the players to plan a quick strategy for successfull attacks. Shank 2's story is a combination of violence and humor. some times it's really violent and some times it's funny but Shank successfully combine both aspects to be a good game. unfortunately, Shank 2 has a very short length of Story Campaign and it doesn't really do well in telling the characters and what's happening in its world. nevertheless Shank 2 is an enjoyable game with very good gameplay, good animations and presentations. it just doesn't really have longer length and story. 7.5/10
2813	1	a	Excellent game. It's like Shank reloaded! My recommendation is to play it with a controller. It can get a bit confusing and much less fun with keyboard and mouse.
2815	1	a	Shank 2 is a huge improvement on the underlying gameplay for the series. Whereas the original amounts to a pretty imitation of the oldschool brawler games, Shank 2 is better in all aspects (+new coop survival) and stands on its own as a worthy entry for this genre.   Dear Esther may be more artsy but this is the better game for the same amount of money. You wouldn't go wrong paying 15 for this even, in fact that's what they should've charged!
2817	1	a	I like this game even more than the first one. The violence is even more satisfying (I'm not crazy. My mother had me checked.) and the extra weapons &amp; characters are a nice addition. It still has a nice challenge to it. I only beat it on the easiest setting and was still pretty challenged to finish some levels.   Here are some videos I did of my play through of Shank 2:         YouTubeâ„¢ Video:  Shank 2 Ep1 - The Dark Road Home&nbsp;
2819	1	a	A really good 2-D brawler. The 2-player 'survival mode' keeps me coming back for more.
2821	1	a	Glorified violence at its best
2823	1	a	Love this game
2825	1	a	worth the price and its a lot of fun both in co-op and singleplayer, gameplay is better but i miss the co-op story from the first game and the way that you had to find difrent aproche for each boss, now its kick them till they dead and it makes them boring and basicly they all feel the same, in the first game you died a lot till you find the way to kill the boss but when you did you can kill the boss fast, and feel smart, the same was in coop story
2827	1	a	You really can't beat this game for the price. So much fun with a friend!
2829	1	a	Lots of action, classic story and BRUTALITY.
2831	1	a	This is the best 2d action game I have been played. Very very good for playing with friend or your brother.
2833	1	a	this game reminds me of my childhood , best game ever played !
2835	1	a	Good fun to play, but honestly a lot more fun if this had co-op. Co-op is only in limited survival mode...bah!
2837	1	a	Nice game
253	0	a	And why do I not recommend this game. EA's Origin! Never even got the game running, 20 minutes of painfull Origin create profil, login, enter game serial. Run game, login again, enter game serial once more, game crashes, start game again, login yet another time, game crashes, reboot windows, run game, login just for the sake of login in, game crash, uninstall!  Steam, would you please ban EA Origin games!
2839	1	a	You warp into people and turn them into blood geysers, is there anything more to say? Good atmosphere, nice sounds, good looking animations. Unfortunately this is pretty much a direct 360 port so the controls are not as tight as they should be unless you have a 360 pad, there are no video setting outside of resolution and vsync, no mouse usage, and mixed control prompts. It's a shame about the lack of graphics options because this game could go from nice looking to gorgeous with ease. Overall the mechanics,unique, well executed, and so much fun it is well worth the full price and a steal when on sale.
2841	1	a	Loved this. The little alien is so easy to control. Good story line too. Still need to finish the game as it does get tougher the more you play. 9/10
2843	1	a	I really enjoyed this game. It mixes top-down, Metal Gear-style stealth mobility with puzzle elements. You can upgrade several different skills that can really change your approach to the game -- whether you prefer sneaking undetected, running and evading capture, or blowing up enemies from inside.  Graphics, sound, and controls are all nice. The story is somewhat linear, but fun nonetheless. Granted, it has that EA account nonsense, but I'd reccommend this.
2845	1	a	A really fun little game that's well worth buying, despite the EA account nonsense. There are some great game mechanics in use and the puzzles are pleasantly challenging. It manages to be both cute and gory at the same time, too. Should note: I was playing with a controller (which works great), so I can't vouch for keyboard controls.
2847	1	a	I have played this for many hours on pc (without steam). I love the cute main carachter, and all of his cool powers. I would recommend this addictively great puzzle game to everyone!
2849	1	a	Very Challenging and interesting game, the way you aquire and use your powers to solve puzzles are nice, the challenge mode is also very nice and the story has 3 different endings, that require you to play the game all over again, however, thats not a problem, since this game manages to be always entertaining and a great time waster. I recommend it, specially if you enjoy Puzzles and stealth based strategies...and if you don't enjoy stealth, you can be an uncontrolable killing machine too! :D
2851	1	a	Very easy game (except a few locations), almost without any storyline, but I've great time with it, it's nice, cute and funny. I don't often play games more than once but in this case I will.
256	0	a	It's a fun game but the EA login killed it for me. It doesn't remember my account and have to recover password every time because it doesn't accept my credentials.
2853	1	a	It definitely is a fun little game, I would recommend it to anyone who wants to play a simple adventure type game. I enjoyed spending time on it. You play as a little critter that can warp through thin doors and such. You can make people explode if you warp into a human so thats neat too :o
2855	1	a	A good game marred by horrible console porting. Poorly optimized and bad controls (arrow keys instead of a mouse, wtf) means it can be very frustrating to play at times. But still, you should probably try it anyway. It's like Portal but with more exploding scientists.
2857	1	a	lemme just say...I hate Origin...the game was fun though :)
2859	1	a	This game is intresting with the mechanics and storyline and also after u get all the abilities u will need to discover some of them secrets which is awesome
258	0	a	i dislike this game, bad graphic quality
2861	1	a	In the distant future: the year 2000, a small alien named Zero is kidnapped from his home planet and taken to an underground science facility known as Black Aperture. He and his mysterious crystal-like companion begin to fight back against the cruel and unhumane scientists by doing cruel and unhumane things to them. Days passed and there was no sign of progress for Zero and his follower, the scientists and soldiers just seemed to keep coming back through the floorboards. Proabably beause they did. Zero was becoming very frustrated and began to question his allegiance, so he did what any logical alien with warping abilities would do. He played by the rules. He would concede to every guard he met and acted politely to everyone he met. But his follower didn't like this. So he got over it.  And you should too.
2863	1	a	There's the good news and the bad news.  The good news is- this is one of the best games I've tried this year!  You're playing this cute little alien guy who teleports around and brutally murders people by blowing them up from the inside. If you've played Unreal Tournament, that's also known as 'telefragging'- actually, this game could easily be named something like 'Telefrag-the Game' :P Now, that's kind of justified because the humans captured the little alien and were performing horrible experiments on it, and are trying to shoot it on sight without any attempt of communication, so... yeah :) The gameplay is strangely addictive and the puzzles (because of course there are puzzles) are reminiscent of Oddworld games, where one wrong step spells doom for the alien guy. Based just on those facts, I could HIGHLY recommend grabbing this game.  Now... the bad news. This game WANTS you to have an Origin account. Yeah, that's EA Games for you. It asks for EA login, then it asks for the serial key, then, after activating and starting the game, it asks for the SAME serial key, only this time you can't paste the damned thing and need to type it in manually. After that, you need to log in to the Origin account, AGAIN, from the game...   WHY? Why doesn't it just let me play the game when I try to start it? Why does EA HAVE to meddle with pointles layers upon layers of DRM?   I guess at least the only 'good' thing you have from all this is, the game actually registers on your Origin account as well, so yeah.  BOTTOM LINE: If you're prepared to endure a bit of pointless logging in and typing a 16-character serial number manually like in the olden ages (or registering an Origin account if you don't have one), this game is AWESOME. Go get it!
259	0	a	EA accout crap.
2865	1	a	Fun little title. IMO it's somewhat underrated.
2867	1	a	One of my favorite games :)
262	0	a	Badly optimised, significant loading times even on my high-end CPU despite such a simple game.  As far as gameplay goes it's a good concept but poorly executed, with minimal stealthing or thinking required.  On top of that - it requires ORIGIN.
263	0	a	Love the concept and it's kind of fun, but. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ frames, weird controls and Origin... I don't mind Origin i use it from time to time, But i much prefer steam, that's why i bought the game on steam.
264	0	a	Crashs and doesn't run
265	0	a	Crashes as soon as you log in, do not buy.
2869	1	a	If you fancy something a little different and enjoy testing yourself then this is definitely for you. Fantastic game to get away from the rages of other games!
267	0	a	This game was not enjoyable at all and I felt like I was smacking my head againist a wall because of my machosistic desire to finish games. The puzzles weren't awful and the atmosphere was okay but stuff seemed off and when enemies spotted you it seemed at times unfair and then they randomly swear at you for no apparent reason.   Not something I'd recommend to anyone.... =(
268	0	a	This game's puzzle mechanics are satisfying. They're definitely unique, especially since a preferred playstyle can be chosen. You can stealthily get around by means of trickery and concealment by creating fake copies of things and swapping around the locations of objects, people and yourself. On the other hand, you can find creative ways to use your powers to waltz on out of every guarded room without leaving anything recognizable as human behind you. You can also blend a very functional gradient between the two. There's plenty of variation in the enemies' appearances and behaviors, not to mention humorous dialogue.  Where the game comes short isn't really a single issue. In general, it feels watered down. It's a great game in concept, but the execution leaves much to be desired. Puzzles lack variation. The art is nice, but it gets monotonous to walk through the same hallway for the umpteenth time. The aforementioned playstyles are enjoyable, but they're not flexible; upgrades are irreversible. To mitigate this, you'll have to backtrack and hunt for the currency used to purchase the upgrades, which, admittedly, can lead to some of the most enjoyable puzzles.  Essentially, the concepts offered potential that was untouched. The game feels incomplete in important aspects of gameplay. Many puzzles are bland, repetitive, or unchallenging. The gameplay is somewhat incompatible with the physics engine used, allowing exploits that get you to higher elevations than you should be able to get to. The game's length is short. Overall, it feels underwhelming. I really do think that this game's core mechanics are far from lacking, but it's the nuances that overshadow the parts that would otherwise shine.  TL;DR: While mechanics are creative and enjoyable, the presentation is trite and disappointing.
269	0	a	I wish there was a way to NOT RECOMMEND games. REQUIRES ORIGIN! :(   Edit 11/26/2013 - Steam finally gave a way to not recommend games. Thank you!
270	0	a	Neat idea for a stealth action, sorta metroidvaniay kind of game. However, suffers from frame rate issues, poor gamepad support (mine only functioned 90% of the time, which isn't enough), UI problems, and swingy difficulty curves.  It's hard to really sum up how all the little problems just add up against Warp. Small stuff like having to go back to an older checkpoint, so you can resave at your current one.  Some of the worst parts of the game for me were the optional challenge rooms, which thankfully were truely optional.  I actually ended up playing all the way to the final boss, then decided I wasn't having enough fun to want to spend the last 30 minutes to finish the janky, unpleasant fight, just to see the ending.  Really the definition of a below average game. This could have been much better with just even a little more consideration of the overall package.  Avoid this one and save your money for the next stealth game.
271	0	a	I hate when I need to loging to Origin while I'm playing a game I bough in Steam. I did it... Now I think I can go back to play Portal - it is way better!  
272	0	a	My video review:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HolQMp6q6A8 
273	0	a	PC port not so great, controls are sketchy and can be frustrating. Story is meh at best. Sad really, great premise, bad execution.
274	0	a	Uh oh, poo my pants, Warp is from EA and indie?!? Hmmm!  The floppy sloppy design and buggy wuggy mess you often run into mid-game definitely brings that indie feel across. Warp's a cool idea with the most mixed of executions, but it's mostly good. It's never terribly fun, but it's not like it's boring or anything, either. It just kinda floats around in the vacant, drooly department that leaves you staring at the screen until you finally reach the game's ending. There's no worthwhile story in Warp, so the bulk of the game should rely on level design when we're talkin' stealth and platforming, but, unfortunately for Warp, the level design remains middling, and difficulty pops up and down unpredictably.  On that note...not shabby! ;)
275	0	a	Game looks nice but on my PC, it runs at ~15fps. Unless I find a way to optimize (unlocking fps in warpengine.ini did jack) it's $2.49 wasted.
2871	1	a	WARP is a stealth-action puzzler where players take control of little alien who is abducted by humans and must find his way out from research facility. He must use powers of other aliens to accomplish this task while completing different puzzles and defeating his enemies. While game may last only 3-4hours itâ€™s actually great and enjoyable. There are 3 different powers to wield and amazing locations. Also to note you can collect grubs that can help you upgrade your powers like walking more silent or just make better use of your abilities. Finally after completing story you can try out challenge room to test your skills and manage to kill enemies as quick as possible. While it may be a poor port from console it still manages to hold on high spot as good indie game. The only flaw may occur is that you are required to have Origin account, and maybe for better gameplay use controller. Otherwise great game to enjoy and relax. 8/10-Overall. 7/10-PC version. 
276	0	a	It's not Portal -- that 's for sure. Stupid people just should refrain from making puzzles. Beat it in a few hours. Challenge mode leaderboards are polluted with hackers' fake records.
277	0	a	This game is bad. The AI is bad. The level design is bad. The gameplay is bad. The story is nonexistant. Another poorly developed EA title.
278	0	a	This piece of crap goes with a hard lock of mouse filter (meaning coursor movement is forcefully smoothed and sharp aiming is impossible). Be aware!
279	0	a	Warp is a console app store game brought to PC without considering the PC client base at all. Not only that but like all games sutured onto to the glutounes corporations you need to sign up for an account under another game client to play it.   Gameplay wise the puzzles are extremly simple and clearly made by uncreative people. You are never challanged and the upgrades you receive are never impressive. They try to tack on some narrative like all modern puzzle games, but that falls flat on its face in how trite it is. You won't want to purchase a soundtrack for this music score either, it's completly lackluster by all account.   *SIGH* you actually feel like you're getting dumber while playing it.
2873	1	a	if you are going to buy, GET A CONTROLLER ON YOUR COMPUTER IMMEDIATELY!!
282	0	a	I Demoed this on console and it was was fun, but this pc version a terrible port. Origin account making and constantly logging in is terrible, game constantly crashed, never got to play this download.
283	0	a	The activation key doesnt even freaking work, this is bullcrap
284	0	a	Horrible game. Doesnt even load, and no one can fix it. Not even the producers can fix it. DONT BUY IT IF ON PC!
2875	1	a	Interesting
2877	1	a	who would turn down the opportunity to play as an overly agressive sentient teleporting jelly that can warp inside people? exactly. 10/10 would warp agen
286	0	a	This game it a bit broken... Its not possible to set the key mapping yourself and you are forced to use the arrow keys instead of the WASD. It is bought in steam but registered in Origin (?) THis is abother EA fail game... Same for CNC4 and Mirror Edge.    4/10
287	0	a	the game is mediocre at best, the concept is kinda cool but not worth $10 i only payed $5 cause of summer sale thank god but even then i wish i didnt buy it. The story is painfuly boring and lack of creativity and the upgrades in the game do very little. As for all the people ahving trouble with the origin account? i logged in once and played the game smoothly ever since the only thing is it said i wasnt logged in everytime i started the game but to be honest i just wanted to finish the game to see how it ended (it was a dissappointing ended obviously lol) and the save game was never an issue. I dont recommend this game because its blan and boring go spend your money on something better. Hope this helps :)
2879	1	a	Nice sense of humor and interesting mechanics. Teriffic stealth action game.
2881	1	a	Really nice little game. It will be worth your while.
2883	1	a	A really good puzzle game that has three different endings. Graphics and sound were ok. 8/10
2885	1	a	Warp is a different way of thinking but I loved the challenge and the game play.
2887	1	a	Under all the bland Indie shovelware that has plagued STEAM in the recent decade, this game stands out as a Diamond In The Rough.
2889	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ will Blow your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off
2891	1	a	good game to pass free time.. just u have loggin everytime to origin account to continue from where you left your game else start a new game again
2893	1	a	Warp is SO much fun! The top-down style of puzzle is very clever and fun! If you liked Portal and Portal 2 but wanted something a little more casual, this is definitely the game for you! I have only played about 73 minutes so far and only have three abilities but it is a ton of fun to play!
288	0	a	The gameplay was fun but the boss fights were way to hard
2895	1	a	7.2 / 10
2897	1	a	Great game, nice mechanics. Few skills that work together perfectly. Just the final boss is a slapp in the face because it requires hardly any skill but mostly just dumb luck.
2899	1	a	Bloop! This game is adorable. Dunno why it didn't get more attention. The PC port isn't super great, but it works okay. Show it to your kids! They'll love it. Fun/5
2901	1	a	Warp is a game reminiscent of the old Metal Gear series, but with Portal elements. A stealth game with teleporting features is a bit of an odd mix, and so whether you like this game will be entirely up to you. I found it entertaining, but after one playthrough, I think I'm good.
289	0	a	I'd recommend against picking this one up. The game was clearly built for the XBOX and so it doesn't control very well on the PC. Worse, is that the game, while novel, is not intuitive; ultimately you will find yourself getting through obstacles via trial &amp; error.   I like the idea of the game, but it's poorly executed and poorly ported.
2903	1	a	This game is insanely fun! The little guy reminds me of Stitch of Lilo and Stitch only he has no qualms with warping into a person and reinacting the chest popper scen from Alien. This game is a great mix of puzzles, stealth, and little bits of awesome that make me squee.
2905	1	a	Nice Puzzle game. It has charm, good pacing and the right lenght (about 5 hours). It's not as memorable as Portal or Braid, however, and the puzzles are on the easy side. I would say $5 is the perfect price for this game.   The store page says it requires Origin, but actually you just need to accept Origin's terms of service the first time you run the game, you don't need to run the client or log into Origin when playing.
2907	1	a	Just buy it !!!
291	0	a	Good Point : Fun Puzzle Bad Point : Boss Battle, really, really really HARD
2909	1	a	if you like Portal games... you'll like this one... so much fun and bloody! xD
2911	1	a	This is a fun little game, and the bonus of getting it on sale makes it worth having. Really adorable concept, if the idea of blowing up bad guys from the inside can be referred to as 'adorable'. I'd pick it up, you can't beat 7-10hrs of entertainment for $2.50 (especially when a movie costs like $8).
2913	1	a	Great Game. I need Warp 2 now!
2915	1	a	Terrible, terrible console port. I tried my very best raising the FPS above 20, without any success. Don't buy this one for PC. Even if it's on sale.  Edit: Now that I've got a much more powerful PC it seems to work alright, with the exception of the framerate being capped when first installed. There's a handy reference to unlock it over on the PCGaming Wiki:  http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Warp  It's an alright, quirky little game and quite fun. The port still stands out as terrible though, so beware before buying it.
2917	1	a	EA sucks! They make you sign in to Origin, twice! Then they make you 'activate' the game with a CD key, twice! The menu sustem is also crap. It's inconsistent and clumsy. Please EA, just die already.  That said, the game is pretty awesome. I had a hard time putting it down and played for 3 hours in the first sitting. Graphics are good and control is decent, at least with a controller. I love all the little sounds the alien makes. If you're a fan on minions, you'll love this little guy.
295	0	a	This game is fun, but until they actually do something about the aweful coding, dont buy it OR get it on consoll, it's hardly doable on pc as it is now, I have sent them an e-mail about this but they dont seem to care...do we really wanna support such bad service?
2919	1	a	A really tiny game and the story is simple: you are a alien. You are caught by a scienist group when you fell onto Earth and they attempt to 'look inside' you. Your power is peeled and you need to get your power back and escape from the lab.   Yet the game is very attractive in its idea. The ailen is able to walk through items( including humans ) in order to escape from traps, gunfires and deadly mechine. You need to think where to hide, where to put the items and where to go first in order to get to your destination?   As a Indie game, it is no compare to those 'big company' product, but the presentation and the creativity are really impressive.   If you are looking for a tiny fun game to smile and think, get this one and you wont regret.
2921	1	a	Short but really fun game!
2923	1	a	yeah its from EA but its a very polished game well executed but bad ported to pc, u will need a game pad and the game needs some steam achiv..its charming and disturbing, its a good indie game. u should give it a try :)
2925	1	a	It's a great game where you're an alien running around a government facility killing scientists and trying to escape. Very brutal and very fun.
2927	1	a	Pretty cool game until the last level. I couldn't beat it it was so hard.
2929	1	a	Excellent little puzzle game, the only down side is having to login to EA/Origin at every play.
297	0	a	A serviceable effort for the consumption of genre fans that are satiated with a competent Tower Defense game. For the rest I suggest you check out Defense Grid, Orcs must Die or another exemplary title in the field since this game doesn't really stray from the tried and true formula.  It bored me.
2931	1	a	8/10 This isn't the  best  TD game on steam, but for the price it's great value. Don't expect plot or fancy looks or sounds, but you   DO   get a good long campaign and a few interesting challenges.
2933	1	a	Just Relax And Play This game if good if you have free time and wanna rest   Just Stop when you lost tray again if you want
298	0	a	iBomber Defense is a fun game if you really like tower defense games and if you're bored.  On the downside is that it is rather bland - I don't really have a problem with the low amount of turrets, enemies and maps (although there are quite a few maps). It's mostly how the two campaigns are very much alike, and how the quickplay is exactly like the part of the campaign you've already played. The enemies come at exact same times and in the same order, making it rather boring, and thus with a low replayability.  The music gets annoying after a while, but it's mostly the 'boom'-sounds without any other background sound that make it very obvious that this game could very easily be improved.   I would think it's worth buying for a very low price, but don't expect too much of it.
299	0	a	iBomber Defense, yet another IOS game that has somehow made it's way onto the PC and onto Steam with little or no development in between.  iBomber Defense is about as simple and generic as a tower defense game can get, no effort has been made towards giving the game any features or gimmicks that might make it stand out from the crowd even a little.  You place down your turrets, Machine Gun, Cannon or Anti-Aircraft and fighting off waves of enemies that try to make it to your base, occasionally you might want to repair a turret that has taken too much damage or drop down one of the equally generically named support turrets that slow enemies or increase the range and firepower of turrets in range. There is no abilities to use or interest to earn and the maps are fairly small so the entire game is purely based around optimal placement.  The truth is that there is really nothing wrong with iBomber defense, but there isn't anything right about it either. Everything about it just so bland and uninspired, it is like so many tower defense games out if they had everything but the bare essentials stripped from their bones.  With the tower defense genre growing in both complexity and polish there really shouldn't be room for a game like this, even on mobile there is better alternatives and on the PC this barely even qualifies as a browser game. It just isn't worth the time or the effort.
300	0	a	I'm sure most of you guys are familiar with the term 'tower defense'. It's a game where you build and upgrade towers to defeat waves of enemies and, later on, bosses trying to destroy your [insert something random here like a base or village]. If you've seen one of them you've seen pretty much all of them. Somehow I do enjoy playing them, even though most of them are simply clones. This one is ok I guess. Graphics are nothing special and it does what it's supposed to do. However, there are definitely better tower defense games around, so get this one if you've played through all the others.  [Rating: 60/100]
2935	1	a	This is a well-made tower defense game. It does not add anything new to the genre but it is fun and well balanced.   There is no storyline but there is a vague World War 2 theme. There are dozens of levels to play, each with dozens of waves, with each wave taking 1-4 minutes to complete. As you complete levels you earn ugrades to spend on various kinds of turrets. This is casual entertainment at its finest.  My main criticism is that some of the levels, particularly the naval levels, take too long to complete. If your turrets just sank the first super-slow but super-tough battleship, then the next dozen such battleships will surely meet the same fate. Yes, you can speed up the action, but there is a problem with repetition.  But this is a minor gripe which is fully addressed in the next game of the series, iBomber Defense Pacific. This game is quite inexpensive and definitely worth checking out if you like tower defense games!
2937	1	a	Fun little strategy time-waster. Turn your brain off (with still a bit of a challenge) and fight off waves of enemies in a static 2D map. Waves go on a little too long imho, but its still fun.  Easily worth a couple of bucks
2939	1	a	iBomber Defense is another great casual game that adds to the classic defense tower strategy genre. Its gameplay is simple, yet complex as you try to survive through waves of enemies while trying to defend your base. The acheivements are challenging, but ensure plenty of fun replays to keep you going and defending.
2941	1	a	This is my first game I ever got on Steam and I made a good choice. If you like 'Tower defense' type of games, I can really recommend it to you!
301	0	a	A simple but fun tower defense. Till level 4. Level 4 does not load, the game crashes. Do not buy this game. It's not worth whatever they are charging.
302	0	a	This game is poor... offers few options for weapons and a few updates for them. Any 'defense' game made in flash more fun that iBomber Defense.
303	0	a	I find this game to be rather boring. Even on fast forward the waves can take way too long. It just isn't really all that fun.
304	0	a	I find this game to be rather boring. Even on fast forward the waves can take way too long. It just isn't really all that fun.
2943	1	a	Great, fun, tower defense game. It's a fantastic time-waster for when I have a few minutes before class.
2945	1	a	A solid tower defense game. Set in WWII, first as the Allies in the first campaign, then as the Axis during the second campaign. This is a fixed path tower defense game, meaning the enemies will always follow certain roads or channels and you have to place towers along those paths. The land and sea paths use the same towers, with Anti-Air towers specifically for the specific areas that have air raids. The graphics are fine for an iPhone port. The sound is forgettable explosions. The challenge is at about the right level. The early levels will be fairly simple to pass and not too hard to perfect, while the later stages will challenge you to even survive them.
2947	1	a	Eh, It is a resonably decent tower defense game. However nothing really stands out about it. Pretty basic, nothing terribly special or interesting
2949	1	a	Good simple tower defense game. I had some good fun with it, though the Axis Quickplay missions were a bit more challenging than I would've liked. I recommend this game to those interested who are into TD games.  My score: 7.5/10
2951	1	a	A funny and tough one.
305	0	a	This game is alright if you have a little time to waste, but I can't recommend it.  Pros:   it's cheap    it's good enough for a standard Tower Defense Game   Cons:   Graphics are Meh   The 2 campaigns are pretty much the same   Very limited amount of different towers   enemies are kind of uninspired. theres kind of only 2 variations,    one that is untargetable for a short duration, and one that can fly   , otherwise its pretty much just the bigger they are, the more hits they can take.   If you like TD games, this one is alright, but if you are looking for a really good one that actually offers some creativity, this isn't it.
306	0	a	Crude and unrefined tower defense garbage. Looks and plays like a smart phone app. Absolutely disgraceful to release this as a PC game.
2953	1	a	Crash!...Bomb!...and Destroy! :]]
2955	1	a	If you have previosly tried this game, but at some point had problems making it start I recomend you read the last paragraph.  FIrst of all you should know my review may be kinda biased by something the dev did (altough I will try to my fullest being neutral). But I hope you have the time and will to still read it. When I bought the game it was kinda mediocre. It got few towers indeed.  Basically there is on fast hitting mg, A slower but stronger canon, Slowing flamethrower, A basic AA and depending on which faction you have money generating thingie and a mega big a** canon (I believe its main its canongun would be a very nice ploace to camp in). The thing this game has going for it placement, and the order in which you place your turrets and upgrade them. As a result of this it becomes repeat until you have learnt what to do process, but finnaly understanding it is imensily satsifying. I will not lie i used walktoughs to get through some of the levels (there I said it now someoen give me x amount of money as is regarded the right thing to do as punishment, to all politicians or politican like figures who deos something unethical uptil blowing up this planet wiht a press on the wrong BIG red button).  True enough the game can be viewed as shallow and its enemies can also be seen as spongebobby (taking so much damage that your weapons/tools lose their awesomeness) but its something imensily satisfying when you manage to complete a map on hard. Or when something about the last enemy in that wave clikcs and you finnaly understand how to repay the poor german tank commander with a family who only fight because he needs medicine for his mother or something for last time he made you lose a base life tenfold (I made four canons shot at him at the same time therefore ensuring that he probably now is going arounf orbit (there you see how the myth about moon nazis was created)).  Bottomlien is that even if it has repeat untill you learn and winn mechanic it doesnt take very long for you to understand it if you pay attention. Now the thing is if you maanage to pay attention. The graphics are a little below mediocre making it in my eyes difficuklt seing the details about for example enemy units and the like. They certainly wont make you goo with big shiny anime eyes either (quick everyone put on your big eyed anime bubblehead mask). One thing should be said about the grapihcs tough. Looking at the games from this coman in this series its easy to see a pattern so they should atleast have a clap for staying put regaridng theses games identity (the ibomber games, 4 in total as I know about). And I certainly dont think they are unpleasant to look like I jsut think they had benefitted form more details.  I at the start mentioned soemthing about the dev doing soemthing right? Well it goes like this. I bought this game over two years ago. Immediatly after purchase I became hooked. For a few weeks I played it a good deal, but then suddenly it stopped working. I tried contacting the devs got no response and gave up. recently I tried again for reasons I cant remeber (probaly impulse) and to my suprise they acctually responded after a few weeks. After giving them my specs tehy told me to wait and try it again after the end of the week. Which I did after donwloading it. To my suprsise it worked. So there you have it a happy ending. No brush your teeth little one and sleep tight. -blows out candle-
309	0	a	Gets really boring really fast!
310	0	a	I like tower defense, but you can find much better than this. Not many towers, and it's of the type where your tower placement can't affect the enemy's path, so by the end of a stage you'll probably always be in a similar position of having all decent spaces filled with the same few towers. When infantry attacks they're so tiny you might not see them.
311	0	a	There are more engaging tower defense games available. I had plenty of issues trying to select towers and other buttons. I had to click multiple times before selecting something only to click on the upgrade button just to have it deselect the tower. It made the gameplay rather frustrating.
2957	1	a	Very good Tower Defense game, probably the best on steam, great replayability and fun.  9.5/10
2959	1	a	The game is great. Has the full potential, the graphics and gameplay are doing it.
2961	1	a	This game is very addictive. Maybe its the sound effects, maybe its the blowing up of stuff, i dunno but its definitely fun :-)
2963	1	a	ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ
2965	1	a	a nice and simple tower defence best played windowed becoz its in 4:3 this is also the only reason i like pacific more (thats 16:9) but in the end its basicly the same game with a few less tweaks than pacific its worth its money for sure but if i had to pick i would get the other  8/10
2967	1	a	I found this game abit more challenging as compare to iBomber Defense Pacific, because of the Axis mode.
312	0	a	Very bland and generic tower defense game. The global map offers no strategic depth at all, without any introductory or story-like element, just letting you paint the red zone into blue one by one. The upgrades of your towers is as good as nothing, since you will get them all after the first 5 or 6 missions (less than one half of a full playthrough). So the game became repetitive very fast. Only recommended for hard core tower defense fans when at discount.
2969	1	a	Fun game to play while watching a stream or just for fun.
2971	1	a	Great fun for a tower def game! Got it via MacLife deal but it's worth it based on it's own merits
314	0	a	my computer made an ibomber on this product so I can't load this high quality product
315	0	a	I like TD games, so I picked up this one. Turns out it wasn't the best decision, as I only made it to the 4th level, then got bored. Why?  - Very few towers, with no upgradeability in missions, so you basically end up building the same towers over and over again each map. - Upgrades between missions are just boring and laziliy done. - Clunky controls - hitboxes of buttons weren't where they're supposed to be. I actually had to click multiple times press an OK button, increase or lower game speed etc. - Boring waves. I have played other TD titles that appealed to me with the first mission. But here it just feels that you play the same tactics each level, fighting off almost identically looking waves of enemies.  Overall the game feels like a first try of an indie studio at tower defense where they lacked the focus to reiterate their game design and do sufficient testing. Or just another lazy mobile port. Whichever is the case, I recommend going for other titles, as there are enough good TDs out there.
2973	1	a	This is a game to which I keep returning. It's old but still loads of fun and well-balanced.
2975	1	a	If you are thinking about buying this game call me first. I will then mail you a brick which you can break down and consume one painful spoon full at a time only to excrete it, again with pain, which you can rebuild it using your bodily fluids as a bonding agent.  After an hour of playing you will wonder why you are playing...Find a game with crystals *hint* if you are into tower defense games.
2977	1	a	Simple Tower Defense with two campaigns in WWII-Scenario, only 6 different turrets and endless attacking waves...but good for the meantime in either case.
2979	1	a	Buy this, if you don't like it throw it away &amp; buy another one because you do like it.
2981	1	a	Another fun tower defense game. Much more fun than I expected.
2983	1	a	An OK little tower defense type game.
2985	1	a	Simple, classic tower defense with some tactical depth and a high difficulty level. Gets slightly repetitive at some point, but hey... it is tower defense.
2987	1	a	It's OK. It's a basic Defense Tower game. You place machine guns , AA and cannons and upgrade them as you progress and unlock new weapons but not many. It would be great as a Facebook game but paying more than $3 for it would be kind of a ripoff since it's not very long. On the Game Scale from â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to Yoshi, I give it a Pippa.
2989	1	a	This is a fun and worthy tower defense game.
317	0	a	not really worth your time, soo many better TD games on steam alone, not forgetting on sites like kongregate
318	0	a	Very repetitive graphics and gameplay. Boring after a few hours. Feel bad that I spent what I did. Maybe worth $1.
2991	1	a	Kinda fun shooting and destroying stuff XD. Great game
2993	1	a	Tower Defense, thats literally this game. Nothing more. So if you're not into it, don't bother. It's an iOS port, it's a simple game with simple controls. It's both good and bad in that aspect, it gets to the point where you just place your turrets and want to walk away, or alt tab (but that game pauses when you do). The music gets annoying after awhile, although i play with really low music anyways I could see that being an issue for many.   Biggest problems I have with the game, even though you have different maps and 2 campaigns (Allies and Axis), the maps look different but its just the same each time. The campaign gives you a few missions at a time, kinda cool the way it does it on the gui. Quickplay is stupid unless you're going for achievements, it's litterally the campaign missions, except you have to beat that map in campaign just to play it in quick play.   The fast foward button feels like a 20% increase in speed, espeically when dealing with slower units coming at you.  5/10 This game is realy only casual at best worth getting on sale for cheap
319	0	a	Horribly balanced game. The first several missions were incredibly easy, then suddenly the difficulty jumps to impossible. The second to last mission I tried was so easy that I didn't have to buy/build a single tower for the last 1/3 of the waves. Then I couldn't beat the following mission no matter how many different tactics I tried. At that point I gave up and haven't bothered playing this again. There's too many other good tower defense games out there to bother with this one any more.
2995	1	a	Quick little stress buster!! 5/5!
2997	1	a	Simple, good for a bit of fun.
321	0	a	Game well not start Ive sent three email asking for help
2999	1	a	An excellent quick, cheap Tower Defense game. Really enjoyed it.
3001	1	a	Nice game! The best TD game in steam.   pros=  -Cheap 3,99â‚¬ -Easy to play  Problems= Display
324	0	a	A game that would be more fun if it weren't a very blatant, very half-â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ iOS port (there are still 'pause' and 'jump' buttons on the interface, and the mouse does nothing for some reason, even in menus). Even the concept is funky as hell since framerate isn't steady, kind of a killer in a game where you sometimes need to 'tap' your jumps to make it to the next platform before meter runs out.  Maybe these things will be patched! Until then I recommend staying away.
3003	1	a	Interesting Gameplay with the levitate gimmicks and not as casual as it look like.  Programmer wise. but this game lack of coating from Art style and the ONE single music gosh that loop every 20 sec or so i recommand muting the music or you get crazy lol, otherwise fun little game for the unique gameplay.
3005	1	a	Very cute puzzle platform game, if you're into that sort of thing you should check this game out.  The controls are simple, jump up and move sideways. You collect keys to open 'doors' and interact with items in the levels to achieve the goal of reaching the end of the level.  It's a simple game with a few obsticles which take a big more thinking and precise jumps to figure out, but nothing as intense as super meat boy. It took me about 5 hours to perfect the game.
3007	1	a	STORM IS LITERALLY IN THE TEACUP.
3009	1	a	It's a where the f*** do I go kind of game. But a man,a good one at that.The game doesn't hold your hand,it requires certain level of skill,you need to save often otherwise you'll end up replaying the whole level (20 mins+).It requires playing around with the files to get it running at 1080p as it usually does with old games,but it's not impossible to do.  But the multiplayer...oh my god...It's....AMAZING. Especially the servers where you've got all the powerups at max and only lightsabers are allowed.You can't just 'Mash X' to kill an enemy,you need careful planning,you need to use your powers as well as lightsaber and movement to take down an enemy player.All it takes is 1 lightsaber hit.  If you're expecting something along the lines of 'Force unleashed' ,then you'll be dissapointed.On the other hand,if you've played JEDI Academy,and you liked it,you'll enjoy this game as well.  8/10 (The navigation really is a pain in the bum)
3011	1	a	Whimsy! If you're looking to add some whimsy to your life, this is a great choice. If not, this probably won't be your cup of tea (haha). The gameplay is very simple - you're a dude who floats around in a magic teacup collecting sugar cubes and stickers and avoiding obstacles. Obstacles include lava, angry clouds, pits and various pointy things which cause instant death. What I think makes SIT special is that there is a meter that controls your ability to jump/float that rapidly depletes when you press jump but immediately starts to fill when you release it. This means that you can do a variety of midair maneuvers such as changing directions and jumping higher than you would expect. You can customize your little dude with stickers you collect (mostly just color choices, but boy, do I enjoy the different colors of magic teacup trails). There are a few different game modes. Story mode is 40 levels with no unifying theme per cluster of levels and no appreciable increase in difficulty. Some levels sprinkled in are randomly a little more difficult, but nothing frustratingly so. There is some variety as far as grassy level, boat level, underground level but like I said, there seems to be no rhyme or reason to level order. A few levels add wind obstacles or little shooting mini games and I guess this is called story mode because there are a few pictures at the very beginning and there is a quasi boss battle at the end. The 10 bonus levels add a cool new element - blocks that allow you to rotate the level. Survival mode consists of 5 levels of collecting sugar for two minutes while avoiding obstacles. You get an achievement for collecting 30 sugars in each, but I collected 50 in each in only a few tries. Challenge mode is 5 reworked levels that you have already played that have more obstacles thrown in to make them more of a challenge.   Tips &amp; Tricks - So this is the first Steam game that I have unlocked all the achievements on. They are pretty straightforward except for 3. I got the no jump achievement on level 21. (It isn't possible on many of the levels because you cannot reach the goal without jumping unless there are wind boosts on that level). I got the no sugar achievement on level 12. (Again this is not possible on every level because the sugar cubes are often between you and the goal). Lastly, I was stumped at first as to how to get the achievement for perfecting the credits level because the credits did not roll after completing story mode or after completing the bonus levels, although there was a congratulations screen after each. To play the credit level, pick Cobra from the main menu and then click on credits. (Weird).  Bottom line - Whimsy! Fun, not overly challenging but decent challenge if you are going for all the achievements which requires perfects on the levels. A nice little diversion. If you're looking for something low stress and sugar-coated, I definitely recommend this. I picked this up during the summer sale for $0.74, so just keep an eye out during the upcoming fall and winter sales if you are interested.
3013	1	a	This game is brillant! It's a simple platformer, all you need to do is use 3 keys. Left, right and jump (so space bar or A on a xbox controller). That's it. Simple; yet great! The game is quite challenging, definitely gave me so frustration but the music throughout the entire game is rather calming to an extent. As much as you get frustrated, you never feel like you want to destory the keyboard or controller. You may get very close to thinking that, but the background music just keeps you sane.
3015	1	a	This is a strange little title. It's basically combatless platforming, where the goal is to collect items and reach the goal. In spite of that, it's very relaxing and has some surprising moments. The game is almost like a dream world, where players have to jump and glide in their little tea cup to get through the almost paper cut out worlds. It possesses an almost childlike sense of wonder and glee that many games lack these days.  This game is just plain fun, if you can get past the laid back tone and the unique visual style. It's not addictive, but it is relaxing and does possess a surprising amount of challenging. Nevertheless, I never got stressed out playing this game. In fact, it's actually a great stress reliever. There are some challenge modes in the game for added replay value, but considering the price, the story mode alone would be more than enough.
3017	1	a	Storm in a Teacup is an entertaining platformer, which has an atmosphere that is similar to LittleBigPlanet. It is wholely enjoyable, but lacks multiplayer or stat rankings. 100%able in about 4.5 hours. If you have 5 dollars and 4 hours to kill out of sheer boredom, you might just have some fun.
3019	1	a	a cute platform game where you collect sugar cubes  there is no need to think in this game but the level design and the customize(you can get new skins tecaps and more if you collect a hidden object in each level) makes you want to keep playing :) the music and the colors are relaxing- 7/10
3021	1	a	It's cute but really, really casual. I can't play it longer than a few minutes. The graphics are cartoony and cute, and the sound isn't all that spectacular, but it gets the job done. The goal is to guide your character (in a teacup (!)) towards the finish line while trying to collect as many sugarcubes and stickers as you can, and, at the same time, avoid enemies. Like I said, it's casual, but the difficulty ramps a bit up later on.  [Rating: 71/100]
330	0	a	Fun... for about 5 minutes
331	0	a	1 minute in and I realized immediately that the song repeats itself over and over... every stage, the whole time, in a loop of 5-7 seconds... unending. It's so horrible that I couldn't play the game for more than 5 minutes. This is a major failure in the creators part making this game as definitely NOT my cup of tea.
3023	1	a	Casual version of Super Meat Boy.  A short game (3~4 hours for 100% completion) with precision platforming in a casual style. The player character does not jump, instead it floats like a jetpack.
3025	1	a	No.. Just no
3027	1	a	Puzzle game that has Storm flying around in a teacup, what else do you need to hear? Get it 8/10
3029	1	a	Take Storm on a wonderful adventure in his magical teacup. Storm's brother Cloud has created an amazing dream-like world for you to explore! Solve puzzles, avoid pitfalls and beat the bad guys in this imaginative and unique platformer!
337	0	a	Terrible, i enjoyed 5 seconds and then went back to play team fortress
3031	1	a	Why so difficult?
3033	1	a	Fun little platformer that works well with both keyboard/mouse and a game controller. All the levels can be completed fairly easily, but also collecting all the bonuses along the way is considerably more challenging. Recommended.
3035	1	a	Enjoyable little platformer. If you're looking for a fun little game, this will be good for an hour or two :)
338	0	a	It has Charm, but thats all it has going for it, in my opinion. It seems to me like a watered down Mario, which I didn't believe was possible to this point. The Music is repetitive which puts you off and the Charm runs off after the first few levels. 
3037	1	a	The Everest of the PC gaming world. Nothing can compare to the masterpiece that this game is, its perfection restored my faith in God.  
3039	1	a	I bought Storm In A Teacup by mistake...good game tho. No ragrets
3041	1	a	I'm not sure if I or the game makers were on lds. Why I enjoy it this much? :D
3043	1	a	Support me and get this game!
3045	1	a	To be honest this game has not THAT much conetent but thats not what i would expect for a low-price indie game. The graphics are nicely done in cartoon/comic style  Gameplay with controller works amazingly good (used Xbox Controler)  The level design is very various and shows new challenges in nearly every stage of its 40.   The survival mode*s last level is pretty difficult to master and needs a bit of multitasking but i liked it a lot.     Conclusion:  awesome Game , anyone wanna have fun for about 4-6 hours definitly buy! lovely little game!     Rating   :  8/10   (Indie-Game) 
340	0	a	This game... it's just not really good. It's very pretty! It reminds me a lot of LBP, but the gameplay... is more like an iphone game.
3047	1	a	Pretty good little game. Not very easy, not very hard, levels smartly created. Reminds me of those free games you can find online and have some hours of fun. This one is more completed and the overall experience worths its price. If you want it to get more difficult, do not content oneself with the original levels.
342	0	a	Bought this game in 2012 to make one of my friends jealous because they couldn't buy it.   I regret everything.
3049	1	a	Riders On The Storm
343	0	a	Inside a Star-Filled Sky is a game developed by the lone indie developer Jason Rohrer. Inside a Star-Filled Sky is exactly the type of game I'd expect to see win some kind of award at the IGF - but winning an award at the IGF doesn't necessarily mean it's a good game.   Insidie a Star-Filled Sky is a novel concept and little more. The game itself is themes around the idea of recursion where you 'enter' power ups and enemies. While this is a nice idea it doesn't really impact the gameplay that much and each item you enter is effectively just the next room. I did appreciate the power up mechanics. You can collect up to 3 powerups and they can be combined in interesting ways to produce interesting effects. This fact alone, however, is not enough to merit a recommendation from me.  As a product, the game is very unpolished and feels like a prototype - for example editing the controls involves manually editing a config file. There's also no sound effects to speak of, just some ambiance music.   There are some nice ideas here but I don't feel the developer took time to flesh them out into a compelling gaming experience and instead delivered us a rough prototype.  Score: 3.5/10
344	0	a	Perfect example of how NOT to use procedural generation: as the content of the entire game. This is an unfinished program with no vision. Your only purpose is to pilot around from randomly generated level to randomly generated level finding better upgrades so that you can kill the enemies in the way more easily.
345	0	a	Interesting concept and gameplay but nothing there to make you want to continue playing after an hour.
3051	1	a	If you enjoy the concept of games as art than this could be for you. I find it to be one of those games I can get lost in for a few 15 minute sessions here and there. There are some points where it's either over the top difficult or because of the power ups you've achieved it's too easy but those moments in between are great fun.
346	0	a	If I was given a chance to refund a single game, it would be this.   There is an interesting mechanic (diving into enemies, power-ups etc.) but its connection to the game is vague at best. Going into something feels nothing more than a â€œnext levelâ€ button , thus making it easier to lose track of your progress, everything looks so similar, if not identical.
347	0	a	This game has a super-interesting high concept to it. However, without any defined goal, it's ultimately pointless. There is no end-game. Have fun playing forever, or, more likely, stop after an hour or so and never pick it up again. This is Jason Rohrer at his Rohreriest.
3053	1	a	Interesting concept where you dive inner(or outer) from yourself, an enemy or power up in order to make the subject in question weaker, stronger or different in order to get to the 'next level'.  Once you figure out the concept of the game... well, that's pretty much it. There is no story so going through each 'level' is pretty much like playing in an arcade, where you are just going for the points. That's not a bad thing, but for me, I wish there was more.  I still recommend the game due to the fact that it has a VERY unique gameplay system. If anything, this game is still worth the trip, even if it is just for a little while!
3055	1	a	A very wierd but fun game that makes me think of Gauntlet for some reason  Video Review Below:  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=269705143 
3057	1	a	This game is unmistakably a return to a time when video games were more raw, unfinished, and simple. That this game appears to have depth and complexity is itself an illusion. I can count on my fingers the number of new things you will encounter as you play through the levels. My first time, I went as low as level -40. I couldn't seem to figure it out and every time you die, you go down a level. But then I started over, and am currently stuck at around level 118. There is a room full of robots that shoot enough bullets to make a japanese top-down shooter choke, and so to get past it, I went 'inside' one of the enemies to try and disable it's weapons through giving it weaker powerups. Instead, now I am trapped inside of it by more crazy robots.  The way I got as far as I have was not actually through a whole lot of careful planning or picking the right items. Instead, I find that I progressed faster by running straight past or through things to the exit. Since when you die you automatically get one of your three 'power ups' replaced with about 6 life points, you can burn through those and get to the exit. But, having done this, I am now not strong enough to proceed.
3059	1	a	Surprisingly deep. Literally.
3061	1	a	Inception:The Game
352	0	a	I get it, small, compact, limitless, indie. But it doesn't make it fun or especially intereseting I'm afraid.
3063	1	a	This is a game about getting lost in infinity. It will be one of the scary and serious experiences you can have in your life.
3065	1	a	A bit boring &amp; a bit pointless. Sorry, infinite shooter of critical acclaim ;)
3067	1	a	I truely can't understand how I'm so addicted to this...
353	0	a	'What if you could enter an object in a level and find a level inside of it? What if you could enter an object in that level and find another level inside of that?' is basically the entire point of this game, and the answer is just that it'd be a procedurally generated game like so many other indie games nowadays, but wrapped in an attempt to make some kind of fancy artistic point out of it.  Honestly, it's exactly what it looks like, though frequently far more boring than the screenshots depict. The game is described as: an 'infinite, recursive, tactical shooter'. By infinite and recursive, the designer of course means procedurally generated, and by tactical it means you'll often be sitting behind a corner waiting for the one time you can dash out without instantly dying, or choosing to run away into a different level because discretion is the better part of valor. If you're expecting good top-down shooter mechanics, look elsewhere.  The artistic point isn't worth $8, and while it managed to bamboozle me into buying the game, I have no idea how it confused reviewers like IGN's or GamePro's, who actually managed to play the game before writing their reviews. I hope.
354	0	a	I don't get this game... seriously. Why isn't there a proper tutorial ? I get the idea of moving to higher levels, and the fact that the higher you get the more enemies appear. But what do the power-ups mean ? How do I change weapons ? Can I even change weapons ? What's the best tactic ? How do I change an enemy from the inside ? And so on and so forth. This would've been a better game if things like that were explained properly. Also, the stylish retro graphics do make up for some of the game, but it just isn't enough. Let's hope the developer fixes some of my complaints in the near future.  [Rating: 66/100]
355	0	a	This game has literally no point. No plot. Just the mechanic of shrinking into objects, with no real end to how small you can possibly get. And while that in itself is an awesome mechanic... it is rendered meaningless because there's just no plot. There's nothin'. It's literally just you going around shooting stuff and getting smaller.
356	0	a	I did not enjoy this game at all.
3069	1	a	'we need to go deeper!'  An infinitely procedurally generated word. Infinite in the scope of a human lifetime.  Go into enemies to make them weaker, go into power ups to make them stronger.   Like 'Inception', except, it NEVER ends.   Insanely difficult, and hard to manage where you are. Very interesting, and majorly rewarding when you finally get to a place and plant your flag in a place NO HUMAN has ever been.  7.5/10 Try, a must if you like shooters or very interesting indies.
3071	1	a	there are no skies in this game
358	0	a	Of all the hipster indie trash I've played, this is by far the most pretentious and pointless.
359	0	a	I have no idea what the point of this game is about. no story, it's only a design idea.
360	0	a	Pointless.
3073	1	a	Yo Dawg! We heard you like shmups, so we put a shmup inside your shmup, so you can shmup while you shmup!
3075	1	a	Inside a Star-Filled Sky is by far one of the most curious games I have played in a long time. Featuring a recursive level diving type system that allows you to go into your enemies, power ups and even yourself and change aspects of the respective object to change the game around. The gameplay itself is much like many other twin stick shooter type deals but a lot more tactical. I myself am not entirely sure who I'd recommend this to but it certainly is an interesting concept.
3077	1	a	This is the soul of video games right here: one man doing all the artwork, music, and programming for a game. It's how the industry began! The result in this case is something more unique than most corporate-funded teams would ever think of, much less dare to release.  Ever seen the movie 'Existenz'? Don't. It's silly. See 'The Thirteenth Floor' instead. It's way better. Anyway, both movies tackle the idea of recursive realities. Inside a Star-Filled Sky puts CONTROL of that concept at the core of a gaming experience. That enemy's too tough? Enter him, dumb-down his abilities, exit, then waste him with ease. Alternatively, enter yourself, learn Kung Fu, exit, then waste him with ease.  Jason Rohrer has made a game that's thought-provoking, moderately mind-bending ('What was I trying to do again? And which level of reality IS this?!'), a good bit of pixelphilic fun, and simply worth your money. If nothing else, I admire his proper use of hyphenation. Support literate games!
3079	1	a	This is a fun little game to just relax with for a while. Not much meat on the bones, but worth it over time
3081	1	a	I wouldn't call this game a hard tactical shmup as it's on the level of an easier Realm of a Mad God. Anything can become the stage as you can enter another level by hopping into the up arrow tile/manually enter a powerup on the ground/enter enemies or hell even your ownself. A good game to pass the time but I wouldn't call it a difficult shmup.
3083	1	a	Indie game of the year for me. And, yes. I have played Bastion.
3085	1	a	The reviews come close to showing what this game is about, but it can't show you just how good it is because what you'll see will be different than what anyone else sees. The strategies that you will come up with will be different. It's because your arenas will be different, your power up options will be different, and your enemies will be different. This is a different kind of game.  There are only two things about this game that some people may not like. The graphics are blocky and there is no goal other than the level you reach.  If you love a challenge, and enjoy slick game design, you should play this.

3095	1	a	Spent 30-45 minutes attempting to stack 4 dead robots from the previous areas to get to an unreachable spot,  even read the hint that was given. Stacked the lot, jumped on, then found out  that the block I was trying to get to was movable.  10/10 would waste my time gathering and stacking dead robots again.  (it's actually a really cool game that I plan to play more, buy it!)
3097	1	a	Considering how cheap this game is, I'd definitely say it's worth a go. The graphics (and art style in general, as well as some of the programming) seem to be pretty sloppy at times, but it has a unique charm to it! The level design is consistently 'pretty good,' with occasional memorable moments.  You play as a BEEP robot, exploring a system to collect antimatter. Gameplay consists of mostly platforming puzzles utilizing moving, jumping, shooting, and, more often than not, the Zero Point Energy Field manipulator (read: gravity gun) which you control with the right mouse button. The game takes place in an unnamed star system with three planets. Each of the two hemispheres on each planet has its own environments, music, and introduces one or two game mechanics that for the most part are used exclusively for that hemisphere. Each hemisphere has 4 levels, which each have 3 anti-matter nuggets to find, as well as a bonus fourth one which is rewarded upon collecting ~20 smaller pellets scattered around the level. This leaves 96 antimatter parts to collect. In order to unlock the next hemisphere, you must find a minimum amount of antimatter nuggets in the previous levels, as well as getting to the end of all the previous levels.  While this game is certainly charming, it's not without its flaws. It is very possible to use the antimatter to grab an item and use it to propel yourself upwards before grabbing it and using it again, and, if you're good enough at it, can be used to get over almost any obstacle. While the game never requires you to do this, it is tempting to do it to get just a  little  more air to climb a wall. On quite a few walls, it is possible to simply drive straight up them by moving towards them, as one of BEEP's wheels seems to clip into the wall. The difficulty curve is somewhat predictable up until the last planet, where both hemispheres present environmental hazards that make the game much more difficult (though not frustratingly so). Completing levels honestly felt a little unrewarding, and I was consistently able to 100% complete levels my first time visiting, never having to backtrack. Additionally,  there is no reward for collecting all 96 nuggets of anti-matter . This may be an issue for people who invest more time to collect everything. I managed to beat the game and collect everything without backtracking in under 4 hours.  As a snobby musician, I thought the music was pretty forgettable, However, it had themes that appeared multiple times in the game, which is always interesting to discover, and the music never feels out of place. The art style feels very much like that of a decent flash game, using basic shapes and characters with cartoony eyes and solid colors. While this isn't necessarily a bad thing, it feels hastily done to me.  At the time that I'm writing this, it's on sale for $0.49. I can definitely recommend it at that price, at least. It's a cute little game, but don't expect hardcore gameplay or mindblowing game design.
3099	1	a	Now THIS is a fun little platformer, adding little quirks to it that makes it just that little bit more unique. Now I'm not a big fan of platformers (except for the good old original mario games and a few rayman games) but I absolutely loved this one.  I like how you can fly your ship around and choose where you want to do. Just everything about it feels fresh, like a whole new spin on how platforming games are made.  You play as a robot with a variety of abilities, you can jump around, grab items, drag them around and do all sorts of things with them. You can even shoot if you want. But I like defeating enemies with gravity, it's amusing.  It's hard to describe the game without showing it, so definitely check out video footage of the game and see if it's for you. If you're a fan of platformers, you won't be disappointed with this game. If you're like me and you're not too much of a fan, give it a go if you can get this on the cheap, I was pleasantly surprised and you may be too. I recommend this game.
3101	1	a	Beep is a sweet casual side-scrolling platformer. Would I tried to dismantle it, I'd saw the pieces of many other good games: World of Goo, Mario, StuntMania, with the addition of gravity beam from Half Life 2... whatever. Really I don't want do dig that deep.  You've got a rocket, you fly from planet to planet, to disembark a little robot there, which then goes from the left part of the screen to the right side, jumping, climbing, diving, shooting the bad robots, and moving objects with the gravity force... As easy as it sounds, after some time given, the puzzles getting more and more complex and challenging.  As of downsides, I really can think only of one. It is cartoon-styled and not-that-much-rewarding. Obviously, I'm a bit too old for this type of gameplay, but I'll easily pass Beep to my kids.  My mark is 7.1/10. Not the brightest star on the sky of game design, but the one made clear and thorough. Well-fit for little casual play sessions.
3103	1	a	Not a bad game actually. Definitely worth playing.  At first I thought the whole game was going to be too easy, but when things started to get a bit harder...I was like...'oh'. xD
3105	1	a	   Basic Information
3107	1	a	One might think it's a cheap crap. Well. You know. True, it's cheap but... GOOD platformer! Simple but hi-res visuals. It makes your mind work a bit to complete a level. And the sound of colliding asteroids is so sweet! :-)
3109	1	a	5.1/10 - Platformer: Disney's Wall-E with a Grav Gun!  I was fonder of playing this platformer than I thought; maybe it's that I have played so many bad ones... but this one delivered for the most part. The typical platformer template is combined with beautiful graphics and some unique gameplay. You mostly rely on your propulsion rockets and a gravity gun that can help you achieve your objectives.   Platformers can be difficult in general; and this one will cause you to struggle, but this game is more on the enjoyable and achievable side of things. There is quite a bit of content and plethora of maps to explore for the meager price of $2; caution though this game can be found on sale more often than not!  Worth the $2; I'd only pay $0.50 though since it's always on sale for that!     Accidently Reviewed
3111	1	a	BEEP is very well balanced and just plain fun to play. You know these games where you feel the dedication of the developers? BEEP is just that! Instead of playing clones and remakes of old 2D platformers why not play a modern game that brings new things to the table? Well, i wouldn't say BEEP is very innovative with it's features but it feels polished from the beginning and will surprise you here and there. For some reason, it's easy to fall in love with this game.  'BEEP' is a simple but interesting game with some cute graphics and good physics and awesome music. Nice example of how to create an indie game without being pretentious. Nothing less, nothing more.
3113	1	a	Simple and easy to follow and the controls are simple as well.  Simple game, simple layout, simple enemies.  'Simple' losses its meaning after a while while playing.   11/10 'Would kill a bot and throw the corpse at other bots again'
3115	1	a	A great platformer that soothes your nerves after a long tensed day!
3117	1	a	BEEP is a 2d platformer in which everything is tied to physics. You control a small robot equipped with an anti-gravity device, a jet pack and gun. Drive, jump, fly, swim and shoot your way through 24 levels across 6 unique worlds. Enjoy and have fun with this great game. 62/100
3119	1	a	That game... is AMAZING, but pls. add co-op.
3121	1	a	Nice, colorful, platfrom game with peaceful music.   One of the best games for 1 euro.
3123	1	a	I gotta say, so far I'm loving this game! I liked it enough that I bought a copy and sent it to the dudes at Steam Train. I hope they have as much fun playing it as I did :D
361	0	a	The default resolution doesnt fit in my screen and there is no option to change it.
3125	1	a	Great game for casual play. Fun twist on traditional side-scrollers. Well worth the price.
3127	1	a	Well , the levels are really challenging despite of it's childish background. I recommend this game to you if you suits the following list of targets. 1. You like to play ' looks like ' baby-level, low - inteligence but surprisingly challenging games 2. You are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ 3. Your IQ is critically low 4. You are a lolicon 5. You are too rich that you want to throw money away for any games to level up the game count badge in steam profile. 6. You are bored to a point that you will do anything for fun NOTE : This game doesn't have manual settings for changing resolutions , language options, convert to window mode , or graphic level. You will have to access the files yourself.
3129	1	a	Really fun! The controls and physics puzzles are great. I love the graphics and sound too. My only complaint is that the mechanics remain very flat until the last 2 worlds. The difficulty feels just perfect.
3131	1	a	dam funny game XD and 0.19â‚¬ on sale hard to say no to that, remind alot about Mario meets LocoRoco so a good mix but self dislike Mario and worth playing
3133	1	a	Simple and nice concept game 7/10
3135	1	a	Not bad for a fairly cheap game :)
3137	1	a	creative adictive game, love it
3139	1	a	Had tons of fun playing this game.  Just finished it, saw that the story is to be continued, but haven't found any updates on it :(  Overall it's a great game for a cheap price.  10/10
3141	1	a	It's just nice to play, the game constantly shows you what you have to do and it's still challenging. The sound effects are super cute and it's just a fun game. Sometimes you have to think back to the very beginning of the tutorial in order to progress, that way it shows you how to combine different techniques. I find Beep very adorable, maybe because his sound effects remind me of R2-D2 :D
3143	1	a	BEEP is the first title out of BigFatAlien, and judging from the quality of this litle gem, BFA is someone to watch.  The core gameplay is always accessible. It is a physics enabled 2D platformer that harkens back to the days of Super Mario and the ilk. It feaures a nice overworld to let you choose levels, and has a simplicity about it that is charming.  The BEEP itself is a darned cute character that certainly has my vote for President when he decides to run.  Music is top notch, sound design is great, and visuals are styled well and look awesome.  Easily worth the money. Stop reading &amp; go get it.
3145	1	a	Finally tried this little game. Simple and fun puzzle platformer, I was surprised for 19 cents.
362	0	a	  To be honest, for a five hours to complete game its not that bad for a 2$ game, or 50 cents if you get this on sale.  Unfortunately, the description is kind of a lie.  I was not thinking at all about Yoshi's Island while playing this, granted there might be some similarities due to it being a 2D platformer, and the fact that you have to go through all the levels of the game. The reason is because yoshi's Island was at best a platformer to anything else, and was loved by gamers because of its classic artstyle and the challenge that was always looming around.  Also, there were boss stages, which unlike in this game, where while it seemed to have built up to a boss it actually wasn't, and it just add more to how there is a lack of any tension to your journey. Really you're just strolling about and at best nobody would ever need to even check a walkthrough because the game is too simple with how you collect items, as secrets are pretty obvious.  That being said I'll give to the devs credit that the physics are definetly impressive and at times I was genuinely impressed with the possiblities they made with them. Sadly, the said potential is kind of locked for the current stage, and the mechanics are different for each of the four stages, basically giving you something new to work with only to be quickly abandoned. It's quite pointless if you ask me.  As for the 'hardcore', the only part that was a challenge was the last stage, only because there are no checkpoints where it feels like there should be, and I'm pretty sure its where you'd probably quit the game by that point, especially since up to this point the game was fair enough in its challenge, only to bombard you with tiny careful jumps along with deadly fall right at the end.  In addition, the only other difficult part is that sometimes puzzles become unbeatable because you might end up accidently throwing the blocks you essentialy need out of your reach, which I feel like they haven't thought it through, and it shows.  That being said, the story is not entirely bad (but sure as heck disappointing) and the graphics are fairly decent for an indie game...Too bad the game already crashed to me once (I think) and at some points did in fact got some major lag for such a minium req. game, and my PC isn't even high-end at best but can still run much bigger games which is why I assume the lag is on the dev's end, plus whenever a certain enemy explodes it seems to almost tear space and time as it glitches into black boxes everywhere...  But hey, if you want to waste 5 hours and dont mind wasting less than a dollar on sale go for it, although if you want to at least seem like you have a decent library of games on your steam account, then you should probably skip this, it's not really worth it.  On a quick note I checked one of the dev's blog. If you absolutely hate clifhangers then yeah stay away from this game. These guys ain't making a sequel, and sure as heck don't deserve any positive review just for that.
3147	1	a	Addictive and fun. Can not complain about the price too!
3149	1	a	BEEP is always on a high level like each triple-A title. It has a awesome main menu which feels like kerbal space program just in 2D, like minecraft and terraria. The game itself is feels like a Super Mario game just with guns, big guns and explosions and a lot of action. The story isn't so good as i thought, but it's definitely on the same level of quality as the assassins creed series or even the battlefield series.  11/10 would accept gift again 
3151	1	a	Great game for 20 cents. Lol.
3153	1	a	 An awesome platforming game with a robot
3155	1	a	Cute robot explores new worlds and has to solve small puzzles. Great little platformer! I really love the art and idea and wish this game had been little longer because I would wanted to see Beep in more adventures!
3157	1	a	Fun game, quick to get the hang of, graphics and physics are smooth. Have not gotten very far in it yet but I actually look forward to playing again. 8/10
3159	1	a	Very fun, is intuitive and easy to waste time on. Also it is cheap and the level select is cool! 8/10 would BEEP again
3161	1	a	Very fun, is intuitive and easy to waste time on. Also it is cheap and the level select is cool! 8/10 would BEEP again
3163	1	a	Very fun game, flawless controls and great physics. Feels much more than 25 cents.
3165	1	a	Wall E meets super mario!! Game is amazing and for 0.19 cents you will def get your moneys worth!  Pros Scenery  Physics  puzzles soundtracks/ effects difficualty  Checkpoints  Cons
3167	1	a	This game is actually quite good! Whenever it goes on sale for dirt cheap (pennies to a nickle I mean) then give this one a chance.  All around took me about 3-4 hours to complete.  Overall there were some fun and interesting physics puzzles that require a good grasp of platforming.  It's all cheap, clean, and has really nice challenge to it at the end of the day.   Pick this one up, Ladies and Gentsï»¿
3169	1	a	I liked it. It was a interesting little platformer. Some interesting powerups, and collecting all the antimater pieces.
3171	1	a	Simple yet fun.  This game is prollly intended for a 5-8 year old. Dangit, apperently I'm too young to drink....
3173	1	a	Pretty decent scroller. It doesn't have controller support(it uses the mouse to aim), but the style is pretty fun anyway.
363	0	a	+ nice idea + simple game - boring - nothing special through entire play
364	0	a	BEEP is just not vey interesting and feels very much like a flash game. I didn't find it too bad at first considering the 19 cents I paid, but after an hour or so I was already bored. The gravity gun is not very fun to use and a lot of the game seems to be just stacking stuff so that you can get up. I wouldn't compare it to Yoshi's Island at all.  The most annoyng thing about this game is the very robot you play as. It babbles and screeches in a high, annoying voice, and you get to hear gems like 'â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you' over and over again when you shoot enemies. But unlike some reviews claim you can disable the sounds and music.
3175	1	a	Press R to re-load your weapon.  that should be included in the tutorial.  no other complaints, great game.
3177	1	a	I didn't expect to like this game. The graphics looked too simplistic, and I mistook it for a half-baked effort. It isn't.  If you've ever liked platform games that ask you to stop and think up your movement beforehand rather than have lightning reflexes, you are probably going to like this game. It is a light-hearted puzzle platformer,  There is not much frustration to be had, at least up until the part I've reached so far. You casually bounce around platforms, collecting thingies and shooting badies. When they either kill you, or you fall to your death, you respawn on one of the rather frequent checkpoints. You have infinite lives as far as I can discern, so no pressure there either.  I've said that on the review of another game too: I'm in a phase in my life that sometimes I just need to squeeze a stress ball to unwind from my day, I need my off time to be relaxing, not stressful. Taking gaming way too seriously is in the past for me. This game suits me just fine. It's one of the anti-stress squeeze balls of gaming. If this sounds like something you'd like, give it a try.
3179	1	a	HELP I'M STUCK!!!   http://i.imgur.com/ijtcKNp.png   This game is some puzzle game you see in floating around somewhere in a vast desert. You enter it and try to play it in some unintended way and now you're stuck inside it so completely and the only thing that can advance you forwards or back out is to glitch the physics in some hilarious way. And the whole damn maze keeps spinning and you use your jetpack and it just keeps spinning even harder. You use your anti-gravity to hold it in place and try to turn it someway so you'd fit through the next tight crevice you're stuck in. And it continues.  I feel both the gun and the enemies are a bit unnecessary for this game, unless you could fight them using your anti-gravity to fling objects at them. I have yet to know if there are bosses, but I haven't seen one in the first level yet. This game would benefit from physics based combat.  And the best part about this game is the physics, whether it gets clever or wonky. It's the kinda game you can make your own humor with. Something funny is bound to happen.  This is an amazing game for its price. Buy it! If you get this for 20 cents, the trading cards you sell even pays back this game's price, making it essentially free.  Hint: To reach a high place, stand on an object, jump, fling that object up at your feet, then jump on it to do a 2nd jump in the air.
3181	1	a	It's kinda interestly made. It looks simple but it really isn't. Great job makers!
3183	1	a	This game is intimate and funny. And the price is good and if you wait for a good deal you can buy it cheaper than 0,99â‚¬ but I think it is good price. And you can get trading cards.
3185	1	a	Charming game. Would recommend for no more than 3$/2.50â‚¬.
3187	1	a	My friend got me this as a joke for Christmas.   It's actually a well made physics platformer with a surprising level of challenge.  If you enjoy platformers, buy it. If you don't enjoy platformers, it's so cheap you may as well try it.  I guess you could say it's pretty BEEPing good :^D
3189	1	a	10/10 WOULD PLAY AGAIN   LIFE SIMULATOR 101  FRIEND BOUGHT IT FOR ME AND STOPPED ME FROM CUTTING  WOW MUCH GAME VERY MATURE  A TON OF BLOOD AND GORE BUT THAT'S GOOD.
3191	1	a	Who buys this at full price.
3193	1	a	Me : Hey i bought BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP Friend : wut ? Me : BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP Friend : whats kind of game is that ? me : u control your beeeeeeeeeeeeepppppp friend : -_-  10/10 best name ( it worths his price tag , when i am bored and i have no idea what to play .... just ..... beeeeeeeeeeepp)
3195	1	a	Very good timewaster, excellent little indie and to some it all up it only costs 5 bucks and i got it on sale for 27 cents!
3197	1	a	It's no secret by now that indie games are rarelly worth booting or installing, let alone pay for.   This is one of the exceptions. It is a charming, well conceived game made by people who cared what they were doing. This alone gets my thumbs up.    I recomend it for young players especially.
3199	1	a	Great game :D
3201	1	a	I bought this super cheap because it had Steam cards and it turned out to be a super fun indie platformer with occasional rocket interplanetary experience.  Totally worth it!
3203	1	a	BEEP is a game that pleasantly surprised me. I wasn't exactly sure what to expect with a $0.19 price tag, but this game really managed to grab my attention. Essentially you're contolling an endless fleet of robots that are exploring various planets and searching for 'matter'. At your disposal you have a gravity gun that allows you to manipulate objects as well as a machine gun for dealing with enemies and traps. In addition, you may find other tools to use on each planet, such as a rocket fueling pad that allows you to fly. Here are my overall thoughts:  Pros: -It controls very well for the most part. The gravity gun can have a few hiccups at times, but otherwise the game functions as intended. -The enemies and other obsticles give the game a bit of challenge, although the game is very forgiving with checkpoints, infinite lives, and no loss of collectibles upon death at the same time. -The puzzles that this game presents allow the player to be somewhat creative by allowing them to manipulate a majority of objects in the environment.  Cons: -The art style is very simple and not extremely detailed. The game's environments are, for the most part, plain. -The music is not very memorable. -Enemy placement forces the game to be played very slowly, but the game's forgiving nature provides no sense of urgency. Essentially this makes the game feel very slow at some points.  Overall, I would say that BEEP is definitely a good game for casual play. It can be rather relaxing, in fact. While it is rather simplistic and minimalistic, that adds a certain charm to its overall presentation, in my opinion. I would definitely recommend it at its sale price, although at full price I'm on the fence.
3205	1	a	A small and fun game to play a couple of minutes if youre bored of your current game. I bought it in a sale for les then 30 cents, so worth it.
3207	1	a	this is great indie game ever..that reason why i love play indie than else
3209	1	a	THe price of this game and the fun it gives is a steal. Totally worth getting. :)
3211	1	a	A fun physics puzzle / exploration platformer. I am enjoying this quite a bit. Some of the puzzles are challenging, but so far most are extremely easy to solve. I hope they increase the difficulty a bit once I land on other planets. The desert definitely ramped up the difficulty. One cool thing to me was it was written in SFML using Box2D and some other stuff, which I hadn't seen very often. Definitely a cute, fun, casual game I'll hopefully beat some day.  + Cute graphics / story + Very fluid and simple controls + Beautiful example of Box2D physics  - Kind of easy so far
3213	1	a	It's okay. It's a pretty good game to waste some time in when you're bored. 6/10
3215	1	a	Excellent Platformer!!  Bought it on sale for less than 1 dollar, simple graphics but really fun  Can`t use a gamepad, only keyboard + mouse. anyway once you get use the control is excellent.  
3217	1	a	I'll preface this by saying i paid almost nothing for this game expecting a game that wouldn't really be worth much.  What I got was a game that i've already played more than any of the AAA titles I have in my library in the past year.  Love the game, it's definately something you will like if you're into casual or puzzle type games. could see myself enjoying it even if I paid full price.
3219	1	a	very fun :) I give 16.2/17.5 cause its fun and full of BARNTA. I CAN TAKE A BIT OF BARNTA BUT THIS IS JUST BULLYING. ALIRRRRRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT
3221	1	a	Simple, colorful yeah may be too much simple but it has a gravity gun! Give it a change
3223	1	a	Get it soon now, as it got big discount, only cost few bucks. It's a good game to wasting your times btw
3225	1	a	So far of what I have played in this game has been amazing. This platformer is a must buy and is unique.
3227	1	a	-pros &gt; good learning curve &gt; humor &gt; The chance to say beem me up scotty every level &gt; Good puzzles &gt; enough gameplay to justify the price &gt; No cons -cons &gt;None  100/10 game ign
3229	1	a	It's like they say,you cant judge a book by it's cover...likewise here
3231	1	a	This game is bra
3233	1	a	Awesome little Yoshi's Island/Half Life platformer.
3235	1	a	This game is awsome! The level design is good and can be challenging at times. I love the sound affects from the chacters and the music. The game also has a lot of levels and will keep u busy for a LONG time.
3237	1	a	cute and easy
3239	1	a	Nice game, Kinda high price for just a flash game tho, And fps issues. But still its cute and stupid af
3241	1	a	BEEP is a good little platformer that would be awesome if it had controller support. It also lacks a menu, meaning no settings of any kind. These 2 things really keep BEEP from being a great platformer. Platformers are meant to be played with a controller, imo and settings(windowed mode, sound) are nice options to have too. As is 5/10, would be 8/10 if it was complete.      
3243	1	a	Really entertaining, especially if your looking for a random cheap game to play  10/10 dead robot stacking is fun  
3245	1	a	Great game. I'm skeptical about games with large discounts but this was worth the money and I reccomend this no matter what the cost
3247	1	a	This is a very interesting game! 'BEEP' is a game for kids who want to learn some smartness! :D
3249	1	a	I have been playing this game for a little while now and I would have to say it's worth purchasing. If you are into platforming games I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy this.   Especially with the current sale going on it's definitely a good game to add to your library.  I did a short First Impressions video on it showing the first 10 minutes or so of the game if you're intersted.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnEjDax3XFs     Social Media Twitter -  https://twitter.com/kovicplayz  Youtube -  https://www.youtube.com/kovicplayz  Twitch -  https://www.twitch.tv/kovicplayz/profile 
3251	1	a	Awesome game, is a cool and nice game, I love it.
3253	1	a	Beep is a top class game with so much room for activites. I would recommend this to my closest children and mostly to bailey, happy shopping.

3259	1	a	BEEP!...*Force Close*
3261	1	a	mighty beep
3263	1	a	Fantastic little platforming game. Does a pretty good job of mixing it up and introducing new mechanics at regular intervals: each world has a unique set of properties and hazards. Lovely art, along with an excellent and fitting soundtrack, make this a gem of a game.  Possibly the best dollar you'll ever spend; well worth the asking price.
3265	1	a	awesome game my friend gave me it :D
3267	1	a	Cute, Lame, Old Fashion Game, Puzzle, Little Action, Child-ish I give it a 6/10 Still under my recommendations
365	0	a	The biggest problem with this game is that it's  unpolished .    The main feature, the physics beam, is awkward to control, and it lets go at the most inconvinient times.     The art is inconsistent and underwhelming. I'm not sure, but I think I could have done most of the art assets in MS Paint. And the semi-realistic gold nugget looking things are supposed to be antimatter? Please, just do a Google search and find a better asset. The same few enemies and bits of terrain are also resued over and over, which results in a boring, static experience.     There is very little challenge and no penalty for failure. If you die, the only thing you lose is time off your life as you respawn at the latest checkpoint with no golden antimatter nuggets missing and the enemies respawned.This obviously makes it very easily to cheese some antigold nuggets by suicide-jumping them.     The reload feature is instant - just press 'R' - and you never stop shooting. It may as well not be there at all for how much it impacts gameplay.    There are some good bits, of course, but not enough to justify the full $5 price. Honestly, I've seen better games written in Flash for my browser.
366	0	a	In BEEP, you are in control of a small robot that is used to explore other planets. It is mostly a platform game with slight action and puzzle elements. There are basically zero options provided to the player as far as graphics are concerned, and the game engine seems to have serious problems with frame drops and performance on a modern computer. The general presentation is basic, upbeat, lighthearted, adorable, and for all ages. The world map is amusing, as you are allowed to navigate through space with your ship and bounce off asteroids or space debris. Each planet looks different than the other, and the levels appear to have been designed well. The controls are implemented adequately, and are quite responsive even in the more dire platforming situations mixed in with some shooting or the tricky anti-gravity device. The robot's wheels also have an excellent grasp on terrain, which makes for some forgiving moments if you are new to the genre. All of this is not without some major problems related to performance. The game runs terribly on a modern computer that more than meets the minimum requirements. The massive frame drops, excessive lag, terrible slowdowns, and extreme choppiness make it unplayable. Others have experienced similar problems, and proof of it can be found in the game's Steam forum. This is actually quite unfortunate, as BEEP seems to be a good game at its core, if it weren't for the performance issues that break it. Perhaps with some developer tweaks and patches, BEEP will live up to its full potential and be enjoyable.  BEEP is mediocre.
3269	1	a	Nice BEEP... Game BEEP...
3271	1	a	A fun and light platformer, with puzzle mixed inside.  Yes this one good enough to be played.  What's more? it also have trading cards. Features : -Ability to shoot enemy -Ablity to elevate thing with magnetic power -Ability to jump and fly (unlocked later in-game after few stages)   7.5/10
3273	1	a	I still remember when the game came out back in 2011. I loved BEEP so much. I was pretty yough back then, aroud 8 years and a half. I prayed to BEEP every night hoping he would come visit me. My brother once caught me in the act and called me a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. On one faithful night BEEP did come visit me, he came through my window with his jet propulsion system. His tractor beam was quite big, it hurt so much but I do it for BEEP. In the end BEEP gave me all the anti matter.  All of that to say: 10/10 would BEEP again
3275	1	a	Best game for Best price!!
3277	1	a	Imagine a space colony star trekking with rovers from planet to planet, collecting cores and annihilating resisting inhabitants, only to deny the laws of physics with said rovers. That is BEEP. I still wish it came with a horn I could honk with ingame.
3279	1	a	Made by the people who brought you such games as: BUZZ, LOUD SOUND, and the adult swim website as a whole   BUY IT NOW
3281	1	a	The game is simple, move around, pick stuff up, shoot enemies, and do some platforming. Can entertain for a while.
3283	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
3285	1	a	CUTE BEEP.
3287	1	a	BEEP is a very good game. Set in a new system, somewhere far away, in a 2D land, there are BEEP ships, they have BEEP's on them. The ships create the BEEP's and you control the BEEP's, trying to get all of the matter in each level, to unlock more levels. Pros- Good puzzle game Good controls Easy to play Easy access and start menu Cons- 2D Unrealistic Some puzzles are too hard too solve Glitching... The game is an okay, 2D exploration puzzle game- I give it 8.5/10
3289	1	a	 https://youtu.be/YAVdF1xAj3M   The first 30 minutes of gameplay are contained in the video.  So far, BEEP is a decent platformer with some clever use of physics, but it's really not my cup of tea. I found the core platforming mechanics to be too floaty, and I don't care for the BEEP robot's design or animations.  Given that the game is an indie title and operated mostly bug-free (save for the need to change my audio channels from 8 to 6 to prevent crashing) I can give these few small complaints a pass and offer a thumbs up to fans of the genre.  One caveat, however - if you're looking for a platformer that offers something new or innovative, I don't believe that BEEP is what you're looking for.
3291	1	a	Fun little platformer game similar to Mario. It did not work properly at first. My game was only partially visible. Playing it in windowed mode solved the problem. Worth getting on sale.
3293	1	a	The good:  -Art; -Space traveling being 'the levels lobby' for missions; -Gameplay is polished for this platformer; -60Hz; -Trading cards;  The bad:  -Menu Options; -User Interface; -Repetivity.  Score: 6/10.
3295	1	a	BEEP is a puzzle game where you solve puzzles with a gravity gun and kill a bunch of evil robot thingys which are... being evil in the star system your BEEP-Ship has discovered. Your BEEPs must explore 2 very different zones across the each 3 planets in the system collecting anti-matter along the way. Each zone is 4 levels long and each level and zone increases in difficulty. Each level has 3 chunks and 25 nuggets of anti-matter. Collecting all 25 nuggets will award you a fourth chunk. Anti-matter allows you to unlock new zones providing you've completed all the levels in the previous zone. You will traverse methane oceans, volcanic valleys, a purple forest and death, so much death. You can get a total of 96 chunks of anti-matter although you only need 60 to unlock the final zone. At the end it's hinted there may be a sequel!  Paragraphs? What are those?  Rating: 9/10 because I get angry when I die.
3297	1	a	Best 19cents ive spent in awhile.
3299	1	a	This is a 2-D physics, puzzles, shooter and platformer. BEEP is a Wall-E like robot kind that have a gun and a gravity like gun. You need to stack, pull and grab your way across three plantets with two sides to them each. Fight the KREEP and find out what is going on.  This is a 2-D platformer with puzzle and some shooting. You can throw your enemys at other enemys to kill them and some need more then your gun. Reload with E, This game is without voice acting and platforms will deliver the story.  This is a shortish cute game that is kinda low priced but if you fancy yourself a puzzler or want to get into it then this might be an easy entry path. For all ages, no blood. You got 8 hp, if you die another BEEP will take your place at the checkpoint. Even I managed to complete it 100 %. No achievements but you can complete it but there is no completon bonus. I hope you found this helpful. Have fun, enjoy and BEEP them all :)
3301	1	a	Simple but addictive Game, 10/10 Amazing for its price. Would love to see a multiplayer ;)
3303	1	a	  Beep is a very fun game considering the price, it has good controls the level design is pretty decent in the way it works with the controls and what beep can do although this game is less than a pound and it can show at some points other than that beep is a fun game and is worth the money 7/10 p.s i just realised I said I got this for free I read the box wrong sorry about that
3305	1	a	better than csgo &lt;3 only 20cent :)
3307	1	a	I bought it for low price and had no problems with this game.
3309	1	a	I doubt that there's any I could say about this game that it doesn't say about itself. Definitely worth grabbing while it's on sale.
3311	1	a	Its actually a pretty good platformer.
3313	1	a	There's some nice, quirky puzzles here, but ultimately very little else but for me it still worth it in that cheap price
3315	1	a	Plus: Fun, casual little side scroller. Good physics, challenging gameplay. No annoying timers or limited lives. Minus: Redundant graphics and music. Does not include many Boops, per capita of Beeps.  AMD Phenom II X6 1100T 3.3Ghz. 6GB DDR2 2.5TB 7200RPM, 16MB, SATA II 16MB/s Cable/N300 Wifi XFX 2GB Radeon 6950 Vizio 42' 1080P 3D LED
3317	1	a	I have to say, I am impressed. I bought this thinking 'cheap little platformer' and got a wee bit more than I bargained for. Those that know me know I do not give easy recomendations. But, for the couple of dollars I spent, I have well gottom my moneys worth so far. Decent artwork, fun content, lots of levels. And thus far, fairly good levels to boot. I'm not sayig Beep os the Mari... must not use trademarked name... of the robot world. but it's been a lot of fun thus far. I'll let you know if that changes. 8)
3319	1	a	big profit for me, this game for 19 cents and 30-40 cents for cards, so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing good
3321	1	a	I bought this game for my friend as a troll, when he kept asking me for GTA V. I bought it for myself to mock him, and I've come to actually enjoy this game. After that, I bought my friend GTA V, but we are still playing this game.
3323	1	a	The itself is so boring but beep is so cute he'll have you coming back for more &lt;3
3325	1	a	I bought this game for my friend as a troll, when he kept asking me for GTA V. I bought it for myself to mock him, and I've come to actually enjoy this game. After that, I bought my friend GTA V, but we are still playing this game.
3327	1	a	It's fun .... I mean .. it's fun :))
3329	1	a	Surpisingly fun. It's hard but the neat imagery makes it less of a rage than a platformer like Mario. Plus, it's only $2USD, and it goes on sale fairly often. I'd pick it up. I got it as a random key but I'm glad I did!
3331	1	a	A fun little game that is quite simple but still makes fun. Recommended if you like Puzzle/Indie games.
3333	1	a	Beep Beep and i got some cards XD
3335	1	a	  The Brave Little Toaster Rebooted
3337	1	a	Bought it for the trading cards, but it had me hooked for a couple of hours. Fun little platformer with a few physics-based mechanics. Not much more to it.
3339	1	a	I bought this game for 19 cents. Walked away for 7 hours. Got 3 trading cards and sold them all for 27 cents. 11/10 would profit again.
3341	1	a	20 cent game entertained me for 6 minutes!   10/10
3343	1	a	I am a 18+ years old guy and I play this game. Tell no one!
3345	1	a	Small n1 platfor game :)  
3347	1	a	BEEP is a very fun and Enjoyable Platformer Game But I Would Prefer it Even More if there was Controller Support but that might just be me!
3349	1	a	Very nice game,
3351	1	a	  Well it is a Platformer (nothing againts) it has real experiance to make it a challange to players whats fun a bit... but in my oppinion its great i like the art work and it felt like i got to beat it all :P
3353	1	a	I got this when is was on discount so i dont mind if its good or bad. I played it and it was a pretty decent game. I played it in my spare time and stuff. You should buy it but there is 1 problem i had, In the loading screens it would most of the time crash.
3355	1	a	IT's ok i guess.
369	0	a	  Ok, so here we go. I got this game from a raffle so I guess I shouldn't be complaining, but the 'Yoshi's Island + Half-Life Gravity Gun' is a prettty much a lie, at least on the Gravity Gun part. The so called 'Gravity Gun' works more like Garry's Mod's Physigun, using a beam to pick up and throw things and the only way you can launch ojects being pushing or 'throwing' the object at enemies. The game also isn't customizable, so you have to use the layout it gives you. The screen size was automatically set to fullscreen and the resolution stuck in one position, rendering me unable to see anything but one quarter of the screen. The gameplay itself is ok, a lot of the time the help bubbles couldn't really be understood though with spelling and grammar errors. The music is pretty good though, the physics are neat, and the art style nice, but unless you are super duper bored, don't buy this game. It makes good raffle, gift, or trade filler though. I think this game could be better with achievements to give reason to collect all the anti-matter and beat every level.
3357	1	a	Surprisingly fun little game.
3359	1	a	I skipped through the tutorial and didn't know what to do, so I ended up flying around the space map for 20 minutes before I found out what to do.  10/10
3361	1	a	^â€¿^ â’ºâ“…â’¾â’¸ â’¼â’¶â“‚â’º
3363	1	a	Awesome game. My girlfriend and I played co-op. I controlled BEEP's movement, she controlled the grav/blaster gun. Very simple/easy mechanics up until the last part of the last level where you want to pull your hair out.  Get to last level. Stoked Get to last part of last level Difficulty spike Jump onto narrow platform that immediately starts dropping Panic Immediately attempt to jump to next platform Next platform is moving Die Repeat Get past where I was before Do series of precise jumps Die Overcome precision platforming See the end of the level Jump with reckless abandon Win  10/10 would fall in lava multiple times again
3365	1	a	I don't write reviews but this 10/10 AAA title from the people that brought you Colin McRae World Rally, torture simulator and Just Dance 3 is a classic to last through the ages. From the simply beautiful soundtrack to the amazing realistic 4K graphics, this game delivers on every single level. I would play this game 25/7 if there were enough hours in the day but unfortunately there isn't, so I cant. Please buy this game, an absolute masterpiece. 'If at first you don't succeed, buy BEEP' - Me 
378	0	a	No diffrence between this and a flash game on the internet
3367	1	a	Old but gold.
379	0	a	Nothing noteworthy about this side scroller. The gameplay is fairly tedious and doesn't really incentivize someone to keep playing.
3369	1	a	Interesting game
3371	1	a	BEST 24 CENTS SPET IN MY LIFE :D GIVE A COOKIE TO THE DEVELOPER!
3373	1	a	Good game but can make you rage.
3375	1	a	I didn't expect much - after all, the game was just 19 cents. But nevertheless, I started playing and actually it's not bad. It's a lot like Super Mario Bros., but you're a robot that shoots rocks instead of a short, fat, Italian dude with a handlebar mustache. On sale I would definitely recommend it, but even a full price it's still pretty good.
381	0	a	Worst game ever seen in the history of selling games. Maniability awful (target system and inerty extremely bad), soundtrack bad (I played with my music), no comment for graphics, and this is the concept of a flash game (some flash games are better AND FREE), I didn't see any fun in this game, but some people did, so maybe try it. If you want to rage and be frustated (I learnt I could be the most important rageous guy cause this game), buy it ONLY when it solded (0.19) but i advise you to go on Miniclip it's still better. It's a shame to sell this game 5 euros.... =/ And when some ennemies exploded, several big black square appear on your screen (=bug) and when plateforms become small, you can't see it cause these buggies. A shame 0.5/20 because there are plateforms
3377	1	a	Interesting game if u want to lose 1-2h. U can try it sometimes.
3379	1	a	Was worth my 19c even if I only played it for like 12 minutes, but yeh its a preety nice game with intense music playing in the backround that just makes ur armpits cry smelly tears.
3381	1	a	Super cute. Just a fun little Mario-inspired side scroller, with a side of Wall-E.
3383	1	a	This game is underrated,A LOT.This is one of the best puzzle games ive ever played in my life,its challenging!It combines outstaning graphics with amazing physics and hard puzzles! 9/10 would buy it (was gifted)
3385	1	a	Its a fun game, good to get your mind off things :)
3387	1	a	Better than War thunder
383	0	a	 It's boring, save your money  - even if BEEP were free, it wouldn't be worth your time.  BEEP feels like someone's first learning project in a game engine. The story is pointless, the mechanics are boring, the gameplay is too simple, and the art is bad. For example, BEEP can fire bullets at enemies and obstacles - that's cool, but what is the point in having an option to reload if you have infinite ammo anyway?  If this was a mobile game, my review would be different. BEEP is okay for throwing a few minutes into here and there, but as a computer game, entertainment feels forced and I quickly lost interest.
3389	1	a	buy this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
3391	1	a	Take the f****** checkpoint, because 'The 'Lie' its a 'cake''.    After this game -&gt;&gt; Einsten genius -&gt;&gt; P. Nobel of Peace -&gt;&gt; Die  11/10
3393	1	a	Cool game
384	0	a	I don't play free flash games in my browser anymore, I pay $0.50 and download them on steam now.
385	0	a	This game is so *BEEP*
386	0	a	This game is pretty terrible to be fair. only paid for it to activate my steam account really wouldn't recommend unless mind numbingly boring is your kind of thing.
387	0	a	boring
3395	1	a	What the BEEP is this game?  jk it is pretty fun
3397	1	a	You can actually throw enemies to your enemies.
3399	1	a	In my opinion this game is really cool puzzley like and cool adventure also it gets 10/10 from me :)
3401	1	a	I love this game... I love...I LOVE IT!
3403	1	a	Asked Steam for a refund because I didn't really want this game. Accepted my refund. Never gave me my money back. Wanted to try playing it again. Have to buy it again.
3405	1	a	Classic platformer with good idea. I liked it =)
3407	1	a	It's now become a running joke between my friends whenever it goes on sale  10/10 would joke about bad game again
3409	1	a	Why did i buy this?!
3411	1	a	best fps game in world
3413	1	a	Beep Beep Beep. That's will you feels whenever to play this game. Somehow this game also pretty dark fo me. Especially when you already found the finish line but still couldn't find the rest of orbs in the map and the OST is catchy enough.
3415	1	a	I wish beep can kill and throw my ex around like he does with his enemies
3417	1	a	interesting physics. I'm a man of small words because as you may have seen in other game reviews, people write extremely long reviews and I just don't understand and people will definitely say that I am off topic which I am just to make this review really long just as a joke because I am talking about really long reviews for games and I can't even think what to say next which makes me sad because people will say that this review is too short so I wil end it here.
3419	1	a	Very fun game. Although I haven't finished it yet I think it's very entertaining.
3421	1	a	This is, in all honesty im completely serious this isn't even a joke, the best game I have ever played.
3423	1	a	Be careful if you buy it for money, your friends will all turn on you and make you regret every wrong thing you did in life and call you an idiot for it.    9/10 would enjoy it if I didn't have friends.
392	0	a	Controls are very not tight in moments where they need to be which is kind of game breaking, otherwise very very casual gameplay. Camera placement is pretty bad.
3425	1	a	It's a platformer, and if you don't like platformers this probably wil lbe no exception. However, it is a startlingly good platformer with some fun mechanics. The gravity gun is fun, and the levels are somewhat challenging and have a solid amount of variety.
3427	1	a	and i love this game all ready... BEEP!!!
3429	1	a	Really entertaining!
3431	1	a	I say this with no sarcasam at all. this is possibly one of the best puzzle platmormers I have played to date. I genuinely recomend this
3433	1	a	it look a little weird at first, but it gets really addictive despites the kiddo like graphics
3435	1	a	A very well made and polished indie game, I really like the variety of the levels and how you want to complete it all, great buy, and if it goes on sale for like 12 cents again get it instead of that CS:GO skin.
3437	1	a	Beep is a Steamified flashgame.   It's hard, but not to hard and worth the 1$.  Why do I say this? Well, what's 1$ to support a developer that creates a game for young and old.  I really enjoyed playing the game, hence I created a video out of it:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ3-cVjPZFo   If you are looking for a fun, stylish, easy to control, Space robot game than this is it for you and your kids.
3439	1	a	Wall-E on steroids
3441	1	a	I only play with the level selection screen. 69 outta 10!
3443	1	a	A pleasant enough little platofrmer worth getting on sale, maybe not full price. You will get an afternoons worth of enjoyment if you finish it in one sitting.   Gotten as part of the platformer bundle, this was one of the decent little gems within.
3445	1	a	The visuals make me think this is clearly made for a five to eight year old. That says it's a great game for a kid that age.
3447	1	a	Not Bad :)
3449	1	a	This game is a GREAT platformer. Different than the stereotypical one because you can use/alter/destroy a portion of your surroundings and there are lots of puzzles to solve. The only thing that could possibly make this game better would be steam achievements, since some of the puzzles are quite difficult, and it would feel good to get an achievement for some of them, or general accomplishments.
3451	1	a	Didnt know where i got it. got cards. gg no re â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
3453	1	a	Dark Souls for Robots 8/10
3455	1	a	Beep is a fun lil game and u shud get it.
3457	1	a	&gt; Killed a robot &gt; Chopped him apart &gt; Grabbed his leg &gt; Killed his waifu with his own leg &gt; This game has fully trained and prepared me and i feel that i am now ready for my new life of pursuing a career as a full time Robot.  For real: This game has a phenomenal environment, and world is beautiful and very detailed.
3459	1	a	Easy to play, Simple but beautifully rendered graphics. Plot is a little weak but hey, whaddy'a expect from a game which costs less than $10? 8/10
3461	1	a	I wasn't sure if I should spend 21 cents on a game that I might only play for 5 minutes to write a review on, so I looked around and found a few nickels and dimes on the floor.  Sure beats spending 25 cents on a bubblegum and I even came out with 4 more cents to my name.  10/10 would find change on the floor again
3463	1	a	Trading Cards ! It was cheap and not so bad after all.
3465	1	a	For $.19, not a bad game.
3467	1	a	Worth Playing damn Enjoyable Game .
3469	1	a	you drive around picking up POPS my favorate cerial!  10/10
426	0	a	Played about two minutes of it.  It needs controller support.
427	0	a	it is not loading right
428	0	a	why..... just why
429	0	a	very boring
430	0	a	Has some of the worst level design I've ever seen.
431	0	a	Im veryy mad at this game. I buy it for $5 and it goes down to $2 and I dont get anything in return? wow devs. kys
3471	1	a	Pretty fun. Not really worth 2 dollars, but on sale for 50 cent is pretty reasonable.
3473	1	a	Don't shy away just because it may not look as detailed as other games- this can be hours of fun!
3475	1	a	This game is awesome and fun! I reccomend it!
3477	1	a	Worth Playing damn Enjoyable Game .
3479	1	a	I just want card drops.
3481	1	a	This is a fun little game to play for a few minutes here and there. Very simple to control.  The price helps too, so cheap. Trading cards are an added bonus.
3483	1	a	I'm not sure why this is in the popular new releases. This was the first game I bought on steam...4 years ago.
3485	1	a	I think this small, cheap game is great to kill some time. The music is stunning and the visuals are simple, yet charming. I like this game alot and play it from time to time.
3487	1	a	BEEP is a game that I recommend because: - is a method to banish boredom - have a good price - have trading cards - is a indie game  Enjoy!
3489	1	a	WALL-E was back
455	0	a	Looks like a flash-game from 2005.
3491	1	a	It's like mario, instead as a robot (with an antigravity gun, and machine gun). Very enjoyable game, feels great to complete a level. Pros: -cool soundtrack -interesting graphics -price -trading cards  Cons: -no achievments :((  Should you buy this game? Yes. A very enjoyable $5 game to keep you entertained for hours. 10/10 would play robot mario again
456	0	a	not worth it!!!
457	0	a	5/10 Scotty, beep me out  No matter if it's concept, engine, artwork or gameplay, everything feels like the devs have bitten off more than they could chew. After a complete overhaul (that hopefully doesn't make it stutter and lag on a 2015 PC anymore) it might be worth your money.
458	0	a	Makes no sense for me.You are a robot and you collecting nuggets? wat? Also the game is not funny for me.
459	0	a	This game is as fun as my dead goldfish.

493	0	a	got it for free, would never buy it
494	0	a	I got this game for 50 cents. Theres no way in hell this game is worth 15 bucks
495	0	a	An awesome platforming game with a robot  I had doubts about this game on the first try, choosing the levels were weird for the first time, but after a few levels, it became clear for me, that level choosing is awesome and creative. The game in overall is lovely, story is a bit weak, but I don't think platformers are about the story.
496	0	a	If you need welfare and life threatening debt play this game 4/10
3509	1	a	Better open-world exploration than Skyrim
497	0	a	  This game is horrible. Please for the love of god and your wallet, do not get this game.
498	0	a	With the sticky, unresponsive controls, to the sheer force enemie throw at you, no wonder this game was 50 cents.
499	0	a	easy to bored..
500	0	a	Cannot recommend this game. Nothing fun here for me.
3511	1	a	its a good game but not worth 5 bucks. buy it when its on sale for 20 cents.  10/10 would sell 4 strange weponds again
501	0	a	game crashes on startup support - as stated in the readme - not available at all obvious cash grab is obvious
3513	1	a	Very Nice Game! 10/10!
502	0	a	Ugh waste of my money!
3515	1	a	Having cute playing style, BEEP is a good game for killing time. BTW it's the second cheapest game (next to CS:GO) to collect Steam cards and as the game itself is only 0.19$ now, don't miss the chance!!
3517	1	a	I haven't actually played this game but it looks nice
516	0	a	This game can get boring easily. The level select is very confusing, and even if you liked it it would take a while to get use to. I don't recommend this game, not because I don't like it, but because of the game mechanics, how it works, etc. Its kinda fun at the first level or two I guess, but the game is pretty repetitive.
517	0	a	CSGO: 300-350 FPS  Minecraft: 500-600 FPS  BEEP: 35-55 FPS  Best optimization 2012
3519	1	a	hello everyone, i hev pleyed this gem all me life and it is very fun good gem. this gem tjenged my laife is very good game.
518	0	a	This game is a lot more crappy than the trailer suggests. But hey, it's only 0,19 so can't complain but would not buy it again.
519	0	a	Don't buy this. Now, some people will dislike this because I don't explain much, but now will I explain all you have to know.   You. Can. Find. A copy. Of. This. On. Y8 or something similar.
3521	1	a	Wall-E + Mario + Scrap Mechanic = BEEP Yoshi + Jets + Robots = BEEP Spaggetih + MeatBalls + Drink = Yum
3523	1	a	BEEP is a game of puzzles and a mix of shooter combat, but also adds a cute art.
525	0	a	After trying BEEP several times, I just could not find it interesting enough to continue. Its mechanics are unique and add a level of puzzling to its platforming, but the overall experience leaned toward being cumbersome and not particularly enjoyable. This is in contrast to Mario games from which it draws inspiration, where moving through the world is intrinsically entertaining. The average graphics and abscence of story give less meaning to the experience. It's a game I would play if there weren't much better ones, but there are.
526	0	a	The worst game ever played. Can't do anything. Gliches everywhere. Highly not recommended
527	0	a	OMG this game does not worth $14.99 eventhough i bought it for $0.99. This game is so boring and low budget, kinda like Mario for 2 year-olds and boring boring and boring.
3525	1	a	Came for BEEP Saw BEEP Played as BEEP Killed with BEEP Had fun as BEEP  10/10 Would BEEP again
3527	1	a	BEEP has great promise in every aspect of it's game, even to the point where I was expecting it to have hairline accuracy with it's controls.  That is however one thing that you must not assume. When you aim at an enemy it auto-locks, great for shooting under cover, bad for tracking moving enemies. In this case every enemy killable, moves. Sometimes it locks at an angle where the bullets you shoot will miss regardless of where you stand, making some scenarios only passable if you lose one block of your health.  But onto the good part! I never found any puzzle that were the same. Some made me feel stupid, whereas some made me feel like a genius in the making, but no two puzzles were the same. Every obsticle you encounter is one you must figure out by yourself, whether you do it by stacking the mangled scraps of your enemies, or by propelling yourself upwards by using the tracer beam to slam the corpses up onto the underside of your BEEP.  Every 'Planet' biome has their own theme and puzzle styles that never borrow from the previous planets, allowing a fresh experience every time you move from one biome to the next. Definite plus.  This is a puzzle game It also feels like a rage game at times. no. It's a rage game.  Also I hate the insufferable flying mines that chase you....
3529	1	a	by far my most favorite puzzle game of all time with action, platforming, puzzles, and of course the best part: robotic underwater birds that shoot spikey landmines at you!  the only problem is the jump how you can boost yourself but if you only do it a little bit you cant boost again til you touch down again.  9/10
528	0	a	dont buy this 
3531	1	a	Very fun is all i can say :P
3533	1	a	Looks stupid, but it's epic!
3535	1	a	Cheap And A Nice Game Buy It If It's Cheap, You Don't Want To Spend Lots For This, It's Cheap All The Time... (Not Exactly).
3537	1	a	Pretty fun! it has some nice puzzles and the gameplay is legit!
3539	1	a	EDIT: THIS WAS FIXED! :D Thank you Developers! Before you read: I have tried to send this to the support email, but I couldn't find it. I would recommend this game but as soon as I start it up it crashes. It gives me a blank white screen and a pop up. I'm running Windows 7 Home Premium. 64 bit operating system. I bought the game for 2 of my friends and myself. Seems to work for them but not for me. I'll change this review to positive once this is fixed.  This is what it says:    Problem signature:  Problem Event Name: APPCRASH  Application Name: BEEP.exe  Application Version: 0.0.0.0  Application Timestamp: 4de80ab3  Fault Module Name: fmodex.dll  Fault Module Version: 0.4.32.3  Fault Module Timestamp: 4cadf0ad  Exception Code: c0000005  Exception Offset: 00019edd  OS Version: 6.1.7601.2.1.0.768.3  Locale ID: 1033  Additional Information 1: f15c  Additional Information 2: f15c5f683107b4382ab134b3b30e3b0a  Additional Information 3: f589  Additional Information 4: f589e7c3cb2c3feb155ce682264d5b67   
3541	1	a	This is not a word I use to describe games much, if at all, but the game is very cute. The robot known as a beep, is very much like a WALL-E, and makes appropriate 'cute' sounds. I actually crack up quite a bit from the sounds it makes, and the art style and music also follows along with the theme.  The puzzles aren't too difficult, and the platforming is very forgiving. The jumps are very floatly, with a very generous gliding back down to the ground. Combine that with the anti-gravity gun, and you have some good control over the robot. He even goes up surfaces with it's wheels that you wouldn't think he could climb up.  I would say content wise, the game is safe for children, however some puzzles might cause the child to want some adult help. Even still, I think the game is friendly to people of all ages, and I highly recommend the game. I was thinking this was a game I'd only farm trading cards out of, given the extremely low price. Instead, I found a game I intend to play through, and enjoy very much.  A surprise, and an enjoyable one at that.
3543	1	a	I am so impressed. You have the choice to play this game as serious as you like. Grab some friends, if you haven't got any, meet some friends! Team up, and have a blast.
3545	1	a	Very fun, visually asthetic, pretty much bug free. CHEAP! Get it
3547	1	a	I really was surprised with this game. I didn't expect it to be as good as it was. Beep has a very good character, and decent difficulty as you get to the later levels. I picked it up for only .19 cents, but I would say it can be worth the full price of only $5 as it is very fun, and I haven't even finished everything there is yet.   I would absolutely recommend this game for anyone who is a fan of side scrolling platformers with a little bit of puzzling, and collection =P    First Impressions Video   
3549	1	a	This game has got to be one of the best I have ever played. The sheer attention to detail is quite evident. How challenging this game is makes it even more enjoyable. 10/10
3551	1	a	Absolutely perfect! If I don't have to sleep I'd play it until morning. :) // Kesinlikle mÃ¼kemmel!! Uyumak zorunda olmasam sabaha kadar oynardÄ±m bu indirime kaÃ§Ä±rmayÄ±n. :))
533	0	a	I purchased this game for about 14 cents, and while I did satisfy my curiousity, this game really began to grate me only half way through my first hour.  The concept is charming enough, and the whole project just oozes cuteness, with the sounds that asteroids make when you bumb into them to the little phrases your robots utter when they do something notible or die. Infinite lives and fairly placed checkpoints were quite welcome, While it does have the atmosphere of a first time game, and while it came out a few years ago, it's a surprisingly competant one, especially given what Steam is saturated with nowadays, although the flash game aesthetic doesn't help.  That being said, the floaty controls and precise platforming required do not make for a good time, although it doesn't start that way. Describing itself as a hardcore platformer to me indicates the controls and mechanics will be fine and precise, yet like the fleshed out flashgame it is, you won't find that here.  Following basic platformer rules, BEEP introduces new mechanics every few levels or so, and getting the super hard to reach goodies even early on demand a mastery of them. However, you're little robot friend is quickly tasked with some fairly convoluted puzzles, implementing a poor man's gravity gun that doesn't work half the time, and when it does, it controls like dead animal caught in a wind turbine. Some enemies, which you can also use the g-gun on once killed, have parts that you can't hook onto, effectively turning off your beam and having you drop it. Repeatedly. This wouldn't be so bad if there weren't areas that called for the use of these enemies, or the requirement to be precise with the positioning as you're forced to move quickly instead of methodically, but of course I wouldn't be complaining otherwise. It doesn't help that the gravity implemented is a pain in butt, and although you're little robot has a jetpack in which it can launch itself in the air and decent traction when it lands on an edge, you can't use it to stabilize or adjust mid jump, leading to some frustration on already floaty controls that are mired by the fact that majority of the game is just bland chasms with chunks of platforms spread far out of eyesight.  It doesn't help that there is a function to fly, but it's purely locational, and only works when you find a pad that lets you charge it. Nevermind the fact that you can't use any remaining jump fuel to adjust, the fact it isn't a permanent upgrade, and something you have to constantly go back and recharge until you know exactly where you're going isn't my idea of fun. Implementing a metroid style progression system wouldn't be hard, and because I constantly felt underprepared no matter what level I went into left me more frustrated than anything. Combat is especially weak, and while your shield isn't awful, your gun is extremely weak. This being said, I barely managed to finish the second to last level of the first world out of sheer will before throwing in the towel, so if there are any permanent upgrades, I didn't find them. That isn't an excuse more so than it is to say that even the base game isn't great to play, and there is no driving incentive outside of seeing the next area, which is basically just a pallet swap of the last in one way or another.  BEEP is not a bad game by any means, but it's not one I can reccomend. Still, since it was put on sale because of the studio about to announce a new game. I truly wish them all the luck, and for the small amount of pennies that they ask for on sale, it's worth it just for the trading cards. Regardless of how I feel about this game, it's without a doubt better than 90% of the other crap being dumped onto steam, so hopefully they've improved over the last few years.
3553	1	a	Nice game with pretty good idea with lovely little robot :-)  Verdict: 6.5/10
3555	1	a	I'm sure a lot of people look at this game and immediately move past it because of the graphics. This is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ thing to do for reasons I should think are obvious. The game starts off with a couple short levels for adjusting to the controls and once that's done the game becomes fantastic.  Solid soundtrack, fun and simple physics mechanics which are easy to pick up and hard to master (the best thing for anything to be really), good pacing in terms of new things being introduced to the player. It's a quick little game that doesn't waste a lot of time but just all around feels good to play and has a lot of charm. Whatever, if you like platformers then grab it
3557	1	a	I killed my time with this game. 8/10
3559	1	a	I mean it kind of looks like a 20 cent budget game, but it's pretty fun. Good level design, relaxed soundtrack, charming artstyle, and a lot of content, even for full price. The physics can get a bit wonky, especially when you're on top of objects, and the lack of any video options at all are baffling, but I'd say give it a go.  On the other hand, Bad Rats is on sale right now, so spend your quarters wisely.
3561	1	a	its a great game do play when you are bored cause its really funny and makes you flexible
3563	1	a	Interesting arcade with funny voices 'woop-peep-peep' :D
3565	1	a	so I played this game for 1 hour and I bought it for a 96% discount, so it costed me only 0.20$, my 1st expression when I saw this was like, might as well offer the game for free with this discount :)  it`s original price is 5$, I have bought like 6 copies of these to send them as gifts.   -gameplay:- the game is pretty easy to play and very fun, but one most be sort of skilled with keyboard and mouse to play the game enjoyably, I don`t think it supports gamepad.  -graphics:- its one of the simplest 2d graphics I have seen but it`s crafted well and looks nice and smooth. I really love the simplicity factor but the menu layout could be better.   -story and puzzles:-  its about a robot ships being sent to out space in the future to discover planets in other galaxies. u simply orbit the planets with ur little rocket ship and hit deploy on various places on the planet to deploy the little cute catty sounded robot.  u face plenty of obsacles and the game appears to have many missions, u have to stack stuff, block things and slide things to reach your goal. nothing too complicated but it`s fun and rewarding.   conclusion:  coming from a hardcore, eye candy fps, strategy and racing gamer, this game may not be as appealing but after I played it I truely loved it. it`s definitly a kid game. but one must always keep the inside kiddo in us alive and happy :) I`m definitly gifting alot of copies to my young cousins since they would love it:)  I would say it's even worth 5$ full price and even better with 96% discount.
3567	1	a	A nice platformer with a cute character and style
3569	1	a	This is an extremely fun game and its 20 cents right now. I would pay twenty cents for the level select area where you fly around the space ship. For 5$ this is still a great game. Its really fun.
3571	1	a	that OP song, I love it :3
3573	1	a	Really isn't my style, but was worth the 0.19 cents i paid for it :).
3575	1	a	This game is pretty cool, the anti grav thing is awesome and fun to use.
3577	1	a	This is a very cool game.One item you get is he gravity gun (Half life 2 reference) and an oil gun.You travel around different worlds and shoot robots with the oil gun etc.
3579	1	a	very enjoy game appreciate 1010
3581	1	a	REally fun game when you're bored and want to plau something
3583	1	a	super awesome for relaxing 11/10
3585	1	a	BEEP is a nice puzzle-adventure mix. At first I was deterred by the combination of simple graphics and the realistic physics simulation, but after a couple of minutes I got used to it.  In the game you have to jump through the levels, solve puzzles, collect stuff and shoot some (few) baddies.
3587	1	a	simple game, but has a lot of fun.. need multiplayer though...  
3589	1	a	A very cute 2D platformer that pulls you in for more, daring you to find everything. --RATING-- 80/125
3591	1	a	I got a coupon for this game, cost me 50 cents. I still cant believe how entertaining this game is, serioulsy! Graphically, it's kinda ugly, like a flash game, but the gameplay is fun, and the controls are really solid! Fun for killing time, definitely.
3593	1	a	Lovely little game, worth the few cents, excellent classic gameplay.
3595	1	a	this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is actually pretty noice
3597	1	a	a realy fun but hard game
3599	1	a	Yes... Yes and More Yes.. BEEP is a highly addictive game with elements from your favourite games from yesteryear. A brilliant example of creativity and superb game play. I was hooked from the first level and already will recommend this to everyone.
3601	1	a	Great game for the money at only 15p, worth it!!!!
3603	1	a	+ space - poor starting location
3605	1	a	IT GOOD TO KILL TIME
3607	1	a	Mario in beep version. It's cool to play it at work :))
3609	1	a	So goooooooooooooooddd... its free trading cards are like 55 kr then this game is 40 kr :) hacks 
3611	1	a	Nice game for $0.11
3613	1	a	What an awesome game, very fun, definately worth my 19 cents i got from steam trading cards. I'm going to play some more now.
3615	1	a	Such a good game I've been playing it for hours already. BEEP will never get old. I
3617	1	a	I bought this game at 96% off for the cards, and expected it to be terrible.   After playing it, however, it's actually quite fun.  Personally, I feel like I've robbed the devs at Â£0.15.
3619	1	a	I got this game for 19 cents i made my money back in 5 min thanks to the steam tradeing cards xD. So buy it
3621	1	a	The realism in this game is out of this world
3623	1	a	It's hard to find good games that are 19 cents.
3625	1	a	At 21 moose cents, you are making more moeny off of the trading cards. might as well buy it.
3627	1	a	Didn't know what to expect from this game but it turns out that it wasn't that bad. For the price of $0.19 and being able to collect the steam cards makes this game definitely worth.
3629	1	a	So Cool game!!!!! Very cool game! i like alote!
3631	1	a	This is an amazing game definitely worth that 21cents on sale, this game not only is a good 2d platformer but in harder levels it gets physics. But with 21 cents and free trading cards for profit. Nothing can go wrong!!!!!!!!!  Definitely Recommend this game!
3633	1	a	Nice 2D game ever :D :D :D featured puzzle and adventure  the main goal of this game is waiting drop trading card :)
3635	1	a	If you are under 11 years, then I recommend
3637	1	a	It has a few graphical errors every once in a while regarding background textures, but it's otherwise an enjoyable game
3639	1	a	I am not 100% sure I can recommend this game. I don't even know where I got it from.  If it's free or under $1, then maybe. If not, then no. It's like someone ported a flash game to Steam. It's pretty bad, but that's what also makes it funny.  Fly into the sun? No problem. Turn around and fly away.  The main bulk of the game seems to be a Super-Mario type of platformer with guns and a gravity arm. Or somethi- HNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG 
3641	1	a	great game
3643	1	a	if you are out of games and bored you will play this.
3645	1	a	5/5 Better than bad rats
3647	1	a	10/10
534	0	a	The biggest challenge are the controls, as they are pretty bad. I do recommend this game if you are about 6 year old, though.
3649	1	a	BEEP is a fun adventure type platformer    The levels are nicely designed, and can be completed somewhat easily. If you are trying to obtain all the antimatter particles, it becomes quite a bit harder.    While the graphics are not realistic, they fit in with the games design very well.     The visuals are unique and fun.    Solid platforming engine, no bugs glitches or clips that I could find.  Overall, it is very well done. I highly recommend picking this game up, and for less than the cost of a move, you will get hours and hours of enjoyment.
3651	1	a	good game.. dark regions are annoying though
535	0	a	it's anoying... the gameplay, the sound (except the bird sound, that's awesome), the enemies it's monotone, and not more than any free online flashgame
536	0	a	For me, it's not worked ... control is horrible
3653	1	a	boring
3655	1	a	The best game you can get for 19 cents!
3657	1	a	6/10
3659	1	a	Such Cheap Much Card Very 10/10 Wow
3661	1	a	I do recommend this game.
3663	1	a	I can`t rage on this game. The characters are really cute and the levels are interesting as well.
3665	1	a	Awesome platformer! You can jump, shoot at enemies and throw stuff (including the remains of the robots you destroy) at the baddies! I found it tough to move around with the keyboard and shoot and drag items with the mouse, but after you ge used, it's really good. I recommend this game to any platform fan!  ================  IncrÃ­vel jogo de plataforma! VocÃª pode pular, atirar os inimigos e segurar e jogar vÃ¡rias coisas no mapa (incluindo os destroÃ§os dos robÃ´s que vc destrÃ³i) e nos inimigos! Foi duro, no comeÃ§o, se mover com o teclado e atirar e segurar s objetos com o mouse, mas depois que vc se acostuma, fica show. Eu recomendo este jogo para qualquer fÃ£ de jogos de plataforma! :D

3671	1	a	Very fun, feels like something nintendo might come up with
3673	1	a	Pretty, awesome game :) I had a little retro-feeling in it, but that lil' robot is so cute :)
3675	1	a	A very nice game  relaxing
3677	1	a	Very simple but fun if u got time to burn.
3679	1	a	This is the best casual game that I've played in a long time. It includes elements of puzzle, platoformer, and shooter that combine together into an excellent game. 10/10  (I'm surprised that I got it for 19 cents)
3681	1	a	Must be an app of this :D !!!
3683	1	a	this game is pretty fun
3685	1	a	wait what  why am I having fun

3689	1	a	Great little game with brilliant color and runs so smooth on mid-end PCs. Fun to play and smart use of abilities in the objects found in the environment; a bit of simple tweaking can be done to get you over a seemingly unscalable wall just by using the bodies of defeated robots and the random mass blocks that work even better, especially if you remember to throw them ahead of the screen to use again for the next obstacle. Can't wait for the sequel.
3691	1	a	Casual fun that is still challenging
3693	1	a	BUY THIS ON A SALE FARM FOR CARDS TO SELL *POOF* EXTRA MONEY FOR YOU
3695	1	a	What am I doing with my life?
3697	1	a	Actually a pretty fun game. The gameplay can get repetitive at times, but definitely worth buying (if you wait for a sale that is)
3699	1	a	very very very very swag flash game
3701	1	a	Beep is an attractive indie platform game that suffers from somewhat frustrating controls.
3703	1	a	A+! 5 Stars! 10/10! It's wonderful in everyway!
3705	1	a	I bought it to troll my friends while they were in a very important game of H1Z1, always when they are in the top 5 left and it alt-tabs the game to see  'Your friend has gifted you BEEP!'  *Friend dies in game*  10/10 would kill my friends again for 20 cents
3707	1	a	I thought this game was an excellent little playthrough and provided a good solid 5 hours of game time. Well worth the puzzle-like problem solving that the game required to collect all the items for each world. I would love to see a continuation of the game in the future.
3709	1	a	It's not bad i recommend this game, graphics are not the best but when you play this game after 1 hour you will like that game
540	0	a	I'll start by saing BEEP is probably worth $2. My negative recommendation is not based on the monetary cost. I wouldn't recommend BEEP simply because I don't think it's worth the time you would put into it. Pretty much every part of BEEP can be considered 'just good enough,' but the game lacks polish in all departments. The graphics aren't bad enough to be offensive, but don't really bring anything to the table. The controls are adequate, but it's pretty obvious no effort was made to tighten them up or make them any better once an acceptable implementation was found. The level design adequately makes the player use the game mechanics in the way they were intended to be use, but it seems like no one went and made the small adjustments to improve the gameplay ever so slightly. Overall, it's just okay, and personally I don't think it's worth the time or effort.
3711	1	a	I don't like platformers, but sometimes... Damn it, sometimes i play games like BEEP much time.
3713	1	a	Its a fun game that has phisics and has lots of stages and puzzles so you won't get board of it for a while. If you like puzzles this is a game that I recommend.
3715	1	a	Hmmm about this game i see. Game is stable yet complicated at times. Person might have to figure out stuff by themselves even though the game mentions what to do its still not clear. It was a pack deal but the game is worth the money. I can play this for hours and not get bored
3717	1	a	not bad game, you must play it ! :)  nice graphics with great control. 
3719	1	a	BEEP is a very good puzzle game! I recommend it! I love the gravity gun!
3721	1	a	I like this game very much, It is a very fun platforming game whith some challanges here and there. This game is really nice to have when you are bored/dont have any connection to the internet, i mean it only costs like 1 euro when its no sale goin' on so why not?  Have some exrtra money just waiting for lord GabeN? Why not spend it here?  I totally recommend this game like a 'secondary' game or offline game but it isnt something you wait all day long to come home and play after school but its a fun physics/platform game and my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ computer always hits around 60 fps so dont worry about the specs of your machine.
3723	1	a	Not bad at all. There's nothing else here but good physics based platforming, but for the price, BEEP is a quite a charmer.
3725	1	a	Great for kids. Its like portal without the portals...and for kids. Id say 12 and under more than likely. I couldnt handle the cuteness after 20 minutes
3727	1	a	Okey is the word I'd use for this, okey graphics, controls and sound. But the price makes it worth picking up. 4/10
3729	1	a	For this price it provides a lot of fun. It can also get a bit tricky at times, especially at the end, but for the most part it just feels too easy. What I really don't like, is the lack of options in the main menu. There is also no way to rebind your controls or change resolution, but overall it is still a good game.
3731	1	a	Love these devs.  Not to often you see a dev making fun of themselves. 'In 2012... We released the worst game ever'    The game is pretty fun overall, glad i got it to support them :)
3733	1	a	The game is $1. You pay $1 dollar to play Halo, Killing Floor, and Quake at the same time. You also get a lightsaber. What's not to love?
3735	1	a	Still better than CoD Ghosts
3737	1	a	i mean... i dunno it's alright, it's kind of god awful in a hilarious broken buggy kind of way. But it's a dollar for a few hours of super cheap fun. You have to pay more for a can of coke than this game, and though coke is tasty and refreshing, this game costs less money and therefore is better than coke.
3739	1	a	This game started as disaster with a good idea. With the newest Update a lot has changed and it needs a review from all the bad voters.... it tooks a while but the devs made the effort to finish their product (not like many other bigger studios out there) Worth gaming. Worth buying.  8/10
3741	1	a	Seriously, if you were paying 0.99$ for it, then why are you expecting a 29.99$ game ?  As lots of you may have known that there are some bugs and immature 3D imaging issues, including shooting delay and broken graphics, but I actually have had a lot of fun in it.  Killing dinos with friends is simply fun, with various choices of maps and gameplay mode. If you don't see it as a dedicated gun game, you'll probably make it easier to enjoy.  In short, personally, paying 0.99$ for a 200-hrs+ game, that was just worth enough to me. Would like to see how this game improve in the future.  ORION: Prelude [7/10]
3743	1	a	It has its problems, but is lots of fun.
3745	1	a	360 noscoped a T-Rex for 0.49â‚¬ 10/10
3747	1	a	You can fight a T-Rex in a mech. That's all you should need to know, unless you live a small, sad existence.  (like the sort of person who makes daily comments on the same Steam review)
3749	1	a	Ah yes, Orion: Prelude, or as it will always be known to me, Orion: Dino Horde! This game has been quite criticized through the years (and in all honestly quite rightly so). they game if filled with bugs and lots of tedious grinding achievements. Still, despite all that I can't help but to love it. In fact it is the only game which I haven't uninstalled after reaching 100%.  So, there's no story to follow in this game and it's a pretty straightforward king of game. You're dropped as one of three classes (assault, recon and support) into a base where you're supposed to defend a generator against incoming waves of attacking dinos that don't enjoy your presence there. If all teammates dies or the generator is destroyed (a timer starts when it reaches 0% health and if it isn't repaired before time runs out it's destroyed) you all loose. If you survive all waves (10 for normal games and 30 for conquest games) then you win. Pretty simple. To your help you can buy a quite big assortment of weapons and perks and each class comes with a specific perk of their own (assault can jetpack, recon can cloak and support can heal).  This game has a lot of various pvps but there are only a couple which I really enjoy such as king of the hill and team elimination. The place where this game really shines is in regular Survival mode when you play together with a good, tight and cooperative team. This is where this game is at it's best! I don't think I've made as many friends in any game as I've made in this one.  So, in conclusion, if you want a good cooperative game and don't mind a few bugs here and there and can either ignore, or work through all the grinding achievements then yes, you will enjoy this game!
544	0	a	Both the publisher: TREK Industries and the devs: Spiral Game Studios should be permanently removed from steam. Not only do they steal assets from other devs, they have a long track record of not following through on there development promises. They try and undermind the steam review system by removing valid reviews, they changed the name of a game they never finished so they could re-release it and make everyone pay for the same game twice while abandoning their first game. I for one will never buy a game from this publisher again, not for $10 and not for $0.10. Devs that only have one release game should not be allowed to rename that game so they can release it again to make more money and cheat their customers. If you like Dinosaurs consider buying Ark, survival of the fittest is free, seriously Ark made a second game and charged nothing at all. What is your excuse TREK Industries/Spiral Game Studios?
3751	1	a	Perfectly Simulates Jurassic Park If It Was In Russia.
3753	1	a	For the sweet price of $1 there is little to comlain about.  I've bought $5 sandwiches and spent only 3 minutes on them. This I've spent over 5 hours. That's like 60 sandwiches.   10/10 Would have more sandwiches.
3755	1	a	  TLDR version; 
3757	1	a	A T-Rex threw a rock at me and knocked me off the triceratops I was attempting to ride for an achievement 10/10.  But â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, it was ninety-nine cents!
3759	1	a	OLD REVIEW IS OLD. AND NO, I'M NOT GOING TO UPDATE IT BECAUSE I'M A LAZY â™¥â™¥â™¥  First off: Metacritic score is wrong as it's for the previous game 'Dino Beatdown'.   Now, let's go with the review: The game is awesome, I've never seen a dev team update a game this much. Since release they added lots of weapons, maps, game modes, dinosaurs... Sure, it's rough around the edges and some things could use some improvement, but the overall experience is good. Really good. Just imagine a team of space marines flying around and shooting at dinosaurs in various settings, jungle, forest, desert, you can even shoot dinos in the snow now!  The game modes add a lot of variety to the game, there's Survival (where you have to defend a base against the horde), Rampage (classic survival, just stay alive) or Conquest. Conquest is the newest game mode and it's like Survival x10, multiple bases, open world, day-night cycles...  Then there's the PvP for all you guys tired of shoot at dinos, you can shoot your former teammates or even challenge them into a duel (1v1 pvp mode) where you use laser swords to kill each other like the Jedi. Oh, and there's this game mode where you can play as the dinos. From the Spinosaurus to the Compy.  There's level progression too, leveling up unlocks starting weapons and habilities like, for example, in Killing Floor.  I give it a 8/10, really fun and addictive.

3763	1	a	Many people asked me about the game â€žOrion: Dino Hordeâ€œ. So I have written a review now. ^^  First I have to say that the game has just 36/100 Metascore. But the Metascore was for the game 'Dino Beatdown', not for 'Orion: Dino Horde' and the game hasnâ€™t only changed the name, its totally different now.  For many people itâ€™s still not a good game, because of a not perfect graphic (uff.. for me the graphic looks alright â€“ I would give for it 7/10 points. â€“ You can take a look at my Screenshots), some bugs (really the most Shooter Multiplayer Games have bugs/glitchesâ€¦) and the not so realistic weapon sounds or I DONâ€™T KNOW WHY!  Reallyâ€¦  I LOVE THIS GAME!    For me itâ€™s like a mix out of â€œPrimal Carnageâ€ (Jurassic Park Style) and â€œKilling Floorâ€ plus you have more possibilities in this game. The aim of the game depends on the mission you choose (but in general itâ€™s about shooting dinosaur (1st Person shooting view / 3rd Person Hybrid Gameplay), surviving and protecting the base).   Possible Game Modes:    Slaughter  (lots of enemies)  Survival  (protecting base, activating objects and surviving the growing waves of dinosaur)  Rampage  (like in â€œPrimal Carnageâ€ there are 2 teams â€œDinosaursâ€ and â€œHumansâ€ who play against each other and switch after that)  1v1 Duel â€¢ Team Duel â€¢ Team Elimination â€¢ Free for all Duel â€¢ King of the Hill â€¢ Instagib â€¢ Conquest â€¢ Gun Game   You can play it  solo, friendsonly (Co-op) or public (Multiplayer).  You can choose the difficulty (Noob, Easy, Normal, Hard, Insane, Redikulous) you want to play and one out of 40+ possible maps!  During the game you earn Credits to buy other weapons (50+ weapons, Tech &amp; Gear) and (depending on the game mode) you can also use 7 different vehicles. But you also earn EXP with killing dinosaur which increases your level. Yeah your level â€“ there is also a level system in this game and the different human classes have all unique abilities.   Classes:   Assault  He has a Jetpack which makes him able to fly for a while (Thatâ€™s freaking awesome! Itâ€™s so funny when the T-Rex is really nearly to eat you and you just fly away BYE BYE T-REX lol). But back to the topic the Assault starts with a CV-10 Pistol (better weapons you get with killing and purchasing). His Grenade is â€œFrag Grenadeâ€.   Recon  The Recon has the ability to use his cloak which makes him invisible for the enemies for some seconds. He starts with the CV-10 Silenced Pistol and uses the EMP Grenades.   Support  The Supporter people have medic guns. They can heal themselves or other teammates whenever they want but they really need it because they canâ€™t just fly away. They start with the M-40 Magnum and have Smoke Grenades. I like those Smoke Grenades because when you get into trouble with the Supporter because you have to reload your weapon but you canâ€™t - because too many dinosaur are attacking you - and you are just healing yourself the whole time, itâ€™s possible to throw such a Smoke Grenade and the dinosaur run away. Good time for reloading and healing. ^^   Back to the level system:  You unlock more abilities with a higher level (for example less fall damage or more jump height). The current maximum reachable level is 50.    Achievements:   Oh itâ€™s just HEAVEN for achievement hunters! There are 250+ achievements and the most of them are not that hard to get. There is really for everything an achievement.. for kills with all weapons, healing, flying, riding, surviving and and and.  So all in all.. what should I sayâ€¦ this game offers much and makes a lot of fun! Sure itâ€™s not perfect (e. g. weapon sound isnâ€™t realistic) but who cares.. which game is really that realistic? In Left for Dead 2 you can shoot through a wall but not through a TENT! LOL So I tell you to give this game a try and maybe you join my games and we smash those dinosaur together! ^.~
3765	1	a	Do you want to shoot Dinosaurs? Do you want to shoot Dinosaurs in space? Do you want to shoot Dinosaurs in space with rocket launchers, lazers, and a sword? Do you want to do all that for only a dollar?  Of course you do! Buy this game!
3767	1	a	i quickscoped a T-Rex with an explosive arrow while my teammate crashed a V-Tol into its head  10/10 would crash again 
3769	1	a	Its Halo 2, but with more dinosaurs
546	0	a	After 3 years and 3 Steam releases, I expected an improvement on the controversial game I had heard so much about.  First released as Orion: Dino Beatdown for $15, then Orion: Dino Horde which dropped to $1, and now Orion: Prelude which has recently gone Free-to-Play. This is where I entered the picture.  I had first heard about this game with such catchy headlines as 'The Worst Video Game EVER!' and 'Is Orion: Prelude still the Worst Game Ever?'. I then saw trailers which showed the game in its new polished state and heard the feedback stating it was 'the best turn-around in video game history!'. Outside of these he-said/she-said discusions I didn't pay much attention to this game. 'It's Halo with Dinosaurs' they said, 'Nonsense!' I'd say. It wasn't until the game literally screamed 'I'm free now, please play me! It would be very nice if you would play me!'  So I did, and while a awaited the game's download I decided to research the critisim of this game. What I saw was a buggy unfinished mess, multiple instances of theft of video game assets by the developers, and radical reactions to negative feedback by the creator. But that was for the older versions of the game, right?  What I played in Prelude, and what I saw in Dino Beatdown/Horde, I could not distinguish. I really like the idea of this game and I wish it all worked, but ultimately the game lacks polish: it's horribly optimized, animations are amateur at best, Ai is atrocious, and weapon handling is nonexistant.  The saddest part is, it seems this game will never be improved because the developers refuse any meaningful critisim and/or are incapable of coding a better functioning game. They have big plans ahead, but I don't know how they can realize them if they can't manage to properly make this.  Try the game if you want, you're free to do so, but as someone who wanted to like this game I warn you of what I have experienced.   EDIT:  In light of some recent criticism I have decided to put a bit more time into this game, but my recommendation stays the same.  To put into perspective: You hear your friend talking about this guy but all he keeps saying is how much of an ***hole he is. You think to yourself 'he can't be that bad'. Then you finally meet him and the first thing he does is slap you across the face. Do you stick around to see how many more times he hits you?  This is a bad game, there is nothing objective about that. Programing is bad, animations are sometimes nonexistant, and it's difficult to run on some of the best computers. 'Can you still have fun with it?' Of course you can! There is nothing stopping you from enjoying a bad game. I myself enjoy several bad games. That does not excuse the corners that this game has cut.  There is a difference between a good game and a game that you as an individual can enjoy. Because I and many others do not enjoy this game, that does not render our opinions irrelevent.  You Are Allowed To Like Bad Games! but after the amount of time I have played I cannot recommend this game.
3771	1	a	This game has made its way through my friends list like a sneaky case of cheap herpes. We all seem to have ended up with it somehow and now that we have it, we're stuck with it forever. Some of us were ashamed to have acquired it, so we thought we'd feel less lonely in our shame by giving it to someone else. Although the game is about as glamorous as herpes, it has turned out to be far more enjoyable. I won't defend the technical quality of the game (it is herpes after all), but I will defend its entertainment value. A survival co-op based on killing dinosaurs with cool guns and vehicles is just good fun. The gameplay is perfectly fine and lends itself well to many hours of pleasurable dino-slaying with a group of fellow herpes victims. The game even offers various ways of enjoying your herpes: several game modes that change things up and offer a good time even when you aren't in the mood for survival co-op. So the next time you see this on sale for a dollar, and think to yourself, 'I don't wanna join the destitute of Steam and engage in this nasty transmission of cheap fun,' remind yourself that you probably have some variant of herpes in real life, and you shouldn't be such a judgmental, pretentious, snob who can't put aside petty scruples in the name of good fun. Buy the game when its on sale (don't you dare pay full price for herpes), and come join us.
3773	1	a	Always wanted to know what would happen if you rammed a jeep into T-Rex  11/10
547	0	a	what is this the fourth time this game's been 'released' to wipe off all the negetive reviews? if stolen art assests and the fact your money is going to a scum bag don't bother you, give it a try the games alright for $1  some history if you're intrested.   http://www.gatheryourparty.com/2012/05/04/orion-employee-beatdown/   theres plenty more if you google a bit, these guys have a track record

3779	1	a	Why the hell do games nowadays NEVER have any dinosaurs?  This game has dinosaurs. 10/10, Game of the Year, best 50ct I've ever spent. Seriously, this game was hella fun for a few hours. I'd say it's well worth the money.
3781	1	a	the third person animations on the player models look like deep fried aass other than that it's fun to make these magestic creatures go extinct all over again by brutally blowing their heads off 577/12 - would kill baby raptors again

3783	1	a	Budget wise this is the best and most fun coop shooter I can think of! I bought this game for many of my friends since its so cheap and we always had alot of fun playing it. I dont regret a single second spend playing this game.   10/10 would buy it again.
549	0	a	  Weapons seem pretty weak . I guess its not my cup of tea . The concept is good but it laggs for me most of the time.   Fast paced gameplay , and much spray and pray . however the lagg-spikes make it really hard for me to play :/
3785	1	a	I got ripped off, I spent 1 dollar to buy it, now it's free.
3787	1	a	 ORION: Prelude  is worth a look. It sells for 0,79â‚¬. Iâ€™d say the price is right. Iâ€™d also say the price point is probably another move by the developer to try and earn back some brownie points. Itâ€™s a fun little time waster and I can see it being a good game to play with friends over a few drinks. Glitching through a building you have just climbed on to might be funny then.
3789	1	a	Step 1: find VTOL Step 2: That's it, you win.

3797	1	a	10/10 best game ever  buy 4-pack and play with your m8
3799	1	a	I got lens flare from looking up at the sky.      At night. 10/10
3801	1	a	It's fun with friends for a few hours every so often. you're crazy if you don't pick it up for this price.
3803	1	a	Where can you go wrong with this game? It's very cheap and super fun. Honestly, I'd buy this game for $10 or even $20. I highly suggest trying it out or even getting the 4-pack so you can play with your friends. How disappointed can you get when it was only a dollar?  10/10 would watch friend be eaten again.
3805	1	a	Long story short ORION: Prelude (Competitive PvP) was the original game announced in 2010, a spiritual successor to the ORION: Source Beta. It was not able to release due to a series of events and we had to focus on a smaller scaled experience. This was called Dino Beatdown (Open World Co-Op). It was a disaster and so we continued to work on improving it using the revenue made and the next massive chunk was ORION: Dino Horde (Arena PvP, Duel).   With the success of Dino Horde we were finally were able to deliver the experience originally promised (Prelude) back in 2010. And then some - considering the original Prelude was to be strictly PvP and only have three game modes (CTF, Vital, Deathmatch) compared to it's modern day predecessor (15 game modes and a variety of play styles). Comparison:  Original Prelude / Modern Prelude 3 Modes / 15 Modes 5 Dinosaurs / 10 Dinosaurs (All Playable) 30 Weapons&amp;Gear / 50 Weapons&amp;Gear 5 Multiplayer Maps / 20+ Multiplayer Maps &amp; SDK  It is now called ORION: Prelude because it *finally* is ORION: Prelude.

3807	1	a	I have to say...when i first saw the reviews for this game a year ago, I avoided it deliberately. However, the developers didn't just sit on their asses while they got bad reviews. 'Games don't fail, only developers do' (love that quote because it's so true). They did something about it, and now I find myself buying this game for my friends who aren't fortunate enough to experience this wonderful FPS. This game mixes dinosaurs, Team Fortress 2, and Halo. The skins are cool, the taunts are hilarious, the gameplay is a dimond in the rough, and it's only a dollar! So if you ever find yourself with a dollar after buying an expensive game, I would strongly recommend getting this game, because it may be better than the one you just purchased.

3819	1	a	Short review: It's Killing Floor with dinosaurs and I absolutely love it.  Longer review: Despite a bumpy start upon release and many updates, this game was developed into something great. You essentially fight wave upon wave of dinosaurs while obtaining credits (in-game currency). Using credits to purchase player upgrades, weapons, vehicles and useful items. Some gamemodes include a generator you must defend and other objectives.  Nothing really feels over-powered but you will notice that player weapons seem a little more powerful than vehicle weapons. I really only use vehicles to turtle myself and/or as a light defense for the generator. Player vs player battles can be fun but it's easy to take someone out with even mediocre weapons.  My only real negative for this game is vehicles are way too squishy to larger dinosaurs. A tank takes no more then 3-4 hits before being destroyed and yet can take dozens of hits from smaller dinosaurs before being destroyed. In a way, I appreciate it because it forces you to compromise. I'm all about compromises, it keeps things interesting. See? The only negative I have about this game I honestly turned it into a positive. Overall, I had a lot of fun.  You'd think flying dinosaurs would be annoying and impossible but they're well balanced.  Similarly to Killing Floor, every new experience level gives you a small reward like spawning with upgrades, weapons or items. A max level player can spawn with a full loadout of weapons and upgrades. Useful for higher difficulties so obtaining experience and gaining levels is actually worth your while. It's not terribly grindy either, you can reach level 25 in a day. Level 70 is max level.  Pros:
3821	1	a	So here is my review on this game. I was a bit confused when I first bought this game. EVERY review said this game was trash, worthless and not even worth playing even if it was free. Almost all reviews gave this game a 1/10, but since it was only 99 cents I figured why not give it a try.  Then I started to play it with a friend of mine and I was amazed! It uses the unreal engine so it lacks graphics. Also the physics are quite terrible. However, if you look at the other aspects of this game, this is probably the most amazing zerg game that exists.  The game offers A LOT of achievements. For every achievement run player this game is worth it even if it was 10 euro's. It offers great co-op gameplay with many different gameplay options. It's like risk or rain for example. The graphics are terrible but the game offers a system that makes it fun to replay the game, get achievements, unlock abilities and progress every run. For everyone that is not a graphics or storyplayer (read casual), this game is a MUST buy!  One big thing with this game is the online play. So many people hate it and don't understand the great features of this game that the online play lacks quite a bit. It's hard to find a proper server with random people, so it's easier to play with people you know. I must agree, this game certainly isn't the best game in several aspects, but I'm still able to get a great amount of fun with the replay system. Get achievement, level you character and progress every time you restart a map.  Also, another great thing about this game is the updates. DLC? What is dlc? ORION doesn't know the term DLC. If you buy this game you don't buy half a game that gets filled with 'updates' like most games. 'You want to have additional maps or weapons? Sure, but you'll have to pay us another 5 euro's to get those items.' A normal way of selling a products in the game industry these days. ORION doesn't give a s**t. This is probably the most updated game there is atm and it won't cost you a single dime. It's all FREE, like it always was, until someone decided that everything had to be paid for. This is a complete game and it grows bigger every time there's an update. It might not be popular, but atleast ORION is a company that cares about their product, rather then screwing over the player base.  Overall, this game gives a great amount of fun. Don't buy this game if you are either a casual, a storyline based player or a player that requires good graphics. For everyone else and especially the hardcore gamer that likes to complete the full game (100%, progress runs) this game is highly recommended.
3823	1	a	For the price it can't be beat. To be honest i would have paid $10 for this game. It's simple but challenging and fun. it also, if accidentally, has a comedic side to it. Though there are some bugs and the controls of the large dinos can be clunky it's still great. Generally, the flaws are unnoticeable during play. I highly recommend ORION: Prelude.
3825	1	a	is it a perfect game? Nope not at all BUT it is very fun i bought it back when it was $0.99 and even though its now f2p i still dont regret it, its a fun fps game to just shoot some dinosaurs trying to stop your generators and you have a large assortment of vehicles aswell as weapons also if you play most of your games offline and solo like i do it completely supports that so grab some guns and blast some space dinos!  (if there is one bad thing to be said its the micro-transaction store for cosmetics im not a fan of stuff like that in any game at all but aside from that its still a solid fun game to play)
3827	1	a	Considering the dark past, this game is well worth revisiting. The crazy low price, and the flood of updates make for quite an apology that I can readily accept. A game that was broken pulled back from the brink is a rare find indeed.   ORION: Prelude is basically the combination of Halo and Killing floor reimagined by a 10 year old. (Not a bad thing) I'm of course referring to the survival and conquest modes that make up 90 percent of the server list. There are an overabundance of game modes, some of which I haven't even touched. But I don't feel like I'm missing much in some of them; but the creators definitely have thought through every possible angle an arena FPS like this could offer. With that in mind, Orion has a crazy amount of depth for such a cheap game. With leveling, perks, loadouts, upgrades, the list goes on. It's got all the bells and whistles of a AAA title, just without the pretty graphics, models, or polish. And if you don't mind that and just want to cut down a T-rex with a light saber, pistol whip a raptor, or set a pteradon on fire; then this is the game for you. Did I mention the music is fittingly epic as well?  Unfortunately for this gem, the amount of available players is sparse, so if you do buy it, I would suggest doing so with friends in mind, or firing it up during sale time.
3829	1	a	Surprisingly fun for its price! Feels good to play this.
3831	1	a	This game is absolutely marvelous, a gem hidden in between triple A games. Not only are you able to express your burning desire to warn someone for a sniper, man. They added a whole other game mode for free! In this gamemode you're able to shoot pre-historic creatures back to extinction while driving vehicles that don't obey the laws of physics.  I would totaly recommend this game if you need a hour to kill.   
3833	1	a	The name will have probably changed by the time I post this, but Super Mega Dinosaur Slaughter Adventure: Space Explorers is not that bad of a game. It's 99 cents, and, while certainly bad, its fun to play. If you have a dollar thats burning in your pocket I'd suggest picking this up
3835	1	a	I was honestly unsure of this game, a friend of mine had bought it for me so I gave it a go. Now there is an issue with lag at some times but it is rare. The up of this game, well it's just fun as hell. I love getting in the cars and just plowing over the raptor. Even my son plays this game with me on another computer. the game is multiplyer or you can go solo if you so wish.
3837	1	a	Plays game for 5 minutes.  Gets trapped in rock for ten minutes. Finally finds the teleport button. Hurrah! Run around dinosaurs with cryo knife taking advantage of their slow turning. Cryo blade a T-Rex and a Triceratops to death. Gets killed by a small and insignificant dinosaur. 10/10 would play again.  
555	0	a	What can I say ? After reading all the negative comments about this game, I thought to myself; nah, it can't be THAT bad. So, stubborn as I am I decided to buy it anyway. Boy, was I wrong. Nothing in this game works. It starts with a buggy main menu; sounds cutting off, the server list not refreshing, unable to even connect to anything or anyone or even starting a solo game. Finally after restarting the game 3 times I was able to create a solo game. It's supposed to be a tower defense sort of game, but deeper. But it's terrible. It's buggy, it isn't fun, it's glitchy, it's... It's probably the worst game I've ever played (and I've played quite a few, thank you very much). Virtual garbage bin material. What a waste of time AND money.
3839	1	a	It's fun and it costs less than a dollar. Sell some cards and buy this game. Trust me, it's worth it. Just make sure you have some friends to play with too!
556	0	a	I'm torn. For the $1 I paid for it during the promotion, it's tons of shameless fun (I thought), and a nice deviation from the standard Killing Floor/zombie wave mods out there. That said, I have to look at this in the context of if it's worth its asking price and...  No.  The game is high production value Unreal Engine modification, but it lacks the attention to detail that makes Killing Floor so fun. Animations are janky, player textures frequently disappear mid-match (leaving behind their primary-colored models), hitboxes are off (why is a shot to the crest of the neck of a raptor considered a headshot, but shooting them in the head isn't?), levels are uninspiring copy-paste affairs (how many times am I going to see the same wrecked drill in a level?) with incredibly linear objective design (Base 2 is always the same spot, as is base 3, etc). Capturing the bases in Survival mode itself does nothing but progress the game to the next wave of dinosaurs, as even the vehicles spawn at the start of the match - you could have a buddy run to Base 3 for the Mech while you turn on the generator to start Wave One!  That's not to say the game is /bad/. Are there performance issues? Yes. Is the attention to detail lacking? Absolutely. Is it incredibly linear to the point of boredom after a while? You betcha. But until you really start to notice those things (about thirty minutes in, for me), the game is still fun in a mindless sort of way, especially with friends. That said though, for $15, I expect a lot more for my money than copy-pasted levels and textures, braindead AI, movement animations from the original Tribes (in terms of 'skating' over terrain), and a linear level experience.  For the $1 I paid for it, it feels like a discounted iPad app. Shame that when it's off sale, the developers are still asking for $15 for this thing. I'd like to see a lot more polish (and better netcode) before plunking down that much cash, especially when you're competing against similarly priced titles like Killing Floor, Starbound, etc, that are way better experiences overall.
3841	1	a	game made me hate pterodactyls  go hear for moor revew:  http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ceubiesreviews 
3843	1	a	Really fun and fast-paced co-op game!  +focus on teamwork +decent graphics +plenty of game modes -sometimes lags when a lot of dinosaurs are in the area
3845	1	a	Ok so this is the best co-op game ever made. (Yes, even better than Killing Floor.)  Why? It has what everyone wants in a FPS co-op; that being boiled down to one word 'FUN'.  This game is pure awesome entertainment. With an easy learning curve and lots of different playing modes. Your co-op team never rage, bully or quit. Everyone is having too much 'fun' for bad feelings to arise.  There is so much you can do, there are three soldier proffesions or in the game 'Rampage' you can be a dinosaur and eat other players! Then there is duel matches, king of the hill and much much more.  There are also a good array of vehicles to run over or shoot dinosaurs with, as well as many weapons and heaps of augmentations and upgrades.  I am completely addicted to this game. :)
3847	1	a	This game is no where near related to it's metascore. First of all, this game has gone through some intense updates that have made it insanely fun. You have the Unreal engine (Which is very good), The Halo-like multiplayer, and YOU CAN KILL DINOSAURS.  TLDR: I ate my friend as a T-rex and I don't think I've ever heard anyone â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ themself over the mic. 11/10 It's OK - IGN
3849	1	a	It woths more than $9 but on sale with $0.49 tag. 100% WORTH. You don't need to spend much extra money , just head into a survival mode server and take out guns in the weaponary shop , bambambam , fun. It has potential to grow bigger.
3851	1	a	This is the cheapest coffee, And it cant be finished, Didn't sleep for 2 days,yes 2 days straight. Dinosaurs + Jetpacks + Mechs+ FPS + TPS game. 12/10
559	0	a	Stealing content from other game developers and lying to their fans about it, deleting negative comments on their Facebook page, setting up an Indiegogo campaign to steal even more money from their fans (They donated $500 to themselves in the campaign to make it look like it is successful) @  https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/orion--5#/  , abusing employees (Firing them just before the release of the game and not paying them a single cent), abusing the current publicity they are getting (  http://imgur.com/s4WSxmf  ), threatening to sue people for having negative comments on their company (  https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4q6xo5/activisions_dmca_claim_on_orion_is_legit_orions/d4rc74m?context=3  )    https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4q6xo5/   Also, this game is horrible in the first place. I bought this game last year and I have only played 0.1 hours for many good reasons.
3853	1	a	Right now i have played around 20 hours on it and I'm still enjoying it! If you just want to relieve some stress, just play this game. It certainly helps. The fairness between Man and Dino is in favor of Man. It depends if YOU like that, but i certainly do. Note: With friends it's MUCH more fun.  PROS: - A lot of variety in weapons and vehicles. - A lot of different game modes. It never gets boring. - Very well-made maps. - Different classes. (assault, support and recon) - Augments where you can buy all sorts of stuff. - It is strategic. e.g. which augments and weapons should you buy first? CONS: - There are some strange bugs. But they can always be solved. - When playing Solo. It kinda gets boring after a while.  Over all, I REALLY enjoy this game and now my other friends can join too bc it's F2P now! P.S. I see a lot of people complaining it's F2P now and they want their money back. Jesus Christ it was â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing 99 cents and you even get helmets for it. Stop complaining for â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s sake.
560	0	a	The devs jumped ship to release another copy of this game under the name 'Orion' to avoid the press on this game because they stole assets and fired their artists right before release so they didn't have to pay them and are now playing the victim and claiming it's a witch hunt because 'they're a small studio and wahhh AAA publishers are mean'.
3855	1	a	OH my gosh! Instead of buying that Mountain dew for $1.89 buy this instead, trust me its worth it! (Plus you shouldnt even be drinking Mountain dew...Its bad for you!) Ok to start off this review i'm gonna list some pros and cons for it below.  +PROS+ + Very affordable price + Beatiful visuals (Graphics) + Well made interfaces (Ex: Main menu, shop, in game HUD, all of its great really!) +Voice acting seems pretty good in my opinion + Different classes (their is 3 classes) +Has vehicles (Suck on that cod fans!) + Variety of guns (and are upgradable)  + Awesome devs (They admit the game was bad when it was first released and made it so much better) + Great multiplayer + Lots of maps and game modes + Even better deal when on sale (Dont even know how much lower the price could possibly go but it's great for you penny pinchers xD) +Has a uique art style mixed with dinos (Think Halo style mixed with Jurassic Park!) +Easy to make servers! and work well!  -CONS- - Has glitches (like most every other game also has. Very few are game breaking) - Only three classes (not a huge deal cause the existing classes are great and fit in the game well) -Not much of a story (BUT who really needs stroy when you got DINOSAURS!!!) -Micro transactions (In game store for cosmetics only)  =Summary= Overall this game is a blast with friends and leaves you satisfied after blowing out a dino's brains! Also fun to take your teams vehicle and drive off (without them) and listen to the glorious sound of 'TEAMMATE DOWN!' xD. If you are still hesitating what are you waiting for? You have nothing to lose, try it out!
3857	1	a	For $0.99 you can go buy a chicken sandwich or shoot T-Rexs with a grenade launcher while flying through the air with a jet pack strapped to your back. Its not even a tough call.
3859	1	a	I have not played this game for all it has to offer but I feel like I have already gotten my dollars worth so I do recommend this game, for a dollar it is amazing!  I was looking for a dinosaur game to play with my young son and found Orion: Prelude on sale for a dollar so with great reviews I thought why not?   Only playing one of the several game modes that this game offers (survival) here is my experience. Survival is a game mode where you defend your base against waves of dinosaurs that get harder as it throws different types of dinosaurs as you progress. You can upgrade your guns, items, get turrets, upgrade your character with different perks, and drive vehicles to fight the waves. One of the best experiences of playing this mode was when I was on top of a bunch of rocks trying to stay out of harms way a terrordactyl picked me up and was taking me who knows where (maybe to just drop me from a height) so I had to spin my character around to kill it. I thought that was pretty cool.  The game feels well optimized playing on max settings at 1080 resolution on a dated system I have had no performance issues. The graphics are not the best but for a dollar with all this game has to offer I think this can be overlooked.  My last statement, if you are even considering Orion: Prelude please pick it up. I mean you can even fight others with light sabers, or be a dinosaur in an online pvp dinosaur match.
3861	1	a	Cheap game but very enjoyable. though graphics is outdated for me its gameplay is nice. But kinda boring playing alone.And If you go online Few players are there and sometimes no one.  But this game really worth its price .. so i recommend this for every gamers out there.  NOTE: if you dont know the name of some dinosaurs you'll know it emmidiatly when you play this game, and not just their name but also their cute faces.
3863	1	a	The best get stuck in a rock simulator.

3865	1	a	Futuristic shooter with Dinosaurs. Lots of Defense game modes that mainly consist of surviving waves of dinosaurs and protecting your base from them. 9\10
3867	1	a	Don't let the low MetaScore scare you away, this game is a blast to play! Ridiculous action, a fun mix of vehicles, weapons and enhancements, and cooperative team-based play. Also, freakin' dinosaurs!  It's well worth 99 cents, for sure, so grab it while it's still on sale if you don't already have it.
3869	1	a	I don't even own the game but yeah.
3871	1	a	10/10 Achievement unlocked for no reason.
3873	1	a	Very good game for only 99 cents
3875	1	a	shot a midget pterodactyl with a helicopter shooting rockets, then i randomly blew up: 11/10 would die again 
567	0	a	This Is way more horrible than the metascore suggests. I dont see how anyone in their right mind would play this for fun, aside from laughing at how horrible this game is for a few minutes. There is a reason this game is only up for 99 cents. The paid reviews should be investigated as well.   Buyer beware.
3877	1	a	A poorly-made, unashamedly dumb game that nevertheless offers equally dumb entertainment.   Pros:  -Drop-in co-operative multiplayer  -Multiple classes  -Customized loadouts (when unlocked)  -Many upgrade paths once in game  -Vehicles! Tanks, Mechs, and VTOLs if you're lucky enough to survive long enough to find them  -Lots of achievements. You can actually unlock vanity items with enough of them!   Cons:  -Occasional crashes  -Discouraging higher difficulties without teammates or unlocks  -Lack of servers  -Somewhat monotonous level design
3879	1	a	Orion: Prelude is a FPS where you (primarily) defend your base against waves of dinosaur enemies. It's not well-explained where you are or why dinosaurs are attacking your base (especially the herbivorous ones, like Stegosaurus and Triceratops), but that perhaps misses the point: shooting dinosaurs. This aspect feels pretty solid; big dinosaurs are hard to deal with and can easily kill you, little ones surround you and can take you down in a short period of time. I'll tackle major aspects of the game below instead of a list of pros and cons. If you're looking for deep gameplay, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a little bit of fun, especially with friends, this is well worth your one dollar (but perhaps not much more). OVERALL: 5/10  Gameplay 6/10 I've only ever played the standard co-op wave survival game type (with bots and/or friends), but there are other game modes. Each of three classes has a specific ability and set of weapons, which are adequately differentiated. Difficulty scales nicely over the ten waves, and rewards for defeating dinosaurs allows you to purchase weapons, turrets, and/or item upgrades. This all feels pretty good, but the weapons could be slotted into 4/5 categories which feel almost exactly the same. Vehicles (which seem mostly ripped from Halo's assets) are an interesting addition and are fun to use, but somewhat difficult to steer. Dinosaurs' models match their power level neatly, and you'd better be packing top-tier weapons when more than two at a time are nearby. Killing an enemy while downed allows a self-revive in addition to teammates' ability to revive you. One of my biggest issues with this game is the AI. The dinosaurs will not know what to do if you are outside of their attack range and will waggle back and forth below seemingly forever. Cloaking immediately breaks aggro of ANY dinosaur and seems to prevent re-acquiring you as a target for a few seconds. Teammate AI is even worse. They rarely revive you, fail to efficiently capture points, routinely fail to headshot dinosaurs sitting in front of their face, and have garish joke outfits like sandwich hats and wizard cloaks. Playing with bots is really only worth it for two reasons: they aggro dinosaurs and can (for some reason) accurately take down dinosaurs flying at/near the game ceiling.  Graphics: 5/10 Looks solid most of the time, but things get wonky when dinosaurs die, and when playing in 3rd person. Switching weapons results in a very low-quality model for the first second or so. Dino models are solid, character models less so, (bot costumes -&gt; horrific). Environment looks good all around, weather effects look great, but hinder visibility in ways that are counterproductive to a FPS.  Music/Sound: 4/10 I have only ever heard two songs in this game, both of which are rousing and I quite like. If you didn't like them, they'd get old fast. Sound is less good overall. Sound balance is wonky: one pistol is about twice as loud as every other weapon; T-Rex roars seem to badly clip the audio (and my eardrums); slow-mo start sound blares unreasonably. Could be better balanced and menu audio options don't seem to affect all sounds. Everything else is solid, but leaves something to be desired.  Performance: 4/10 The game seems to be very poorly optimized and freezes for a few seconds when awarding class level ups, and uses far more system resources than I would expect from a game like this.

569	0	a	Just played it for free, but I feel like they should have paid me to play it. It took me a while just to be able to play it. At first, I tried joining public games using the matchmaking option, but I was immediately kicked from the lobby every time. I finally got to at least try it out using the 'Play Solo' option. The game is ridiculously glitchy. The game froze for about thirty seconds, I was constantly running into invisible barriers, which I had to jump over, I tried to purchase a certain augment and it purchased some random one I didn't want, and I spontaneously lost the ability to shoot or reload, despite it saying I had full ammo. Despite the PS2 era visuals (don't let the video previews fool you) I still suffered from a horribly low framerate. Oh, and all of that happened in less than 15 minutes.  It was enough to make me think those giving this garbage positive reviews are either dummy accounts set up by the devs or they are just trolling me.
570	0	a	What a huge piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.  Very poorly optimized.  Framerate is poor and drops constantly. Specially when the dinos come.  Unplayable, unenjoyeable.
3881	1	a	The year was 1967. We'd just been deployed in the delta to keep the Cong and NVA from approaching some of the major trails. I was trudging through one of the tree covered marshes, soaked to the core, wondering what the hell I'd gotten myself into. We were two minutes away from setting up an M249 on a rigged turret when out of nowhere what looked like a pterodactyl flew down and exploded, killing four people in my unit. From there on out, it was hell, neon lights everywhere, and then the god damned t-rex had to come in and stomp our â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.  Either way, this is a 10/10 simulation of Vietnam War II's opening, with Far Cry Blood Dragon acting as a good reenactment of the end of VWII. May the t-rexes of the world rot where they stand.
571	0	a	I've fallen victim to made up quotes shown in the trailer. Where do I start? I'll start with the most trivial things - graphics.  They are bad, like bad bad. Low res textures, game looks like late alpha/early beta. It's also poorly optimised and if you don't own a decent gaming rig (like you own an aging gaming laptop) then forget about your game looking anything close to what you can see in the trailer. Even setting everything out ot max makes you feel like all those blurs, blooms, dof effects are to cover how ugly this game actually is.  Graphics are not deciding here, let me move on with the review.  Gameplay is extremely boring and unsatysfying. Killing dinosaurs? That's cool. Well how about any progress, strategy, real objectives? All of that was replaced by run and fly tactic (also exploiting bugs and broken pathing of enemies), pretty much all the guns feel the same (like bb toys) and objectives are just to have a laugh at them every once in a while. Go the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to the objective, stay there for 15 secs, get nothing but a vehicle so you can run back to the base asap. Wow, jesus!  Enemies? All the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing same, slaying a t-rex doesn't give any satisfaction whatsoever but some slow-motion for 15 seconds straight so you can meditate on your miserable life, since you're still playing this game and wasting your time.  Audio is just crap. I think you can easily tell that by watching some gameplay video. I'm not going to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ around with onomathopeyas.  Btw. Watching the trailer again - haven't you noticed this actually trolling? Who would believe this is 'the most fantastic game' anyone ever played? It's not, unless it was this guy's first game. 'So cool I love it'? Now that's a cool quote. 'The metacritic score is misleading'? Of course it is, this game is 2/10 at best.  Look, getting this game for its current price is kinda a bargain. But keep in mind you only want to get this if you're: -A hipster -A game collector -A suicidal maniac candy crush veteran who's got no cash in his pocket and wants to commit suicide during playing a co-op shooting game.
3883	1	a	Lol why did I buy this
3885	1	a	amazing game 8.5/10, me and my friend had invested in this development in order to find an amazing first person shooter. it was on sale for 99c, so we thought, why not. it was the worst game we ever played, so after 1 hour, we immediately uninstalled. Coming back almost a year later, we both downloaded it, as we had heard of the word that it ha totally and utterly transformed into a monster of a game, and we thought, 'How on earth could this be?' We came on to have a bunch of giggles, fun, suspense, action and glory,.....   Biggest transformation i have personally seen in a game.  Great Job game devs, hats off to you lads.  - Good ol' dusky
3887	1	a	Do not listen to the metascore!!! This game is awesome and I've had so much fun playing this game so far, if you are thinking about getting this game for the $.99 get it! You won't regret it.
3889	1	a	Funny game, not as bad as people say it is.. when you get into a game, because there are some connection issues. But it's a fun co op game and if you can get it at a discount, I got it at 93% off, 0,99 â‚¬ you should get it. 
3891	1	a	A very underated game !
3893	1	a	It isn't great but you'll get 10-20 hours out of it for next to no money (less than Â£1 is a fair price for what you get).  Make sure to bring a few friends and try and save for the flying tank thing.
3895	1	a	Payed only 25 cent on a sell, 7 hours later, OH MY GOD BEST GAME EVER, I mean who the heck does not like dinos and halo like combat? The fact the developers stuck with this over the years shows dedication. Drives a jeep around in circles as dinos ragdoll under my wheels as I squeel about the lighting effects in the game. 10/10
3897	1	a	10/10. Would shoot baby dinosaur in the face in front of dinosaur family again.
3899	1	a	The Devs are extremely devoted to this game, and after seeing what they have in store for this game, i have nothing but gratitude towards these guys. I used to have a bad opinion of them after seeing some bad news on them, but it seems to have been nothing more than some raging internet idiot posting lies. I say get the game, and since it goes on sale so much for $1, you shouldn't have much financial problems from picking this up. What the devs have in store (Orion Prelude) looks amazing, and they'll evolve the current game into a much more beautiful and refined game for FREE. The devs are also producing free dlc, nothing you have to pay for. If anything, it would be the dev's devotion and effort to build this game into something beautiful and amazing that caught my attention and encouraged me to recommend this game.  tl;dr - Great game, great devs
3901	1	a	Game is a lot of fun. Many of the modes require exercising precise teamwork. Updates have eliminated a lot of the bugs. The metacritic score does not do the game justice at all.
3903	1	a	Quite a bizarre experience, actually. On the one hand, this game is very buggy and unbalanced, its sound design is just weird... BUT on the other hand, you are killing (and roadkilling) a handful of FAHKIN' dinosaurs and flying around using jetpack. It's kind of like a mix of EDF, Halo and maybe a little bit of Tribes. It could be better but it is good for what it is. ...why do I even enjoy this
3905	1	a	Fun game, lots of problems, get it on sale or whenever they give it to you for free which is almost god damn every month. So, that's a thing.
3907	1	a	I got teleported into a Triceratops and my vehicle randomly exploded. 10/10 would play again
572	0	a	 https://encyclopedia   dramatica.se/The_Orion_Project 
573	0	a	The compeny behind this game is a real flock of scum bags so don't bother supporting them.
574	0	a	very much not a fun game, not worth the dollar it cost
3909	1	a	In short this game is almost free, gets updated all the time, has dinosaurs, a ton of modes/maps and is one of the most fun online FPS games on Steam.  And even if you don't like it, it's not like you're wasting a substantial amount of money or anything. Just skip lunch for a day and you'll be able to buy 2 or 3 4-packs of the game, you fattie. But I doubt you'll not enjoy it (I mean, you can kill raptors with a giant robot).  I've heard that a long time ago this game sucked and was full of glitches, but apparently they pretty much remade the whole game from scratch, so don't worry about it.  Oh, and you can play as a T.Rex. &lt;- this was the major selling point for me  Buy it.
576	0	a	 https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4q6xo5/activisions_dmca_claim_on_orion_is_legit_orions/ 
3911	1	a	This game reminds me of of the time I got that dinosaur skull from an auction.
3913	1	a	Is this seriously only Â£0.79?!  It's fun, it's lively, it's simple. Kill the dinosaurs, secure the objectives, buy cooler guns. This is a bargain, get on it.
3915	1	a	it's not bad.. but it's not great. They tried to mix Halo with a Dino hunt. Good graphics except when they aren't. Good controls that suddenly seem to stop working. (shaking head) I hold final opinon cause it's consistantly getting updates and changes. But get it cheep dudes.
3917	1	a	What the hell Bren, this is actually fun.
578	0	a	When this was Orion: Dino Horde, I would have recommended this game.  Most of my time spent playing this game was when it was under the previous title, and I throughly enjoyed my time with the game during that time. I randomly decided to try it once more, after its update to the new title to see if it was still okay.  The menu UI for the game, with the transition, feels like it under went a 15+ year regression compared to what it was previously. They had a fairly sleek UI previously, that overall looked decent for a modern age game, and it functioned well enough, and now the new UI looks like something that might have been taken straight out of the late 90s, maybe early 2000s.  Aside from that, the views while in the game, at least to me, went from feeling like a decent first/third shooter to feeling just cramped. I could be wrong on what I recall on this point, but I remember having a wider field of vision for both first and third person views, and even as a spectator floating around, I recall a wider view than what is shown.  On the positive side, it is still a good game for the price.. it just feels more deserving of that price now, instead of feeling like an amazing game for the price. If you need something to entertain you for a couple of hours, this will certainly do it, especially for the price on it.
579	0	a	this game was a dollar and I still feel like it wasn't worth it  that's like an entire twix bar man
3919	1	a	Great game, very fun to play!   Only problem is losing your arm to dino, which really sucks.
3921	1	a	ORION Prelude is a charming enough FPS with dinosaurs that only costs $.99 right? Wrong! while this game has some good qualities to it, there are far too many bugs/ issues with it to even consider playing in a more consistent capacity, with there being far more capable FPS for free on steam. You would think with the 99 cent price tag that the game is worth a shot and your right. But when you get in game and notice that the game also has in game purchases for cosmetics and everything else, bugs and very unrefined yet basic system. You'll be wondering why you even payed the $1 in the first place. Luckily I was one of the thousands of people who got this game for free and thankfully that means that I got free trading cards for my time spent playing the game. before I get to the pros and cons of this game, I'd like to put some of the comments in retrospect from my experience.  This game has been compared to Halo, Borderlands, Killing floor, Jurassic park and a plethora of other AAA/ popular games.  To clarify things for the hyped up buyer. This game is as similar to those games combines as power puff girls is to street fighter. To put some things into terms this game retains a cap of roughly 300 players per day, while the original Halo on PC still caps out at 400 users daily. So if your looking for Halo. Then just go back to the original PC community as it is still alive my friend.  Sure this game has guns, but the shooting is generic and it's not realistic nor is it futuristic. The game can be played with the starting pistol and not challenge the user very much as he sits on a rock and kills all the boss dinos and everything in between. Even when I force myself to stay on the ground, the AI is poorly executed, even while on the hardest difficulties.  Pros and Cons.  Pros:  *The game is fairly cheap. *The community is not dead for now. *The developers may fix all the issues at some point. *The developers give away thousands of copies of the game monthly, so you can expect new and exciting users to keep playing with while the fun lasts. *The graphics are quite nice for the price *You get a cute little shooter for 99 cents  Cons: *Even on a high performance gaming computer, this game does not function well in full screen what so ever. *The game forces it to launch in full screen no matter how many time you toggle it to windows. *The clipping isn't rendered correctly on full screen *The audio is horrible and often drops/ cuts out from gun fire to dino roars. *The vehicle control is highly generic and most often comparable to Halo 1(That's a lie) The vehicle controls are far worse than the original halo games, or almost any early shooter for that mater. *Full controller support is true, although it's highly glitchy and the controls don't always seem to register when using a controller vs mouse and keyboard. *combat is often boring and tedious as the AI is one of the worse AI's I've seen in a FPS.   I could keep listing things wrong with the game but there is too many other games I could be playing during this time. I do hope that the developer takes the time to buckle down and release a good patch to fix most of the issues as the majority of them are common features in thousands of games that have way less funding/ following.   My advice is simple, if you want a fps with dinosaurs in it. Then buy a game that has mods for dinosaurs in it. Like Star Wars Battlefront II or Arma II. Cheers and happy gaming
3923	1	a	wow. such dinosaur. very achievement.  putting a mech on a helicopter  10.000001/10 would glitch again
3925	1	a	Objectively this game is pretty bad, mainly because of the bad AI and stiff animations, but due to it being co-op, and it's crazy concept &amp; gameplay, it still manages to be loads of fun. The developers still update it, too, and so far every update has added something good.
3927	1	a	Halo with Dinosaurs
3929	1	a	BEST GAYM EVER JHHRURHURADKAD :melon:
3931	1	a	This game is honestly great, you'll buy it for the Horde mode with the dino's and stuff and when i got bored one day i didnt even realise that they're other game modes i could play! This game is worth it!
3933	1	a	Its good fun with a team of freinds and its only 1 euro.  Lots of different modes, maps and weapons and lets not forget the dinos, they are great.
3935	1	a	Yes, this is the game you should buy. Very good for the price.
3937	1	a	Fun game! Graphics are pretty good and the gameplay is solid. Orion Dino Horde has a Halo/Jurassic Park/Avatar feel to it and I like it! You've got guns, tanks, and planes to kill the dino's. It is mostly PvE but it does have PvP as well. Great pick ESPECIALLY for $1. Get it!!!
3939	1	a	i love this game you must buy and play with me ^.^
3941	1	a	If there ever was a game that combined Aliens, Dinosaurs, Space Marines and robots etc. It's this... People may say it's a bad game. That's because it ain't your avarage shooter. I love this game, and the first time I saw it, I said 'I want'. It may not have a storyline so far, and It may just be matches fighting people or Dinosaurs but it's so much fun and great all the same. Dino Horde is reguarlly updated and is about to 'evolve' into it's final stage, Prelude. And I can't wait, so far it's one of my favourite shooters. The company may be small but it has made a great game. There are tons of Dinosaurs you can play as and fight. Tons of customizations, weapons and weapons and vehicles. One thing annoys me though, you can only play team eliminations and free for all's a lot when it goes on sale for $1. When it's not on sale, all you see is survivals and conquests and very rarely a Duel or Gungame.  It's still worth your money and attention. I would recommend getting Orion Dino Horde! (Also like how I heard T-mass on their trailers)
3943	1	a	Halo with Dinosaurs
3945	1	a	I've never posted a serious review below a minimum playtime of 40 hours, but consider the following:  the average wage in western europe is above â‚¬6/h this game costs about 20% less than an espresso  If I ever want to get my money back, I'll have to work 8 minutes overtime, or walk past the coffee place next morning. I could never down-rate a game that cheap.  Besides, just the mere existence of vehicles and sandbox maps give Orion a very good replay value. Sometimes it feels like back in 2007 on Halo 2.  
3947	1	a	 I'd buy that for a Dollar!
3949	1	a	Shooting raptors while flying through the air in a jetpack. Sniping pterodactyls on top of mountians. Driving tanks head-on into battle against a giant alligator. And best of all, flying a VTOL through the air, laying down covering fire for a teammate trying to make it to the base. 10/10 best buck I ever and ever will spend.
3951	1	a	If you are using Steam Enhanced and see that this game has many dislikes, dont act on that. This game, at launch was very buggy and needed a lot of content. The devs have made up for it and have cerrtainly improved the game a lot. I suggest this game A LOT. The metacritic is also another misleading score, it reflects the original games score, but the game has evolved quite a bit since then.   Why should you buy it? This game is for people that like games like Killing Floor that send the players against waves of enemies that keep getting stronger wave after wave, occasionally there will be a boss dino which will be quite the destruction machine. My own suggestion is to play this game with stranger and/or friends, since the singleplayer can feel a bit devoid of hummanity.
3953	1	a	It's pretty much Halo: Reach but you're killing dinosaurs instead of screaming children.
3955	1	a	Do NOT trust metascore ! This game is pure awesomeness ! Spread the word and join !
3957	1	a	The game I feel that it is underrated and it's developers have been keeping to their promises and are still developing it with community ideas with support from people.
3959	1	a	I was shocked when I saw this game being sold for 0.99 â‚¬, so I decided to write a review. This game truly made a great leap in development and is an acceptable, fun and fast shooter with many game modes, maps, enemies and vehicles. Playing with friends is even more fun, and if you're not interested in dinosaurs, you can disable them, receiving a normal FPS game.  I'm very sorry for the developers, who optimized this game instead of just dropping it. It's sad that you are able to earn more cash with an unfinished, bad and buggy 'Early Access' game than actually with a real good game... :c
3961	1	a	Great Game! Best game i have played in a long time, And it is better then some $60+ games! 10/10 would recommand it, Hours of fun!!
3963	1	a	Old review was completely inaccurate and overly subjective, stating in a nutshell, 'this game has jetpacks and dinos what more could you want?' Actually, that was the review in its entirety. An honest review of this game would be that it is a stupid buggy mess, that has its moments, but even when it has those moments, they're a result of the game's utter lunacy. Put that on the box and quote me with it. That said, you'd think I hate the game. You couldn't be more wrong. ORION is to Transformers (Bay Films) as Matt Damon is to a heaping pile of fecal matter. What exactly that means, I'm not sure; and I really only thought through the first bit of that analogy, but what I'm getting at here is that ORION: Beatdown/Horde/Prelude/WorkingTitle is stupid fun. Even more stupid and even more fun with friends, and really its best described as Just a Good Time. Quote that too. It's fun.
3965	1	a	Best game I've ever played in my life 11/10
3967	1	a	My mum bought this for me and told me this is COD:GO the dinomen mod but there was not enough black men without eyes. - Halnoter Jafin
3969	1	a	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5HOt0ZOcYk 
3971	1	a	its kind of good
583	0	a	its not worth 1$
3973	1	a	Few times in one's life do they get the opportunity to do the things that you can do in this game. I have been blessed with the oppurtunity to shoot dinosaurs in the crotch while driving mech suits and tanks.   Doesn't sound relaxing enough?   Perhaps you enjoy pushing your friends and dinosaur corpses through the blood and feces of a now endangered species with state of the art ragdoll physics?  And how can we forget about the CryEngine level graphics and in-depth storyline? I was hooked from the beginning of the 10 level massacre to the end. I became legitimately worried about the sanity and morality of the characters and even the dinosaurs. The game creates a player-glitchy NPC bond that can only be created on the incredibly diverse levels that the developers have created. Don't even get me started on the animations! They were 'Transformers' quality and left me in awe every time I looked at them in 3rd person mode.   Basically, this game gives you an oppurtunity to achieve your goals and conquer your greatest fears in one incredible experience.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 26/10 would recommend to public ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Best game on Steam. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3975	1	a	THIS GAME IS ONLY .99 AND ITS VERY FUN TO PLAY WITH FRIENDS I PURCHASED 5 COPIES OF THIS AND SENT TO FRIENDS THIS IS A COMBINATION OF HALO + BORDERLANDS 2 + Planetside 2 I ENJOYED IT A LOT 10.5/10
3977	1	a	I like this game. Glitchy as at times and it does seem a bit chucked together, but fun all the same. Really, for 79p it's not like you are wasting your money. You'd get more hours out of this than you would goes on an arcade machine :D
3979	1	a	If you're going to buy a game in which you wield lightsabers, shoot your friends and blow the tar out of some massive dinosaurs while flying hundreds of feet up in the air, I would probably recommend this game above other games that fall into those categories. Most likely.
3981	1	a	I like this game. Glitchy as at times and it does seem a bit chucked together, but fun all the same. Really, for 79p it's not like you are wasting your money. You'd get more hours out of this than you would goes on an arcade machine :D
3983	1	a	Definitely far from a bad game. If Borderlands had a Horde Mode sponsored by the National History Museum's Dinosaur wing, this is it.
584	0	a	I got this game for free.... and I want my money back.
3985	1	a	Nice game but it has some things that could be done better but the benefit that it's a cheap game makes it good. :)
585	0	a	horribru
3987	1	a	The metascore may be low, but this game is real fun with friends
3989	1	a	I think I shot a dinosaur and it moonjumped into space, came back down to Earth at break-neck speeds, and survived impact only to land in water and drown.  Why aren't more people playing this, again?
3991	1	a	I was riding on the back of a T-Rex.  10/10
3993	1	a	BUY IT BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!!  Edit: Oh wait its free...
3995	1	a	METACRITIC SCORE IS A LIE
3997	1	a	After reading the reviews, I bought this game thinking I would get a few lolz with 3 friends for 3 euros. After playing for a while, I have to say that this game is ridiculous and looks funny, but it is also absolutely fun and awesome.  Animations look weird, graphics are dated and some illustration are hilarious in a kitsch way. It can be confusing too and doesn't make much sense. But as long as you don't take the game seriously it's surprisingly fun. Just try it if you can without expecting too much. It does a very good job at making you forget its flaw.
3999	1	a	I played this game for 25 hours striaght for Extra Life 2013, and despite the obvious exhastion of playing a video game for that long, it was a surprisingly fun experience! There was more than enough content to keep me occupied by myself for around 10 hours, and 10 more if you have friends to play with. Of course it isn't perfect, the looping music can get very repetitive, but it does a good job of getting you hyped up. As of this review, it is on sale for $0.99 and Free-to-Play, so at least give it an hour of your time, and be patient with it.
4001	1	a	Really cool game tbh. Looks cheap bad etc... BUt truly its a great game with a bit of call of duty in it and some nice graphics really cool ideas and creative!
4003	1	a	36 Metascore, everytime for 1 Euro... Dont care about that... The game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing awesome!
4005	1	a	no one told me it had dinosaurs, completely misleading.
4007	1	a	Definitely better than what the metacritic suggests. And for $1 right now... totally worth it. Get it while it lasts! Has the structure for replayability, especially with friends.  Edit: The previous was my inital reaction. A more detailed review to come.
595	0	a	This game for me was more of a Yes/No thoughts about it. I usally found a match, so that was good; Gameplay gets boring after about 2.5hrs you just do the same thing over and over unless you change gamemodes which may give you another 1hr of gameplay. The weapon buying system is decent, you can buy turrets, Flamethrower, Minigun, swords, New primary weapons, Grenades, ect. Some of the reloading animations can be buggy, such as fingers going through weapon. Overall this game  just  went below average.
4009	1	a	My friend said to me 'hey Protahto! this will be the best decision you ever made', I believed him. I have since killed myself from the hatred I bear for this game. Has some neat holiday themed updates. Fun times ahead. 8/10
4011	1	a	This game is like a combination of Starwars, Unreal Tournament, and Jurrasic park, by far 3 very popular things together couldnt turn out better than ORION. The dinosaurs will actually use pack strategy on you, and instead of being high and mighty in vehicles, larger dinos can put you in your place quite easily. By far an epic game experience thats never the same twice.
4013	1	a	A First Person Shooter. Check! Multiplayer? Check! Upgradable Weaponry? Check! Stealth Camouflage? Check! Jetpacks? Check! Tanks, Mech-warriors and other Military Grade Equipment? Check! Oh, yes... Dinosaurs, hungry for your blood? Check!  I have not had such a lot of fun in ages. Mutiplay with friends in Co-op is awesome. You should get it just for that. 
597	0	a	too many glitches and stuff they need to fix them
598	0	a	Pay real cash for in-game items for a game which you already paid for?...Really?...Might as well make it free to play then.
4015	1	a	drive around run around fly around and kill those dinos. loads of fun and laughter and best played with friends!
599	0	a	So I see a ton of reviews stating that 'This game is fun! This game is Awesome!! Best Co-oop ever!', but none of them give you any details at all. I see some that do, but it annoys me that they put up a 'release' video that has multiple reviews doing just what I hate. Don't get me wrong though, I do love the idea of showing the communities love for a game by putting their name on the video, but at the same time it's bad. I'll get to the point though, the review of the game via pro and con list.  Pros: The game is 0.99c. It has co-op in so many ways. It has pvpve. it has hordes of dinos. It is satisfying to kill a bunch of dinos with a big gun/tank. There are lots of weapons. Conquest mode has a very interesting concept. It has the old announcer styled 'Double Kill, Triple Kill, ect'.  Cons: There is a bug that allows your 'Private' server to become a public server without warning. There is no way to change the audio for the Dino's seperately from the other audio so if your game volume isn't low the T-rex will kill your ears. For all the guns, there are really only about 10 you will ever use. If one person is killing all the dinos they get all the money, and can share it, but usually won't since the good weapons cost so much. Getting a tank is a savior just as much as a death wish, as you can die in seconds to anything larger than the acid spitting dinos.(T-rex, stega, ect.) Getting stuck on spots is very likely. The tank's machine gun is ear â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ much like the large dino roars. The Mech is awesome looking but will die even faster than a jeep without a gun will. There are turrets, but they only last for 60seconds. They have an apc that does tons more damage than the tank, and has seats that are supposed to allow passangers to shoot from, but they do not, and it has a main gun that was apparently taken out so the main weapon has a non-functional cannon on it now. The most viable way of killing dinos is running them over, but that will get you far far far less credits so you will be less useful versus large dinos. There are still other bugs that have not been adressed. Controllers still do not function properly with the game. The new update has brought in even more bugs than before it seems. This is supposedly the 3rd time the game has been 'redone' or whatever they would like to call it, and the ammount of change is so pitifully small that it's not worth mentioning.  So after putting all that in, I'll say this for my final words. I have played the game quite a bit, I'm lvl20+, which I didn't put as a pro or con because I didn't think of it as especially one or the other. I have used most of the weapons except for a select few that I just have not wanted to use at all. I've played all the co-op maps so far for survival and conquest. I can say this from my experience. I would not pay 99c to play this game. It is fun for a short while, but after you get frustrated with it, and after you realize how buggy and glitchy the game is. You and your friends will quickly move onto other games, and the fact that they have renamed it(for reasons I didn't look into as I didn't really care.) along side pricing it at 99c now, makes me feel like they have possibly given up on fixing anything with it, and just want to squeeze this lemon for it's last drops of juice. They put out a fancy trailer that recognizes the positive short review from the community, and left it at that. So I say keep your dollar, and buy something else. This game will most likely rot in your steam library like it has mine. It has become that game that me and a few friends play for about 1hour every 2-3 months then forget it again because we hate the bugs and glitches.
4017	1	a	Ignore the metacritic score. It's freakin' awesome. I'd say it's like Halo meets a Tower Defense game (with one one tower to defend, and I'm pretty sure it doesn't shoot), set in Jurassic Park after the dinosaurs broke out, but without all those pesky fences.  In essence, X number of dinosaur waves come at your team (10-30-infinite I believe), and after each wave, your team has a chance to purchase weapons and upgrades. There are also upgrades you can get for you whole account/player, but I've only gotten one so far, so I don't want to give any misinformation; I can't recall what I achieveved to get the upgrade. That's how they work though, accomplish an 'acheivement' and then in the future you'll always have that upgrade the 'acheivement' granted you.  I won't give too much away, but the vehicles are ALL awesome, and the whole game is loads of fun. Not to mention, look in their 'recent updates' area of thier Steam page: 'Buy ORION: Dino Horde, Get ANOTHER Game FREE!' Read it. Enough said.  Buy this while on sale and you won't regret it. If I knew it was this good, I would have probably already have bought it before Steam's 'Sales' section got me again.  It's the best game I've ever gotten on Steam for $0.99, and it's better than a lot of current FPS big name titles.  Buy it. Play it. You won't regret it. At least try the free 2 days!
4019	1	a	Even though many people says that it's bad, I had alot oof fun with it. I recomend playing with friends for maximum fun.
4021	1	a	Orion Dino Horde Is A great Game! it literaly grabs you into the world where you must fight dinos for survival BUY IT NOW BEFORE THE DINOS EAT YOU!
4023	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING BEST GAME YEAAA 10/10 A MASTERPIECE
4025	1	a	Halo ft. Dinosaurs. Still buggy but constantly updated, get some friends, crack open a box of Scooby Snacks and don't go into the long grass
4027	1	a	Have you ever wanted to play Halo 3, or Borderlands but you were too â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing stingy? Well Orion Dino Horde is the game for you! Bungie, and 2k obviously stole many aspects from this game. Including the borderlands vehicle controls, the second wind, actions, and many other aspects from borderlands. Now on to the halo guns, textures, hornets, and character models. Great Game! This quote perfectly shows this game 'I paid $3.99 for this game, and its better than most of my other $60.00 games.
4029	1	a	If you have Â£0.99 its a must buy! Better yet buy 4 copies for Â£2.99 then you can give them too your friends when they ask why you don't come outside anymore... I see dead dino's... and I love it.
4031	1	a	The metascore is definitely something you should just ignore. The developers have really done a fantastic job and I hope that they will continue to do so. The gameplay (survival) can become boring since you're playing it over and over again but if you're playing it with your friends it can be extremely fun. With all the current features that it has e.g. gamemodes, weapons, vehicles etc. that will definitely expand in the future I recommend it.
4033	1	a	Don't let the metacritic review stop you from getting this game. Great buy with good multiplayer and forces you to work together or you won't survive.
4035	1	a	Best game ever 10/10 would play again
4037	1	a	It's hard being a support class. Everytime there's a support class, you are expected to heal/support team mates while saving your own skin. If your team mate dies 'IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT' , if you die 'IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT', if your whole team dies 'WHERE THE HELL IS THE SUPPORT?'. RIP support class for being too supportive :(
4039	1	a	EPIC dino killing!!! Ps. the METACRITIC Score is WRONG!! its for the old version, this is Mk2, all new and improved!!
4041	1	a	an unpolished gem, get more servers and you guys good to go. im having fun playing with my friends, but with a helluva ping. 8/10
4043	1	a	I love this game ! :D
4045	1	a	You get Halo, CoD, and one heck of a FPS for .99 cents
601	0	a	Despite having a relatively good computer, I found it really hard to play this game. Many of the reviews had good things to say, though, and I wish I was able to experience all that it is capable of.  Maybe I'll try again at another date!
4047	1	a	Didn't think I'd like this CS:GO-inspired kind of game, but oddly, the first time I loaded it up and played a little bit, it was like the first time I played Zombies. It's so simple yet addicting and for $0.49, no one can argue that price.
4049	1	a	YOU SHOOT DINO'S  AND DRIVE MECHS AND DRAGON FLYS (TO GET MAD AIR)  WHAT THE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ MORE DO YOU WANT?
4051	1	a	This game made me realize that judging a game based on Critic reviews is a big mistake. I just don't know why people complain about this game. This game is very enjoyable and has hours of fun!
4053	1	a	Rightful winner of Game of The Year every-year 
4055	1	a	Really laggy but the eleven minutes i could play were awesome!!! I love how the dinos teleport!!!
4057	1	a	cool.
4059	1	a	When I first bought this game for 1 dollars.. I was like holy &amp;%^$ this is such rubbish game, not even worth for 1 dollar.. Never going play it again, I even wish it remove from my account.. Last night saw one big update and I thought it might my pc delete by mistake and download it again.. until i saw big news about developer change this game completely! My eyes pop out when I saw the big changes on graphic.. today i give a try.. WHAT A AMAZING GAME!!!!! Spiral Game Studios.. please read this review.. THANK U FOR LISTEN TO ALL FANS.. I going recommend this to all my friends and trying ask them to get this! 1 Dollar? I believe it shall be price more than 1 dollar because it brilliant! I just need you to fix chat log, make it more more clean and simple like others game in co-op please :)
4061	1	a	love the game, wish i could delete all my progress so i could experience the thrill again from leveling up and getting stronger doing so.
4063	1	a	This game is T-Rexcellent.
4065	1	a	I really love how immersive this game is, it's like a mix of jurassic park and halo came together and had a brain baby, this game is very fun and I personally recommend it.
4067	1	a	This game started out as 'meh whatever' and is now skyrocketing somewhere between 'neat' and 'awesome'. While it's not a AAA title game it is also not available for $50- anything below $15-20 for this game is something you cannot say no to. Whether you just wanna mow down a ton or Dinos with your friends or wanna mow down a ton of friends as a dino- this is the game for you.
4069	1	a	After about four hours of firing non-stop rockets into an unending wave of invisible raptors with bright orange heads, I'd say this game was worth the 50c I paid for it.  The horror never ends.
602	0	a	How to play : Play for like 2 mins max and delete
4071	1	a	10/10 would get chomped again.
4073	1	a	worse than cancer 10/10
4075	1	a	I've put in a lot of hours into this game and it's better than last two COD games released! I'm looking at you COD Ghosts!!! Anyways, the game is highly adictive and fun and may have some issues if you're playing solo or online! Unless you got a really good gaming computer like Alien or similar, than disable blooming and dynamic lighting! (even though it takes away from the overall awesomeness it brings to the game) And set the game to windowed mode to help out with makeing sure you have a better speed! (May not work for everybody) Overall this game will bring back nostalgia of Turok while adding other styles of games to make a familiar, yet unique, style of gameplay! Hope you guys (and gals) have as much fun as I have with this game!
4077	1	a	It may be a really cheesy game, but metascore is way too low. It has no outstanding features, but playing co-op (especially with friends) is a real blast!!!
4079	1	a	This game is Awesome. You can drive cars and fly Helicoptors.
4081	1	a	Definatly worth 99cents
4083	1	a	I have to say, this game has turned out to be pretty awesome. Keep up the good work devs, and thanks for making a fun game.
4085	1	a	This game is ridiculous. But it's worth a shot, if you play with your friends. For only a buck it's a decent experience. There's something about this game that gets people playing it, I guess, it's the mindless run-shoot-upgrade model. This game has its fun, but you have to give it a time. I enjoyed this shooter much more than L4D2 for instance. Also, it has one of the most easiest-to-acquire achievement system, I have encountered on Steam. My overall rating â€“ 6/10, because, after all, this game is shallow and with lots of bugs.
4087	1	a	This is the most 99 cent game I've ever played
4089	1	a	has potential. if the creators did not throw the game, and will make a few improvements, will be a great game
4091	1	a	there be dinosaurs; u shoot them more importantly, u could almost buy a candy bar, or get this game instead
4093	1	a	this is one of those games that makes you want to take a bath with a toaster 10/10
4095	1	a	Orion: Prelude is really not a bad game like the price would suggest. It deserves a lot more players in my opinion. Parts of it remind me of the original Halo. The graphics are of course better than the original Halo, but still slightly on the outdated side if you compare it to something like Battlefield 4. ALTHOUGH, atmospheric conditions in the maps are some of the best I've seen. Fog rolling in, sunlight and rain, frost on your visor, day fading to night and then to moonlight; it all looks really beautiful in this game. There is a bit of a cartoonish appearance to the maps but I kind of like that. There's a good amount of weapons to pick from. I suggest playing the Gun Game mode first to figure out the controls and weapons if this is your first time. Start your own Gun Game server if there aren't any, preferably with a friend, and people will usually join. There is a leveling system but nothing that would really affect gameplay unless you were playing in a Deathmatch mode against some really high level/experienced players. Co-op against dinos is a blast. Co-op against Santa is a blast. This can be a really fun game.
4097	1	a	These developers man. Selling this game for $0.99? This game is better developed than any early access and most recent full release titles. Well worth the amount you spend on it if you have a friend to play with.
4099	1	a	best game NA jimmy buy this right now u cok guzler
4101	1	a	It's like cs go, but with dinosaurs  11/10 - Would play this game again (with friends this game is a must own)
4103	1	a	this game is sp00ky, 10/10 would bang
4105	1	a	Like this game came out of nowhere. It was truly outrageous. Phill Fish really knocked it out of the park. Cancelling Fez 2 was worth after he made this magnificent masterpiece. Truly the best game i've ever played in my entire life.  à¼¼ ã¤â—•_â—•à¼½ã¤à¼¼ ã¤â—•_â—•à¼½ã¤à¼¼ ã¤â—•_â—•à¼½ã¤à¼¼ ã¤â—•_â—•à¼½ã¤à¼¼ ã¤â—•_â—•à¼½ã¤à¼¼ ã¤â—•_â—•à¼½ã¤à¼¼ ã¤â—•_â—•à¼½ã¤à¼¼ ã¤â—•_â—•à¼½ã¤
4107	1	a	ORION: Prelude  Would totally recommend this game! It's a fun dino FPS that's great for playing with friends. You capture bases, buy weapons, get upgrades, and fight off dino hordes!  PLUS if you like getting achievements there are tons that come really easily, mostly from just casually playing the game.  Picked this up for $1.50 in the steam summer sale and would give it an 8 - 10
4109	1	a	This is a really good game, not 'good because it's cheap', but this game stands on it's own merits. Lots of fun, good feeling weaponry, the graphics are simple but clear and attractive. Strongly recommend.
4111	1	a	Great Game For MultiPlayer And Killing Different Dragons !!! &lt;3 &lt;3 but shuld inprove a bit cause it's a bit of a mix of Halo i hate Halo but when i m playing it i kida foget about it :)
4113	1	a	'Very Great Game indeed' -Quote from ME! :D  I would play this game MORE often if I get a better Pc,Who wouldnt buy a game thats 1$ and great graphics! :D
4115	1	a	PHEW *Wipes Sweat From face* Just got done playing a conquest on wave 30, man what a ride it was.  It was litteraly the most enjoyable 2 hours spent on a match i've ever had!  There was never a dull moment each part had action killing murdering beating down dino noobs across the tundra. Got in my VTOL/Helicopter started wrecking all types of dinos across the map I felt like the damn ice age myself the way i was killing those dinos.  DOUBLE KILL TRIPLE KILL MEGA KILL ULTRA KILL ARMAGEDDON LAST BUT NOT LEAST BRING ME SOME PIZZA!  Those are the coolest kill streak quotes in the game i feel like a damn boss when they guy is telling me all that mojo! This game has AWESOME REPLAYABILITY I RECOMMEND GETTING IT NOW WHILE IT'S ONE DOLLAR! You're paying one dollar for a game that produces $60 of fun honestly, which in my book is pretty darn good.  Highly Highly Highly recommend this game to all you guys looking for something new or something to play with friends with this is you're game I for sure know it!
4117	1	a	Jetpacks, guns and dinosaurs. What more could you want? Tanks? yup, got that. Multiplayer? What else IS there? Fancy devouring the corpses of your vanquished foe? Got that.  Best game ever, 10/10
4119	1	a	Insane level  Active the generator, kill raptors, restore the generator, , kill compys, restore the gen again, almost die ; revive, buy weapons upgrades,kill dilos ,secure the outpost killing a trike and 236 dinos, back to base without press 5 and no vehicles, a rex is coming; poor rex, be a sniper; dead by rhams,help mates; dying in front of you,buy all augments , even the antifreeze in slopes, bots stuck in a wall; annoying sound, trike smash; die in high grass, buy smoke ,last dinosaur in wave; rahm stuck in a high rock sooooo far away....  Kill everything using the gatling gun with the assault class... 11/10
4121	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it was ninety nine cents.
4123	1	a	It plays like Halo! It's got Dinosaurs but it's a breakfast cereal! 
4125	1	a	Totally Worth 99 cents
4127	1	a	gameplay 1/3 story 9/1 graphics 2.14/6 moms 8/4  Overall 10/10 Game of the last year
4129	1	a	I was hesitant to get this, because of its metascore, but it's actually worth it. This game is a great FPS that reminds me of Turok: Dinosaur Hunter (anyone else?), but I can guarantee you that this game is original and only reminds me of it. In this game, you kill dinosaurs with guns, something I've always wanted to do as a child.  In spite of a few bugs here and there, this game is pretty good (very good if you got it for its sale price). With just a bit more development, this game has the potential to get its metascore where it schould be.  I rate ORION: Dino Horde a 7.75 out of 10.
4131	1	a	This game is so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing fun its unreal. There is a survival horde mode and PvP. A solid 10 hours of fun AT LEAST
4133	1	a	shot an Dino in his â™¥â™¥â™¥ and he blew up 10/10
4135	1	a	Best game I ever bought
4137	1	a	Okay, Metacritic failed the score for this game! I got this when it was on sale for $1, but I still recommend it at its $15 price tag. Basically, its killing dinosaurs with mechs, and on a lot of servers, you can BE a dinosaur.  Hours of fun, so buy it now. Overall rating: 88/100
4139	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.... 
4141	1	a	It's kind of a glitchy game, worth a dollar. Graphics are 'ok' but still good enough to have fun.
4143	1	a	this is a fun game and at one point you can be a dino yourself 
4145	1	a	Dinosaur shapes , chef boyardee ~ DINOSAURS! ~
4147	1	a	Counter strike with Dinosaurs, do you really need anything more? You even get classes to buff yourself up so you can HACK INTO DINO ANKLES WITH A KNIFE
4149	1	a	DO YOU HATE PREHISTORIC LIFE? DO YOU HATE THEM ENOUGH TO MURDER THEM WITH VARIOUS FUTURISTIC WEAPONS?? IF YOU'VE ANSWERED NO TO ANY OF THESE QUESTIONS, DO A 360 AND RE-EVALUATE YOUR LIFE CHOICES IN LIFE. BECAUSE THIS IS THE GAME FOR ALL HUMAN BEINGS (AND THE OCCASIONAL QUADRAPED) TO TRULY FEEL SWEET JUSTICE AGAINST THAT VEGETARIAN STEGASAURUS THAT KILLED YOUR FAMILY BACK IN 'NAM. YOU OWE IT TO THEM (AND THE PRESIDENT) TO SEEK JUSTICE AND REVENGE. THIS IS YOUR CHANCE. TAKE IT, BECAUSE IT IS A DANGER TO YOURSELF IF YOU GO ALONE, SO BRING FRIENDS. NOT ME THOUGH, I'M BUSY.
4151	1	a	Definaltly one of the best, most funnest multiplayer games and fps games. Don't listen to metascore. I have no idea how they gave it a 36. It deserves like 106! Just get it. GET IT NOW. You need this in your life. You won't regret it.
4153	1	a	I heard bad reviews coming into this game, but me and my friends ended up having an absolute blast playing it.
4155	1	a	hands down the best game you can get for $0.99. tons of game modes and cool guns! perfect for the jurassic world hype!
4157	1	a	I played this game a little while ago and it wasn't terrible but it had things in the game that just were not done well. But now it seems the Developers actually saw this and unlike other game devs they actually fixed â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. NIce job
4159	1	a	Pretty good game, I like getting the handheld minigun as support, and having the self healing as that class to is a teensy bit OP, and the start pistol is pretty OP for that too, but really good game overall
4161	1	a	If you're like me, you know the meta-score is the first impression of any game. If it's between 70-80 and above, it's worthe considering right?  Let me tell you this, ORION: Dino Horde is a good game. Maybe not so much the $15...probably catch it on a sale (sorry devs, but it's a consumer opinion)   ORION is pretty damn fun. Really great shoot 'em up, an original concept, and although it has a bug once every 50 play throughs, it's stable. You know how you're on skype with friends and you're all trying to figure out a game to play because you're all bored? You scroll down your games list looking for games you guys both have and wanna play. Well lemme tell you this, ORION: Dino Horde is always a game that we agree to.  Check it our, join in, be a part of the community, and shoot some dinos!
4163	1	a	Super fun game the score is very deciving its super fun!!!
4165	1	a	Fun game for the price! I feel like I got my monies worth.
4167	1	a	its like battlefield and borderlands 2 had a dino baby
4169	1	a	At first this game didn't seem that apealing, but when I started eating it I kind of liked the taste.
4171	1	a	A lot better than it looks. It's like Shadow of the Colossus, mixed with iCarly.
4173	1	a	Noscoping dinosours has never been so fun.
4175	1	a	I had a difficult time choosing if I wanted to buy this game or not. Sure, it's only a dollar, but I guess the guy behind it pulled some shady dealings, so I couldn't decide if I was okay with that.  After much though, I came to the conclusion that a buck was worth giving the game a try, and I'm glad I did. While there are still a few bugs in the game, it's fun and refreshing. I didn't realize just how much we really needed a dinosaur game!]  If you can overcome the moral arguement of the game dev, and overlook the outdated metascore, this game has a lot of potential.
4177	1	a	If you're looking for a triple AAA platnum seller, then go look somewhere else, but if you're looking for a shooter that runs decently where you kill dinosaurs just for â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and giggles, then you've come to the right store page! First of all, the game has a really cheap price tag attached to it, but that doesn't mean it's not a good game. Again, it's no game of the year award winner, but you really get a lot out of this for the price you pay, especially if you're buying it for only $1. If nothing else, it makes for a great game to play on rainy days when you lose your internet connection. Just fire up the game, turn on bots, and have more fun than you might expect. I played this once a long time ago and wasn't that impressed, but recently I played it again and was surprised to see that the devs have been updating the game, which is really saying a lot when you think about how little most devs care once they get your money. So come on! Buy the game, install it, and have yourself some fun. It's $0.99 and I can pretty much guaranty that you'll get your money's worth out of it.
4179	1	a	It's Halo. BUT WITH FRICKING DINOS. nuff said
4181	1	a	It's 0.79p?  what you waiting for i got more enjoyment out of this than COD AW   no surprises though :(  but this game for 79p   go.
4183	1	a	THIS IS THE BEST GAME 
4185	1	a	This game, like others have said, is a mixture of Halo and Left 4 Dead in gameplay, with maybe something else thrown in. My computer runs Left 4 Dead 2, Portal 2, and Team Fortress 2 just fine, but for some reason, struggles with this game. I had to lower the graphics settings in-game to their lowest just to even get close to a decent performance. And even then, I didn't find the game that fun. I can see its potential, though. It's just not working for me personally. So my recommendation only comes half-heartedly, but only because I don't think it would be fair to say I don't recommend the game.
4187	1	a	Probably the worst game I have ever played. 69/11
4189	1	a	HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!   ITS LIKE HALO. SURVIVE AND THRIVE. And watch to Dactlys.They seem to be annoying trying to swoop down on u but get a couple of buds and u can survive them.Totally worth to buy it.
4191	1	a	this game is so fantastic i cream my pants EVERY TIME I PLAY IT â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING LOVE DINOSAURS AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUGH
4193	1	a	Stole the lightsaber sound from star wars 8/8
4195	1	a	When I bought this game i got to blaze it everyday with a T-rex. T-REX IS LOVE! T-REX IS LIFE! 10/10
4197	1	a	This game needs better optimization but its good. I wish this game had a better explanation of the gamemodes, and it had more unlocks. The game dinos just seem to be repeating and have very bad sprites.
4199	1	a	I thought dinosaurs were the scariest thing about this game. Turns out it's the bugs.
4201	1	a	The Metascore given by critics to this game is very misleading as this game deserves somewhere between 80-90 score. Good gameplay - almost the same if you combine Halo and Jurassic Park together. Makes you nervous everytime you queue solo for the game. Best to play it in multiplayer. Slight bugs on the dinosaurs but its a great game to have.
4203	1	a	For a dollar, this was one of the craziest and most enjoyable games I've purchased. The fast-paced hordes of velociraptors, pterodactyls, and eventual T-rex is absolutely amazing with 4 of your friends, if not complete strangers. Not to mention the insane abailities and vehicles, like jetpacks and health stealing, or tanks and mech suits.   Buy this game for a buck, and kill dinos without giving a ****.
4205	1	a	team duel - the most fun i've ever had gaming - 5v5 using only lightsabers, bows, temperary stealth and super jumps... need i say more... no, no i don't.
4207	1	a	Super fun with friends. Rough around the edges but still really fun. For less than $3 100% recommend. Just buy the 4 pack and give it to your friends.
4209	1	a	I probably paid somewhere around $10 for this game when it was actively being worked on. It was one of the first early access games that I purchased and my friend and I had a blast killing dinosaurs. You used to be able to purchase vehicles as well as weapons. For whatever reason they took out the vehicle purchasing building. There are still vehicles, but they are spread out across the map in little outpost like areas. You could say it makes it more challenging. I would say it takes away a bit of the tactical choices and freedom of playing the game the way you like. When I played the community wasn't huge, but usually saw a pretty high uptick in players when it went on sale. There are a lot worse games for $0.99 or less. I would recommend this game, if you you have a friend that would like to blow away a bunch of dinosaurs with you. Well worth the $0.99.
4211	1	a	Was not expecting this to be much of a game halo vs jurassic park was my first impression oh how wrong i was its a challenge its funny and iwould suggest everyone gives it a try. survival mode multi player awesome times grab a can grab your mates and get to killing everything that moves :)
4213	1	a	One of the best games I have out of my almost 100 game steam library! The Metacritic is wrong. Other than connection problems, the game has no problems. It gets better with time. The Devs really deserve for this game to be played. GET THIS GAME ALREADY!
4215	1	a	Got rekt by a stegasaurus while running from velocirapors. 10/10 would die again.
4217	1	a	The Metacritic score of 36 / 100 is way off base...I'm thinking that the game was released a little early with too many bugs, but the Developers have fixed that and added a ton of content. This game is a lot of fun. There are many different weapons, dinos, vehicles to drive, game modes, upgrades, etc.
4219	1	a	Very fun game! Great Co-op style and is like fighting a militia.
4221	1	a	nice game and it is cheap. Good for playing with friends for few hours.
4223	1	a	Got rekt by a stegasaurus while running from velocirapors. 10/10 would die again.
4225	1	a	this is a great game a mashup of halo jpark a little bit of ctf &amp; survivle
4227	1	a	THIS GAME was pretty so so, yeah, my friends didn't want to play it anymore
4229	1	a	I'm bad at writing reviews, but this game deserves another thumbs up, so here you go. Easily worth 10 to 15 bucks. Pure madness they are selling it this cheap.  Also, these devs deserve way more attention and praise. They kept working on their game, kept releasing free patches and updates for years. In a world where abandoned Early Access games and bug-ridden triple A titles are daily routine, these devs are showing exceptional dedication both towards their game and their customers.
4231	1	a	It's Halo with Dinosaurs
4233	1	a	This is a great game, it's has alot of playibility due to workshop. Multiplayer is great and graphics are good
4235	1	a	It cost me less than two dollars. And I can shoot dinosaurs.
4237	1	a	The first time I was killed I was dropped 200 feet to my death by a pterodactyl.  Fun game to play for an a short time period. I can't sit and play it at length like I can a lot of games, but if you're looking to waste an hour or so it's a great game for it.
4239	1	a	better than ARK
4241	1	a	Soooooooooo This game finished downloading; so I decided to sit down and play it at (around) 12:15 AM Eastern time. When I look around or just stand still the screen tears and graphical errors seem to occur. Combine this sleeping and tired eyes and you can either   A. Get yourself a headache B. Go Blind C. Get an EXTREME seziure  Or the common effect D. All of the above!  4.5/5
4243	1	a	one dollar is well fukken cheap for good game... but then THEY DISCOUNT IT INTO HALF.  I mean, even it's cheaper than I buy coffee without the cup and sugar!  10/10 good game, best price.  np: even now I feel guilty when buying this at halved price.
4245	1	a	Killing Dino's have never been so much fun!!! Teamwork is great and all... but killing dino's with tanks and what not just takes the cake!
604	0	a	I dont know if im doing something wrong but i have big fps lags with this game, when the rest of tha games i have works well
4247	1	a	Like killing Dinousaurs? Want a first person shooter? Do you want to drive tanks, fly helicopters and control mechas? Or what if you want to be the Dinousaur and kill the other players? Now imagine you can do all this in one game. Welcome to ORION: Prelude :P
4249	1	a	I just picked a 4pack up for 3$.   Pros vs Cons:  Pros: Dinosaurs Jetpacks Mechs Tanks Dinosaurs  Cons: I can't find a laser..but there is a F'CKING LASERSWORD..  Really, for 1$, there are no cons. It works, I had fun. And I KILLED DINOSAURS USING A JETPACK.  Buy it.
4251	1	a	Just buy it
605	0	a	So it got updated. And nothing from what I've noiced has changed. It's still the same boring buggy mess when it was orion: dino horde. Just go buy primal carnage instead. That's an actual good game where you shoot dinosaurs.
4253	1	a	this game is so good. i have a great time using the battlefield 4 guns. the graphics are better then real life view. there is a few â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ places like riding the T-Rex.  i enjoyed the most to replace the guns! once in a life time experience
4255	1	a	Mid or Mac because Mid is not Mac but when Mac is Mid it is
4257	1	a	This game is the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥!!!  9/2 Would not â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.  play it
4259	1	a	fun and amazing I love it. one of the best Dino games I've played
613	0	a	This game is terrible. First 2 minutes sure that was fun but after that its terrible. The reviews below are misleading the trailer is nothing like the game, this is just Halo with Dinosaurs. The game is full of microtransactions and full of glitches. Do not trust the trailers or reviews that are postitive the developers are lying and this is not even worth putting on your Hard Drive even if its free. DO NOT be pulled into the heap of trash which is Orion: Dino Horde
4261	1	a	ok, i can't beat around the bush here, this game is fun AND ONLY FUN with friends if you're a neckbeard loner lurker on â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ then this game is the equivalent of having a dinosaur mug you for 15 dolans or 1 dolan if you got it during the sale, with friends you can make fun of how stupid and awful and dumb and fat and ugly and mean the game is together, unite people with the hatred that is this game. its fun with idiot pals 4/10
619	0	a	Grafica e naspa.... Graphic is to low and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥....
620	0	a	if u want good graphics this is not a choice for u
4263	1	a	What Jurassic Park could have been if it had a good director like Michael Bay.
621	0	a	Eh. Can't launch a game with a friend, that's kinda why i bought this :/ if this gets fixed i might change my mind. why release a game that has that many bugs?
4265	1	a	this is the game of the year, if you dont have this you might as well just give up. buy the 4 pack just for yourself and have pride in having 4 copies of this game. dont trade any of them away. truly a masterpiece of our time 7 flamingos/5 flamingos.
622	0	a	its like a worse version of primal carnage. the sound and movement aren't really sinced at least when u shoot.
4267	1	a	Better than Angry Birds
4269	1	a	This is probably the best game that you can get for $1 (on sale)! Only thing I don't like are the microtransactions (purely asthetic). I would have preferred to unlock all the asthetic's through playing the game but really it's quite minor. This game holds it own and seriously is more fun and addictive then the shooter you are playing right now. It's a must get.
4271	1	a	Don't trust the Metacritic score. This game is absolutly amazeballs.
4273	1	a	After wading into this game with unceremoniously low expectations and a halfish-hour of actual game time solo (the rest was toying with tweaks to get some enhancements working), I can at least say my expectations were met and there is a decent game underneath this. Disregarding the, um, troubled history that I found out after. Sure, there's no tutorial, motion blur is apparently not working, the trailer is an amateur looking montage of gameplay with quotes from who knows where, the animation is abyssmally 1999 (a F- I'd say), the visuals are some sort of bland thing reminding me of Serious Sam 2 and Halo: Combat Evolved and the gameplay is a mix of older Unreal, current class based affairs and Halo gunplay and vehicular antics, but with DINOSAAAAURS. Still there's at least a fundamentally good game at the core. The HUD needs some better iconography (I had to guess at what the heck the two bars were), the animation completely ruins the look for me and the sound effects are absolutely terrible. Gameplay-wise the general mode seems to be Survival (I just tried that solo) where you have to protect or otherwise secure objectives from marauding waves of dinosaurs, with opportunities to buy character perks or equipment as you go. There are also some PvP modes and an apparent laundry list of features in this here store page, but they aren't elaborated much in game. It's kind of like Killing Floor in a Turok setting, but with terrible production values. If you're looking for the next bit of fun to spend 99 cents on, I'd certainly say okay. Sure, it's artistically strongly inspired, but uncreative ideas don't necessarily mean bad ones.
4275	1	a	Cheap and Good ^^
4277	1	a	There's dinosaurs?! That was scary as all hell!
4279	1	a	This game is so awesome now, shooting dinosaurs for only 99 cents! I bought 4 copies of this game for 1.50 euros to give to my friends and play together. This game is very fun and challenging for a couple of hours. ORION: Prelude is totally worth your money: 8/10
4281	1	a	You like halo?!?! You like dinorsaurs?? Than this is the game for you!!!
4283	1	a	Stupid amount of fun, especially with friends. Worth it for the price no doubt
4285	1	a	I had this game for a while. It is pretty damn fun. Think Killing Floor with Dinos in the far future with vehicles and you get the idea.   Also while its on sale for 99 cents, why the hell not!?
4287	1	a	Was â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ at the start, developers were like 'â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ me with a mango flavored popsticle, looks like we gotta improve this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.' and then they gave us an update more vicious than a hobo hurling out of his trolley in believe of hearing a 5c coin dropping to the ground and seeing you about to pick it up. This game could kill a 78 year old man just by... know what, it probably can't do that, BUT NOT â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING YET ANYWAY, this game is still being worked upon to become such a popular steam game that it will have its own store where you can buy in-game items and trade them over the steam community with your beloved friends and other members of this ever growing community, now where the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ have we heard of this before???? Till then it will be a 10/10 and HOPEFULLY remain that way after all those traveling salesmen come along and turn this game into a bartering simulator.
4289	1	a	This is a great FPS with many play options and configurations. In a phrase: Halo vs Dinos. Oh and it sells for less than a dollar. I have put more hours into this game than other games I have spent $50 on.  I highly recomend it.
628	0	a	I got it for 99 cents. It's bad. Just.... bad. 
4291	1	a	ONION: Dino Hoes has no onions  10/10 broke it
4293	1	a	Quite possibly the best wave-based dinosaur FPS's ever.
4295	1	a	It's like Halo, but with dinosaurs
4297	1	a	Its a buggy, awful mess with little polish, but a lot of heart put in to it. But its amazing. At first you laugh at the badness of it, but it becomes irrelivant as you find yourself having fun at killing large amounts of dino's in this crazy chaotic FPS.  Its an awful fun game, I recommend you get the 4pack and play it with friends for some stupid fun.
4299	1	a	This Is Freaking Awsome 
4301	1	a	I'm not too sure why this game has such a low meta score. I only played this for 17 minutes and that was during the free weekend, to make a let's play, and during that time, I had a lot of fun. Sure, the shooting isn't the best but the concept and the graphics are awesome!  I only played this on easy so I don't know if the dinosaurs would be harder on the harder levels or if you just have less ammo etc... but shooting dinosaurs is quite good fun!  This is one of them times where you shouldn't actually listen to metacritic and just go ahead and buy the game.  I have to admit though, this game is not worth Â£11.99, maybe just Â£5 but I would recomend it to anyone for just 99p!   This is a really good game overall and I liked it a lot!   You can see a full let's play of it here:  www.youtube.com/tomthecubegaming  (the let's play will be going up later today)
630	0	a	they have made a lot of changes and whatnot over the years but i still think it was much better back when it was Dino Beatdown with just three giant conquest maps. i wish it was still like that.
4303	1	a	you can taunt on people that you lick â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ !
4305	1	a	God damn autistic as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ 11/10
4307	1	a	Incredibly fun game to play with friends!  A survival game that pits the future against the past.  I highly recommend all players pick up a copy of this game, especially for it's unbeatable price!
4309	1	a	Best game I ever played.
4311	1	a	Holy cow. This game is awesome! And for 0.99c it doesn't get any better! I love this game. The graphics is.. Im speechless.. THEY ARE AMAZING. Even on lowest !! Really liked the first couple of rounds I played and will be playing more.
4313	1	a	This game was a ton of fun despite the metascore. XD
4315	1	a	Killed a T-rex with a pistol before I revived my fallen caped crusader who shot me with a med-gun as I jet-packed over the next stegosaurus. I now wear the T-rex's head on my head. No â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
633	0	a	This game has brought me enjoyment it is true; from its derpy triceratops to its 'laser swords' that definitely were TOTALLY original. This game has brought me joy, not from its gameplay but by the pure BS that the developers have pulled to make this game into the guano it deserves to be.   The graphics look like they should run on a potato, maybe 2 potatoes if they are small. The guns are ripped from other games and it is frustrating to see that there was a complete lack in creativity during the development of this game.   I bought the game on a whim because all I would be losing was a dollar. Is this game worth what I paid for it? Not entirely based on the fact that the servers always dropped connection or that it took several minutes to boot properly. After playing this game for the amount I did, I am not sure if it can ever 'run' properly. I laughed at the shear derpiness of the dinosaurs rather than enjoying the game itself and that is worrisome for me because now it just sits in my library. This game just taunts me now and I wonder what else I could have done with that dollar.
4317	1	a	Started off as really biggy and unplayable but has been pbeen getting better and better and is now qite fun to playh, Highly recommended.
4319	1	a	 ORION: Prelude   ORION: Dino Beatdown   ORION: Dino Horde  ORION: Dino DLC is a shining light in an otherwise dark and gloomy sea of poorly thought out RPGs, Shooters, and MMOs. This game is completely flawless in every way, a perfect example of a 10/10 rating, a number given too often to sub-par titles such as Mass Effect and Call Of Duty. ORION: Dino Beatdown is an instant classic, and surely stands up to the best as an action adventure indie casual racing game. For only  $8.99  $14.99 (Plus the price of any of the fabulous DLC you can purchase! I recommend the Gangnam Style dance pack myself!), you can't afford not to add this amazing title to your collection. Don't forget to donate to the Kickstarter for the upcoming ORION Project too! Support indie devs!
4321	1	a	This game is awesome fun with friends, would recommend this game to anyone.
634	0	a	They say the Meta score is wrong I think their right I agree with them the metascore is wrong.  It should be lower
635	0	a	Honestly the concept of being able to play in various game modes along side your friends in this Jurassic slaughter house is a great idea. Personaly tho I found the controlls for the Dino's hard to manage and clunky. If you can get around some of the frusterating controll draw backs you could probably get a couple hours of fun out of it if you play with a buddy. ORION: Dino Horde shall remain a game full of quaint notions and maverick game modes.
636	0	a	Better than the meta-score, but still not worth playing.
637	0	a	its 99p for a reason. Don't expect a good result.
638	0	a	This game is not worth it. Honestly, it will not capture your attention for long. ORION: Dino Horde is just another FPS that was quickly slapped together.
639	0	a	Don't spend a penny on this game, the servers are terrible, the graphics leave much to be desired, the attack animations are non-existent. Did they even try? It's good for a short while, but never leads up to your hopes. Please spend your money elsewhere.
640	0	a	Thieves plain and simple.
641	0	a	PATCH THE SERVER GLITCHES
4323	1	a	great game hope for new updates
4325	1	a	10/10 it's ok
4327	1	a	Dinosaurs are awesome, so the laws of physics literally state that this game is awesome too.  Play it.
4329	1	a	THIS GAME IS BETTER THAN AIDS! I REALLY MEAN IT. IT IS AMAZING AND I LIKE DINOSAURS. ONCE A BIG BIRD THING GRABBED ME AND IT CHUCKED ME OFF A ROCK AND I GOT SCARED. BUT IT WAS FUN AND I LIKED IT. THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVOURITED GAMES OF 2015. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING.
4331	1	a	36/100. The score you see upon entering this page, and trust me, this is NOT for this state of the game, from what I can understand,this game got that score when it was released in an early version that had many problems with graphics, gameplay, etc,from which it gained poor reviews,and caused people to hate the game, leaving it with that score. I choose to ignore that score, and buy it in the sale. Thank god I did.  I can say from my experience, this is, THE BEST, multiplayer dino game to play with friends, other games such as Primal Carnage and Dino D-Day are fun, but I haven't had quite as many laughs and fun from those games than this one.  Me and my friend agree that this has the most variety of any dinosaur game out there, (which I will list in the good and bad points of this game).   Now, by no means is this a '10/10 OMG BEST GAME EVARS' game, this game certainly has it's faults, for me it's the store, which involves *gasp* micro-transactions to buy hats and taunts[where does that sound familiar?], but again, buying in-game items is not necessary to win in game,*cough*EA*cough*.  Good Points:  Well optimized -At least for me. This game runs at a great FPS on my PC, and my computer isn't the best in the world by any means, ;-;  Variety - Oh god, where do I start? Ride vehicles,Be a dinosaur,Be a human,choose from a large choice of weapons, so many gamemodes to choose from, (adding more apparently)  CO-OP/Online Multiplayer - The spiral community seems to be one of the nicer end of the web game communities, playing online with friends/random peeps is always fun, there is always so much going on.  Sound- The dialogue in this game (while little), is just a JOY to listen to, the 3 human classes all have something funny to say at the best of times,the music can sometimes be good, and the announcer, oh , the announcer, I won't dare spoil what he says when you get a 10+ kill streak, but it had me laughing for at least 30 seconds.  Updates- I have never see any other developer update the game in so many good ways in such a short period of time, whether it being open worlds, new weapons, more detail in-game. As soon as I see this game update, I play it, just to see what they've added, and usually stay in for ages as I get hooked into it.  Bad Points:  Single Player- Sadly, this is what kinda lets it down for me, it is advertised as a 'Single-player' game, and for me, it really isn't all that special, as it's basically the same mode as in co-op, just, on your own, *Insert forever alone face here*, also, here are many modes you CANNOT play alone.  Sound(again)- However, some of the sound kinda lets it down, the dino sounds are quite poor, and often lacking from some, the music is OK but some sounds really need to be fixed, (If you're wearing headphones, like I was, be ready for a T-Rex roar, it will break your headphones)   Well, this is my first in-depth review, and for a good reason; this game doesn't deserve that 36/100 stamped on this page, if your interested in dinosaurs, good online play, or just a variety of things to do in a game, here's my advice to you;  1. Wait for this game to go for a F2P weekend/watch some UPDATED gameplay videos. 2. Buy it in a sale (Last time it was 99p!)   Final words; I paid 99p in a sale for this, I would gladly pay the Â£11.99 for it, if the updates continued as good as this, and just for the sheer joy factor :)  Thanks for reading! (Or, going into the comments just to rage about me talking about the rating of this game)
4333	1	a	in this game, I used a jetpack to fly up to a t-rex's head, and hit it in the face with a lightsaber. and its usually 99 cents! Does anything else need to be said?
4335	1	a	its got dino hordes i guess 10/10 delivers what it promises  just make sure to hold C to roll out of trex chomps  ( This game used to be called Dino Horde )
644	0	a	I dont know one person who auctually likes this game, most my friends play it and they say its only ok
4337	1	a	Drove car into an alligator and blew up. 10/10
4339	1	a	I was backed up next to a cliff, surrounded by dinosours, with no escape. Out of the corner of my HUD I see a ally driving over to my rescue in a jeep/car. He clambers out of the vehicle to help me with the growing horde of dinosours. Seeing the oppurtunity I jumped into the jeep and drove off without him. Quickly after leaving the player that had selflessly come to my rescue I see a death-message pop up saying he had died. 11/10; Would abandon an ally again.

647	0	a	mehh...you get what you pay for for.
4343	1	a	ORION: Prelude is a game that had such a low price that I had no idea if it was actually going to be a quality product. Fortunate for me, this is a unique and fun shooter game, and all the problems I had did not subtract the overall fun I had with the game.  ORION: Prelude is a game in which you shoot dinosaurs (or robo-santa in the Christmas map), but it is not a normal game with team deathmatch or anything. The player (and any friends or internet people, as this game has the multiplayer option) faces 10 waves of dinosaurs while buying weapons and upgrades. However, there are many different gameplay modes, many which I still need to experience.  The game has good controls, if with a bit of a delay and a bit sluggish, but the sluggish controls can usually be fixed by editing the mouse sensitivity. The graphics are okay, and the dinosaurs looks rather stupid and not very well animated, to be honest (the bigger bosses in particular). However, they get the job of being a hitbox done pretty well.  The sound and music is decent enough. Nothing spectacular, but worth listening to if you want to. However, where this game pulls through is the actual gameplay itself. It is incredibly satisfying to shoot dinosaurs and buy weapons, with loads of different weapons to try. The player can have different lives and be revived or, in a similar way to COD Zombies, take down one dinosaur to be revived with all weapons. Anyway, this game is designed for multiplayer, but the genius fact about the game is that there are bots in both modes. Therefore, when playing single player, bots will help you take down dinosaurs, and they actually are well programed and an actual help, which is a problem in a lot of games with bots on your team. Also, there is loads of content (different gamemodes and quite a few different maps), as well as achievements for those who like to collect those sorts of things.   In total, this game entertaining buy and is certainly worth buying and revisisting from time to time. Playing it with friends is a good idea, but not required to enjoy the game, as there is single player and random online lobbies. Anyway, there are some hinderances, such as the sound, the graphics, and glitches (I didn't mention any yet, but I have heard of some glitches from others and have experienced a glitch myself in which the upper half of the screen has a purple tint. The purple tint is easily fixed by using ctr + alt + delete and to go to your desktop and then just entering the game again with no restart or anything). However, these can all be ignored and leave a fun game that can certainly be fun for a good while and kill time. Somewhere around 7 or 8 out of 10.
4345	1	a	What isn't there to say about this gem of a game?  The developers took a common staple multiplayer game, L4D2, and challenged the concepts that make that game great. 'Why are their zombies? The story just doesn't make sense!' They exclaimed, and went to work fixing all they could.  The end result? An amazing amalgamation of Amazing graphics backed by an abnormally high framerate, incredible gamemodes and features that make it a complete blast to play, and amazingly polished combat. Don't even get me started on the incredible menu design and feedback.  If you're going to buy lunch, do yourself a favour and buy ORION: Dino Horde instead, and even better, buy some for your friends also.  A solid 11/5 from me, if only I could go higher.
4347	1	a	Quick review: This is 'Getting Attacked by Endless Impossible to Hit Flying Enemies: The Game'  Seriously. I can still hear the constant, endless, horrible screeching of the most annoying flying enemy I have ever encountered in a game. It's Cliff Racers from Morrowind all over again. I actually have fun playing this game despite the bugs, poor balancing, and lack luster presentation. It has charm, like B grade sci-fi. But those flying what-evers kill this game for me. The guns are so hilariously innaccurate that there is no way you can reliably hit them, forcing you to listen to their screeching while they peck away at your armor, bit by bit, harassing you to the point of insanity. Yes, my entire problem with the game is not the enumerable other issues that so many point out, but simply the fact that I spend the entire match beset on all sides by what amount to Cliff Racers. No one liked Cliff Racers. Not even the devs that made them.  If you like Cliff Racers, this game is for you. If you don't, then get the game when it's a dollar. Still worth playing with friends.
4349	1	a	This game has really mixed reviews everywhere, some people will complain because of bugs, and problems and because in their words the game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, but heres the thing, its 99 cents, its the price of a cheap burger from burger king or something. You dont expect a whole lot for that 99 cents, that being said this game has a lot to it. It has been around for a while as Dino Horde, but they finally got out the Prelude update and it was a free update and now its 99 cents. If you dont wanna play online there are bots now so you can play by yourself. This game has character loadouts so you can change them around, and it has tons of modes. You have human modes like survival and conquest which are fun and now you have deathmatches and stuff like that to play as humans. Then there are modes that let you play as dinos, and guess what its all for 99 cents. This game has been supported for years with free content, updates and support throughout most games dont get that kind of support. Also they have workshop coming to so there is another reason. Plus how many games can you get where you kill dinos? This game is well worth the price, dont listen to all the people â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing because really its only 99 cents, its not like its expensive, also it has cards too I believe so there's also that. Its fun, its cheap its the best cheap co op game you can get and sink tons of hours into it.
4351	1	a	This game is more of a 'so bad it's good' kinda deal. For literally 99 cents, you really shouldn't be expecting something along the lines of an actual good game. But for some reason, despite me not playing it much (only 4 hours clocked at the time of writing this), I've had some actual fun with it. There's some bugs and graphical problems. Not to mention that on the topic of graphics, the graphics are just mediocre. The variety of weapons is pretty standard along with the option to pick up insane Adrenaline weapons.   Essentially this game can be described as something similar to Killing Floor on a budget. The concept of surviving incoming waves of enemies is standard, but ORION takes some liberties in the form of objectives that need securing, the occasional mini boss dinosaur in the form of a triceretops/stegosaurs/T-Rex. There's also the option to select perks while in game to boost your chances of survival.  In all honesty the gameplay is pretty much the same as a lot of FPS's. You get a selection of three classes which all serve basic, generic roles. Assault are front line gunners and carry larger weapons. The medic is just that, a battle medic with the ability to heal teammates. Finally there's the Recon, the obligatory stealth class. The only slightly unique thing about the classes is that the Assault gets a jetpack that only serves limited use.  All in all if you're looking for a cheap game that you can fart around with your friends in, this is a good game to pick up. Just don't expect anything grand and don't expect to play this game much except for the off night you and your pals are bored out of your skulls.
4353	1	a	Alot of fun for an odler game. Fun with friends and the ever so not safe for work chat and in game voip. Its a great 11 round shooter that has a similar set up and play style to borderlands but its a survival game with vehicles youd see in Halo or mechwarrior. If you ever played Sanctum/orcs must die etc youll like the game. It reminds me of alot different game mechanics from other games. Online is solid, lots of bots to help you :3   My only issue that is the interface to buying weapon and augments are not the same and some what complicated/confusing, augments you double click and weapons you have to click the green purchase.
4355	1	a	This game is good for its price but i would like to see offline modes survival etc. 
648	0	a	It isn't amazing but it isn't awful either. The game is a decent amount of fun, but Trek Industries is a trashy and shady company. I'm usually all for supporting indie devs, but Trek takes things to a whole new level. They're manipulative and money hungry. They lie, fire employees without paying them for their work, and they steal assets from other games as well. I cannot recommend buying this or any other games they may be involved with.
649	0	a	Feeling like i was scammed i bought the game when it costed money but now it is free devs can you return my money because this is now f2p  To anyone who bought this i feel your pain
650	0	a	I was not aware this game had stolen assets before purchasing. For 50 cents, it's a great game to mindlessly kill some time on, but after hearing about the theft, I regret supporting this developer with my purchase.  
4357	1	a	It's less than Â£1/copy, with 4 copies for Â£2.... why wouldn't you buy it, even if it just sits in your libary as part of your collection.  The game doesn't run all too great, and feels very cheap/poor quality -hence the price- but if you want a game to play for just a few hours with some friends and have a laugh, this isn't a bad option.  It's a shame this game is the way it is and feels so cheap, I think it offers some really great ideas - jetpacking around fighting dinosours with a lightsabre style weapon, like what?!  People are complaining a lot about the company and their dodgey endeavors, I don't know too much about it, and frankly I don't really care to look it up. The game is so cheap, and has been for a while, why care about any of that lol.
653	0	a	It was a free weekend, and I wanted to see if it was as bad as people were saying. Words cannot describe how abysmal this game is. Supposedly the devs went through the game and fixed all the bugs.   Supposedly.  Honestly don't waste your time, and certainly don't waste your money.
654	0	a	I played this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game.Bad graphic
655	0	a	Whats orion mean?!
4359	1	a	I didn't expect it to be so much fun...but it is! It's like Jurassic Park 5: Shooty-shooty fun-times with Dr. Alan Grant
657	0	a	This has got to be one of the most boring and most disjointed games I have never had the pleasure to play.  This game has recently had a name change, for the second time, because for some reason these developers change the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing name of their game whenever they release a 'big update'. This game was and still is a buggy pile of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ since launch and despite these 'big updates' the bugs remain. First time they changed the name, they didn't fix anything... They just added a microtransaction store. Because they changed the name it caused a lot of bugs with Steam and it brought the game back on the front page of the Steam store and it did NOT deserve it. And now they did the same â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ but it didn't seem to break the Steam Store like last time; No, all this update added was some hats, controller support (which by the way made it so that it only shows the Xbox controller buttons in the main menu, well done guys), and some game modes. I didn't even bother to play any of the other game modes after seeing how godawful their MAIN gamemode is.  So what actually is Orion Dino Beatdown/Horde/Prelude you ask? Well, it's a horde mode game involving dinosaurs. A fairly simple concept: there are waves, there are enemies, you kill enemies, progress through the waves and so it goes on. But the presentation and gameplay are so horrible that it doesn't work right (which is probably why they added the other game modes to make up for the garbage that they have created).  Presentation: This game looks hideous, even for an Unreal Engine 3 game, and it runs terribly dispite how bad it looks. I had to lower all the settings down to get a decent framerate and the game definitely does not look good enough to justify it. And it appears that they added a disgusting cell shaded look that just seems completely out of place recently, weird black outlines on some places. Besides graphics, the animations are atrocious and the modeling on the guns look pathetic, the sound design is just bad, many of the guns feel weak as a result of having poor animations and sound quality. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing magnums should not sound like BB guns. The dinosaurs look alright, decent enough modeling and sound design... Until they attack you with their adorable little nibbling animations, making them look completely unthreatening. Yeah, this game doesn't look good at all.  But ok, graphics aren't important, gameplay is what matters in a game, right? Of course, only one problem, THIS GAME IS HORRIBLE! The gameplay is so bland and generic, it has nothing original about it, it only takes game mechanics from other games, and the mechanics that it takes it doesn't do as well as where they were originally taken from. I mentioned before how the guns feel weak, and they really do. Nothing has any of the OOMPH you would otherwise see in a competent FPS. This game's gunplay is almost as bad as Borderlands', and the guns themselves are completely uninteresting. There's very little variety in the enemies and it gets boring to fight the same dinosaurs REALLY FAST. So the gameplay is also a failure here.  So it looks bad, sounds bad and plays bad. Is there any point in getting this game? Absolutely not. It's not even so bad that it's funny, it's just awful, it isn't even worth the $1. If you want to play a good horde mode game, I highly suggest Killing Floor, it does everything right where Orion does wrong. I decided to write this review now because it seems like the developers are trying to squeeze out every little bit that they can from this game and it's just depressing to see. It feels like they really tried their best here but this just doesn't work. Guys, this game is not good, you have to move on, from here you have two choices: You either realise that game development isn't your thing, or you improve upon what you did here and take note of your mistakes. Either way, let go of this game and focus on stuff you really want to do, rather than just change the game's name multiple times and milk the ever living â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out of it.
4361	1	a	OREOS: Dino Horse is the spiritual successor to the universally acclaimed smash hit Cabela's Outdoor Adventures, building upon everything that made the fan favorite so spectacular (YOU JUST USE CARS TO WIN, AS LONG AS YOU ARE SEATED IN A VEHICLE THE ONLY HORIZON FOR YOU IS ONE OF GOLDEN RADIANCE) and revving it up to the next level! Squeezed from fresh virgins harvested at Spiral Games Studios very own Hell Engine, ARYANS: Dino Harp finally delivers what all satanists have been craving for the past 2 decades: For someone to take good ol' fashioned class based FPS gameplay, dumb it straight the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ down, shoehorn in pointless costumes and hats, and throw in all the assets from Natural Selection but instead of aliens have ZANY â™¥â™¥â™¥ SPACE DINOSAURS so that it can all be blended up, mixed into a fine non-alcoholic beverage, and poured all over the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing ground because holy hell this game is complete dogshit why in God's name would anyone wanna drink it. But don't soften up yet, cause this game's still got enough hilariously stupid shenenigans to keep your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ rock solid; It's got all the core essentials to being cool, including but not limited to 1) Dramatic Slo-Mo Kill Cams so you can soak in you/your friends every death, 2) Motherâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in jetbikes, 3) Motherâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in JETPACKS, 4) Poorly Optimized Motion Blur (a strong sign of being truly next-gen), and 5) Rag Doll Physics out the â™¥â™¥â™¥. If you aren't soaked through to the seat by now than you gotta have a crotch colder than the Artic Circle, in which case this is the kind of game that might just actually kill you. TL;DR it's ugly and stupid and cheap but if you're looking for a silly co-op shootbanger than you came to the right place
658	0	a	Oh boy, this game.  The game isn't horrible, at least not as horrible as metacritic says it is. But it still isn't good. Everyone else has explained what the game is like so I'll just do a pros and cons list.  Pros -  -It's 99 cents. -Can be fun with friends. -Graphics are mostly nice. They aren't bad, but the player models are kind of weird looking.  Cons - -Animations are horrible -Dinosaurs have skin made of steel. -Boring when played alone -Definitely not worth 15 dollars.  Overall, 6/10 would not recommend. May want to get it now since it's a dollar, but for 15 dollars, you'd expect more.
4363	1	a	Got this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ when it was free and went hard as a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Forgot to buy it when it was 99 cents and got â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ for it but I have it now and I gotta say, it's complete â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Don't get me wrong, it's fun as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ but the spinosaurus is a mean â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. He'll eat you for breakfast and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you out right after. He eats those little â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing raptors like a fat kid eats cheetos he found under his man-boob flabs. His health shoots up faster than a meth addict in a truck stop bathroom. The stego is an OG and is a pretty cool guy. The â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing trike likes to hang out with the stego and act like he knows what's up but he's really just a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥ nigguh. The damn crocidile thing is just â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and can't do â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ other than be in the way if you're playing as a dino. Now you may think I'm just â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing, but your opinion doesn't really matter you loser. All-in-all I'd give it a solid 8.5/10. Really good price for a really good game.
659	0	a	Regret: The game  what seems like an awesome concept becomes boring after 10 minutes. Avoid like the plague.
4365	1	a	its not necessarily a good game by any means, but oh my god is it a good time. Its not one of those games thats so bad it's fun it just has a bit of charm to it. I do recommend this especially for only $0.99 
660	0	a	Turn away. Now.
4367	1	a	The MetaScore for this game does not do it justice. - If you only read the first line of reviews, then this one speaks volumes.  Essentially a wave-based first person shooter (in the same mold as Tripwire's Killing Floor and Valve's Left 4 Dead), this game has a man vs dinosaurs theme set in mulitple locations.  Graphics are smooth and surprisingly good. The developers have thrown a lot of work into making this game not only playable, but challenging and enjoyable as well - and it shows. Not the most immersive game out there, but that fades into insignificance when the bullets start flying.  A worthy addition to any game library - especially when on sale.
663	0	a	For the love of god avoid this game in its entirety. It's god some decent ideas but the execution is the absolute worst of perhaps any game ever made. Avoid. Avoid. Avoid.
4369	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Metacritic and their BS score they gave to the game, it has dinosaurs and thus is awesome as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. The game sure has its flaws but for an indie game such is expected, nevertheles a few cons don't rule out the awesomeness like badass close combat action you get to have with super sexy motherâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing reptiles. 6/5, would bang (the dinosaurs I mean).  Okay so Prelude is out and the game is even more awesome than before. They fixed almost all of the FPS drops which is really cool and the only problem I now have (randomly exploding sounds) is because of my sound card so nothing to complain about anymore. Totally worth the money, you definitely should support the makers so we would have more games like this. If you like dinosaurs, you will love the game. It sure can be kinda confusing at the beginning but once you get a hang of it, it is the most fun you have had in a long time, especially when playing with friends.  Tl;dr: You haven't even lived if you don't own the game already.
666	0	a	Crashed starting a solo game. Turned all the details and everything down to minimum, still crashed.
4371	1	a	Yeah, I have been playing games for years and years, and back in the day, games were fun, games were simple, and most of all games were FUN, specially with friends,this game while simple in its premise, has a lot of heart is fast paced, and is loads of fun, sure the meta critic is low, but that was its previous incarnation, not this one, this is a great article on the game check it out:   http://www.dsogaming.com/editorial/orion-dino-horde-controversy-let-the-battle-begin/   Besides what have you got to loose for a few dollars? this game gives you more bang for your buck than some AAA titles that I own, and even tho It might not be the most polished or graphically amazing game out there, it delivers, and brings home the pizza!  so dont hesitate, you will have fun, you will be surprised at the sheer madness of running around from killer dinos, and then jumping in a jetbike making a last second save, the gameplay has lots of emergent moments of pure madness, and in that you can see that the folks that made it has a vision, and above all know how to make a fun game.  Play it, you will be surprised! oh and it has a 5 star community you cant go wrong!

674	0	a	Don't trust the minimum system specs listed. My system meets all of them and even with all settings dropped to lowest, I only get around 3 FPS, making the game completely unplayable. This comes despite marginal polygon counts and no exceptionally heavy eye candy that I could see. There is little to no optimization of code, making what should be an easy to run game utterly unusable for anything but fast computers, and the threading priorities within the client are so poorly done that I even encountered audio stuttering in the menus before the game. Audio stuttering on SFX is one thing, but this was BGM stuttering, completely ruining immersion. Needs heavy work before I'd call it a success of any sort.
675	0	a	I only have 17 minutes played, but the 17 minutes were dull enough to make my eyes glaze over. The gameplay is boring and repetitive, the voice acting is awful, the combat is easy enough that a person with no eyes could beat the enemies, and the maps are overly large for no reason at all. I don't think there is even an end goal in this game.
4375	1	a	But â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ was .99 cents.
678	0	a	its bad
679	0	a	ORION: Dino Horde is a game that brings forth many interesting gameplay mechanics but so far seems to falls short in its execution. The developers definitely have many ambitious goals set for Dino Horde but seem to lack the skill and/or funding to implement them properly. The animation quality is fairly poor and the game is still extremely buggy with texture detail fading in and out constantly, frame rates dropping (even on high end graphics cards) for no apparent reason, in-game audio buging out on occasions and with hitboxes that are just seemingly broken. I would be able to forgive a good many of these short comings if the game was an Early Access title however, seeing as this is a full release and updates have yet to fix these major issues, thatâ€™s sadly not the case. Overall the gameplay just feels clunky and underdeveloped with a lack of attention to detail as well as level design leaving much to be desired. I wanted to like this game but unfortunately, in short, I just canâ€™t see myself recommending it in its current state.   Rawwr!!  4/10  Prelude update - About two days after I posted this review Orion Dino Horde was updated and changed names. I have yet to try Orion since it's update and second name change to Prelude (mainly cause I have no dersire) so I can't say much about the 'improvements', however one thing I do approve of is the new $0.99 price tag. Still... Last time I played Orion it needed a lot of improvment for me to have given it my recommendation so I'd still be warry if you're considering purchasing this title.
4377	1	a	The Best Way to play this game, Is to play with freinds.
4379	1	a	Its just fun, I don't know how else to explain it. Little sweet $5 game.
4381	1	a	This game is amazing, better than CoD and battlefield combined and the perfect blend of action and ridiculousness! I don't see why this doesn't get more publicity 
4383	1	a	Sometimes I want to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ a dinosaur but be careful that you dont get dinosaur STD e.g dino genital herpes, Dino aids and dino gonorrhea and GTD but i love seeing that dinosaur riding my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and me cumming in its â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ but it is fun.
686	0	a	This has got to be just about the worst, overhyped games i've ever played. It's not hard, it's just stupid and boring. I would NEVER recommend this to anybody looking for a great game to play.... Go grab yourself a valve game, or a steam sale game instead of this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t.
687	0	a	Dinosaurs AI is very bad, they only walk in straight lines. Clipping issues with dinosaurs. Graphics could be so much better since this game was release in 2012. The maps are boring, plain open fields of nothingness. The gameplay is clunky and unrealistic. Weapons seem like they don't have any weight and I think bullets travel foward until they hit something. The dinosaur theme itself, not that interesting but I decided to give it a try anyways and wasn't really disapointed cuz i was expecting anything good from the start. Wouldn't even pay 0,01 for it.  (anyone who wants to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about this will be talking to the hand cuz i have better thing to do than listen to lil fan boy kids.)
688	0	a	Dinosaurs. What's not to love, right? Right?... In the case of ORION: Dino Horde, there is a lot not to love. I was excited at the concept of the game, as I love horde-type games (MVM in TF2, Escalation in Transformers, etc.) where you are forced to work as a team to defeat unbeatable odds.   In my first time booting up Orion, I had a bit of trouble finding a server as there were not many to choose from. There are a few dedicated servers, however most are player-run on their own machines. Because of this, the lag was almost unbearable to play a decent match. There was no teamwork to be had, and usually I would blame this on the team I played with, but there wasn't any incentive to work together. I trudged on, hoping it would get better after a couple of waves. I was wrong. Server after server the dinosaurs would warp around the map, and give Michael J Fox a complex because they were so jittery.   The game feels like a Halo copy, with dinosaurs thrown in. After jumping in a jeep and manning the turret, it felt oddly familiar. This only confirmed my suspicion when I saw the tank go by. Yep, same tank, different color.   It isn't absolutely terrible, but when it was on sale for $0.99 I still didn't buy it. You may have better luck.
4385	1	a	STEP ASIDE DINO D DAY FOR A NEW DINO GAME HAS COME FOURTH! FOR ALL OF YOU THAT LIKE A 99CENT GAME WITH UNPOPULATED SERVERS AND â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING DINOS THEN BUY IT FULL PRICE, EAT ME, #DINO4LIFE#ALMOSTASGOODASPEGGLE  #YALLBETRIPPIN
690	0	a	Same game, different name. Would not recommend if you're looking for something different from ORION.
691	0	a	This game just sucks, its the kind of game that a 10 yo would play, if he didnt have any other thing to play with.
4387	1	a	It's a good game. You have the Asault clas there you ee jatpack on. The suport clas, reco class each class has more weapons and contain some wapeons can you buy for each class.Thit is a nice game, Its so cheap for it.  i give it an 8/10.
4389	1	a	It would appear to be a work in progress. For one dollar this game is amazing. Full price though..... I do like that the developers seem intent on adding content without charging the user for it. I like to support the little guy and this is a good game.
4391	1	a	This game much better than the metacritic rating it has recieved, I have only played this on multiplayer co-op but there is some fun to be had running around with your mates killing dinosaurs.
4393	1	a	This game has hot dogs you should buy it
4395	1	a	Oh man, this game.  Let us begin with the very beginning of this game.  It was â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, just utter â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, a friend of mine couldn't even play the game back then because when one of us hosted the other couldn't join, we were frustrated by this and thought the game was horrible. We regretted ever buying this game and shelved it for all eternity. However, I remained faithul and watched the development going on from the shadows and I must say, good job Spiral Game Studios! You have shown people they you are one of the few developers that actually give a rats â™¥â™¥â™¥ about your game and want to make it bigger and better! Gone with the DLC crap, you buy the game you get the updates and DLC for free! Period!  I salute you, with the new updates I have gained faith in you again and the news about the Orion Project gave me new hope, I just installed the game again and will try it out, a full review will follow afterwards and I wish this will be my most favorite game, because the new additions are so many for me it should give me a lot of time to try them out, not a fan of PvP but that is my opinnion. Full review coming after real gameplay.  Also, for all who see the rating of Metacritic, that was when the game first came out under a different name and was utter â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, give it a try, show your support to these awesome â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s, show them that Indie developers need more support then right corporations that care only for the money and not its fans!  Extended Cut; So, I played some more and got into a solo match of Open World, man is that snow coming from the skies? Is that a fricking T-Rex walking around not noticing me? What is going on!  I quickly found out that Open World is Open World, a place covered in and by snow, it was snowing when I spawned but after a few minutes it vanished, so I took my jeep, went to the generator and saw it was a generic survival mode, activate the generator and hold out, pff, easy I thought and so it was, I was bored and got the Cryo Blade (Lightsaber) and oh my gosh this thing is powerful, two hits against a mobs head with the 2x damage boost and you are set to go solo mode. Now, why would I continue playing after I defended the generator and have to go to the outpost? Easy, five huge beasts to slay with my trusty VTOL, now the VTOL is great and all, but if you DON'T kill the flying dinosaurs you are pretty much screwed, they chew away your VTOL's armor and the fact that T-Rex throw rocks at you, start flying boy. So, after I got downed I tried to fight the T-Rex who got his little T-Rex friend AND army with him to fight me, eventually I died and thought; 'Screw this, it was fun.' And to my surprise I could revive by killing an enemy, which was awesome, also could my shields regen after I got hit a few times, which worked only once because I got overwhelmed again. So, after a minute of fighting the T-Rex got me and digested me, woops.  Also, the fact that there are chests and cabinets with money and/or weapons in them is a neat idea, first loot and then see if you can buy a better and bigger gun, a great idea for people who just hop in and need a bit of extra cash to win the battle!  All in all I give it a 9/10, it is a great and awesome game and they did a great job, the snow effect made for some intense fighting because my vision got blurry and frozen as soon as I stepped outside, which made it harder and more challenging, I won't give the 10/10 until I actually play some multiplayer matches with random people and friends and see how it works then, overall a great game if you want to test you luck and survival skill against two T-Rex's and their little buddies, next time I bring my own army of four with me and see how long they can survive against us.
695	0	a	suck.
4397	1	a	I recommend it a lot ! :D Buy it ! NOW ! Cheap and awesome :3  The game gives you the sensation of a simple game, but it's the best 'shooting things' game i've ever played :3  Amazing graphics, but i can't play it on max settings due to my GPU :'c (GT520 2gb)    Keep up with the awesome work :3
4399	1	a	I bought this when it was Orion: Dino Horde. I LOVE this game!! For 0.99$ its is worth it, actually its a rip off to the developers! This game hasa hours of replay ability and it is still being worked on,  so the people claiming the ai sucks, shut your trap, msot people who claim it sucks have little time on it anyway. Its a great game to play with m8s or random people online. It requires stratagy on higher levels and good teamwork. 11/10 In my opinion, anyway its only a dollar and you spend 20$ to buy cod 4 still.
4401	1	a	justawesome i just love blowing trexsbrains out in a airship and alson some multiplayer ffa action
4403	1	a	I recommend it a lot ! :D Buy it ! NOW ! Cheap and awesome :3  The game gives you the sensation of a simple game, but it's the best 'shooting things' game i've ever played :3  Amazing graphics, but i can't play it on max settings due to my GPU :'c (GT520 2gb)    Keep up with the awesome work :3
4405	1	a	I know what you're probably thinking. Someone who has barely any time put into this title wouldn't know anything. But, after shortly playing this game and watching gameplay, I can fully recommend this game. Though the graphics may not be technically 'there', the concept is. If you love to just kick back, relax, and kill, then this is your kind of game. Just ignore the Metacritic rating. In my opinion, it should be at least an 80. There is an amazing weapon selection to choose from along with great objectives and sudden horde bosses. It kind of has a MW3 Survival feel to it which is great. I personally enjoy this type of game and it's just action packed and will keep you on the edge of your chair.
4407	1	a	This game has changed A LOT since release. What was once a shoddy, broken game is now one of the most jam-packed, jaw-dropping experiences I've ever encountered in a game. Not only does it have literally every game mode I could ever want it's only $15.  Do you like Dinosaurs? GET IT. Do you like PLAYING as Dinosaurs? It has 4 (soon to be 10). Do you like tons of guns? Game has 50+. Do you like cooperative gaming with friends? 4 coop modes. Do you like competitive multiplayer? It has like 10 modes!  200+ achievements, 30+ maps, I don't know how, even in it's worst state, this game was so knocked. Seriously check it out at the next f2p event or sale.
4409	1	a	A good game. Entertaining, Beutiful And- DINOSAURS! The maps are well made. The game is extremelly fun, though lacks a large player base. Deserves more than its current meta score for sure.
698	0	a	I tried the game serveral hours since it was free to play this week.  I really wanted this game to be good since i'm always on the lookout for good coop games, but this game isn't it.  Don't get me wrong i definitely had some fun moments when everything was working, some nice games but after a short while i had the feeling that i have seen everything there is to see.  Enough fun for 99 cents, but still buggy, especially the server browser. I couldn't sort the servers by ping because it didn't how any ping for the first 2 hours i tested it. So it was gambling if i would find a server with acceptable ping.  I couldn't join any game if i tried joining a password protected game until i completely restarted the game.  There were some crashes, sending me directly back to the desktop, really annoing if we had a survival nearly finished and no idea how to find the server that i was playing on.  In game it felt a little odd sometimes, the weapon handling seemed a little off and the physique of the dinos made for some hilarious sights from time to time. Also the penalty for dieing in the survival mode seems a little harsh. If you die you not only loos all your items, they can be picked up where you died, you loose all your perks and improvements. This penalises dieing in medium or higher difficulties so hard that you might not be able to win the later waves after getting eaten in one round. The only way you can influence the fight after a late death is driving vehicles. I know avoiding death is possible and the meaning of this game mode but somtimes there will be a T-Rex just eating you anyway.  I can imagine this game being fun for a short while, if you have friends to play it with even if it crashes from time to time. But playing with randoms in the matchmaking system and then loosing the connection/game crashing mid game can be really dissapointing.  Well if i hadn't had those crashes and a really hard time with the server browser i would have recommended this game. Even if it feels a little off from time to time you can still have some nice coop fun with it. Well they advertised in the trailer that they improved everything and made this a great game, after watching Totalbiscuits review of the first relaunch i can see that they actually improved the interface and animations a lot but the new advertising seems to promise too much.     
4411	1	a	A Really nice game that you can play alone or with friends
4413	1	a	Epic 11* out of 10 i played free week and now i am going to buy it recomend for sure 'It implants Halo, Primal Carnage, Zombies and other games in to one whole dino action packed epic game for only Â£11.99!'
701	0	a	This game is just... really bad. Not polished, poor shooting mechanics, poor survival wave mechanics (we never really knew why things were spawning in between waves), and a mess of other problems. In dino survival, when a player spawns they have to run for about twenty seconds to a point where they can buy a gun. Why is it designed this way? The player spawns next to the ability upgrade teriminals, why aren't the gun terminals next to that?  The animations are so janky. The most common example is when a player is 'downed'. The player gets on their hands and knees and sort of hip fires their pistol at dinosaurs, but stands up on both knees to reload, dropping back down to their toddler crawl to fire some more. Aerial enemies move in little 'increments' when on flight paths in this sort of jerky manner.  Why does my health not regen when I'm in a vehicle? Why does the AI sometimes get hung up on players on rocks, and other times, they just vault right up? Why isn't there a prompt for raising an ally from the ground?  It all just seems really basic and unpolished. I'm not really enamored with dinosaurs so I have to go by gameplay merits alone, and there just aren't any. A lot of other games do similar ideas better in a more cohesive manner. The scary part is I've never played this game when it was 'Dino Beatdown' or whatever, and it's apparently improved a ton since then.  Skip this one. Play one of the other various games in this genre instead.
4415	1	a	Best transformation of a game I've ever seen. It was, honestly, very buggy and broken when it was first released. Since then there was a massive overhaul and more (content) updates than any AAA game ever had. The devs didn't charge any money for any new content they released while the in-game content increased by extreme amounts. It is a really enjoyable and good game now and will get another big update (for free of course).  http://spiralgamestudios.com/post/77018495383/a-prelude-within-coming-2014  It's definitely worth the money and because of the current sale you can even get it for only 1â‚¬
703	0	a	This is not done well. The animations suck, the dinosaur movements are bad, and the guns don't kick enough. There is no tutorial, so you're thrown in with no idea how to play. I like the concept of a survival game based on dinosaurs, but this is not what I want. Besides, fighting dinosaurs as a Halo reject isn't cool. Couldn't we get something like Jurassic Park stlye characters?
4417	1	a	10x better then 'Call of Duty' :P
704	0	a	Wow this is bad. I didn't plan on even testing this out until I read some reviews and decided to try it for the weekend trial. Wow what a mistake. I played a whole 30 minutes of this and knew this was garbage. This game has numerous basic gameplay issues. Just to start off, you can't properly remap your keys and the keys displayed in the control settings don't correctly state what key something is currently bound to... Shooting a gun has some sort of a lag from when you actually click and the gun shoots to when you see your weapons recoil/flash... Everything is scaled horribly, it's like they had no regard for what things should look like. You'll have dinosaurs ranging from mouse size to giant size, vehicles, buildings and consoles all look like they took a whole 5 minutes slapping something together... I honestly knew what I was getting into when I looked at this game and other reviewers made me think otherwise. I am honestly more dissapointed at the Steam community for all the 'recommendeds' for this pile of dinosaur crap. Don't waste your time on this, even for a $1 there are much more polished games out there.   Metacritic got this one right. Heed my warning, stay away.
4419	1	a	Awesome Game, for the price you pay it is absolutely amazing
705	0	a	this game is a waste of time dont even bother to be honest there are better free to plays
4421	1	a	Very Fun game for that price. MUST BUY++++!!!!
4423	1	a	its one of the best games, some may gripe about the price drop, but its so fun to run around lopping off raptors heads in a single sword swing  really lazy, didnt read: its better than most games that take many many years and many MANY millions of dollars to make
707	0	a	This game is great......for a good laugh. Though the laugh is not really worth $1.
4425	1	a	I haven't had this much fun eating someone as a giant monster, since the original Natural Selection's Onos.
4427	1	a	YES, What a friggin awesome game! The most fun multiplayer game i've played in a while! 10/10
709	0	a	The excitement of this game is about on par with Minesweeper.
710	0	a	Played this game in a FREE weekend EVENT (THAT'S WHY my GAMEPLAY TIME IS SET to 0 Hours) The sale price is a trap !! Don't buy it unless it is less than 0.49$  The game is one of those that u play for like 2 hours then never coming back to the game again Primal carnage is way better than this game  What king of openworld gameplay that can take only up to 5 players ???????
4429	1	a	Fun to spend time, interesting game liking so far. There should be more players almost no servers
4431	1	a	Ignore the metascore. I believe it has something to do with a previous iteration of the game. This game is great fun with friends. There are plenty of different game modes and most of the bugs seem to be ironed out. The development team are also constantly adding new features and game modes.  If you're looking for some entertaining co-op or versus action with friends then I highly recommend it.
714	0	a	It is rare I'm able to say this, but this is even overpriced at $1..
4433	1	a	So bad it's actually f'ing hilarious, totally worth 99 cent, would rent. 11/10
715	0	a	bring the pizza
716	0	a	I can play horde-based gamemodes for hours upon hours without even getting slightly bored. I've played tons of Black Ops Zombies and Gears of War's Horde Modes back on Xbox 360, and the concept generally kept me entertained and immersed in the game longer than I would have without those Horde Modes.  However, when a Horde Mode isn't all that good in a tripple-A title, there's usually plenty of other content that will keep you busy, like the multiplayer and the co-op campaign and what not; the Horde Mode is simply an addition. Lately developers tend to create more stand-alone Horde games with little to no other content meaning that the value determines how good or how bad the game is. Take Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army for example. It's a great horde experience with lots of fun to be had in the co-op. This is stand-alone horde gone good.  ORION: Dino Horde  is stand-alone horde gone haywire-bad.  The Good: Â· Reasonably large maps with objectives and hordes of dinosaurs. Â· Dinosaurs. Ross approves.  The Bad: (Oh God, where do I start...) Â· Terrible hit reactions from the dinosaurs. You just have to spray and pray that you see some blood squirting from their fugly bodies. Oh, and there are no bullet holes where you hit them, so good luck figuring out IF you've even hit them and which ones you hit and which you didn't. Â· Unorganised and messy, from map layout and design to gameplay. Dinosaurs look like they're moonwalking on an escalator, the maps are unnecessarily large, 'upgrade stations' to buy vehicles, upgrades and weapons are scattered unlogically far from each other and so on. Â· The menu looks okay, but everything else is just so damn aweful: the HUD and chat-window are just large bulky windows that take in unnecessarily huge chunks of your screen. Â· A few 'game modes' that make little to no sense what so ever.  The Ugly: Â· The visuals look just acceptable on screenshot, but ingame it's simply terrible. It feels like a rushed and forgotten product the entire time and it's broken at its very core.  Final Verdict: Save your money (even the 99c for which its being sold lately) and do not waste your time on this mess of a horde-game. Boring, ugly, broken and generally dumb,  ORION: Dino Horde  underdelivers in every sense of the word. You may get a laugh at the terrible overall design of the game when it's on a free weekend and you're drunk as sh*t and high as f*ck munching away a pizza on a overly hot summer evening with some equally bored friends.  1.5/10, and that point and a half is simply for the dinosaurs. Rawr.
717	0	a	Probably the worst game I have ever had the displeasure of playing, seriously not even worth 0.99 cents.
4435	1	a	Orion: dino horde is great for those cold winter days when you need to light a wood stove with your computer. 10/10
724	0	a	When I first contemplated buying this game, I though: It's so cheap. It's like buying a can of coke, surely this will be more enjoyable. I was wrong, this buggy, spasmy game full of rubberbanding is not only more repetetive than a pendulum, but is actually less fun than watching one. The graphics suck, the game lacks animations, the sound is lofi. Even the announcer is laughably terrible.   There you have it. I should have gone with that can of coke.  3/10  Also, can you get refunds on steam?
4437	1	a	Many dinosaurs, weapons and game modes ! To take urgent !
4439	1	a	this game is awesome i cant wait to play it every day 
4441	1	a	You know, this game kind of sucks. BUT. I have had a ton of fun on it- I cannot lie. Haven't played anything but survival, so that's what I'm technically reviewing. Check it out. It's only $0.74 right now.
4443	1	a	For however â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing cheap it is, it's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing hilarious to play with friends. It also looks REALLY good.
4445	1	a	First game, I just jumped in. Found a rifle, 'Ooh, that's cool. I'mma shoot me a raptor!'. I ran around until I saw a raptor. As I was patiently scoping on him, a t-rex came up behind me and chomped my â™¥â™¥â™¥. My girlish scream of terror woke up the whole house and I was sold in an instant.  Get this game, shoot dinosaurs, squeal like a little girl and hopefully don't get eaten.  Pure and simple extinct-animal-murdering fun!
4447	1	a	Will not start up... Dont get it yet, wait till they fix this!
4449	1	a	One time, my girlfriend had this dream that me, her, and all of my friends were riding this huge pterodactyl. We were armed with assault rifles and flame throwers, soaring through the sky. There were many raptors and lions beneath us, which we were mowing down by the ton with our guns.
4451	1	a	If you play games with a group this is a hands down awesome game for the price.  on another note I was able to trade this game for ROCKETSROCKETSROCKETS   Dinos for Rockets   10/10 would trade again  It's like syrim with dinos and guns 10/10 ~ IGN
4453	1	a	i brought this game because it was on offer and it may be cheap but its fun to play with you and your mates you can set up a server or join one so ill give it 9.5/10
4455	1	a	Running through the cannons shooting up a Raptor when all of a sudden a massive T-rex rears its ugly head from around the corner. I can see it staring deep into my eyes, I watch on as this massive beasts picks up a boulder with its jaws and throws it at me, I had no choice but to take it to the Knee like a real man, I was down. I watch on as the beast walks over to me, fear in my eyes, hate in his. He leans down, smells me then stands on my head. R.I.P  10/10 Will play again, &lt;3
4457	1	a	Worth every penny!
4459	1	a	We were mowing down a bunch of little annoying dinosaurs with machine guns then a giant T-rex came out of nowhere with an ear-shattering ROAAAR and ate my friend in one bite.  9/10 would watch my friend die horribly right in front of me again
4461	1	a	By far the best game for 1 EUR I ever played till now. DINOSAURS! You ARE SHOOTING DINOSAURS :D:D:D Add a Level and Loot-System = Perfect.
4463	1	a	I was watching the steam page and I waited for this amazing game to come on sale. It was a dollar so i had a choice watch a porn video on Barzzzars for one dollar or get this amazing game, i made the best choice of my sad and uneventful life, i got this game! I was thinking to my self i may have down's but i got a smashing deal! Opening this game to the menu was amaizing the meu was so well made it was almost as good as the ET game from the 1900's hell this menu was so good i unzipped my pants and started to beat my dino to it. after 2 hours of trying to get in a game with my gay lovers we were in, the graphics were amazing they looked like someone â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed on a wall and added in color, then i noticed the best part of this game, the dino's looked and moved like they were mentally â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and it made me feel accepted in this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ covered world. This game also ran amazing it ran better than bf4 and had much graphics i was getting 2 fps on low! As playing as a dino i realized wtf am i doing, as i write this i pounder killing myself because i spent 1 dollar on this game when i could have been watching cp, this game should get an 11/5 game of the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing century. Thanks Sprial Games for putting oon alt-jay and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing me till my â™¥â™¥â™¥ is no exitxtant.
4465	1	a	ive played 7 minutes of this game, most broken thing on steam. 11/10
4467	1	a	Bad. Play it and see how bad it is. Bad.
4469	1	a	This game is tons of fun. 99 cents right now!!!
4471	1	a	Dino Horde. I really think this game is great. Fast paced, balanced achivement/ credit earning (changes based on difficulty setting) Really helps to play as a team, and feel free to guide new players in to helping the team's overall progress.  I can't wait to see what the future holds for this game. Very replayable in the current release.  I would value this game around 15 - 20 USD all day long.   I am having trouble browsing/finding game matches/ servers. Usually about 10-15 come up, but I have trouble connecting to most of them. Often time I find myself in a Lobby, and It appears the host is AFK. Would also love to see projectile/paths added. Other than that is very fun. Give it a try!!
4473	1	a	Get this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game, you're â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ if you pass it up. I'm not â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing kidding get it.
4475	1	a	I 1v1'd a T-Rex with a laser-cannon rifle
4477	1	a	As a jurrasic park survivor, it's really touching to get the oppurtunity to get back at those pesky dinos for almost klling me and my family. For any one like me who had to go through that tragic events of jurrasic park it is a must have.
4479	1	a	This game is fun!It has ok graphics not the best but who care's.  Ok let me get to the point,I i was not to sure if i should buy the game but with all the helpful comments I bought it! It won't lag,trust me unless you are on a server with high ping.So I say buy the game you won't be sad if you do and please as soon as you go in-game don't say it sucks and you have wasted your money because you havent!Enjoy the game i know i have and just because i have only played 1.6 hours of it is because i just bought it so trust me for a game this cheap there is nothing to lose!You can make your own servers to play with your friends so have fun.
4481	1	a	Cool game :)
4483	1	a	NIce game for 0,27 $ ! Love to killl Dino with Friend !
4485	1	a	I'd recommend Orion: Dino Horde because the game's a good run for the money especially because it's only like a dollar right now. I've played this game for a few hours and while it gets a bit repetitive and isn't as challenging as I'd expected it to be, the game's fine. In my opinion, this game merges the FPS and dino elements together in a rather fine manner. The netcode isn't as smooth though and the game works best when you're playing with friends that are close-by, not with people across the world because the ping has a huge impact on the gameplay. In conclusion, the game's soild especially since it's available for only a dollar right now.
4487	1	a	 I dont know why people complain about this game, i think it is very enjoyable, fun to play with friends,and the bugs that people seem to complain about(example:cant connect servers/lobbys, vehicles like Vtols crash around, dinosaurs pop to outposts,walk trough walls and other that kind of lies. I havent met any of these so said 'real bugs' in the game. I can connect the game lobbys when i want, the game has crashed only 2 times for me, the dinosaurs are not phasing trough the walls, VTOLS and other vehicles work like they should. The complaining about the sounds aint true, atleast i dont have them, weapons sound just like they should( except the Revolver, but it might have intergrated silencer like WW2 STEN had). Buy this game for real, you can enjoy it, or hate it doesnt make my life different. 
4489	1	a	A game that has everything you've ever needed: Guns, dinosaurs and pizza.
4491	1	a	This is the best 75 cents you will ever spend on a game. Just buy it dammit. Its got terrible graphics terrible physics terrible sounds and the announcer sounds like he was ripped right off the Halo 1 disk and rammed into this game but â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ get enough kills and the announcer hollers bring me a pizza like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ SON thats way better then any game already. Trust me if you want to have a great night with a group of friends playing an actually pretty smooth running comedy of a game buy it. DOnt ask questions. It doesnt get much better then this!
4493	1	a	This game ended slavery and cured aids..... 99/10 IGN
4495	1	a	bretty damn cool  I've always loved dinosaurs and really all the games about dinosaurs are pretty terrible, but this one isn't all too bad it certainly isn't a terrible game, infact it's has the potential to be fantastic, and it's almost there, but I feel like it's a little rushed  great to play with friends, and the dino vs humans mode is a blast with a lot of people  if you've played call of duty zombies, or ghost's extinction, it's very similar to that, and all the same fun
4497	1	a	For 1 dollar, it's damn worth it. Make sure you play on prehistorik settings (kinda like an advanced setting, where you can change more stuff) to get more experience faster.
730	0	a	Okay, simply put...I hate this game. Horrible framerate. Bad controls. Annoying music.  Good thing I only bought this game from someone for 20 trading cards. I wouldn't have paid $15 for it.   I would rather play TF2 or Section 8 instead of this game.
4499	1	a	TL;DR: It's fun, frequently updated and generally enjoyable, especially when played with friends. Wait for it to go on sale though, because the gameplay isn't worth the full price.  I was a bit scared when I picked up this title because of all the bad reviews it was receiving, stating that ORION: Dino Horde was one of the worst games ever made. After I watched a rather hilarious german gameplay video, and the game was on sale for less than 2â‚¬, I finally decided to get this game.  First of all, we've got to set the record straight: ORION: Dino Horde IS NOT the same game as ORION: Dino Beatdown. This should be a no-brainer, but unfortunately many people will still post bad reviews mistaking the previous Dino Beatdown for Dino Horde.  Dino Horde is a mutiplayer action game in which you have to kill off waves of dinosaurs and defend buildings. Between those waves, you're able to upgrade your loadout and perks by spending money which is earned in a TD-like fashion by killing enemies. The general concept is rather simple as is the gameplay. When fighting on foot, the gameplay consists of rather monotonous gunplay. Because the dinosaurs are generally faster than the player, movement and celever positioning don't really play a role in fighting. The only real variation lies in the different enemy types of which some require different strategies to kill. The game also includes vehicles and vehicle combat, which is a pleasant relief. The graphics are rather good considering this game is a low budget production, but the map design can be monotonous from time to time.  The strengths of the game lie within the co-op aspect and the frequently updated content. Since the launch of the title, the developers have included multiple new game modes, some of which deliver a rock-solid co-op experience, as well as other additional content.  This game isn't the next big multiplayer co-op shooter, but it definitely has it's moments and is generally enjoyable, especially when played with friends. The price of 13.99â‚¬ isn't worth the experience though. If this game goes on sale anytime soon, you might want to pick it up for some hours of multiplayer fun.
4501	1	a	this might just be the funnest game i have EVER played. im talking better than cod advanced warfare
4503	1	a	Best dollar I have spent in a long time. The CoOp is a ton of fun.
4505	1	a	For $1 this game is awesome. Gunplay is alright, the auto-shotgun is satisfying, the vehicle combat is fun as hell. My only problem with the game is the vehicle spawning but overall for the price the game is amazing.
4507	1	a	Pew Pewing at Dinosaurs, what more could I ask for!
4509	1	a	got this on sale for a dollar and it's like going to burger king and finding out you're the 1 billionth customer and they shower you in triple whoppers made of REAL MEAT  8/10 wish i had friends for hamburgers and dinos ;_;
4511	1	a	After being disappointed by a few other games claiming to offer a fun time kicking dinosaur butt, I was reluctant to buy this, even at the ridiculous sale price of 1.49. After a friend recommended it, I found to be a great shooter with a nice arcadey feel that not only features great human vs. dino combat, but also fulfilling human deathmatch modes. That being said, I strongly recommend this game to be played with friends. Help get this underrated FPS to where it deserves to be.
4513	1	a	I can't get enough of this game. I don't know what it was before but the Meta score is WAAAAAAAYYYYY off now. This is a great game. I got this game on sale and I love it so much I am buying in game Items just to support the developers!
4515	1	a	I would like to take your time to say...that this game...is only fun with friends and if you do it by yourself...  Well how do you feel when you touch your pee pee while looking at random images?
4517	1	a	Dude... You get to murder dinosaurs with futuristic weapons and jetpacks and tanks... The vehicles all resemble Halo, so do the guns and maps for the most part. BUT WHO CARES YOU GET TO MURDER DINOSAURS!!!!!!!!!!!
4519	1	a	This game is a simulator taken on space where you get attacked by dinos,WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT!People say this game is laggy but thats there computers problem it works perfect for me and I tried it for free and found very enjoyable so i bought premisson for teradacyles to put me on the top of the world and it was worth it,somehow.
4521	1	a	Pretty fun game, kind of a mix between halo and left 4 dead. Can act slightly glitchy at times but no major things.  BUT THE DAMN BIRD DINOS, like jesus, give them a nerf please. Almost impossible to hit and can take you out so quickly.  8/10 so far.
4523	1	a	Decent FPS to hop into with friends for quick 30minute sessions
4525	1	a	This game is highly innovative, interesting, and highly original.  I enjoyed it, and is definately worth cheching out.
4527	1	a	Really fun and enjoyable game with a great price!Of course it was down to 1$ for like a week but still 11$ is worth it!I had some fun playing this game and I will propably play a lot during the summer.Now I have to focus on my exams and I don't play videogames a lot :p
4529	1	a	T-Rex ate me.. EPIC!
4531	1	a	Great game to play with friends. Not too difficult, enjoyable multiplayer and a fun concept. The announcer is one of the best features of the game, would recommend.
4533	1	a	420/10 would buy
731	0	a	it sucs
4535	1	a	crazy fast paced gameplay combined with violent over the top dinos make this a very fun game it just may take a bit to get the setting rights on an older comp like I own
4537	1	a	Awesome game for the price!.
4539	1	a	This game is awesome. the .99 cents you pay is worth it, because you get a fast paced gun game with Dinosaurs. If you want to fork out more cash you can buy special custom looks for your character. Great maps and the graphic style is like that of borderlands. This game is a 8 out of 10 for me.
4541	1	a	This is a great game!, but it still could use some more update's, becuase its pretty much the same gamemode, only slightly diffrent, but still a great game! (:
4543	1	a	Many reviews say this is a bad game, I disagree. The gunplay feels good, the graphics are very good, the maps are nice and the gameplay is fun.  I haven't seen many bugs at all, it seemed a fairly seamless gameplay experience.
4545	1	a	just had a LAN party. This game was one of the funnest games we played!
4547	1	a	This game is amazing, the guns are great and it's so many choices, they have tanks and flying stuff D: AND Its the best multiplayer game i've ever played
4549	1	a	great game
4551	1	a	Nice game, having lots of lag issues though, that needs to be fixed. (its the game because i have no problem playing other games)  this game is awesome to play with a few friends or just by yourself. this game isnt challenging at the start but later on you will die a couple of times wich is good, it keeps the challenge in the game. the graphics are great (although i have to play on lowest graphics because of the lag issues)   everything summed up a bit: buy this game, its awesome. but you do need a pretty decent pc to play without lag
4553	1	a	Burned three hours in one sitting since buying this game. For the dollar I payed for it I've already gotten a 33 cent per hour return on it. Keep in mind this is only fun with friends.
4555	1	a	verry good to play but it's lag
4557	1	a	very good for this price you can pick it!
4559	1	a	I don't know what you guys are talking about because it's even worth 15$ But one dollar I don't how they make money. But it's a good game. 
4561	1	a	This game is amazingly fun for how cheap it is.  If you want some quick laughs, buy the 4-pack and gift the games your friends so you can play together and share the insanity!
4563	1	a	It's cheap and fun. You don't lose anything if you buy it.
4565	1	a	playing alone by yourself this game will be boring and you will regret buying it playing with friends however provides a really fun experience. this game is actually quite fun the leveling perk system is unique and gives you a nice rpg feel to it and wide variety and weapon types is also good ive been playing this for awhile and i find it fun reminds me of borderlands and halo almost with a good horde slapped on i play this with my buddies alot and we have a blast this is really fun if you have friends that are interested go for it you guys will have fun so far im enjoying it.
4567	1	a	this game is good for 0.99 i dont see why you wouldnt get it i would probably pay 5.00 for this game 9/10 bugs
4569	1	a	It has dinosaurs, and you shoot them..... 10/10
4571	1	a	This game is some of the best fun I've had playing a multiplayer on the PC in a VERY long time. Thumbs up from me!
4573	1	a	When this was released may 2014 it was junk!,now i love this game! with 60+ updates this game is not like the old one!,I recommend buying it its only 0,79$,Better than COD i can say, a mashup with hallo and jurassic park :)
4575	1	a	Good game, people naturally knew what needed to be done. Not a single word said and you got a driver with a gunner.
4577	1	a	I admit i HAD to give this game a try as soon as i noticed how the devs. mocked their own game, and hey it only costed me like 7 bucks to find a very enjoyable game, yes a poorly designed but fun game and i can only cheer the devs for the improvement they've made so far. With some more work this game could be a coop-dino-classic.  At first glance this game will simply remind you of Halo. The armors, vehicles and even the weapons must be inspired by Halo i must say.  This is a focused co-op wave-survival game which offers several difficulties and competitive modes such as Conquest, Deathmatch and a 5v5 where both teams need to protect a power generator while destroying the enemy's. Very fun.  Graphically the game does not offer anything new, i can be honest and tell you that this aint no eye-candy, at all. They seem old and poorly designed.  Right away you will notice clunky animations aswell. Robotic movements and weapons being held by thin air, dinosaurs that may disappear for a second while they chase your sorry-â™¥â™¥â™¥ making it difficult to kill, specially the small ones.  Dont take me wrong, i really enjoyed this game for a couple of days nowadays i play it when i dont know what else to do and i still find it fun. Remember, like 7 bucks for a fun ride !!   If you are considering if this game is a go or a no-go, please do.
4579	1	a	Really worth 99 cents :D 
4581	1	a	a cheap good game....now thats is unique.
4583	1	a	If you are looking for some good clean fun with your friends ORION will give it to you. Nothing fancy, just A LOT of Dinos to be killed. Although a bit lacking in the graphics department and such. Still worth the $0.99 price tag.
4585	1	a	Fun game that costs less than $1, what more could you ask for?
4587	1	a	nice fps games ... worth to buy
4589	1	a	10/10 
4591	1	a	Brief: An extremely underrated dinosaur survival game well worth the small cost.  Pros: +GRATUITIOUS DINOSAURS! +Play as a dino or a human +Bots for offline play +Various game modes +'Avatar' style vehicles +Various weapons/cosmetics +Decent graphics with nice effects +Skill tree per match +Endless survival mode (or maybe I'm just too rubbish to reach the end)  Cons: -Gameplay gets a little stale after a while
4593	1	a	Step 1: Happily play with friend for 20 minutes Step 2: 420.69 mph in a speedy gonzalez car.  Step 3: Get stuck in rock Step 4: 5 mins later figure out suicide command Step 5: Continue to play happily  10/10 ign would buy again.
4595	1	a	This game is really awsome its totally worth it!
4597	1	a	After only playing the game for a matter of a half hour I managed to get stuck in a dino, watch as my team mate flew into the sunset carried off by a pterodactyl. I got bumrushed by Compsognathus (tiny rat looking things from Jurrasic park, you know the miniture t-rex's)  Wan2play.net  9/10 gives this game a 9 out of 10 the only thing they need to work on is minor glitches and support for AMD users other then that I think this game is well worth a dollar
4599	1	a	Great game! Bought it for myself, and after a few hours of playing, bought the 4-pack for my friends, Good job!
4601	1	a	Glitchy for now... But it's AWESOME!  EDIT: 2015 This game... it has changed... from a Glitchy F@*% Fest.... into a formidable game... This is where my 2012 purchase went to..... it worth at least 10 USD....
4603	1	a	Briliante Game'a :P recommend it :)
4605	1	a	Don't even have the game but i can review it.  11/10
4607	1	a	Despite some negative feedback, this game realley deserves to be praised for its ingenuity and fun gameplay. Over all I really do recommend this game and I give it a solid 8/10.
4609	1	a	An amazing game, especially for the low cost. A good game of dino survival with a few friends and you can't go wrong.
4611	1	a	Fun, bought it on sale, easy to pick up and get right into it after a bit. Worth full price IMO
4613	1	a	This game is great fun, I dont think it gets as much appreciation or attention as it probably should.
4615	1	a	at first i didn't know what to expect from this game. i just had a little money left so i thought sure why not buy it. it was tricky at first because i didnt know how to play and i don't really play these kinds of games anyway so i wasn't to sure to think wether it was good or bad. a group of players helped me with learning how to play and from that moment on i started really liking this game. the dinosaur gameplay i wasn't to crazy about but i loved the weapons. jet packs, mech suits, tanks and things that unleash hell XD. to top it off there are also dinosaurs ofcourse! :D  so yes i do recommend this game it's pretty good for the price...
4617	1	a	Very well put game love it so much!! and P.S. help me i can't stop!!
4619	1	a	The real questions is...  Would you pay $1 to pilot a helicoptor firing missile swarms at a Tyrannasaurus Rex?  Why, Yes. Yes I Would.
4621	1	a	its pretty fun for the price, nothing special but very enjoyable with friends, just buggy enough to give you a laugh without being frustrating, easy to pick up and very scalable in difficulty, from being a cakewalk at lower difficulties to being nigh impossible at higher ones  same price as a cheeseburger, you cant go wrong
4623	1	a	It's a game featuring cyber-soldiers with jet-packs, shotguns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers, cloaking devices, and a bunch of other weapons and gear against waves upon waves of dinosaurs. And it costs one dollar. There's no reason not to buy it and spend at least an hour or two messing around in this game. Also, rocket launchers and jet-packs are OP.
4625	1	a	I paid less than 75 American cents ($0.74) for this game today. And me and my friends just got over 3 hours of some of the most fun gameplay we've had in years.  At first, I thought, 'Hey, this movement is clunky', and then I remembered that this wasn't a $60.00 Battlefield X title. But it wasn't any worse than any FPS I grew up with like Wolfenstein, Half-Life, and... um... other stuff.  5 minutes in, all bets are off, and you're loving killing dinosaurs. 10 rounds of 'pull the trigger and shoot' and then you start to figure out an upgrade path for your weapons and skills. It's about 30 minutes of confusion, and then it clicks, and this game is fun as all get out.   The visuals are amazing. The levels are huge. The weapon selection is vast. The vehicles are ridiculous. Yes, vehicles. Not on-rails. Free vehicles like Battlefield.  Case in point: by the last two sessions tonight, the final map is an all-out dino rampage. Two of our three players figured out how to fly the gunships, keep them in the air, while providing air cover for a tank driving back to base. The slow moving tank was getting swarmed, and the gunships were raining missles down on the dinos attacking the tank. Meanwhile, the gunships were getting swarmed my pterydactyls. They had ground-cover from the bots though.   Seriously. It's not earth-shattering physics or revolutionary gameplay. But it's some of the most fun you can have goofing around with friends. It's an AMAZING game.  The maps are beautiful and huge. The layouts are really smartly done, And the progression for each level is smart too.  I wish there was a way to make the progress from levels 1-&gt;10 carry over to session 11-&gt;20, but you quickly realize that it's a 10-match world, and you scale appropriately. When the next round comes up, you start with nothing, but you're a little smarter. And you WILL play the next round, because its fun as hell.  Buy this. Buy the 4-pack and hand it out to people on your friends list.   I love this game at under a buck, but I'd have no probalem dropping $20 for this one.
734	0	a	Warning , there is NO invert options on this, i have waisted cash and space on this . if you do find options for this pls let me know as i cant find invert anywhere. good looking game but built in the stone age it seems:( 
4627	1	a	Awesome game especially for not even a buck Orion &gt; McDouble
4629	1	a	Best Coop Game that i have played in a while
4631	1	a	Game is fun for a few minutes and on a sale cost much as a phone app so get it
4633	1	a	Hey, forget Evolve, buy this instead. It has assymetrical multiplayer, excellent co-op, different classes with leveling and perks, multiple different weapons, turrets, vehicles, and ridiculous fights.  It's really a lot of fun, and it's cheap! It's something you can play with anyone. Oh yeah and Workshop support? Yep.
4635	1	a	After 78h I'm glad that I bought this game. That is really great time-killer with a lot of fun.  If you don't have this game - buy it now. :)
4637	1	a	Non scoped a T-Rex with a Sniper for 0.49â‚¬... 11/10 Best game...
735	0	a	From a 100% honest reviewer:  Hi guys, this game wasn't too bad! The graphics were definately a bit underwhelming, especially the way the dinosaurs moved. However the gameplay was fun and easy to learn. I picked up pretty quickly and was able to play some fun rounds. However, it was slightly repetitve, and for me, it didn't really have any replay value. I wouldn't really play this game a lot.
4639	1	a	What you must know is that it's all about the vehicles. Get a ground vehicle, run dinos over or shoot them from and attached gun with someone else driving. Or get an aerial vehicle and shoot the hell out of annoying dumb flying dinos.
4641	1	a	played when it was free weekend i remeber it was fun im actuly planing on buying it this summer
4643	1	a	I honestly didn't have much thought about this game when I first started, I thought I'd play it once, think 'Yeah, alright, good laugh' and never touch it again.   I absolutely love it. Fun, frantic, fast paced, and getting ontop of a rock with an LMG spraying down dinos is immensly satisfying.   Easy to pick up, easy to play, little brain processing required - good, simple fun.
4645	1	a	OK playing solo, awesome playing with friends. Great game, especially considering it's only $0.99. Heck, spend the extra $2 to get the 4-pack and send them to friends, it's worth it.
4647	1	a	Mmm...nice game!
4649	1	a	Getting grabbed by Pterodactyls never gets any easier.
736	0	a	First match I get the flag and a T-Rex tries to eat me. I glitch through the bottom of the map and am stuck down there for the rest of the match along with the egg. Very buggy.
4651	1	a	Devs actually fixed it. Game don't suck anymore, guys.
4653	1	a	This is basically the Mass Effect 3 multiplayer with fewer bugs and dinosaurs instead of aliens. Definitely worth the purchase, I spent less than five bucks so I can shoot dinosaurs in the face with three friends. Worth every penny.
4655	1	a	Using the Unreal Engine, this game is a combination of Halo and Killing Floor, only more entertaining. With three classes to choose from and a extensive leveling up system, this game is one awesome indie title for the ages. Orion has difficult but pleasant battles with all kinds of dinosaurs, including T-Rexs. It is very satisfying to fight and kill these very large and prehistoric beasts. The fast-paced shooting works greatly and I most definitely recommend this title for everyone.
4657	1	a	Great little game, fun too mess around on and fun to play with friends. I would recommand getting it. :D
4659	1	a	Best dino shooter I have played. Pick it up if its cheap.
4661	1	a	so fun and addicting you upgrade and kill dinos! i judged it at first cause i thought it sucked but played and i loved it
4663	1	a	My friends told me 'you could buy a bag of chips, or this game' and you know what? I would rather have that bag of chips. Honestly, this game is crudely-made and minimally optimized with gameplay inferior to Killing Floor.   However, if this were 2008, I'd rank this game a solid 9/10.
4665	1	a	Unknown game blew my mind. Plays like HALO!!!! Kill dinosaurs like TUROK!!!! Vehicles work great, leveling up gets addicting. Within the small hour of gameplay I blew a pack of Compy's with a grenade, a triceratops rammed me and knocked me back across the map, stepped on by a trex, ran over a pack of raptors and got picked up by a damn Pterodactyl.....while I was driving a freaking warthog! Instant buy 4 pack for me and my buds.
4667	1	a	Good game, TERRIBLY OPTIMIZED  the game is FUN don't get me wrong but... running around at 2 fps with the lowest settings on MY computer means something is VERY wrong.
4669	1	a	somebody clean up my â™¥â™¥â™¥
4671	1	a	To be honest, this game is bad aesthetically. Its animations are rudimentary at best and the gun animations are out of sync but what do you expect from a game that costs 0.99 freakin' cents?! The gameplay is repetitive but somehow it keeps me playing for a few hours (I just go straight for the mech during the later waves) but again 0.99 freakin' cents! I recommend this game solely because of the price. The game is fun with some friends and you owe it to yourself to try it out. It isn't the best looking game but it is a hell of alot of fun once you get the hang of it.  PS: There is microtransactions in the game but only for cosmetic items so if you are one of those people who love buying virtual items using real life money... go ahead nobody is stopping you (or you could buy the items to support the developers ;-) ).
4673	1	a	IS GUT GUT GAIM YIS
4675	1	a	Its a fun game but man could the frames be better
4677	1	a	its like cod bo3 with dinosaurs.
4679	1	a	Well it's not the best game out there but it really fun to play + it's very cheap bth 0,79 euros is not that much. I think its worth buying it ! :)
4681	1	a	Onion:Shreklude &lt;--- thats how i feel about this game. &lt;3
4683	1	a	Shooting dinosaurs. Interesting environments. Unique weapons.  All this can be yours for just one easy payment of $0.99.
4685	1	a	Very recommend.It is a very interesting game,it's price is very cheap but the game experience is good.The optimization is fine so the game can runing smoothly on a low-configuration computer,so you may not worry about your configuration.In the game,you can play three different career and cooperate with your friends or a Bot.And there are also so many interesting game modes,you can enjoy them one by one.
4687	1	a	I really like this game. Totally worth the money, especially if you have friends to play with. The game is still sometimes rough around the edges. For example, the animations aren't as smooth as you expect them to be. Still one of the most fun I've had playing a game. Occasionally, you'll die from something dumb like being glitched into 2 dinosaurs, but I'm looking forward to the game being polished by their updates.
4689	1	a	Very enjoyable game, if you are playing it with a budie on co-op mode :D
4691	1	a	Great game. 100% worth the $.99 it costs. 500% worth it when its on sale for $.50, or 1000% worth it to get the four pack for $.75. I bought 5 of the four packs to share the game with my friends. 10/10 would buy 5 more.
4693	1	a	You get to kill dinosaurs with big guns... and it costs less than a beer. So you get the idea.
4695	1	a	Fun game especially when you play with your friends . Lots of fun and laughs. Many interesting weapons and vehicles , although the mechanisms are pretty difficult. Nice graphics too. Definately worth my 0.39 euro.
4697	1	a	If you use the weird hoverthingies you can climb over the heightlimit and go driving around the skybox. Also it had dinosours at some point. But they won't really bother you if you keep driving in circle and just not care about them.  You are a autist who likes dinosours so you will buy it even if I say that this game is worse than Hitler.  9/10 it has dinosaurs.
4699	1	a	I recomend it becaus its trully fun to blow stuff up especially when its alive though i would like to see more oprimizations for laptops and 'not so good' PCs.
4701	1	a	This game is well worth the money spent ($1), and even if it was 5 bucks i'd STILL buy it! Half descent graphics, and good game-play make this game a 7.5/10 in my opinion. I've paid alot more ($10-20) for games that weren't even HALF as good as this one! Enjoy it, and pass on the good word :)   Respectfully, Cronic
4703	1	a	This game is actually really cool, like I spent $1 on it like 'pfft whatever, can't really lose at that price' and it turned out to be remarkably fun. I'm not sure what this game did or what state it was in on release but it's certainly much better now, has a huge Planetside 2 feel to it on a smaller scale but with freaking dinosaurs!  Planetpart, Jurrasicside, take your pick.
4705	1	a	One of the most fun co-op games i have played in a while and with still more content coming out this year!
4707	1	a	Awesome game for such a low price! Definitely worth it!
4709	1	a	10/10
4711	1	a	It's fun!
4713	1	a	its cheap , cool and fun
4715	1	a	This Game is bad but it makes fun with friends because you can trickshot dinosaurs! 10/10 :D
4717	1	a	I have no idea how it costs so little. It shouldn't be this good.
4719	1	a	I hit a dead T-rex with a vehicle, t-rex flew into the air. 10/10
4721	1	a	.50 cents on a sale to play hours of tons of gamemodes with friends. Sign me Up
4723	1	a	Teached me so much about history, 5 stars.
4725	1	a	Is the best game
4727	1	a	i need a tutorial on how to stop playing this game because damn gurl, this game is gud
4729	1	a	Well worth the money, quite a bit of ridiculous fun. wave based dinosaur survival game with limited shopping between waves. can also buy power-ups and turrets not just guns.
4731	1	a	An AMAZING fps game! Just watch the trailer and you'll know why. This game has guns, jetpacks, tanks, helicopters, and dinasaurs in it! It's 99 CENTS just for the plain version, and the WHOLE game, PLUS FOUR PACKS are only 3.99! It's worth so much more! I would reccommend to anyone who is a fan of an fps, and surviving waves of enemies. I even got a four month free trial!
4733	1	a	The ratings on this game through youtube and a couple other places are pretty bad but I think this game is amazing. Sure it has a few quirks, as all betas do. But I can't seem to get enough of it. Well done!
4735	1	a	Awful, yet also awesome.  The game is not well made, even on a good machine with solid internet connection it will lag.  It's not smooth, and the AI is kinda dumb. The modes simplistic and the enemy cheap.  With a few friends (and it helps to have a drink or two in you) it's an absolute barrel of laughs and fun. Play for the dino mayhem and slaughter. Don't play to have a good intelligent shooter.  Grab a gun and go shoot a raptor in the head. Rinse and repeat.
4737	1	a	Orion dino horde is extremely fun and you will never get bored, servers are also very easy to make!
4739	1	a	I was told this game was really bad by friends. With a free weekend we started to play the revamped version and I must say it is a blast to play coop on CONQUEST. I will be supporting there new kickstarter on feb 27 for an open world game. Give this game a try and you will not regret it, this team has pulled a complete 180 with their game and you can see with their updates that the truly care.
4741	1	a	I'ts worth .99 cent but that's all I'm going to say about it.
4743	1	a	OH yes it is the most fantastic game on the planet. Even the Stig has something to say abou â™¥â™¥â™¥ and i quote, 'It's real good.'
4745	1	a	I played this game when it was free for a day and I was very negative and only looked at the bad parts of the game.  But when my friend and I wanted to play some co-op we decided to give this a second try. And It's actually really fun! Maybe the idea and sounds are kind of cheesy but the game is packed with hours of fun.  I recomend this game for the people who want's a good cheap co-op game. 10/10 would dinosaur again.
4747	1	a	After the update and switch to UDK this game got AMAZING. My whole class in college is full of people who play it and LOVE it. I cant remember a time in my life I have had this much fun outside the tub. I give it 5.4 stars out of 6.
4749	1	a	THIS IS THE GREATEST â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ GAME EVER
4751	1	a	0.99 is a steal for this game. Fun and more fun. Lovin it.
4753	1	a	This game is insane... and fun!
4755	1	a	This was 39p
4757	1	a	Do you like Science Fiction? Do you like Dinosaurs? Do you have a Dollar? If you answered yes to these questions, get the game!
4759	1	a	The first game I play where the butt of a gun hurts more than the gun itself.
4761	1	a	Half life 3 GOTY
4763	1	a	Me and my friends had a blast its halo vs dino amazing
4765	1	a	So much fun, so much god damn fun and violence and dinos all together.  When to buy this: If you like fun If you like more fun If you like killing stuf If you like running like a little girl If you like fun (yeah, again) If you like being chased by big â™¥â™¥â™¥ dinos If you like shooting stuf If you like FPS (should be first, but all the other stuff is moar important)  When not to buy this: If you don't like fun If you don't like killing stuff If you don't like being chased by dinos If you don't like having a god damn lot of fun while killing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ while being chased by dinos while having a lot of fun trying not to die. (there is no syntax error on this sentence, read it right and you will understand what it says)  Ahcro.
4767	1	a	This game is certainly worth 10 cents.
4769	1	a	Its a nice little game that you can enjoy for a some time. especially with friends and stuff. it is a bit bad here and there but overall its a pretty good experience.
4771	1	a	If you love Dinos and hunting this game is for you
4773	1	a	Get past the general generic feel of every aspect of the game and it is actually quite fun, plus theres always killing a T-Rex with a lightsaber.
4775	1	a	You pay 1â‚¬ to play Halo and Killing floor at the same time!
4777	1	a	Got the game as a gift, started playing seriously a couple weeks ago.  Played as assault class, purchased perk to get other class adrenaline weapons.  Roll in the final round with 2 pistols, 2 LMG, double grenades, and a Gattling gun. Mow down three large dinosaurs with the pistols and the grenades. Pull out both LMG's, take down the Crocodile looking motherf*****. *Morph into Hank Hill* 'That T-Rex is always throwing rocks at me. I think I'll go over there and gvie it a piece of my mind.' *Pull out gattling gun* *Put five hundred rounds into the T-Rex's head* 'There we go, Bobby. He ain't gonna be throwing no more rocks. I taught him a lesson.' The whole place explodes as I Matrix walk out of the canyon.   -Directed by Michael Bay
4779	1	a	'ORION: Prelude' is a wonderful 'MURDER EVERYTHING' game, with great graphics, gameplay, and content. It has a variety of weapons, vehicles, and gamemodes. You could be shooting dinosaurs with energy lasers, or alternatively shooting players with energy lasers. Now, for most of the review there'll be content on Dinosurvival. This is because it's the main point of Prelude, but there are other games too. CTF is almost never played. If you want to play CTF, you might want to go somewhere else. Not saying CTF is bad on Prelude, just that nobody ever opens a server for it. You'll usually find the official servers are all Dinosurvival, with a few unofficial ones sportying different gamemodes, such as Gun Game or Team Deathmatch. I, myself, have never played TDM or Gun Game on Prelude, prefering the Dinosaur Shooting Madness known as Dinosurvival, in which you murder dinosaurs with Gatling Guns, Flamethrowing Turrets, and Helicopters.  Most of the time, the players are nice, friendly, and concentrated on the game. But once in about every 50 games, you'll get someone who hoards all the good vehicles without doing anything to help murder all dinosaurs you see. It's also very good for a cheap game, coming in at a CS:GO case key for 4 copies. (Â£1.69) Think of how much more content you and your friends are getting for your money when you bought a 4-Pack of this game instead of a case key for CS:GO. TLDR: A MURDER EVERYTHING game with a good playerbase and populated servers but some servers overlook gamemodes that probably would be good. 9.8/10
4781	1	a	*Friend Shooting T-Rex with Minigun* *Rams T-Rex and gets the kill*  10/10 would steal dino kill again
4783	1	a	10/10 not expected games that cost 0.74$ (summersale) are bad, but not this one
4785	1	a	Honestly, if my PC wasn't â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, i'd play this more
4787	1	a	Dinosaurs. Do I need to go on?
4789	1	a	This game is optimized worse than a giraffe for raising a baby. It runs terribly, looks MUCH worse than in the screenshots, dinosaurs are dumber than Donald Trump running for president, all of the sfx are ones I hear in flash games on kongregate, and the price is a couple dollars over what I would pay. Also, i'm reccomending so people actually see it.
4791	1	a	Fix the damn multiplayer bugs and this game would be lots of fun
4793	1	a	This game, when it came out it 2012, was, without a doubt, a total wreck. Glitchy graphics, animations screw ups, pathfinding issues, etc.  Now?  One of the best survival shooters I have played. It's tieing with Gears of War's horde mode and Halo's Firefight mode for best survival shooter I have played.  Seriously, Play. The. Game. It. Is. Awesome. YEEHAW!!!!!
4795	1	a	I have been playing this game for a couple of hours now and I've got to say, this is probably one of the best dinosaur survival games that I have ever seen! The gameplay is so smooth and the graphics are amazing! The action in this game is unreal and you're always up to the task of finishing the objective. The only thing that bugs me are the pterodactyl's, they're always flying at you picking off your health, but the only way to stop them is with a shotgun! I recommend this game for everyone to play if you like a dinosaur survival, open-world, action, and multiplayer/solo experience!
4797	1	a	Good buy, a little expensive though
4799	1	a	You are in a SUV killing off dinos when a trex spawns and hits ur car....the car flyes off into the sunset (off teh map) and u win the round by unknown reasons. 10/10
4801	1	a	This game is awesome co-op is done well,it reminds a lot on Halo and Borderlands  Everyone should try it  -There aren't much servers
4803	1	a	Pretty dank, fun time waster
4805	1	a	Mech machine can get on top of a helicopter. 10/10
4807	1	a	t-rex sited on me 10/10-woud be afk agien
4809	1	a	You kill dinosours with guns 8 out of 10
4811	1	a	This game is worth more then just a dollar! If you own a steam account you should own this game. It has multiplayer rpg levels and rewards with over two hundrend fifty achievements. Many different game modes and even play as dinosaurs. Multiplayer games are fun and easy to host or play solo with bots.
4813	1	a	Was expecting to eat many people (cough cough Chris Pratt). Got bored and started killing friendly dinos (for sport... of course) and maybe ate some velociraptors and stomped on some compys in the process.   roar/10 would kill everything that moves again.    p.s. : I did better in the movie, except for the whole dying part.
4815	1	a	This game costs 80p A 500g tin of chopped tomatoes also costs 80p  This game has dinosaurs  Chopped tomatoes do not  Logic = Buy this game 10/10 - if this game were a tomato, it would be the best tomato  In all honesty it's hilarious and a load of fun with friends Absolutely priceless, best 80p ever spent
4817	1	a	Get in the car Ram the T-Rex The car flies in the air 10DINOS/10  
4819	1	a	25p each for 4 friends to shoot a T Rex in the face. What's not to like?
4821	1	a	Jet pack on top of a mountain to throw nades at dinos, see someone next to me slide off the mountain towards a T-rex, watched him get slaughtered. 10/10 Long live the king.
4823	1	a	Every so often you get a game that feels so genuine. By that i mean that this game is low budget as hell, Glitchy and bad quality animations, generic graphics. But through playing the game, i felt that the people who made it really enjoyed making it and they made it mostly for themselves with no expectations of getting popular or even wanting to be popular. I just get that vibe from it and for me it just makes the game so much better.   I have only played the survival mode. and it's kinda like the serious sam games but with different classes and unlockables and dinosaurs. And i love it.
4825	1	a	Cool and great.
4827	1	a	The Best Cheap Game Ever! i wonder why its cheap because the graphic looks fantastic!  10/10
4829	1	a	This game is awesome first off. Its a little broken in some places but theres tons of cool weapons, good graphics, awesome action and punching dinos in the face. If you have a couple of dollars you should really consider getting this game.
4831	1	a	Why spend $10+ on a game you will play for a few hours and quit. This game is only ~$0.99 and you can easly put 100+ hours into this game. Best bang for you buck end of story. Love this game. Highly recomended!
4833	1	a	This game is bad and terrible for a lot of reasons but it's somehow really fun to play.Am I going crazy?
741	0	a	Cool concept, Poorly executed.
4835	1	a	The game is actually pretty good! the graphics are OK, and the sound design isn't crap. unlike what others say, this game is pretty fun compared to the bug-fest others make it out to be. Dino Horde borrows elements from other games, which makes it very familiar and relatable. Ignore the Metacritic review, this game is worth the purchase, especially if on sale
742	0	a	it dose't woke on my windows 7   WTF I wrote this review when i was seven. My friend got me this game to play it but it is not working. I am gonna try to fix it bye reinstaling it but I cant stop laughing about the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ review I left/
4837	1	a	I love the open - world aspect, and the Metascore is totally off, it's a great game, and I reccomend it highly! 
4839	1	a	perfect blend of crazyness halo openish worlds and players
4841	1	a	Maybe this is a buggy game... but for 0,99$ ist really good and can give you 100 hours of fun :D
4843	1	a	This is a fun wave survival game. Its diffrent how it mixes future technology and dinosaurs together. It all works out to make a fun game. You start out at the begining of the round buying some guns or armor. Then you fight a wave of small Dinos and 2-3 bigger dinosaurs. For the 99 cents i paid, it was totally worth it. As cheap as it is i would say give it a shot.
4845	1	a	s'alright.
4847	1	a	i think that this is a high quality game, the anti aliasing is really smooth and you don't see any jagged edges(even on low). Also there is a very good campaign that everybody plays, everyone on my friendslist is playing this because it's the new trend. i feel sorry for this kid whos name is listerine that got bullied because he didn't play it a lot. The movement on this game is really realistic which gives a jurassic park feel if you're on acid. Overall: campaign=:) multiplayer=:) graphics=:) movement=:)
4849	1	a	1 dollar, come on, thats chump change. Just get the game. Even if you're not going to play it just get it.
4851	1	a	like halo with more dinosaurs
4853	1	a	I found Barney the dinosaur, I gave him 10 hugs. and by Barney I mean T-rex and by hugs I mean rockets to the head
4855	1	a	Just 5 hours in and I've already got the game by the throat, and then it goes and throws me for a loop all over again, something that doesn't happen to often. It's a great game to play with friends and laugh as they get eaten by dinos, and then get laughed at when you get eaten by the same dino. Easy to get a grip on, tough to actually master, the A.I might not be the smartest, but it still makes you work, no matter what weapon you have in your hand(s).  Give it a go, you can't go too wrong with this, plus who hasn't wanted to grab big guns and slaughter thousands of dinosaurs?
4857	1	a	I stabbed a dinosaur to death with a combat knife.... 10/10
4859	1	a	You can punch dinosaurs in the face
4861	1	a	Like Skyrim with dinosaurs. 10/10
4863	1	a	The best co-op survival fps game ever! You like Killing floor? Halo? Evolve? You should try this one then! You pay only a dollar for a great unique gameplay that will combined with beautiful graphics and some personal system that include level, stats, achievements, etc. It's a profit to buy this w/ your friends ;) 9/10
4865	1	a	This game.....I feel like im watching an albanian mock-up of Jurassic Park. It's absolutley wonderful 11/10
4867	1	a	'Games can't fail. Only developers can.' - orion dev team  this statment is true to every sinlge aspect of a game.  this game use to be unplayable, glitchy and down right imposible sometimes, but not the game has evolved into something beautiful and worth every penny you spend on it.  litteraly wtf guys, you forced a dream to come true, you are the real heros of videogames.
4869	1	a	The studio made an AMAZING job on this game and the remake of it, I would recommend this to all my friends, and I don't understand how they make money by selling it for so cheap?!   In all seriousness, I spent less than a dollar for this game, and its more fun than most of my games in my library! It has a great feeling when played, I only have very minor complaints!  -extremely large gun models -Cliffs like being buggy -no direct Steam connectivity  Other than that the game is amazing!  8.4/10.0
4871	1	a	After countless failed attempts, finally joined game. Lagged horrifically. Did nothing. Got achievement for being useless.  10/10 would be useless again.
4873	1	a	i love this game so much!
4875	1	a	Just 2 much lagg, sad but true. Good Game through, but im sad that my friends didn't play with me ;_;  â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘ â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–„â–„â–„â–„â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘ â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–„â–„â–ˆâ–ˆâ–€â–€â–€â–€â–‘â–‘â–€â–ˆâ–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘ â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–„â–„â–ˆâ–€â–€â–€â–„â–„â–„â–„â–ˆâ–„â–‘â–„â–‘â–ˆâ–ˆâ–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘ â–‘â–‘â–‘â–„â–ˆâ–‘â–„â–„â–„â–‘â–„â–ˆâ–€â–€â–€â–„â–ˆâ–ˆâ–€â–„â–€â–ˆâ–ˆâ–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘ â–‘â–‘â–„â–ˆâ–€â–‘â–‘â–€â–„â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–‘â–‘â–€â–‘â–‘â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–„â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–„â–„â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘ â–‘â–‘â–ˆâ–ˆâ–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–ˆâ–„â–ˆâ–€â–ˆâ–„â–ˆâ–ˆâ–€â–€â–€â–€â–„â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–€â–„â–€â–ˆâ–ˆâ–„â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘ â–‘â–‘â–ˆâ–ˆâ–€â–‘â–‘â–‘â–€â–€â–ˆâ–ˆâ–€â–‘â–‘â–€â–ˆâ–„â–„â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–‘â–ˆâ–‘â–‘â–‘â–€â–ˆâ–„â–‘â–‘ â–‘â–„â–ˆâ–ˆâ–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–ˆâ–€â–ˆâ–€â–€â–€â–€â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–€â–„â–ˆâ–ˆâ–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–€â–ˆâ–„â–‘ â–‘â–ˆâ–€â–ˆâ–ˆâ–‘â–‘â–‘â–€â–‘â–ˆâ–‘â–‘â–€â–€â–€â–‘â–„â–„â–€â–€â–€â–€â–€â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–ˆâ–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–ˆâ–„ â–‘â–ˆâ–‘â–‘â–€â–€â–ˆâ–‘â–‘â–‘â–ˆâ–‘â–€â–€â–€â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–„â–€â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–ˆâ–ˆ â–„â–ˆâ–„â–„â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–„â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–ˆâ–„â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–ˆâ–ˆ â–ˆâ–ˆâ–€â–„â–‘â–‘â–„â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–€â–„â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–ˆâ–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–„â–ˆâ–‘ â–‘â–ˆâ–„â–‘â–‘â–‘â–ˆâ–€â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–ˆâ–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–„â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–„â–ˆâ–€â–‘ â–‘â–‘â–€â–ˆâ–„â–„â–ˆâ–„â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–€â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–„â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–ˆâ–ˆâ–‘â–‘â–‘ â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–€â–€â–ˆâ–ˆâ–€â–ˆâ–„â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–„â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–„â–ˆâ–€â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘ â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–€â–ˆâ–„â–ˆâ–„â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–€â–‘â–‘â–‘â–„â–‘â–„â–ˆâ–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘ â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–€â–€â–€â–ˆâ–ˆâ–„â–„â–ˆâ–„â–„â–ˆâ–„â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–€â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘ â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–€â–€â–€â–€â–€â–€â–€â–€â–€â–€â–€â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘ â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘
4877	1	a	Really good game, recomend i highyl! You can point **** you and have a sandwich/hamburger hat, what beats that? Nothing is better than this game considering you also can dance like a boss with matrix patterns on your armor. If you want a fun, dinasaour killing game, I highly recomend ORION: Prelude
743	0	a	This game is still crap.
4879	1	a	Do you like dinosaurs? Do you like peacefull, non FPS games? Do you like usefull teamates? Do you like paying for good games? Did you answered NO to most of the questions? Then you will love this game
744	0	a	I dont even know where to start, the game in short is a terrible mess. Ugly and confusing GUI and the game's graphics even on best resolution leave much to be desired. It amazed me because the screen shots look good, even fun, but like every movie trailer these pics were probably the best parts of what this uneventful game has to offer. Trust me whan I say this.... STAY AWAY you'll thank me later.  Update: The game has gotten better since writing my review, but it still is graphically inferior. If you see my review just skip this game and try the devs new game The orion project. This game has much more promise, its currently in early alpha stage but well worth the dollar.
745	0	a	Taking a bloody â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ would be funner than thhis game
4881	1	a	So...the enemy AI is crap, the music is repetitive, and the guns/shooting is uninspired. Why am I recommending this? Well, it often goes on sale for under a dollar and the sheer enjoyment of co-op dinosaur shooting makes up for it. Expect about 4 hours of entertainment from this before your ears start to bleed from the sounds, but hey, 4 hours with friends shooting T-Rex are ones well spent.
4883	1	a	This game is somewhat like mixing CoD: BO with dinosaurs. You work together with teammates who help you in return with getting the giant T-Rex down for new weapons/attributes that you unlock with EXP and 'CRDT', gained after killing any reptilian creature that attacks you first. It needs lots of development, more weapons than JUST pistols but it has potential. Good luck devs!
4885	1	a	i.... i dont know what i just played... where is my bleach stash.....
4887	1	a	It's nice to get your head bitten off by a T-Rex!
4889	1	a	Spawn into halo-ish world. Have no idea what the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to do. Have a gun. It fires laser balls. Get into a car with tractor wheels. Run over 27 dinosaurs. Stegasaurus tail-whips car across map.  Jump out. Buy flamethrower. Go insane. Get picket up by flying dino â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and dropped from the sky.  27/10 Recommended.
4891	1	a	I got stuck in a rock. 10/10 I will get stuck again.
4893	1	a	A friend gifted me this game, i played it once. game crashed twice and lagged the hell out of my game. I swear I had like 4 FPS. I don't have a bad computer, and i rarely have a problem with this type of thing. Dinosour haelo is fun. 
4895	1	a	360 no scopped T-Rekt while i eat Doritos n MtnDew  9/11  MinamiNyan
4897	1	a	How to play this game: Pull out a gun, load it and shoot your head off. I played this game and i got molested by a T-Rex 11/10
4899	1	a	This is one of my personal favorites.... you get to kill DINOS!!! Not to mention you can run over other dinos with jeeps.
4901	1	a	Game sorts problems out for you: 10 year old kid was â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing around not doing anything and spamming down the mic so a Pterodactyl swooped down, grabbed him and flew off with him into the sunset whilst he was screaming down the mic for us to get him down. 10/10 would watch 10 year old be abducted by prehistoric bird/dinosaur again.
4903	1	a	You made it 0,99â‚¬ instead of a greedy 20â‚¬? Holy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. The first non-greedy game company in existance.
4905	1	a	THE DINOSWER CAME UP TO ME THEN I PEW PEW IT WITH BO THAT COST A MILLION COINS THE I DIE   GOOD GAME OVERAL
4907	1	a	I got $.99 and I spent it on this game!
4909	1	a	The whole time I was playing this game: 'WTF IS GOING ON?!?!?!?!?!'
4911	1	a	Absolutly love this game.  10/10  would jurassic world again.
4913	1	a	Is it perfect? No. Is it a Triple A game? Nah son. Are the dinosaurs smart and tactile, like most dinosaurs were? You bet your â™¥â™¥â™¥ they aren't.  The game is a dollar. You can kill freakin' dinosaurs with lasers and light sabers and grenades and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. No, it's not the amazing FPS dinosaur game every kid that grew up watching Jurassic Park wants, but it's still cheap and fun for a while. The one thing I absolutely hate about this game is the audio. The guns sound like they have ZERO power. When I shoot a velociraptor in the face with a shotgun, I want my ears to vibrate from the loud blast coming out of my headphones. Aside from the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ poor sound fx, the game is worth your dollar. Besides, what else are you going to buy for a dollar? A candy bar? That'll be gone in 2 minutes unless you lose it in your couch cushions. Buy ORION: Prelude instead.
4915	1	a	It's okay, considering that I can buy a Coke for more than I bought this game for.
4917	1	a	Its a good game, but no Malaysia server, so if you about to play this game, make sure you live in the right region, to of course,avoid lag.  Pros: Epic graphic Massive multiplayer Overpowered weapons and upgrades  Bads: High RAM Usage Some badass dinasour will camp outside your spawn  Infinite/10 will play again if theres Asia Server  -Modified Review 11.13.16
4919	1	a	Truly one of the best ever games i have ever ever played, the graphics are amazing and the gameplay highly enjoyable, minecraft has nothing on this shooter.
4921	1	a	HELP!!! I can't move because my head spinns
4923	1	a	fantastic value, good gameplay and all forÂ£0.99??? AMAZING!!1
4925	1	a	Even though the meta score is 36 its still a great game.
4927	1	a	Fun little game for very cheap at Â£1, worth buying while on sale!
4929	1	a	I played this solo. A Dinosaur bit my gentleman's specialty off and as I was bleeding out it ran away.  Of course, I died. These dinosaurs don't hang around like the mooks do on Borderlands, waiting to kill you. That suggests Dinosaurs are cleverer than the populace of Pandora.  8/10, would have my particulars bitten off again.
4931	1	a	I'm not sure why this game received such low reviews. I hear it used to be not the caliber it is, but I just played it for a solid hour and it was a blast. Seriously the most fun I've had in a long time. 8/10, would recommend.
4933	1	a	This is the worst game in my library. I love it.
4935	1	a	It's not bad, but it's also not good. If you enjoy a buggy dino slaughter, buy this game 
4937	1	a	It is very funny but it is not worth 13,99â‚¬   But 0,99â‚¬ IT IS SO WORTH !  
4939	1	a	It ain't â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. I dont get the exceptionally low metacritic score as it's pretty much what is. I would give it a 6.5 at best at full price and an 8 for a dollar. Good silly survival co-op if you play with friends kinda reminds me of killing floor with dinosaurs and vehicles. It ain't no Killing Floor though.
4941	1	a	This game is really fun
4943	1	a	Definately ignore the MetaScore, this game is way better than however it got that rating! Great Co-Op or PVP fun, even play as the Dinos!
4945	1	a	It may be fun if we play with friends for a few hoursâ€¦ but it may be not. There are many games fighting in the FPS genre, and it's very hard to find something worth highlighting in this one.
4947	1	a	For $1 you would be insane not to enjoy this. After playing it, I would say it even deserves its $15 price tag. But they cant get my money back NO SIR E  But seriously, just try it with a friend. Multiplayer is a must.
4949	1	a	Ok it is sooo broke but thats what the fun of it is, also there are jetpacks!  I will say get it, BUT ONLY IF ON SALE FOR LIKE $1  Because even if it is funny it is still a rather unfinished and badly programed game. But with good mate it can be very fun good time waster  4/10 for me
4951	1	a	Great game!
4953	1	a	This is the gameplay Call of Duty: Zombies wished it had. Very fluent, groomed and polished little game. Fun playing solo, and an even better time playing online with friends. Rewarding class/tier and weapon upgrades to demolish dozens of Dinos in a satisfying manner. Definately worth the price. 85/100
4955	1	a	First off the meta score is a little low for this game it is way more fun than you might think it does need lots more work.
4957	1	a	Would deffinately recomend this game! It plays a lot like borderlands and horde mode from gears of war. Really fun and challenging, especially with a couple of friends!
4959	1	a	Possibly the most fun you'll have with a bad game.  10/10 would bang.
4961	1	a	Fun with friends, but not that great of a game overall. graphics are old and bad, game is poorly optimized, but the gunplay is fun. Unless you havve a fairly large group of friends with Orion, I do not reccomend.
4963	1	a	Although more work on the game needs to be done, the game itself is really quite fun. that of course if you play with or in a group of people or friends. playing alone is a more hard and really just pointless, you wont survive long and it way less fun.  for my opinion there is no point of buying the game without friends to play with. its just don't worth it, but if if you do have someone to play with and you love the idea then give it a shot
4965	1	a	Reason why the meta score is bad because the game is bad
4967	1	a	I was rather worried about all the bad reviews, and the awful metascore this game had recieved, but given my interest in games like Killing Floor and Halo, I figured I'd give it a shot. I mean, how bad can dinosaur killing be, right?  I downloaded the free trial, and WOW was I in for a surprise. It was just good, clean fun. It didn't feel as tight as Killing Floor, or as 'Next-Gen' as Halo usually does, but the combination of those two, and lack of real seriousness about the game make a fantastically fun time sink, and an extremely enjoyable game.  Within 15 minutes, I decided it was worth the $0.99 to pick this game up, as I had already had more fun playing it than I have had in a game like this since Killing Floor, and I do not regret it one bit, especially at this price.  While there are a few bugs here and there, such as dinos occasionally flying up to unbelievable heights, and arrows hovering after they have fired and hit a target. But there doesn't seem to be much of anything that gets in the way of the actual gameplay.  While to this point, I have not strayed much from the Players vs. Dinosaurs Survival mode (which is truly fantastic when you get a good group of people playing with you), there are many other different gameplay modes that provide good variety. Also, there is a pretty good selection of weapons in this game, catering to many different tastes, and nothing seems to be TOO over powered, with weapons seeming to be rather well balanced. The different 'Augmentations' are also a nice addition to the game, allowing you to play to your own strengths instead of always having a vanilla character.  TL;DR:  Overall, this is a really good game, and has changed a lot for the better from the game that recieved a 35 metascore. Definitely worth the $1 it is right now, and probably even the $10 or $15 it is at full price.
4969	1	a	Lots of changes from the previous version... Keep up the good work. Looking forward to see another great updates
4971	1	a	Super fun, fast action dino killer.
4973	1	a	I recommend this game to the people who like first person shooters and 3rd person. There are tons of very uniqe weapons and equipment. PLAY THIS GAME!
4975	1	a	It's essentially killing floor, but cheaper and with dinosaurs and a car...and jetpacks...and no patriarch. It's actually nothing like killing floor. 8/10 Would recommend to people who like Killing Floor.
4977	1	a	Dino horde, the game you just love to hate, bad? maybe? its a game that you can play again and again and again, and yet still rage at it no matter how good/bad it is!   Is it worth it? not so much.
4979	1	a	I absoloutly love this game. 10/10    
4981	1	a	This game can't be compared to Dino Beatdown. Yes! It's created by the same developer, but once you play ORION: Dino Horde you'll get to see that Spiral Game Studios really took the negative reviews directly to the chin and practiced what the community demanded from Dino Beatdown - Put that into consideration. Also people that purchased Dino Beatdown received this game for free.  More and more free content has been added to this game, so it's pretty clear that Spiral Game Studios is working on it.  So how's this game? Well first off you need some people you can rely on playing with, I mean proper teammates. They should be able to revive you when you're incapacitated. Since there are big dinosaurs you'll trying to avoid them with your jetpack and you'll freak out for a moment since you don't know whether the Spinosaurus or Tyrannosaurus Rex can reach you or not when you're in the air!  If Spiral Game Studio is reading this - Please consider supporting Steam Workshop!  Peace.
4983	1	a	The metascore may leads to misunderstandings. It's not a very good game but at least not bad. i play in a lobby and it's really fun. it's exciting and some kind of interesting but still lots of problems  such as this game has the worst music ive ever heard and this game need more test. Anyway highly recommend if it is on 1 usd again.
4985	1	a	This buggy game is actually pretty fun when playing with friends!  This has a 5 player co-op.  i find the original price to be too high, I think this game should be around $5.00.  However, me and a lot of my friends only paid $1.00.Worth every penny. :D
4987	1	a	Great fun with friends :D
4989	1	a	If you didn't get this game when it was a dollar you really missed out. Honestly, i would have been more than happy to pay the full $15 for it. i put off actually loading this game and trying because of the low, low meta score, but you need to ignore the **** outta that number until they re-evaluate this gem. I reminds me of halo 1 charcter, vehicle and world design but on a much bigger bigger scale and more polish. it has a solid perk and weapon purchase sytem in game and a meta loadout your unlocking those same perks for you to use in matchmaking. and too top it all of ive hardly experienced any framerate drops, but ive been playing on med graphics when alone and low when online. All in all, on of the best multiplayer games if your lookin to have fun with a group of friends.
4991	1	a	A game so bad, it's good.  I bought a four pack of this for â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and giggles when it was on sale (90 cents a pop). Sent it to a couple of buds and started playing. There are so many mediocre elements in this game it's mind boggling.   LOOKS: At a glance the game looks kind of good. Until it starts to move. Animations are laughably bad, with characters running in comic fashion, kicking their heals against their butts as they run. Torso's not moving and turning as if on a swivel. Jumping looks equally terrible, with characters bouncing up into the air without bending their legs to push off. Dinosaurs movement is OK-ish if you do not count the bad AI creating what my friends and I ended up calling, 'Dino-trains'. A conga line of dinosaurs in all shapes and size, being kited across the battlefield as if connected to the player by invisible strings.  GUNPLAY: Weapons in this game are completely bland and unrealistic. From sounds to looks to feel. None of them stand out. Cross-hairs are obtrusive making aiming down site an awful experience. All gun sounds scream stock wav file.  BUGS: So many bugs, weird AI mess-ups, bad design choices (like having to run back and forth between a generator and the weapons caches in horde mode), clipping issues, getting stuck, spawning under the terrain. The list goes on and on.   GAMEMODES: PVP is a joke, with dinosaurs controlling like drunk trucks being driven by blind drivers. Horrible hit detection on their attacks and impossible camera angles making it even worse. There are so many invisible walls and clipping bugs in this game I started to wonder if the devs ever played their own product. Until I killed a dev and got an achievement (which was kind of cool).  This game has one redeemable game-mode, which is Survival (horde mode). This mode is the game's single saving grace. I wasn't expecting anything when I went in, but playing this with a couple of friends is a total blast. The constant upgrades in weaponry and vehicles between waves of enemies and their ever increasing size is just fun. Plain and simple fun.  Would I recommend this? The crazy thing is, yes, yes I would. But only if you can get it for a buck like I did. Spending more on this is just not worth it. Unless you're really into bad B-games and dinosaurs. It is good for a lot of laughs because of the over-the-top badness (is this even a word?), bugs and crazy physics. Survival mode is genuinely fun though. So at least there's that.
4993	1	a	Ok, so the graphics aren't jaw-dropping and there are so many bugs with the animations, gameplay and pretty much everything else...but this game is awesome. Because it is just plain fun - there is no mind-boggling depth to it, it's not all srs bznz and you can genuinely have a laugh and just enjoy the ride. Even if you're a filthy casual, like me, you can jump right in with those who are a much higher level and not feel out of your depth or unable to get stuck into killing compys, taunting T-Rexes (or should that be rexi?) and punching pterodactyls in the face.  Because if this were real life, you would TOTALLY punch a pterodactyl in the face. Admit it.
4995	1	a	There're dinosaurs in this game.
4997	1	a	Although I can barely handle this game on Low graphics, this game still looks good. The gameplay itself on the other hand, is AMAZING! I can see why they recommend a 6-core processor though xD
4999	1	a	Can kill T-Rex with mech.  10/10 Game of the Year  On a more serious note:  This game is incredibly underrated. I've played several hours of the survival mode alone, and it has been some of the most fun I've ever had in video games. The gun's models are well done, but are few in number. The game runs like butter and has crashed only once after a couple hours of gameplay. The dinosaurs models and animations aren't cringe-worthy. The combat is fluid, but some of the mechanics are questionable (Specifically the fight-to-survive mechanic). The graphics aren't anything revolutionary, but don't take away from the experience. The rounds in survival do, however, need a ready-up function to bypass the minute wait time in between waves.  I payed $0.99 for this game and had a better experience with it than I have with most AAA shooters selling for 60 dollars.  8/10, highly recommend.
5001	1	a	Good, fun, addictive game, great to mp with mates
5003	1	a	Pretty good game if you happened to get in on the huge sale, other than that i couldn't rec @ 15$. Controls are below average, weapons are about average, gameplay is maybe a little below average, graphics are poor, concept is pretty badass!
5005	1	a	Very fun, it has some server problems but it is evolving.
5007	1	a	Its a fun game and totally worth $1 i say get it and just enjoy the fruits
5009	1	a	You can kill a T-rex with a lightsabre.  10/10
5011	1	a	This game is just awesome!! The game is very fun to play with your friends! :D
5013	1	a	Woooooow...  A dollar well spent on the most ridiculous adaption of (Halo's) Firefight mode I've ever played. It's like a cross of Firefight, Planetside 2, and Dinosaurs. If you have a dollar that you don't know how exactly you want to spend, use it to buy this.   Best played while you're high on something. Seriously.
5015	1	a	this game is like an arcade game from the mid 90's that you played once and forgot because you played MK2 for so long afterwords and wished you had that quarter back.
5017	1	a	 Guys, buy it now . You won't regret it. Dino Horde , a.k.a. Futurist Killing floor with dinosaurs and vehicules, is a nice fun source. Step 1: Buy the 4-pack Step 2 : Give copies Step 3: Have fun !
5019	1	a	The game is incredible, it have a lot of dinos to kill :)  Pros: Have multiple classes ( assault, support and recon ) Have multiple game types ( survival, conquest, duel and so on .... ) Have multiple vehicles ( car, jet, tank, APC and so on ..... ) And ofc the game is constantly evolving ( char-class lvl and the game it self )  Cons: few minor glitches needs menu interface polish :)  overall - 7,5/10 ( at least )
5021	1	a	Orion Dino Horde, is basically HALOXKILLERDINOSAURSXGOODGAME. The game is fast paced with a couple ways to play. Three classes: Assault (Can Fly), Support (MEDIC!), and that one sexy female class that can go invisible. With rounds of dinos and lots of guns to play with, what could go wrong?
5023	1	a	Amazing textures ... gotta get ur self indulge in it if u try this game
5025	1	a	This is my first review, and I'm only writing it because of the low metascore that is highly inaccruate. If you like to shoot at dinosaurs and fly around with jetpacks, this is the game for you. Enough said.
746	0	a	This game is the love child of nazi-zombies and borderlands, except this child has an extra chromosome.
5027	1	a	For $1 I could have done a lot worse. This game is a lot of fun for the price. Yes there are annoying glitches and sometimes crazy lag, I have very muc enjoyed my time playing this game and will log in a lot more hours. Way to make a fun game guys :D
5029	1	a	Theres like dinos and guns and mechs and planes and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
5031	1	a	Best game I ever bought for $0.75
5033	1	a	Imagine playing a version of HALO 2 where you can obliterate raptors with the gun from RoboCop.  That's what it's like playing ORION: Dino Horde.  And I'm okay with this.
5035	1	a	Real fun often you can get this with a discount so be sure to check it out
5037	1	a	I got this for $0.99. 100% worth it. Great game to kill some time with your mates and a lot better than the usual Zombie Horde kind of games.  It's cheap and fun. Why not. Just like a street hooker.
5039	1	a	Game of the year! 10/10 It bearly works. amazing to record!! It's awesome butt ses so it doesn't work so good.
5041	1	a	Great game ^^
5043	1	a	so my reviews are along the lines of 'fu*k this game, 10/10' and this is no different. Wave defense, jetpacks, tanks and dinosaurs, what more could a guy ask for? you get to kill them? YES.    Fu*k this game. 20/10. Seriously.
5045	1	a	It's almost so bad it's good. I wouldn't recommend for solo play, fun with a friend. 10/10 would get stuck in a rock again.
5047	1	a	GET a group of friends All get this game HAVE A BRILLIANT TIME
5049	1	a	this game literally isnt worth any amount of anyones time not even for the price I got it...
5051	1	a	I know Jeff Goldblum and he says that this is the best game where you kill dinos and he is the best person to judge dino games because he is Jeff Goldblum knower of all things dino.    ALL HAIL THE MIGHTY JEFF GOLDBLUM!   Real review: This is the best game ever, I mean having the upgrade stations on one part of a map and atleast 20 seconds apart with a minute to get to them is the best idea for the best game ever.
5053	1	a	Not A Bad Game
5055	1	a	This game is a must buy if you like the early halo series IE 1-3 , if you like jet packs gears of war or dinosaurs. This game started out broken as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ when it first came out and a lot of people got really butt hurt that this game was broken. But guess what they fixed literally every â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing thing people complained about. I bought the game when it was broken and shelved it for a bit and came back after fixes. But this games early community seems to be a bunch of limped dicked â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥es because they still troll this game ..... They have no right to talk â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about this game any more, the dev's truly made a cult classic out of this one and if your still upset about this game then it is time to move on it is great now stop living in the past.   This game is and will forever be one of my favorites not only because Dinos + jet packs + mechs with a Halo 2 meets gears look about it. But because the devs kicked â™¥â™¥â™¥ and took a broken game they could have abandoned, and really polished the hell out of it. I have bought not just one copy but at least 10 so far because it is an amazing game to play with friends . Takes me back to when I use to do LAN parties as a kid :D  Do yourself a favor hop on and enjoy.
5057	1	a	This is a game that cost me $1. Simply the best dollar I've ever spent in my life.
5059	1	a	It's like call of duty meets dinosaurs.. but not exactly. It's really fun and addicting!
747	0	a	Play this if you hate yourself... and dinosaurs!
5061	1	a	why do you keep changing the name?
5063	1	a	This is the most fun you can have for $1.
5065	1	a	great game 
5067	1	a	this is a pretty good game, i give it 10/10 would recommend to my friends and family and would play 24/7 to save the little black people from Kony 2012
5069	1	a	Those who critisize this game do not really get deep into the gameplay. I personally like this game very much. You can experience a different type of FPS game by killing dinos with friends (and the multiplayer game is quite smooth). And you know what, this game costs only 1 dollar (and is even cheaper when you buy a 4-pack). Please don't compare this game with other which costs you more than 20 dollar!
5071	1	a	Metacritic rating is very misleading. This game is quite fun: lots of guns, perks, and powerups to buy in each individual map, as well as a leveling system that applies permanent passive bonuses.
5073	1	a	This game is great, i picked it up for the $0.99 sale. It is a fun game, it does need server work and i think there should be a TDM type mode as to where 2 teams battle it out, but also have to watch for dino's.  the graphic system does need an upgrade, it is a great looking game but it can be better, the menu needs an overhaul as well, the store items and character loadout is really pixeled and not clear.  The game has potential, and i see that there is another update coming this year, for a change of it to be orion: prelude with new maps, characters, menu, game modes ect. i hope graphics and dedicated servers are in it as well. Maybe more players in each game as well. But while this game is on sale id reccomend it, you cannot go wrong for $0.99
5075	1	a	I have given this game 2 reviews already but i kept coming back after the updates, the last update did this game justice, Spiral Games finally stepped up and listened to their fans and players. At first i did like the game, nice concept but then after they redid it, the optimization and performance was awful, and when i mean awful. The animations were just sad, i mean the way the raptors *chomped* on you was too odd and sad. It looked like someone eating cereal while having a stroke. But after the recent update this is what i must say.  1. The performance has been hugely improved, i can now play at 60 FPS without my pc tanking it.  2. The visuals have improved greatly, Dynamic Lights have been given a meaning however being annoying sometimes.  3. The animations have improved slightly, they still look clunky, specially the spino's, when theirs too many raptors it starts to breakdance lol, it looks funny but it could be improved.  Overall the game is actually enjoyable now, just becareful on joining a server where the host is from another country, you WILL lagg. This has to be fixed ASAP. Fun gameplay, great weapons (specially the bow, my god that bow is fun) and thank you for listening Spiral Games.   7/10 Fun, Great concept, Killing dinos with a bow while using a jetpack trying to avoid being eating while not dropping to a pool of raptors is enjoyable now.
5077	1	a	Great graphics and yet terrible graphics, but it is one of the most fun games to play with friends, up to 10 people at the same time.
5079	1	a	Amazing game! Love the graphics!
5081	1	a	Light and fun gameplay.
5083	1	a	Firtst off all Outstanding... Met score WTF this game is amazing why would anyone not want this game.. if you think about getting it.... wait why the F*** are you THINKING about getting this game. If your PC can run it get it! :) Here is a list of postitive things. 1) So Addicting  2) Great Game to play with family and friends 3) Great Open World DINO MURDER HELL YEAA!  Here are some negitives 1)Sometimes when you kill a big dino such as a spinosaurus it may crash, this has only happend to my twice and has only happened because my pc is a load of A hole. 2)Animations could be improved (But who cares right?) 3) In game Purchases, such as spiral points that I wish you could earn by leveling up. WHYYY.  Thats it! I rate it... 8/10 (Still some flaws; such as animations and in game purchases.) Addictive rating: REALLY GOD DAMN HIGH!  I love this game hope you do too :) Bye!
5085	1	a	Game is actually better than Call of Duty, less hackers , even not really possible to find one. Great Graphics, better animations than CoD, good Rainy Weather, even COD doesnt have that one. Good gameplay, enjoyable game with Friends over COOP.  Able to make lobby, not paytowin game , easy to play.
5087	1	a	llol i shoot a terex an it kill but i die cuz herbivore???
5089	1	a	The Bestest First and Only Dianasour Game! keep the great work Spiral!  9.8/10  EDIT (8/26/2014): Since Orion: Prelude is out Thank god i already bought the Orion Dino: Horde Because i diden't have to Repurchase  Rate again : 10/10
5091	1	a	Really fun, especially when played with friends
5093	1	a	well well, let me see... after a long break i have returned to Orion: Dino Horde .. it's fun.. with the right people, the job get's done easily..   do note, if you're planning on hosting a game, have a powerfull CPU.. a 4-core core2 series cpu won't do the job in later rounds..
5095	1	a	Just like battlefield with dinosaurs. 'It's okay 11/10' - IGN
5097	1	a	Ignore the metascore review, its wrong. This game is stupidly fun and you find yourself playing it over and over again with friends. This game is simply fun, if you're looking deeper into this gane welp, then you're not even trying to have fun. It's simple, it's fun and enjoyable and a good game overall. It's like 10 bucks too, just buy it.
5099	1	a	drove my friend into a t-rex 10/10
5101	1	a	Very good game. Metacritic scores are misleading.
5103	1	a	It's a decent game i guess. A little bit of bugs and other stuff but it's ok. :3
5105	1	a	I wish my T-Rex would evolve and get himself an automatic weapon but I guess throwing rocks will have to do. Fun game for a buck and young kiddies like it too. No complaints but hopefully with the next update the raptors will finally get jetpacks...eating guys in space suits sure beats licking tacks.
5107	1	a	at $0.99 I have already enjoyed this game tremendously for what I spent. Only have 2hrs in at the moment, but those were a couple of really fun hours for me and my buddies. This game has some terrible reviews, but I think it has come a long way since those reviews. Bottom line, this is a good game for its price, and a GREAT game for its current sale price.
5109	1	a	I haven't play'd this game since some of the most, most recent updates as an fyi. When my friends ask me about this game i tell them that this game is buggy and if you come into the game as a try hard wanting to beat it on the hardest difficulty this isn't the game for you. however if you come in with friends and just F around you will have one of the funest experiences of your life.  10/10 Best Simulator for Driving off cliffs in a Truck full of teammates
5111	1	a	Ran over 10 velociraptors with jetbike and, got stuck on a tree branch and killed 10 more with nuclear revolver. 10/10
5113	1	a	I'm surprised. This is actually a fun game. Is it a KF replacement? No, but it will give you hours of fun. And you can't beat the price.
5115	1	a	ok so i bought this game for 99 cents when it was on sale and i will admit it was probably the best 99 cents i have spent recently. the game is pretty fun i mean there are a few small things that i think could be a little better but overal the game is a great time killer and it has the potencial to be really fun if you have a good group of friends to play with. i personally wouldnt spend full price on it though even though it is fun there isnt much content its just another multi-player shooter. but next time it is on a steam sale i say get it for sure
5117	1	a	Given the massive sale that is going on right now it warrants a look at only $1. The score given by Metacritic is wrong. The game is a polished FPS that is continually getting updated. Fast paced survival action is what gets it for me. Nothing seems to over powered or useless, and there are many different styles to choose from, and routs to take. I am looking forward to see where they take this game in the future and I am gad I can be along for the ride.
5119	1	a	Wow, simply fantastic. I've persoanlly been searching for a good Dinosaur game for a while now, and all have been sub-par. All until now, that is. This game is the most exhilirating, most intense, hardcore dinosaur game I have ever played. I would a hundred dollars for this game, but this game is a fraction of the price, making it a must buy, 11/10 would reccomend
5121	1	a	Besides it being terribly hilarious, Dino Horde is really all I thought it was going to be. For only being able to play durring the free weekend, I was able to get a taste of something fun. Something that makes me laugh at it's simplicity, yet how amazingly fun it is. Best played with friends, this game is able to showcase just about everything it shows in the videos. It's a defense, survival, pvp/pve that does hearken to Halo, Killing Floor, and Jurassic Park as well. Though it goes beyond that into amazing maps, survival games, and even gives the players chances to get back at their friends in a multiplayer deathmatch.  It is a ton of fun, though I would say wait for a sale to get this. It's not exactly worth fifteen dollars in my mind, since there were bugs, but what game is without flaws? If you got it when it was a dollar, then hopefully you got your money's worth. This is most definitely worth the time for friends who want to have some co-op madness with dinosaurs and guns and mechs and always wanting to punch dinos in the face. That's always fun. :3
5123	1	a	Fun and great to play with friends
5125	1	a	My first experience of the game went something like this:  Waste loads of money on deciding which pistol I want (whilst not realising I can get a primary or secondary) Clicking more times that I ever have before in a panic to kill the dinos Hardly knowing what to do Dying within minutes 10/10 Would do again  If you didn't gather, my first experience was freaking amazing and I really found it enjoyable. I absolutely love it.
5127	1	a	You know what they say... 'it has swig'  #ND2013
5129	1	a	I'll be honest here I thought this game was gonna be a cheese buy like the game Bad Rats.  But honestly this game is a load of fun even by yourself.  I mean who doesn't love killing dinosaurs with guns?!  Also this game is super fun with friend's so bring them along as well!
5131	1	a	Love this game!
5133	1	a	It's an okey FPS game. But it gets boring after a while.
5135	1	a	Fun and addicting shooter. Worth a try.
5137	1	a	Purchased the game watching the videos. It looked like alot of fun. But then a saw that it had such a low metascore... i then thought dumb for buying a game that has a low metascore.. i shook it off and started the game. I loved it!! its alot of fun with friends. by yourself it can get hard. I recommend this game only if you have friends to play it with! 8/10
5139	1	a	I stabbed a T-Rex in the face with a sword. 10/10
748	0	a	99c? Not worth it. Atleast I saved 14$ with the sale. After it I bought 14 packs of sour skittles with the other 14$ I burnt my mouth. That experience was better than this game. The game -1/10 the skittles 11/10.
5141	1	a	Although the animations are eh, and the movement is kinda laggy/jittery-ish, it's still a pretty fun game to play with friends. I had fun playing it :D
5143	1	a	You can shoot a Tyrannosaurus with a lazer shotgun while flying with a jetpack... WHAT ELSE DO YOU PEOPLE WANT?!?! In all seriousness, I got this game on sale for 0.99$, (which it goes down to rather often) and I thought it was completely worth the price. At full price, I'd try to check out the game somewhere else first to see if you like it, but it's definitely worth a look. It has quite a few fun modes, and the gameplay is fast paced and fun. One of my few critiques though is while there is class variety (A soldier who can fly, a medic who heals, and a spy who can cloak) The distiction doesn't show up that much, and they're basically interchangable classes (So it's best to pick the one who can fly). Overall, a reccomendation to look at it, because you'll probably like it. It involves shooting hordes of dinosaurs while flying in a jetpack. Sometimes you can stab them with a lazer katana.
5145	1	a	Guys this is a great laugh........ give it a try!
5147	1	a	Very fun time killer with friends.
5149	1	a	Don't trust the metacritic score, this game went through several mayor changes, and the score is based on a much older version. This game is amazingly fun to play with a bunch of friends, and extremely diverse too. You can cloak yourself to escape from a T-rex, get enough distance in a suped-up helicopter and unleash hell on this dino by means of overpowered laser rifle! Leveling up earns you cool rewards, and so does unlocking achievements. For this current price, buy the 4-pack and blast some dinos to bits.  There are enough game-modes to keep you entertained for days and enough maps and difficulty settings to challenge your strengths. You can even open up a vast world and conquer it completely, provided you don't die in the process. Seriously, this game is top, recommended out the wazoo!
5151	1	a	This is a very silly game, for very silly people. All of this is in my opinion, keep in mind.  Graphics: Lovely Fun to be had: Lots Punching of the dino faces: Rediculously fun  I've had one game crash when I joined the server so far, so keep in mind this could be a problem,  but you can easily host your own public (Or friends-only) server in-game without third party software or paying,  which is a plus in my book.  It's Â£1, buy it, do it now (This only applies to the sale this review was written on, and possibly any future sales), although, for the full price of Â£12, I would find it a bit hard to recommend, but something to keep your eye on.
5153	1	a	What BF3-4 Dinosaurs should be!
5155	1	a	I got this game out of the blue thanks to the steam sale. And if it wasn't for that I wouldn't of found it. This game is awesome period, its player movements are nice and smooth and the dinosaurs give the game a different feel. The weapons are great and nicely balanced so far. If this game goes on sale again I recommend buying it. Its a rather fun game to play.
5157	1	a	When dinosuars existed they shot guns at them just like this.
749	0	a	This game is awful. Now I know what you're gonna say, 'How is it bad if you played it for less than an hour?' That's true, but it is extremely laggy, god-awful with a controller, and graphics are terrible.
5159	1	a	This game is far the best dinosaur game i've been played, a good game to play with your friends.
5161	1	a	not historically accurate, stegosauruses (stegosauri) were pacifists and did not partake in violence.
5163	1	a	controls are confusing, and it lags SOOOOOOOOO much for meh, but i dont dislike it. its really laggy, but i enjoy it...
750	0	a	Bad Game, worst Server Browser. Canr recommand this Game to anyone.
5165	1	a	Three words. Guns. Dinosaurs. Kill. 10/10 - IlumminatiGN
5167	1	a	Best $0.99 I've spent on Steam 10/10 would quickscope a T-Rex again
5169	1	a	Extremly repetitive, but strangely addicting. Small range of weps, OP upgrades, 3 classes with different skills to use... It kind of reminds me MVM on TF2. Jump right into the game and hope to meet the nice side of the game's community that will actually teach you things, because there isn't a tutorial. (Or study at the control part of options.) Overall, 7.5 out of 10. (And for 0.99, well, it's alright.)
5171	1	a	This game suprised me, I hate FPS games but being able to play as dinosaurs really drew me in.   Dislikes, The tutorial or starting play to me is garbage. Besides that its more fun with friends. way better then the lets play videos when it first came out.
5173	1	a	donno if its just me but its super laggy, can't see the dinos or anything else. I also played it on a friends PC and was great   9/10 great game
5175	1	a	It's mindless fun. The game takes itself more seriously than it actually is and tries to be over-the-top awesome which is quite hilarious. :D  The developer's good 'track record' makes me very optimistic about the game's future because they turned a complete wreck (Dino Beatdown) into a decent game and promise to refine it in the future, not very typical of todays small - and big - developers.  It is worth the original 10,99E in my opinion while for others it may not, but if it's on sale be sure to give it a whirl.
5177	1	a	You shoot dinosaurs. With guns. Also, Jetpacks. Win.
5179	1	a	Wow i can write a rewiev for a game i doesnt have(Yet)  10/10 Not IGN
5181	1	a	BEST 0.99 CENT GAME EVER!  8 minutes ingame and already lovin it! A must get for all shooter fans!
5183	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it, don't need many words, one of the best games i've ever played, i've been going back to origins since games do bore me alot nowadays and when i tried this game (without any prior knowledge of it's existence) it was such a wonderful experience i can't wait to play it again every time i come home, just try it, don't bother with the reviews, TRY IT!
5185	1	a	10/10
5187	1	a	its good 
5189	1	a	A fun FPS that has basic FPS things (mainly stealing mechanics from Halo) but has it's own superior uniqueness.
5191	1	a	It made me â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ upon myself
5193	1	a	like halo and wave defense had a baby, that had a pet dinosaur, that tried to eat the baby, too far?
5195	1	a	I've had this game for a while and I don't see how it got better... At all... I read reviews that hype it up and saying it got better since it changed its name to Prelude, and I see no change... I only recommend this game because I do still like it, I liked it before and like it now, but I was expecting that it did get better lol.
5197	1	a	Seriously this game is pretty badass. Think Killing Floor but with Dinosaurs. I always wondered what life would be like if I could beat down some velocoraptors with a laser sword and now I now.
5199	1	a	I bought this game when it cost Â£1.99 during a steam sale. Since that moment I can honestly i have never regreted my choice. This now under Â£1 game should not cost that much and i await the moment they put the price up and award themselves for the hard work they have obviously put into this. Would happily play Â£10 for this game as it is worth it. To any others that are looking at the game BUY IT NOW before they do what they should and make it cost more. Easily better than games such as Call of Duty and battlefield, It just needs more players and a wider community which it deserves
5201	1	a	I have to say that for 1$ is a really good game... And I REALLY mean it when I say that is a good game, considering you just spend the grosseries change on 1.5 GBs of pure FUN...  And I'm serious when I say that you have to give it a try! And let's be honest, at the beggining, everything looks blurry and you don't understand pretty much anything about the game, but after 2 hours this FPS becomes very promising! The game modes, the dinos, the weapons, skills and stores are fabulous!  You won't get dissapointed.
5203	1	a	This game is awesome... best FPS I've seen in a while.
5205	1	a	Slaying dino never felt so good.  The graphics is not so good but not so bad (1$ game, what you expect ?!). It is fun, it co-op, ROTFL mode on with this game. And 4-pack ? this game should consider 15-Pack. This game was way more fun if you played it with your close friend in the same room.
751	0	a	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxtPRF6NG7I 
5207	1	a	If your looking for a game to chill with this is one of my favourites. Well worth buying when its oin sale :D 
5209	1	a	The reviews are very misleading as they were reviewing a dfferent game... This game is pretty fun and right now its only a dollar so grab it and have fun with some friends
5211	1	a	I just threw a grenade down the throat of a T-rex that was trying to eat me. Need I say more?   Well I'm going to anyway. The graphics are very clean and play is very smooth. I can't even describe the feeling of taking down multiple large dinos with teammates and the satisfaction of learning how to use the classes well (I still love Assault the best, if only for the jetpack).  If you like co-op FPS survival games like Killing floor (and to some extent the L4D line), you will love this game. By my 2nd day playing the devs had even had an event, so I know they are involved with community. As usual a good group will go a long way toward you enjoying your playtime, so I definitely recomend getting a few friends to play with you.   I can't speak to the PvP element yet because I prefer Co-Op but I've enjoyed the Co-op play so much that I'm definitely going to check the PvP out and that is something I'm not normally drawn to very often.
5213	1	a	you get to fly around with jetpacks and shoot dinosaurs. what more could you want in a game? 11/10 would bang
5215	1	a	This game is total â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
5217	1	a	Killing floor with dinos and other game modes 10/10
5219	1	a	If you have buddies its alot of fun and a good time. but i wouldent recomend it to solo players. 
5221	1	a	subpar in just about every way, and poorly optimized. BUT has some interesting ideas and innovative mechanics which you rarely see in an fps. id love to see this one picked up by a major studio but only if it would stay faithful to the original concept and gameplay quirks. like everyone else has said, its way more fun than it ought to be, and its only 99c!
5223	1	a	Good for a 99c price
5225	1	a	With the gun style of Borderlands and the HUD style of Halo that makes this perfect. And you kill dinosaurs. DINOSAURS! How can you not find 99 cents for this game! Within 10 minutes of starting my first game, my friend and I were in tears because of how much fun this game is. 10/10
5227	1	a	This is definitely a fun game. Easy to learn after about 15 minutes of messing with everything that you have access to. The best weapons are late in the game so you'll have to be patient with pea-shooters. Each weapon does have its own unique set of characteristics but overall, I have quenched my thirst for killing dinosaurs - like no other game can! Thanks N!N and the Orion dev team(s)!
5229	1	a	Really good game. This game has been driven into failure because of it's previous title ORION: Dino Beatdown, but Dino Horde is different, and it is a whole new, exiting and amazing overall game. Completely worth my 15 bucks.
5231	1	a	I bought this game for 39 pence simply to extend my library and to have something to entertain me for about 20 minutes. What acctually happened was I spent 80 minutes having one of the most fun experiences in multiplayer gaming. The people I played with were extremley fun and helpful, no trolls or spams or anything like that. I only played the game with strangers but I imagine there is also more fun to be had with freinds. I'm about to find out actually, I just bought this game for three of my friends and we are going to paly it to death.  If I was to give this game a score out of 10 so far it would be an 8. I was happily surprised by this game.
5233	1	a	A fun little game which doesn't really feel like it's that much special but it's a great game to play for a few hours with a bunch of pals.
5235	1	a	this game is great
5237	1	a	I have no idea why did it take me so long to adore this game. Maybe it's the weird Metacritic score or some bad reviews from random people. I tried the game during free promo weekends and was all like: 'Meh, I'd better play some Killing Floor'. Now, I make a statement that this game is really fun. TONS of play modes, plenty lots of weapons and enemies. I won't say that this is a co-op game where you shoot dinos and stuff. It's all about how YOU play it. Deathmatch, Survival, Rampage, CTF. Weather changes, heavy rain and night time make you almost blind, your FOV can be frozen if you play in Arctic maps. Too much to say. You should really give this game a try? The most I like about it is that you level up. You gain additional damage, guns, ammo capacities and stuff. Buy it! P.S. You can 'arrow to the knee' a T-REX and build turrets! :D P.P.S. You know what would make this game hell? A FLYING BOSS DINO!
5239	1	a	ORION: Prelude is super glitchy and half-â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥... but for some reason, it's really fun. It was $0.99 when I bought it... perfectly priced.   Buy a copy for each of your friends, have a stupid amount of fun playing with them and laughing at the game... don't ever play it again and still feel like it was money well spent.
5241	1	a	Deserves a lot more love!
5243	1	a	great game for a low price, although animations and graphics are a bit low quaility
5245	1	a	ORION: Prelude is a game for every dinosaur lover, star wars fan, jurassic park fan or a Halo fan. I recommend it to everyone of those people from the list above! My rating for this game is 10/10. Keep up the good work!
5247	1	a	Great game
5249	1	a	54 cents Hour Download Instant Regret. 11/10 Not Halo
5251	1	a	wow nc game price soo low many vehicles weapons to test and a tough game evry one should buy it i will give 9.5/10
5253	1	a	Where is the Donate button?
5255	1	a	It's cheap, decent and almost always on sale. If you've got a dollor to spare have fun.
753	0	a	10/10 would not play even if it had a naked super model at the end
5257	1	a	Shootin dinos is fun. Nuff said.
5259	1	a	T-Rex throws machineguncar on hill, machineguncar not reachable for enemies and can kill all 20/10
5261	1	a	Its a very good game but at my PC lags. Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-3240T CPU 2.90 GHz RAM: 4 GB and on board GPU. Is this normal to happen? I play games with higher system requirtments and they dont lag at low settings.
5263	1	a	This is a great game if iÂ´m bored with tf2 and cs:go...And for just a buck
5265	1	a	Not a bad Dinosaur Horde Survival game, but for $1, its a steal of a game! Definitely get it, since its one buck.
5267	1	a	This games just â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed.
5269	1	a	Theres...Dinosaurs
5271	1	a	This game somehow makes many old concepts work together and feel new and innovative. It's a whimsical kind of awesome; you can fly around with a motherâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing lightsaber fighting a T-Rex.
5273	1	a	Great Game for only $1
5275	1	a	Cheap and pretty fun. It's a win-win.
5277	1	a	ORION: Prelude is great horde game. It is really unique style. I absolutly recomend it!
755	0	a	Here is what we have learned from this game: Dinosaurs and Killing Floor do not mix. At all. They just don't. The people who think this game is good are lying to themselves. If you check the public multiplayer servers, there are many. Many barren, unused servers. It took one try for my friends to find the game that I had joined through the server list. That is not what I want in the game. Neither is a dinosaur Killing Floor knockoff. I guess that's what I asked for when I bought this game for a dollar. Yeah, don't buy it. Save your dollar.
5279	1	a	This is the type of game you mess around in with your friends.
5281	1	a	It's fun. Pure, simple fun and the developers are really cool guys whose devotion really payed off.
5283	1	a	Still not sure what this is a prelude to. 9/10
5285	1	a	When I first got it, I thought this game was crap. Then I realised that my computer was crap. The game was too pretty for me and my computer wasn't happy about it. So really, that's good. But survival wasn't doing it for me. AI weren't all that great, and I didn't know what to do. Then I played rampage mode. DANG. I'm a human. And some guy playing just ate me. LOL. I mix things up and play as a Spinosaurus. And I ate people. And it was AWESOME. Then I finally got somewhere in survival and I found a tank. And shot a Stegosaurus. And a T-Rex. And I wrecked dino-face. So glorious. Bought a 4-pack, and I'm looking forward to eating my friends while they try to kill me with puny guns. Not a great game, but it's great fun. I'd recommend this for $15 dollars. All the way. IT GOT BETTER.
5287	1	a	Your character spouts nonsense about pizza while your friend shoots dinos while in a giant mech. Out of room in the truck? Just run into your friend and take him along with you.  10/10 Bring me some pizza
5289	1	a	i punched a T-rex in the balls  10/10  would punch again
5291	1	a	First person shooter game sets in Dinosaur survival cooperative, big maps setting, survival mode waves with few objectives task to finish it. Killing dinosaurs to earn credits, you can buy upgrades, weapons or items. There a three class in this game, Assault, Support and Recon. The Assault has the ability to use his jetpack to easily escape from the dinosaurs as well going through unpassable obstacles. The Support has the ability to heal his teammates and also can heal himself and perhaps can act as a tank in the group, the last and finally. The Recon is my favorite class since the ability itself can cloak invinsibility to save herself in the trouble or revive her teammates, i also forgot to mention. There are alot of maps, game modes, etc.   I bought this game and i really enjoyed alot, even though there are minor bugs. They will always fixed the bugs and go for the updates, i highly appreciated of what the developers did because they listen to the community players. Take note that this is an Indie Game and its actually a small company who made this game. Some old low reviews came from Orion: Dino beatdown predecessor so there are lots of changes in the gameplay.  Rated: 8.7/10
5293	1	a	I've never been much of a fan of Shooters, but this game keeps bringing me back for more. Have you ever played a game where you can shoot dinos with a powerful array of weapons, or been able to kill a T-Rex by punching it in the face? Well, despite Sally more likely to end up eating you whole, this game has that, and so much more. It may lack the story that Guardians of Orion has, but nothing's as good at relieving tension than running through Prehistoric mode solo, as you can set enemy damage, health, large and small dinosaur ratios, starting credits, and credit drop rate to become a dinosaur killing machine, easily going on a 6 hour spree without even realizing how much time has passed. For just a dollar you can get so much fun out of this gem of a game, so I recommend it to anyone willing to give it a chance.
5295	1	a	Like halo... with dinosaurs very good and fun
5297	1	a	ok its food for the first 4 hours then you start to realize that it is way too damn easy. that makes it bad. the controls for the vehicles are annoying, i mean who does the borderlands controls like they suck... i want to press 'a' or 'd' to turn not move my mouse... the game really does suck â™¥â™¥â™¥ though. though it is fun if you like that kind of game.  now i will say it is fun, i will say it is intresting, i will say it is worth the buck you pay for it, and i will say that if you have enough cards to sell, sell them and get this game. its bad but not for the price and the enjoyment you can get out of it.   will i play it again? yeah at some point is it worth my money? yeah it is... it's only a buck. is it worth playing? depends how bad are you at Modern Warfare...   this game is fun it is easy but hard at the same time, while i can survive multiple rounds (like 15) in Modern Warfare's servival mode, i only survive at most 5 in this game. but the shear size of the waves is rediculous. they get hard fast... but well sitting ontop of a rock and snipting the heck out of a few hundred dino's with a 75% acuracy rate... is rediculous. heck i think i am about 80 or 90 witht the top tier sniper... that isn't that hard to get. i can bearly hit the broad side of a barn in modern warfare when i snipe, yet along headshots are rare. in this game... you can pick up the sniper and head shot alot of dinos verry easilly. there are times you will run out of ammo before you miss a shot. large targets i guess...  lets now talk vehicles... they suck. getting them sucks even worse and well when you have to use an emp to access them... that is bad. intresting but bad.  i'm getting a little ranty so let me say the bottom line.  SHOULD YOU BUY THIS GAME?  Yeah. you should. play if for 4 hours then realize it isn't much of a challenge. yes it is fun, and i would recomend this if you have a buck to spare.
5299	1	a	Fun for while. Jokes for a while. Id reccomend of youre bored. 10/bored
5301	1	a	Like jurassic world but with a 10$ budget 10/10 would play again
5303	1	a	I got an achievement for being eaten. 10/10
5305	1	a	This game is aweosome for a 1 dollar game, great game for if you feel like playing something new but dont feel like spending alot of money
5307	1	a	dinosaurs, lasers, guns, futureristic,lightsabers,jeeps,hover vehicles,and drones what more of a cluster â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ can u ask for  1000/1000-MGN would play again
5309	1	a	I felt like Boba Fett, but except for rebel scum, I was killing dino scum 10/10
5311	1	a	pretty amazing game. i got it for .99 so that makes it even sweeter. good game play great graphics would recomend it to others
5313	1	a	I bought 4 pack of this game with 39 cents. I'd pay more for the fun me and my friends have. Excelent
5315	1	a	Don't listen to the haters. Its 79p for god's sake. You get what your paying for and for the money, with some mates, it's really not that bad.
5317	1	a	Got it on sale for .49 cents. Played for 2 hours and it was a blast. So far that about 25 cents to the hour. 10/10 would give two quarters again to get this game. Don't even think about it, just get it.
5319	1	a	This game is really fun for a cheap game and I enjoy it! stop for looking negative comment you should try it!
5321	1	a	Call of Duty: Dinosaurs  11/10
756	0	a	The worst game I have ever had the displeasure of experiencing. Not even worth the $1 its on sale for.
5323	1	a	Seriously just go buy this..Loads of fun and it's practically free..even in SA..
5325	1	a	You can either get that 2$ chicken pizza burger taco or buy 2 copies of this for you and your friend to shoot dinosaurs (and other prehistoric things not to be racist) for hours on end.     If your hungry you can always become the dinosaur and eat the human, probably tastes better then that chicken pizza burger taco.  I rate 1/1
5327	1	a	This game isn't too bad, and I know I say this with a very low gameplay count, but it isn't THAT bad. I definitely think that this game has improved, although I hadn't played the older versions, hearing it from other players, it seemed to evolve a ton. The developers seem fun, seeing as they called their old game 'the worst game ever', which is always nice to have good developers. I bought the fourpack for my friends, still haven't given all of them away though.  Let's start with the graphics. When I first launched the game, the title screen was okay, and then I joined a game and the graphics seemed a little... strange, not too well done. Then again, I'm used to ARK graphics, which is most likely why. As I went deeper into the game, I ignored the faulty graphics and I think it's still enjoyable.  Onto the gameplay. When I started up the game, I went into a server to see what everything was about. Wow, I never thought I'd be so confused - I went into a random gamemode, chose to play as a Dilo, and had no clue what I was doing. I started spitting everywhere and a human crawled up next to me and blew me up. That was that for that server, so I went into the Survival gamemode with a few other players. Man, that was certainly a plus. The survival gamemode is fun, waves of dinosaurs of all types, and it's decently challenging when you have everyone come after you. It took me about 5 minutes to get the hang of it (which I am a fast learner, sometimes), and all was good. I followed my teammates to see what was going on, shot dinosaurs, killed a pteradon. Overall, the gameplay I've had so far has been decent.  Honestly, this game is good and all, but don't have high hopes. But then again, for $1, the price of a can of coke, this is worth it, definitely. Sure, there may be glitches, the gameplay may be wonky, the dinosaurs kill you every two minutes, but if you manage to look past its faults, Orion: Prelude is a wonderful game. I'd rate it 7/10.
757	0	a	Well, it sucks.
5329	1	a	Well it had more than i wanted and the graphics are epic
5331	1	a	It's not a great game, It's not the game with the best animations, or the best gameplay, It's one of those games which is cheap and sells alot because of the great times you have with your friends blasting dinos.
5333	1	a	I got the game because of the sale and would have payed full price for it, I have a great time playing with my friend and gives off a sense of adrenaline rush that makes it extremely fun.
5335	1	a	10/10 I cried for three whole weeks after I bought the game. This game is litterally my life, shrek is no longer my life this game has become my love as well, sorry shrek. This game has to be the best game ever with the dino blast and the dino chopper all going like 'pew pew pew pew' gotcha! take that you dinosaur scumbags! MURICA NEEDS ITS OIL SOME HOW â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ES. Must say I played for 30hours straight using a bucket to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in and drinking my own â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to survive, was worth it just to finally kill some god damn dinosaur looking â™¥â™¥â™¥ mother â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ers. I lied 20/10 would reccomended beat the hell out of that there call of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥o 3
5337	1	a	please make it for free because it is a very awesome game plz plz plz plz plz plz plz
5339	1	a	its neat.
5341	1	a	Don't listen to the metascore. This game has vastly improved.
5343	1	a	This game is by far one of the best games on steam and can be played for hours on end. nothing says a great game like guns dinosaurs. The fact that you can play it with friends makes it so fun and replayable also with different maps and different gamemodes there is a new adventure ever time. there is so much to be said about this game but to some it up in two words they would be 'Pure Badass'.
5345	1	a	Hello its me, Ive been recomending games like this since black ops 3 to go over everything, For only 1 dollar this game is such a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ steal, BUY IT NOW OR YOU WILL SEE, HOW BLACK OPS 2 IS MW3333333333333333, AND I recomed this game
5347	1	a	Beatdown, beat em up, killem good!. Just watch the skies for the god darn TERRIES! May you jetpack in peace.
5349	1	a	This game is solid. The price is right, even better when I picked it up for 49 cents. If you like shooting things and fighting dinosaurse you will enjoy this game. If you dont, get off my internet.
759	0	a	This game sucks
5351	1	a	I recommend this game for countless reasons   Graphics 10/10 Gameplay 9/10 respect for David Prassel 900000/10
760	0	a	this game is absolute â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
5353	1	a	Wow This game is Really good, it only needs a tune up on the visuals and maybe a couple more classes. and boom HALO for 1 doller+ jurasic park.
5355	1	a	To be honest, the game is far from being perfect. The animations are bad, the bots are dumb and for the first hour in game, you don't really know what's happening. BUT the overall concept is really, really cool. It's just like some guys were sitting together over some beer and then someone said: 'I'd really like to play a game right now, where I can punch some T-Rex on his nose!' And then the second guy said: 'Yeah, and where I can fly a jetpack while shooting rockets!' And the third guy just shouted 'LIGHTSABRES!'. Then they finished their beer and started working. For all of us. Because we all secretly wanted this game.  Even though the result doesn't look as great as they probably hoped, the game works. And goddammit it's so much fun. Buy it. And buy it for your friends too, so you can punch T-Rexes and run over raptors in beach buggies together. It costs less than a beer.
5357	1	a	Billions of great experiences and action in a 1 dollar game! 
5359	1	a	Great game so worth 1 dollar
5361	1	a	Simply the best survival game I've played combat is great and the visual effects are great ! Could add some more weapons and some smother maps to maneuver on that would be more grassy or have more trees in them giving that prehistoric feel ! Playing with friends is easy and great fun... This game deserves a 10/10 from me !
5363	1	a	HIghly recommended for people looking to play team-based games, or just waiting to have fun with friends online.
5365	1	a	I played it once before it was free for a few days i loved it.  What i like :  - You can be a dinosaur and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ up. - You can â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ the dinosaurs and steal theire babies. - Has COOP and Online. - Can pick a few dinosaurs that are funny like the one that suicide bombs. - I like the graphic personally.  What i don't like :  - The fact that it dosn't have alot of players cause IGN rated it bad and same as the other.   I like this game but it has no one.. You could get it at a discount for 50 cents i got it for 73 cents i think. I reccomend it but don't buy it at the moment it dosn't have alot of players i want this game to be Popular again.
5367	1	a	its just awesome plain and simple
5369	1	a	AMAZING GAME! Sometimes you just need some mindless, time-wasting, jet-packing, missile-launching, dino-stabbing carnage. Even better? Get a few friends on a match with you and watch the hours melt away. This game delivers... NOW BRING ME SOME PIZZA!
5371	1	a	'This game feels like the hand of the lord has stroked my genitalia.'
5373	1	a	Orion: Prelude. Where do I start with this game?  Orion: Prelude is an extremely fun experience, especially with friends. Having bought it in the early-ish stages of Orion: Dino Horde (what it was formerly called). I can say this along with everyone else: This game has improved loads since its initial release.  Let's start with the gameplay. Orion: Prelude feels alot like other wave-based survival games, but with dinosaurs. Pretty self explanatory. (There are also PvP gamemodes, but I haven't played them, I just bought this game for the co-op). However, the variety of maps and settings keep this game fresh, especially the fully customizable 'prehistoric' difficulty setting. The open world game mode (conquest) is great, and I still haven't fully explored the open world maps.  The visuals, simply put, are good. It's no Crysis 3, but everything looks really nice. The tasteful lighting and particle effects add to the atmosphere and overall feel of Orion: Prelude. However, the environments and such sometimes clash with the player models (the player models being the ones doing most of the clashing), making the game's graphics look imbalanced at times. Some of the animations are slightly mistimed. None of these are major issues though, and don't really affect the feel of Orion: Prelude. For the price, you just can't get visuals this good.  The soundtrack is excellent. My only complaint in this department is sometimes a song won't play all the way through before switching to another song, and the song-changing seems unrelated to what you are doing in the game.  Orion: Prelude is a great game. It's not without flaws, but I can definitely recommend it. For the price, this is probably the best game you can buy on Steam.
5375	1	a	If you enjoy FPS games and horde action games   Orion: prelude is for you. All you need to know  Kill dinosaurs. Survive. Kill more dinosaurs.
5377	1	a	Great game the Meta score does not do it justice at all!!!
5379	1	a	It's a nice game, but if you dont got a friend to play with, you almost go SOLO. Not too much people playing.  8/10 play again.
5381	1	a	Forget about what all the critics say. This game is suprisingly good fun! It may be buggy and a tad rough around the edges but its very playable and you will have alot of fun with it for sure! So I reconmend you give this game ago!
5383	1	a	This game is created by illuminati My review is 9/11 ( Í¡Â° ÍœÊ– Í¡Â°)  â–‰â–‰â–‰â–‰â–‰â–‰â—¤â”³â—¥â–‰â–‰â–‰â–‰â–‰â–‰ â–‰â–‰â–‰â–‰â–‰â—¤â”³â”»â”³â—¥â–‰â–‰â–‰â–‰â–‰ â–‰â–‰â–‰â–‰â—¤â”³â”»â”³â”»â”³â—¥â–‰â–‰â–‰â–‰  â–‰â–‰â–‰â—¤â”³â”â”³â”â”³â”â”³â—¥â–‰â–‰â–‰  â–‰â–‰â—¤â”³â”ƒâ”ˆâ•°â”â•¯â”ˆâ”ƒâ”³â—¥â–‰â–‰ â–‰â—¤â”³â”»â•°â”â”â”â”â”â•¯â”»â”³â—¥â–‰  â—¤â”³â”»â”³â”»â”³â”»â”³â”»â”³â”»â”³â”»â”³â—¥
5385	1	a	 Fun! Lots of fun and innovation right ahead!   + Awesome concept + Various types of dinosaurs + Alive community as hell + Usually has some good prizes + Lots of game types + Well made vehicles + Awesome potential  - Few and unbalanced classes - Relatively a few weapons - Not very known game - Sometimes you get p!ssed - Suggestions to make a perfect game   PROS   1. Awesome concept  When I first bought the game I thought like  dafuq am I buying? A game with a goal that is to kill dinosaurs? But wait, it's only R$1.50? I'll give it a try . And I liked it! A lot! The concept is fun, the teams have to be organized to survive the hordes of dinosaurs, that come from air or land. Although the graphics are not thaaaat good (they're only ' good ', not ' very god ', but that's not bad). Even though the dino-shooter game category is incresing, Orion is awesome and even if it's cheap it deserves a nice place in that place in that category.   2. Tons of different dinosaurs  The game itself has a lot of different dinosaurs, from different species and with different statuses: some are tank-ish, others are fast, others fly, others are so small that shooting them is way too difficult and etc. That's awesome! Bringing lots of types of dinos is truly a heavy thumbs up to the game, while other games lack in this topic, Orion is an absolutely  win  here.   3 Alive community  The community is alive, differently from other games and the devs are constantly open to discussion or sometimes they start contests or invite people to play with them, isn't that cool? I've seen lots and lots of games  (some good games, acutally)  that are with more than one year without free patches and are only 1,5 or two years in the market. This game's about 2.5 years until today being sold and is being constantly changed.   4. Usually has some good prizes  This topic is strongly related to topic 11, unfortunatedly. But everything has its good and bad sides! The good thing is that I've seen Orion with awesome prizes (85%, 90% off) a lot of times before actually buying it. I bought it with a heavy discount, 90% off if I'm right, and profited very well. It was actually better than a lot of games that I actually paid more and had less fun.   5. Game types  This topic is not as important as it should be since most of the shooter games -related to dinos or not- have this in common but since it's present in Orion it should be pointed, shouldn't it? Like many other games there are lots of game modes PvP, PvE, EvP, etc. It is a positive point so it has to be put here but nothing special.   6. Vehicles!  The vehicle types are cool! There are tanks, jet-motos, mechs, futuristic helicopters, jeeps, mechs and other types! The good things are not the vehicles themselves but the way you can use it. Even if the graphic's not that excellent there's always an animation of getting in and getting out, signal that  at least  the developers tried to make the game the most complete as they could. Other thing is that depending the place you are and enter the car, you can't drive or you can't shoot, that's a complete and wide thinking of placing the player in the most realistic ambient to the game. You can also get up on some vehicles while they're moving and they 'carry' you as long as you're on them. Of course that there are some necessary vehicles missing, like a two people mech and a 2-4 people helicopter but the game they way it is is not that bad :)   7. Awesome potential  Well, what can I say, this topic means it all. Yea, Orion has a huge potential, believe me or not, and it only depends on the developers. The ambient is nice, the dinos are annoying  (well, they're only doing their job, hah) , the vehicles are challenging, there are bosses  (with, let me say, are hard AS HELL to kill)  and a lot of other things that are differential to other games. This game's technically prepared to have any colossal upgrade that can greatly increase it's gaming experience, remember this.   CONS   8. Unbalanced classes  The game can have up to three classes only (assault, spy and medic -you probably know what they all do). But it lacks a LOT of classes, for example at least engineers, tanks, snipers, hunters, scouts, and ninjas/melee-handed  (anyway, call them the way you want)  are missing. Another bad thing is that every weapon is absolutely the same if used by  any  class, with means that, for example, if an assault player uses a machine gun they'll get the same damage output as a medic (which is NOT right, since the assault-dude is focused on hitting while the medic is focused on supporting). That's not right. The game could have at least an upgrade-tree, too, particular to each class. You can see some suggestions at topic 12.   9. Few weapons  The game has too few weapons in my opinion and they're all pretty much the same. They're all ballistic and the game's context is futuristical. Not that the game would need to have futuristical antimatter-weapons or black hole generators or portals, no. But at least some energy short range weapons, maybe some lasers, gauss rifles or 'dino-ECMs'? Maybe...?   10. What is Orion?  The game's not very known, maybe because the gaming industry is way too competitive, maybe because it was re-released twice I think, or even maybe because  the game has poor grades  [www.metacritic.com]  in a lot of sites and was poorly reviewed by a lot of critics (just see their grades). That's odd, I might say. If you see the Steam Store valuations  the game score is 74/100 . Anyway, despite the reason is, the game does not has a very good fame and that keeps pushing it down the gamer community, not only Steam.   11. You usually get â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥  Most of the times when you're playing PvE games at medium difficulty or harder you have huge chances of getting killed, despite of the reason. But the point is that when you die you lose ALL (I repeat, ALL) of your character/weapon upgrades and weapons! FFS! I know the game's not meant to be easy but this kills the game sometimes, it's very common to see players leaving rooms after getting killed, making the survival task way harder than it normally is, unbalancing the game and making sometimes other players leave! If you buy this game be sure this will be a common thing to you!   12. It lacks a lot of good things that could absolutely make it a perfectly success game  The game's awesome but it lacks a lot of things that some other games have that make them more successful as Orion. Let's list them up here  who knows maybe a Spiral developer read them     Classes overhaul : The class system needs to be completely remade. Not that the ones who are in the game are bad, but because they're insufficient to fill all of the gaps the game lacks:[/tr][/tr]    Class  Duty    Assault  Shoot things at a fair range Can fly.    Spy  Master of disguise. Can turn invisible.    Medic  Can heal people up Has a +0.5 HP/sec regeneration aura (10 meters).    Engineers  Like techy stuff Can repair vehicles with his money but earn more money.    Tank-ishes  Have more armor. Better at close-ranged fighting.    Snipers  Snipe!    Hunters  Incredible damage with bows/crossbows. Can smell enemies    Scouts  Poke and run Can run faster with their futuristic armors.    Melee  Awesome damage with swords and knives. Can make enemies bleed!       Campaign    Bigger vehicles   More game modes   Profile passive skills   More dinosaurs! :D  
5387	1	a	Those that bought is game when it was 15 bucks must have felt cheated......I bought is at the price of dirt. Anyway Orion Dino Horde or what its now know as Orion Prelude is a game where you survive hordes of dinos attacking you,its similiar to many zombie games and wave of enemies games so you will enjoy tis if you enjoy those.
5389	1	a	Ruined my life. 'Just one more wave.' 10/10 would bang.
5391	1	a	Its like skyrim with guns 9/10
5393	1	a	Halo Clone [check]   Halo Clone with Dinosaurs [check]  that's all folks, not the best game out there, but for 99cents, its well worth it. Highly Recommend to play it with your friends since the servers, well sucks  6/10
5395	1	a	Reasons why you should get this game 1-dinosaurs 2-multiplayer 3-10/10 fun 
5397	1	a	Just spent two hours on Survival, got a consistent feel going. That.Was.The.Most.Amazing.Game.I.Have.Ever.Played. This game is INSANE. The dev team is out of their minds to make it $1. Buy it now, buy 4 packs like I have, sell it when it gets popular for like $5 lower, make a profit, have fun with friends, heck, the experience is yours to make. Enjoy.
5399	1	a	I Got killed by a T-Rex 11/10
5401	1	a	It all started back in 2014, I got this game because my friends told me to. After playing it for the first time i was addictted and i started seeing the world was boring unless i was playing ORION Dino Horde, my life was centered around it. Ruined my life 10/10
5403	1	a	It's a terrifically fun game that's one dollar and people still feel entitled enough to complain about it on metacritic.  10/10
5405	1	a	What do you when we gain access to a time machine that allows us to go back in time and visit dinosaurs  Why we shoot them of course we want to make them go extinct before the astroid does  6 dinosaurs out of 10 dinosaurs
5407	1	a	I gave this game a yes only because Valve does not give us the option of a 'meh' or 'Decent' option. Let me go through this with you shall i? The game is loads of fun, if you are a fan of Killing Floor you will ADORE this game. If you love the art style of Halo and the feel of Halo you will ADORE this game. If you lik fast paced FPS games like Quake or Doom you will ADORE this game. It is all of these elements rolled into one with an added bonus of awesome DINOSAURS! However, perfection i not with out its hidden flaws.   These flaws have been reported as crashing upon starting the game or even just browsing for servers (wich thankfully i have yet to experiance though apparently it can be fixed by verifying game cache), the gun and other sound effects not loading up or working and finally (the one i am suffering through) Lag. Now there ae two types of lag to this game, regular internet lag (as i have seen most the people on here or the less populated servers you can access for play are foregin in nature IE im American and joining a primarily German server) but then theres graphical lag. This being the lag where you must lower the settings to the lowest or have major slow down. This issue is usually fixed by reducing the screen size but unfortunatly the resolution only gors to 1270x720 and no lower. The only way to truly fix this is if the resolution could go lower making it less of an issue to render and work the PC more. I have resorted to playing in windowed mode on 1270x720 but even then with alll the graphic settings set to low i lag HORRIBLY.   Outside of that tiny lag issue and bugs that can be patched the game is fun and offers hours of enjoyment and is a fun party game for survival mode. Highly recommended of a pick up but i would more or less wait till the bugs are ironed out (i believe the game isn't a full release yet not totally sure)   PICK IT UP AS I AM SURE THE .99c PRICE WILL CHANGE VERY SOON!
5409	1	a	The reviews are right, this game is extremely entertaining! It's a new look to the feels I got from playing L4D2 with friends before.
5411	1	a	whether you're flying a wangus or shooting a t-rex in the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, this game is hella fun with friends
5413	1	a	Okay, so you're probably thinking that this looks like some game for 5 year olds that the devs incorporated guns into. Well, I thought the same exact thing. WELL I WAS WRONG. This game is so much more than that and with the size of the actual game, with the sale going on, I would buy this game for a dollar in a heartbeat. Don't pass up this steal before it's to late. I have not bought it yet but I will make sure I do before the sale ends.
5415	1	a	I really liked this game so much but only two thing in this game need to fix, the sounds always out of sync and weapons need some improvments when shooting the big birds, but i recommended for sure when you play it with your friends its more fun!
5417	1	a	Orion Prelude is fun very fun game overall and the price is even better this game has by my opinnion the best developpers a game can ever want.  I have some slight requests for the devs. :  1. A graphical improvement wouldn't hurt considering the fact that we gamers, in 2015, have powerfull PC's. 2. Character customization system (a bit like the TF2 system but less complicated maybe). 3. Customizable weapons (Scopes, muzzles, etc.)  I know its a big demand but im sure our caring developpers wouldnt mind making huge (maybe) 3 year celebration update with these cool new addons.  Thank you
5419	1	a	Really good for the price. Actually really fun.
5421	1	a	fun coop with friends
5423	1	a	This game was suprisingly really fun. I'm not really scared of dinosaurs,  but I do scream when I see the stegosaurus running towards me. This is a game where it will sneak behind you and grab you and by  the time you look at the time, while you're trying to survive the next wave,  you will already be 3 hours late for work.  Plus- Jetpacks. This game made me see how well jetpacks and dinosaurs go together.
5425	1	a	Pretty good game Pros Weapons Difficulties Gamemodes Dinos Cons Bad graphics  8.3/10
5427	1	a	this game is the best â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ I`ve never played for 0.79â‚¬ and will give u tons of hours of entertaiment
5429	1	a	So addictive, and for the price you can't beat it!
5431	1	a	Recently purchased the 4-pack bundle for my friends and myself - I tried it out this weekend with a friend, it was tons of fun. Absolutely recommend it for play for fun casual gaming and spontaneous LAN-parties.  The full price seems a bit high, but if you can pick it up on sale it's really worth it - especially if you have a few friends to play with! Also, you fight dinos with big guns from a jetpack - what else do you need?!
5433	1	a	8/10. A few bugs, but still really fun.
5435	1	a	this game just has the best 'cost/benefit ratio' a game ever had
5437	1	a	I didnt have much to lose, .74$ for a four pack for me and my friends(sale). I came out with a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing amazing game. it's a little clunky at first but god damn you'll enojoy this game.
5439	1	a	Very adictive Game
5441	1	a	I purchased a 4 pack of this game while it was on sale, not expecting much, but man, was that the best three dollars I ever spent. If I would have purchased this game at the full price, I would still not regret it. This game is loads of fun by yourself, but grab a couple of buds, and it gets just 10x better.If you are debating wether or not to get this game, I would advise you greatly to take $15 out of your wallet and throw it down on this game. Seriously. You won't regret it.
5443	1	a	Love this game. Bought it when it was on sale for .99 cents better than a lot of the 20 dollar games
5445	1	a	Great Game, Countless Hours of fun, only game i could fight a giant crocodile with a mech :)
5447	1	a	9/10 would be 10/10 if it was called orion dino beatdown again
5449	1	a	Best dollar game I have ever bought.
5451	1	a	one of the best dino fps ive ever played :D
5453	1	a	Amazingly well done game. Tons of game modes competitive and co-op with lots and lots of maps for hours of multiplayer fun. Still slightly buggy but I'm confident the developers will be working hard to fix everything. Buy this game!
5455	1	a	Dont believe the meta score for a second. While this game lacks modern texutre graphics, it hugely makes up for it with gameplay. With regular updates, new features, and devs who actually care what the players think, this game is awesome. even at that its a TON of fun.
5457	1	a	One of the games that comes with a ''Buy ME'' tag on. Easy to play and fun FPS.
5459	1	a	i wish i had this game 
5461	1	a	For $0.50 this is the best investment of 50 cents you could ever have. I would gladly pay 10.00 for this beauty of a game. Lots of replayabilitiy, good for wasting time with friends.  I love it.
5463	1	a	You shoot dinosaurs   175/10
5465	1	a	Worth the money! You can kill dinosaurs while flying with a jetpack and looking at the great rain effects!  10/10
5467	1	a	i like to shoot the dino and think that the gun is my wiener and i am peeing
5469	1	a	Game is bull shavick. I stood completely still and the T-Rex still saw me.
5471	1	a	I wasn't too interested in this game, but a friend bought a 4-pack for like $3. After playing the game, however, I can say this game is awesome. Its so much fun driving around yelling 'GTA MOTHA â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥AS' while mowing down dinos. Some of the guns feel good to shoot, there are plenty of perks and guns to buy, and some of the maps are HUGE!  Unfortunately, I do have a couple problems with this game. Although there are 3 classes in the game, but I feel it is really neccessary to play the assault, due to the fact that dinos will quicky overwhelm you unless you can jetpack out. Walking around is not really a thing you can do, especially while being attacked from LITERALLY all direction. Also, vehicles can be overpowered (you can disable them though), and some of the gamemodes (that I have played), while fun, seem a bit lacking (too short usually). Some of these probelms may disappear with a larger group though (I've only played with 4), so keep that in mind  Overall, this is a really fun game though. If you think killing dinosaurs or flying around with jetpacks while killing dinosaurs is something you would like to do, then I would reccomend this game, especially if its on sale.  7.5/10
5473	1	a	To be honest it's a crap game. But it was 99c!
5475	1	a	It's buggy - but for $0.99? Why not? The survival gamemode is definitely worth at least that. I have fun with it.
5477	1	a	1 dollars is nothing!!!!!!!!!!!!!this game worth more
5479	1	a	as good as my last joint
5481	1	a	I want My money back
5483	1	a	This game is hilariously bad. The raptors will spawn right next to you and you can kill hordes of them with one clip. It's awkward to shoot because your gun doesn't recoil most of the time and for what ever reason the boss dinosaurs always attacked me. I can say the best part about this game was being grabed by the pteradons.
5485	1	a	Ignore the negative reviews. Its only .49 cents, just buy it and have fun for a couple of hours.
5487	1	a	Good game easy to play with friends
5489	1	a	What the actual â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
5491	1	a	Surprisingly fun game for next to nothing
5493	1	a	For the price, you get a lot more than you pay for, ignoring the awkward animations and weird looking players, a bug here and there, it's a quite fun game specially with friends.
5495	1	a	9/11 would bang
5497	1	a	So I watched like one episode of Sword Art Online 2 and if anyone knows me they know I like sniper rifles as much as I like swords, so I was reading this synopsis of one episode and I got really â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off that they imply the top sniper in an entire extremely competitive gun-based game was less skilled than some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that shows up with a sword, and then my friend tells me about how Kirito is using a sword in a gun game and how that was the class that was apparently treated as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and awful and he's automatically the best at it.  So it made me think of this game because one time I jumped out of an aircraft with a lightsaber and took out a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing t-rex in one hit with it.  *****. Best $1.00 I ever spent on a game.
5499	1	a	This is a game that if a bigger budget was available, it would be amazing! As it stands, it is good. Fun Co-op or Single Player. Great weapons, good dinosaur combat and plenty of ways to customise your map variables (dinosaur health/damage, timers, vehicles, oddly funny extra dinosaur waves). I've been playing since Orion: Dino Horde and I enjoyed that game too. Sure it has bugs and some issues and not amazing visuals compared with $40 Million dollar games, yet it is surprising replayable and trying to get even more XP the next game by using Melee is great! Punch a T-Rex in the head! There are not that many 'Survival' levels which is what I mainly play but still good solid fun. And won't cost much at all! Recommended!
5501	1	a	its not a complete or balanced game, but for a $1 it's fun as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to play with friends. Also it has fire-breathing robot reindeer &amp; a robot santa claus in the santaslair map, how can you not give this a try.
5503	1	a	Got gangbanged by chickens, 10/10
5505	1	a	It's good.       ....For .99 cents.
5507	1	a	Great multiplayer, even though the game's engine isn't very good, its still pretty sweet for the $500+ pc.
5509	1	a	I love it. Sadly we have to have a kickstarter for the Open World versioin and Im broke &gt;.&gt;
5511	1	a	If you like dinosaurs, and you also enjoy slaughtering them, this is your game! 10/10 - IGN
5513	1	a	The game still needs work... like, a lot of work, but it's surprisingly fun, especially to play with friends!  Don't believe the Metacritic score. Buy a couple copies for you and your friends, and you're guaranteed some good times.  Just watch out for those baby dinosaurs. They'll bite your kneecaps off.
5515	1	a	I'm not sure why there is so much hate surrounding this game. It is not bad, and is deffinatly worth the 99 cents i payed. Flawed, but fun.
5517	1	a	Absolute bute game.Ever since the major update buying a 4 pack for $2.99 was a complete steal
5519	1	a	Kill a dinosaur  Kill a dinosaur with friends  Kill many dinosaurs with friends  Kill many dinosaurs with friends while fighting other teams Kill many dinosaurs without friends while fighting everyone in free for all Kill humans as dinosaurs Kill many humans as dinosaurs Kill humans while being a dinosaur who realizes his enemy is in the wrong time frame and who actually should be working together to find a way back to a safe dinosaurless environment rather than killing each other to have a bigger base  Careful for FaZe Rex BTW, he'll rek you with a rock like it's an illcam trickshot 8/10 for $1 7/10 if it was $10
5521	1	a	Fast, fun, and infinitely better with bros
5523	1	a	This game is not the best, not the worst, it may look like an unfinished game, but actually good enough for the price, the metascore is being unfair.  I did not played hardcore enough to make a perfect review, so go check other reviews.  This review is actually neutral, but steam doesn't have that option
5525	1	a	Thosands of Dino's, lot's of guns, good multiplayer, lots of gamemodes (One is almost an open-world kinda thing), 420/10 Fun Game, reccomend to all.    In a Doni-Shell: It's Worth Playing!! (If you have a good PC 'cause this game eats your CPU and Memory more then John Belluci and Cheese)
5527	1	a	This game is one of the most captivating and enjoyable co-op games I have ever played , and what's even better is that it only costs $0.99. I would say that if you have $0.99 to spare, this is the best way to spend it. 
5529	1	a	They should rename the game to 'Orion: Dino Hoe'  Because that's how i felt when i was playing the game.
5531	1	a	When I bought the game like 1 year ago it was really just a piece of buggy junk. I got it for 50 cents in discount so I was't really angry. Yesterday I was looking at my steam library and I found ORION: Prelude. I was kinda confused (the game was originaly named ORION: Dino Horde) so I downloaded it again and Holy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥... They tweaked the game A LOT. It's still the same, same old weapons and vehicles, but it's polished. It really looks like the devs made a lot of improvement to the game. Some previously useless perks are now vital and guns are more responsive. Also, they added flying damage indicators, so you don't have to guess if you hit that one annoying pterodactyle or not. And the best thing is, IT'S FREAKING 79 CENTS!!! It will give you at least few hours of enjoyment and even if not, it's just 79 cents. 8/10
768	0	a	SERIOUSLY? YOU SAY THE BEST GAME EVER? THIS IS A â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING BULL â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥    if you want a REAL GAME of dino buy primal carnage but i don't name that a 'video game' this is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing bull â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
5533	1	a	If you seek a game full of fun and none stop dino hordes then this is your game, ORION: Dino Horde is a great dino survival, it has many gamemodes which are multiplayer and contains fun weapons and viechels. It is an easy game to get into and can be good for tornaments and other activities.
5535	1	a	This game is sweet
5537	1	a	its a great strategy game that you can battle dinosaurs! and beware in the map hell where you randomly fight the pumpkin king. hell map is best for assault as you can use jetpack to get on a cliff and take some potshots at the pumpkin king! good luck dino hunters!!!!
5539	1	a	A well spent Â£0.79 i must say, very good, recommend to everyone who like dino's or shooting so yeah
5541	1	a	Meh..Nothing special.A few servers,and not much people are playing it.The game is fun doe.
5543	1	a	I had to delete my old review, the game is very different now.  My review: it looks like a lot of fun, some good features, good all-round co-op survival game. Except that it has these floating damage numbers that appear every time you hit something and while you can toggle ALL of the HUD, you can't turn that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off. So i won't be getting into it because that 1 flaw ruins the entire immersive value.   tl;dr if youre not an immersion gamer, but arcade or casual, you'll like it I think so I still recommend the game.
5545	1	a	This is so bad it's good trust me buy it it's amazing
5547	1	a	Funny game :) got alot of fun playing all those game mods, shooter based on the unreal engine. With 3 classes, each got his unique skills, different dinosaurs, variating from small Comps -&gt; Raptors -&gt; Triceratops -&gt; T-Rex's etc etc. even Spinosaurus and the Deinosuchus Croc. U can play all these dinosaurs and even flying Pteranodons etc.   Nice survival mods, egg caputure etc etc. alot of different weapons add even more fun and tons of achievements. Get this game its worth it :) sometimes its even supercheap like i got 4x for just 3â‚¬ or so :)
5549	1	a	Easily one of the most fun co-op games you can play online with your friends. Ignore the meta rating score that must have been many patches ago the game seems to have improved massively. I would recommend this game to anyone. 8 out of 10 from me.
5551	1	a	This game has gone from one of the worst games to the most fun time waster on steam. This is proof that there is no such thing as a bad game, just developers who don't care.  10/10 best fun:cost game on steam
5553	1	a	This is a fun little team based shooter which involves you, the player, gunning down... well, dinosaurs. Hundreds of 'em, in droves. If you ever get tired of shooting at dinosaurs, then there's a whole host of different modes to choose from, including several styles of PvP. You can even turn the tables and play as a dinosaur yourself. The developers are very prompt about keeping this game up to date and adding new content, and have already released a huge update in the short time I've been playing it. Good work guys!  Pros: - Caters to a range of different playstyles. You can play in first and third person, solo or in a group. - Customisable characters provide a huge range of options. - A range of vehicles to choose from. Ever felt like blasting hordes of raptors with a tank? - Constantly updated with new maps, game modes and big fixes.  Cons: - Currently a little buggy, though mostly minor stuff like sounds not playing properly and dinosaurs getting stuck. - The music can be repetitive - While the game  can  be played alone, it's noticeably built with multiplayer in mind. Most game modes are considerably more fun with friends.  TL;DR: This game is a lot of fun with a group of friends. Why not give it a try?
5555	1	a	Well for a dollar its worth it
5557	1	a	Orion is a superhero in dc comics.
5559	1	a	It gets boring after playing for a while. Gameplay is too monotone. However it worths its price. If you have friends to play with, you can have a few hours of fun.
5561	1	a	For a 1.09, You need to own this game. The gameplay is addictive and fast paced, and Big ups to the Dev's for not giving up!
5563	1	a	Pretty sure this is the most fun I have had with a $1 game. Buy it.
5565	1	a	This game used to not be good at all. However the developers are amazing, listened to their fans, and turned this into one of the most fun games you can buy on steam right now. I've played this game for hours on end (on a different account if you're confused about my play time) and will continue to do so for a long time. Buy this game if for nothing else than to support developers who care about their player base
5567	1	a	Summary: This game is WELL worth the $0.99 it is selling for now. Gameplay is enjoyable, and the the overall graphics top it off.  8/10 Would knife a t-rex mid air again.  I bought this game for $0.99 when it went on sale as a game sold regularly at $12.99. This game by far was not worth $12.99. I didn't even consider it worth $4.99. The gameplay is nice, but very repetitive. Playing with friends is by far the most enjoyable way to play, but to fully play a match through, you have to play for a few hours non-stop. Point shoot point shoot point shoot.   The graphics make up for how little thinking is involved at times, and I'm not saying that you don't have to think strategy sometimes, just not most times. Out numbered yes, using your cloak to get past groups or larger dinosaurs is very enjoyable, but sitting at base sitting and spawn killing dinosaurs with a minigun, it gets boring.  Another problem with the game is how the pvp matches seem out of place. Not only do some of the maps have cartoon-like graphics, but the pvp system is so screwed up that it isn't enjoyable to play on those servers. All you see in those servers is people spam clicking with their sword until the other person dies or they die.  Overall the game I could have seen going for $2.99 and being well worth the money. Now that it is set at $1.00, I see it maybe getting more of a playerbase.
5569	1	a	You can kill dinosaurs, with futuristic weapons 8/10
5571	1	a	This game is amazing, tons of fun. fighting dino's with friends, and stabbing friends in the back with an t-rex egg in gungame. i really recomend you to buy it. a litle bit buggy but that doesn't really matter.
5573	1	a	Now Right Off The Bat This Game Is Realy Laggy And Bad Quality Do Not Waste Your Money...UNLESS You Want An Amazing Game That Is Amazingly Entertaining If You Can Look Around The Lag Bugs And Bad game Quality (Now I Know That Sounds Pretty Bad But Im Going To Finish What I was Saying Just Trust Me) Then You Get An Amazing Time With Your Friends So If You Can Do All That Get This Game...Its Worth 1 Dollar And Just Remember 'Games Cannot Fail Only Developers Can'
5575	1	a	For the price yes. Even though I didn't buy it... I did try it out and it was pretty fun. Bunch of kids, screaming: 'I'm going to eat your dinosaur â™¥â™¥â™¥!' made me laugh...  Any way... Did you know, customize charaters requires you to pay real money? It makes me think of Destiny... DLC after DLC after DLC = $ It not a bad game. For a old computer. My gaming computer seeks for something else though. Thanks for the trial though.
5577	1	a	I paid $.99 for this game and look how many hours I have on record. Need I say more?
5579	1	a	better than what you pay for it
5581	1	a	Dion is a motherâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
5583	1	a	worth your money 
5585	1	a	This offers a wide variety of dinosaurs like Argentinosaurus, Raptors, T-rex, Triceratops and many more for you to play as or against. Which is neato  Obviously you'll pick and play as the dino master race though, rather than dumb humans.  Overall dino scores: Includation in the game: 10/10 Looks: 7.5/10 Sounds: 3.8/10 Animations: 9/10
5587	1	a	I love the gameplay, but it's full of bugs, too bad there is only players servers, if there was a matchmaking this will be great
5589	1	a	Good game for such a cheap price.
5591	1	a	Flew some weird airplane into a T-Rex. Best $0.74 I've ever spent.
5593	1	a	This game was on a 93% off discount recently, going at 0.99 USD a piece. It's possible for me to fork out a single buck from my steam wallet after liquidating some of my items, so, why not?  The first thing you should know about this game is that, there is a reason why it's score is 36/100. Yes, this game is crudely made and, in most manner, buggy, but that does not mean that this gmae isn't fun. You will get to witness some seriously ridiculous conditions, such as rains or blizzards that which can pretty much blind you. There are also times where you can get your hands on some vehicles. Cherish them, as me and my friend managed to ram more than 100 enemies while driving an average looking hummer jeep (and it 'capsized' after my friend tried to ram a boss and failed).   I didn't play much to give a full account on how to stretch this game to its full potential, though I am certain this will be a great party game and its worth a laugh or two. Just one thing, don't get this game at full price.
5595	1	a	Your game is the single worst â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥en peice of trash i have ever seen in my entire life. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ looks at ypur game and says gee that looks â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. I love it  8/8
5597	1	a	This game has the right plan, cheap games with good amount of stuff to do = good profit
5599	1	a	You can quickscope trexs and ride Choppers while running around with a lightsaber.  You get a game that's better than battlefront. All for 99 cents.
5601	1	a	This game seems to have a pretty bad reputation but after playing it for a few hours it is genuinely entertaining. It is not, however, a polished product by any means. It has plenty of flaws and at times feels like a conversion mod for another game. Overall it's definitely fun and worth $1 though.
5603	1	a	awesome game get it while the special last, you will be hooked trust me.
5605	1	a	Run into dinosaurs Kill dinosaurs Get credits Spend credits Kill more dinosaurs ... Get a fancy hat  Superb game, loving every round and match.  Only downside is that from all the different game modes they offer, I only ever see Survival and Conquest servers. Which is basically the same thing...
5607	1	a	gameplay - pretty solid, and a lot of fun with friends, and multiplayer. graphics - this game is not meant directly to graphic enthusiasts, but still looks pretty solid  lots of different modes to enjoy with many players.  cons. - many glitches and weird buggy gameplay which get frustrating. overall this game is pretty fun and i would give it a legit rating of 7.5/10
5609	1	a	A somewhat rickety dinosaur first person shooter, it makes for some very short periods of intense fun. It's definitely a game that you will want to play with friends, but have fun dealing with weird connection bugs. Overall, definitely worth $0.99.
5611	1	a	This game is awesome! That is the truth. There is a bit of jank to it though, but the developers appear to be actively updating it and ironing it out. What is already here is awesome. Like how Fall Out New Vegas was awesome, jank and all. The game is a blast to play. All games types have a real sense of progression to them and a rewarding upgrade/weapon/vehicle system to keep it changing as you go. The augmentations system alone gives you the ability to customize your game on every life or level if you want. This game is great. Get eaten buy a T Rex or the other one at least once. You gotta do it. 10 outta 10.
5613	1	a	Reminds me of Firefall ... but a little bit cheaper
771	0	a	I mean its kinda fun, but its just terribly made. Really badly done, choppy animations. The textures are muddy and bland, but some of the bigger dinos look good. You fight wave after wave the same way in the same area so it gets repetetive very fast. The weapons all handle like old school doom guns, along with the iffy hitboxes it just makes for a boring experience. After playing Primal Carnage(buy it), this game just doesnt have any appeal to me. I really couldnt recommend it, even for $1.
5615	1	a	Thsi gaem is fun if your a meme HA PRANKED!!! 4 heil hitlers outta 5 heil hitlers it was one helluva schnitzel
5617	1	a	You should to beat T-Rax its A freaking Hard and that's makes game Realistic   Don't forget you can use Joystick or Dualshock Controller its wroth it bro   And its best game you can play when you get boredddddddddd Enjoy!!!  
5619	1	a	It may not be a triple a title with insane graphics and intense story(it doesnt even have a story) but for pp cens, it is hands down the best game ever
5621	1	a	Where to begin with this game. Dinosaurs, guns, mechs and explosions. What is better than that absoluetly nothing.
5623	1	a	For a dollar its a must buy. I would suggest getting a copy for a friend as this game should is quite fun when you are playing with friends.   Pros ----------- -Lots of weapons -Vehicles -Dinos (what more can I say) ----------- Cons ----------- -Animations are derpy -Graphics are meh -Some maps are retextured and passed off for new one -Glitchy dinos (sometimes) ---------- This is your typical wave surival game. Kill enemies get credits spend them for weapons/upgrades. Die. For a dollar its worth the laughs  7/10
772	0	a	I was able to buy 1 game and my ma said she pay for the game... so I decided to buy a cheap ugly game... ITS THIS GAME!  The Framerate issues make it impossible to play,every one who plays it is a jerk,the weapons are terrible and take all day to kill a raptor, A RAPTOR!!!  All the 'LEVEL UP QUICK!' Levels too, DONT HELP! When I saw this game I was at first like,'Ohmagawd Dinosaur game' *sees price* 'oh its a bad game :( '  This My fellow gamers on steam is what we call... 'A waste of money' I-I-I just want my money back... Or My soul.
5625	1	a	metascore means nothing for this game. 36 my â™¥â™¥â™¥. 8/10
5627	1	a	Bought it for $0.50, more fun than games I've paid $30+ for, this thing is simply amazing.
5629	1	a	This game + the Jurassic park movies prove that all dinosaurs are evil, even the good ones. Cheaper then a chocolate bar. Random crashes just add to the fun.  10/10 would throw grenades at dinosaurs again 
5631	1	a	Learned how to fly with a jetpack.. 11/10.
5633	1	a	it was a real fun game! i enjoyed playing it!!
5635	1	a	I wish I could pay more. It's that good.  Do yourself a favor and buy this game. It's great for solo play, but the coop aspect is really what makes it shine. The AI isn't top notch but watching a triceratops throw vehicles into the air around your campfire base in a lighting storm in the middle of the night while raptors go crazy down on the ground is just a feeling you can't duplicate. AND THIS GAME ISN'T EVEN ALL ABOUT DINOS! There's a ton of PvP maps and modes as well!  Just buy it and contribute to the dedicated developers who made the 'worst game ever made' into one of the greatest and probably least appreciated games of all time.
5637	1	a	Just buy it.You won't regret it!
5639	1	a	A game with derpy dinosaurs? HELL YEAH!
5641	1	a	Got a giant Mech to ride on top of a helicopter, 10/10.
5643	1	a	first it was bad but now my its 1 euro and its free for now its killing floor halo and tribes combinde do i recomend YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
773	0	a	its very expensive i dont think you should waste your money on this.
5645	1	a	It is a serious amont of fun, join a game fly around blow up a T rex with a rocket turrent run over little dinosaurs in a car. USE A TANK !!!
5647	1	a	Pretty decent game, fun to play with friends, defenetly worth the 1 dollar
5649	1	a	Defiently a way to say â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ the ecosystem. Had fun making the dinosaurs go extinct.
5651	1	a	Way more fun than I thought it was going to be. Playing this with some friends is a total blast. I see myself playing this for a very long time and I won't regret a damn thing.
5653	1	a	I don't know why, but i can write a review for this game. I have 74 minutes of playtime, and have unlocked 14 acheivements. I have never played this game.  ?  
5655	1	a	Awesome game on replay value!
5657	1	a	Love this game i think the metascore is bulls***
5659	1	a	This sheit is tight yo. Play the role of extinction and laugh at god for doing so
5661	1	a	10/10 -IGN  'Like Skyrim with dinosaurs.'
5663	1	a	Great game for the price but don't expect more
5665	1	a	While the metascore may seem off-putting, it is COMPLETELY misleading. Great for a night with your buddies; fast gameplay interspersed with 60-second breathers, craploads of weapons, and multiple game modes to keep it fresh. The only problem is a slight lack of polish, but the game's wonderful mechanics shine through every time. In short: Holy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, this game is fun!
5667	1	a	Stabbed a pterodactyl  10/10
5669	1	a	This game packs alot of punch for a game the costs almost nothing, this game is 79p thats less then a Â£1 and you get so much content and fun for this amount of money  with 15 or more game modes.  theres co op modes, player vs player and player vs player vs dinosaurs.  There are also lots of vehicals from jeeps to tanks to hover bike things to walking robots.  Whats not to love for that price for somthing that awsome right still not sold?   If you could also play as 10 diffrent dinos would that make you want it? well you can.   theres also a dynamic day night weather systme one minute you can be stolling to work at the kill all dino corp office and then it can rain and storm or blizzard if your in the artic any time day or night  the worlds your play in are wide and wonderfull with lots of places to go explore there are also loot chests to find.  so you have guns weapons and cars to drive what about a lightsaber? yes it has one to.  if you feel like flying ther ptreadactol will pick you up and drop you to your doom.  ok now lets talk about the other bits of the game graphicly its not gona win any awards but they are smooth and remind me of halo  where the graphics do shine is during its dynamic weather the freezing on your visor and the rain during the night look stunning :)  The controlls smooth easy bog standard fps controlls.  the xbox controllers work well :) just wish there was a sensativity option for it.  ok youv heard alot so far but for a small price its worth it.  so theres always servers going theres a nice comunity and its fun to play.  Another Pro is the game has devs that care its very rare :) here are some of my favriot moments so far  i Got picked up by petrdctol and droped to my doom wilst falling i managed to finish off a t-rex  i was driving around ran 100 little dinos over hit a tri cerotops and i flew across the map with all my buddys in the car and we drove off in perfect condition   so if you like what iv said so far then go get it if not look at the discription and see if theres anything iv missed about this game as it might sway your vote but hope you enjoy :) this game for the small price you pay you do get a lot of fun
5671	1	a	Fun game if lacking a little polish in some areas, the Metacritic score is years out of date from many patches, updates, and free DLC added onto the game. It's greatly improved since the initial reviews and is pretty fun. A very big update is coming later in 2014 that will improve the game even more. If you picked this up during the $1.00 sale, congrats on a great deal!  Graphics: 8.5/10 Gameplay: 9/10 User Interface: 6/10 Replayability: 8/10 Innovation: 7/10  Overall: 7.7/10 Summary: Good game, great idea for a game. With some tweaks to the engine and a few more bug fixes Dino Horde will easily be an 8/10 game. 
5673	1	a	Okay - One of those blind buys, because it was cheap. DOES NOT DISAPPOINT! I have so much fun rolling around and blasting dinosaurs with my friends, I'd say that everyone should have this game - go buy a four pack and gift your friends and let the carnage begin! 10/10 would buy again.
774	0	a	Too expansive for 0,49 cents. Horrible, and isn't shiny. :&lt;
5675	1	a	I managed to survive one wave with my weak â™¥â™¥â™¥ PC, and it was awesome. Bought the 3 dollar expansion whatever thing.
5677	1	a	this game.. oh man.. this game is AWESOME. it's a nice little pearl.  At first view it may look quite bad, but give it a try in the PROPER manner and this game is super-addictive. The infos you will need to get the fun out of this game are a bit 'hidden', because no tutorial is going to show you, so you have to guess yourself or learn from other players.  For example, exping is SLOW if you just play on servers. solution? make a 'surival\conquest' &gt; 'pre-historic' lobby (or solo room) and set the parameters to get up until 1400% (or maybe more) exp multiplier! you can literally lvl up from lvl 0 to 40 in 40 mins if you keep a ~1000% multiplier.  There are many, many other tricks and strategies to be succesful on this game, but they will require you to play for more than 2-3 matches and experiment a little. (for istance: EMP granades can activate vehicles shop even if you disabled vehicles in a conquest match!)  Furthermore there are many game modes aside from coop. Unfortunately the servers are a bit empty! But if you start some good lobby players will eventually join.  Again, this game is fast, relentless, furious.... and it also comes bug-free (at least no big bugs), has a solid co-operative mode, cool weapons, cool maps, it's not P2W (the store is only cosmetic).  Futhermore the devs seem to be in love with their child and they take care of it. I suggest this title especially to players who liked Unreal Tournament (1997) cause it's that kind of GOOD.
5679	1	a	Gets more updates then Day Z Standalone.
5681	1	a	This game might be one of the best value games on the Steam store. I would call it a mix of Halo and Counter-Strike with Dinosaurs. For the most part the vehicles are very cool. I like the aircraft and the mech in particular, though the jeep feels kind of clunky. There is a nice variety of maps to play and they are rendered very nicely. The guns are where it's really fun. I just can't get enough of the fully automatic shotgun. The big dinosaurs are tough to take down and it's rewarding when you do. I definitely enjoy this game a lot more than what I thought I would. And for a regular price of $1 you just can't go wrong with this, assuming you like shooters.
5683	1	a	This game is the funnest game i have ever played!
5685	1	a	bought a 4-pack for $0.99 and i've played alot more than i expected. it does need work but overall a fun game.
5687	1	a	I drove into a trex and killed it                                10/10
5689	1	a	brilliant game some graphical faults but one of the best games available in my opinion
5691	1	a	I don't really know how bad this was at launch, but right now? It's quite fun. It's essentially Killing Floor with a touch of Halo. Worth giving it a shot considering how deeply discounted it tends to be. Ignore the Metacritic score if you can, and ignore all the people who tease you for playing 'such a bad game' because â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ them, you're a grown up who can make judgment calls for yourself and are capable of enjoying life without worrying what other people think.
5693	1	a	nice nut a bit Laggy :/ 
5695	1	a	It's kinda like Halo2 and the oiginal Turok decided to go out for drinks, ended up getting smashed and got hoard mode confused with â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥...ooops we got a baby!  It's not a hardcore fps, take it serious kinda game. For just messing about, having some fun shooting dinosaurs and flying away to safe ground with the jet pack (and who dosen't like shooting dinosaurs or jetpacks) its perfect. The gameplay is great (once you figure out what the hell you are ment to be doing....there is no tutorial), maps are pretty big, dinos are plentiful, graphics are ok too, guns are fun. For 59p you can't really go wrong! Although i now know what the guy in the toilet felt like with a T-Rex about to eat him in Jurassic Park!  8/10 Would get â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out by a T-rex Again!  
5697	1	a	Very fun game at a cheap price and is worth a dollar. It's pretty much Halo with dinosaurs instead of aliens. 7.5/10
5699	1	a	Despite being pretty unpolished and seems like it was made by a band of chimps; it's still very fun.
5701	1	a	Good FPS game in low price.
5703	1	a	why is this game so cheap??? It's game about surviving hordes of dinossaurs. Not that good, but not that bad either, let's say is so so.
5705	1	a	$0.49 USD thats all :D
5707	1	a	This game is tons of fun! Got it on sale , but having so much fun playing co-op / survival with my wife that it would be worth full price. Pretty easy game to learn with enought variety to make it fun , but not so much to make it overly complicated. Love the fact that I can set up a friends only game with bots. Makes it fun with just 2 of us playing. ( Or single player ). Bots actually work pretty good !! Will heal you as well as get in vehicles with you. Graphics are very good and gameplay runs prettty smooth. Really nice game to just jump in and blow the crap out of some dinosaurs! Good variety of vehilces , weapons , maps , and augmentations. I was'nt expecting much for a game that was so inexpesive , but was extremly surprised &amp; happy on how good this game turned out to be! One of the best values for the money I've gotten. Would definately reccomend this game !!
5709	1	a	This game proves why critic scores are pretty much useless for judging the value of a game. Play as dino or man, hunter or hunter. Eat or shoot your prey. Drive your friends off a cliff. Eat raptors for health.   Buy this and play it with your mates. Solo is fun but co-op is insanely fun.
5711	1	a	Uhhh, this is a bad game - and I love it. It's trashy, cheesy and a hell of fun.  Play it with friends, though.
5713	1	a	sick game you choose one of three classes and get different weapons and abilaties based on your class help your team or be a noob and steal all the kills do whatever you want just by it for you and your friends.
5715	1	a	I bought this game for pennies, way back when it was a pile of junk. I was amazed when I logged in a few months ago and it looked completely redone. Are there strange physics glitches? Occasionally? Are the dinosaurs a little stupid? Absolutely. However, the game is one where you can play the game because its core is good, and you are happy to see the game actually be good, perform well, and have a decent level of graphic fidelity. 7/10 in my book, a real recovery. Just look at the cost and ask yourself, why not? 
5717	1	a	OMG THIS GAME IS INSANE! I recommed this game to everyone! I like to kill dino's ;D But those small creatures are hard to spot -_-
5719	1	a	really love this game, my friend bought it for me and we always play it together, so much fun its really awesome. kudos to the developers
5721	1	a	New to the game? You'll love it. It never truly shines, but there is something delightful in equipping a flamethrower and baking crispy dino-treats. Or zooming around in Halo-esque vehicles causing general mayhem while you're being chased. This could be a very, very, very good game and at how cheap it is and it IS a good game. . . for a time.  Then there are the game modes that don't completely work. Game settings that never stick (I'm always having to change the visual settings even though I've saved them EVERY TIME.) A healing gun that sometimes won't heal (because the game doesn't properly show health bars.) Less than stellar UI. Boring and repetitive dinosaur mobs.   Maybe the reason why I recommend this game is because I can see what this game COULD be. At the core, it's a incredibly fun multiplayer game that is easy to pick up. Sadly, though, the game doesn't feel complete. Most people will put this down after a few hours and never pick it back up. . . which is a shame! Add some more customization, make more maps, fix the other game modes! There is really not a game quite like this out there - similar, yes, but not quite.   TL;DR: Buy this game. It's cheap and good for a few hours with friends. But don't keep it out of mind and let's see what the future can bring.
5723	1	a	So this is how the dinosaurs became extinct... 10/10, would force species into extinction again.
5725	1	a	wow..lots and lots of dinos especially on prehistoric difficulty...lots of fun and only 79p..AWESOME
5727	1	a	i dont even know where to begin 10/5 would not play again
5729	1	a	you know that moment when you pee after a long day of work and it feels so good and you're overwhelmed, that's just like this game except you're peeing out dinosaurs
5731	1	a	Thank god they changed it from a expensive grabage to a cheap masterpiece.
5733	1	a	Couldn't resist for less than a dollar. Downloaded. Logged on to server. Shot a tiny dinosaur in the face with my pistol. Picked up and carried into the atmosphere by a pterodactyl. Plummeted to my death. 10/10 would forget parachute again
5735	1	a	Its relly good and fun game but little laggy and buggy also pay2win i think   Ill givethis game 8/10 :P  Comon buy it its cost onley 1$
5737	1	a	A bit buggy game, but enjoyable none-the-less. Shooting down a Pteranadon? Heck yes!
5739	1	a	'Optimus Prime in the teens fights buggy dinosaurs.GOTY!' - Gamestop 'Like Halo with guns!' - IGN 'IT'S 1$!!! I LOVE STEAM!!!' - 12 yo boy
5741	1	a	Total of 30 min. 20 min searching/getting to a game.10 min of gameplay. Searching for a game was more fun. I somehow got this game for free.So im winning.
5743	1	a	Who doesn't love blowing up dino brains with their friends? 10/10 hands down one the best co-op games ever!
5745	1	a	Buy this game, it will make ur life better because you can think and say 'i'm not the most â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ person in the world' becuase the creators are :P &lt;3
5747	1	a	10/10, bought the 4 pack last time it was on sale, gifted it to my friends, I now have no friends. Thanks Trek Industries!
5749	1	a	You get to play as a spartan, using lightsabers, to fight dinosaurs.  Need I say more?
5751	1	a	You may get what you pay for in terms of functionality but the game does seem to run ok with only minor issues, but I mean come on..dinosaurs..guns..JET PACKS what more do you want? lots of fun
5753	1	a	RAWWWRR pew pew pew RAWWWRR pew pew BANG! game summed up
5755	1	a	Fight for Egg-Based Dominance in a world of marines fighting for Egg-Based Dominance and Dinosaurs who conveniently are also fighting for Egg-Based Dominance.
5757	1	a	This game is good when playing in such as Lan party or something. A thumbs up game that every FPS player should have.
5759	1	a	&gt;Bought it during the steam christmas sale for %51 off. &gt;Lauched it up but never played a round &gt;Never even launched the game for about 5 months &gt;Finaly got back on the game and played 1 solo game &gt;Only got past wave 2 &gt;Didn't play the game for about another 3-4 months &gt;Got back on a couple days ago and played a hour or two &gt;Found out the game was pretty good, like halo but you kill dinosaurs instead.  10/10 would spend 49 cents and not play it for 5 months again
5761	1	a	Pretty much an epic game! =D
5763	1	a	This game is highly addicting. And packs a whole punch for such a cheap price.
5765	1	a	Best game ever! 10/10 Worth the money, got a dragon fly and flew it to mars.
5767	1	a	This game really isn't that bad anyway, so the fact that it is Â£0.79 ($0.99) is phenominal, there's litterally no reason for you and friends not to get this game, being as cheap as it is. Shooting dinosaurs is nice, the easter egg events are great and it really tests you and your friends when you first play.  After not long the game becomes rather easy and you gain more knowledge; make sure to turn the difficulty up.  And not to mention you can 720 blaze a T-Rex with a sniper rifle :D
5769	1	a	A truly fascinating commentary on Muslim life, told through the eyes of a young Japanese man stranded in Antarctica following the death of his family by mass seppuku. What it lacks in visuals it makes up for in its terrific fighting mechanics, which require the player to mash not only X, but left trigger as well.  11/10. A masterpiece
5771	1	a	IT THE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING BEST GAME IN THE WORLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5773	1	a	BEST CO-OP SHOOTING GAME This game is Halo 4 and Star Wars combined.  Nice graphics, very fun to play with friends. However a bit buggy.
5775	1	a	Dinosaurs + Guns...what can go wrong?
5777	1	a	Killed a T-Rex with the starter pistol.  devs pls nerf starting pistol
5779	1	a	I killed a T-Rex with a sword. The dinosaurs didn't have feathers. NOT SCIENTIFICALLY ACCURATE PORTRAYAL!
5781	1	a	Â£1 for a game thats like cod zombies in the halo universe (obiously with dinosaurs instead of zombies), brillent, shame about the wave limit.  10/10 ragdoll physics - rammed a triceratops witha tank, did a double backflip then exploded
5783	1	a	As i exspected turok+halo+killing floor equal a game that does need to be redone but is still fun to play anway so im not surprised i tried it its fun.
5785	1	a	This game is excellent, ignore that low meta score because it is so much fun to play, single-player or mulitplayer but is best with others, the graphics are good and the mechanics great. I have found no bugs so it is very smooth to play and easy to learn. It can get very heart-thumping at times and is very good fun for groups of friends
5787	1	a	Really cool type of game I have never seen before. A survival wave game... with dinosaurs.
5789	1	a	A good game and it plays very well for the size of the game
777	0	a	I 'played' this game for twenty minutes before I had enough.  Five minutes were spent in a solo game to test out graphics settings. Noticed the AI was pretty terrible, but I figured it was just easy because It was only the second wave. Anyways I didn't want to make any judgements about it until I tried out the multiplayer.   So I navigated through the buggy menu for fifteen minutes. I tried to join multiple different servers. I restarted the game several times trying to get it to work, and I could not join a single game. It's really frustrating to have to give a game a negative review because I legitimately could not access the multiplayer (Which is the only draw to the game in this case) Rather than on the merits of the gameplay itself.   I could have probably had a better time smoking cat hair out of the dollar I spent on the game.  Still better than Infestation Survivor stories.
5791	1	a	Air lifted a Deinosuchus with a spaceship. 5/5
5793	1	a	It might have been complete â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ once, but after trying it, it isn't too bad for such a cheap game. Think Killing Floor, except really, really stupid and with giant enemies and vehicles. The hate for this game is a little bit ridiculous at this point, so I suggest getting it once it's on sale and just have some fun. With a more polished sequel with more content and variety it might actually be a great game... Hell, give me a sequel with climbing mechanics from Dragon's Dogma and we have a classic.
5795	1	a	To start off, let me say for only one dollar this is a must have game. I don't understand the hate in some of the reviews and in the metacritic score, as the game is very fun for just the survival and conquest gamemodes. In these modes you'll face waves unending dinosaurs, buying upgrades and guns along the way. And when you think you've got everything under control, prepare to face a T-rex, or maybe a tricerotops, either way it adds a great challenge you have to carefully approach. Lastly, mechs plus dinosaurs, what're you waiting for?
5797	1	a	The game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
5799	1	a	sick game love the environments, game could change, when everyone dies on a specific wave, they just restart that wave and not a hol new game.
778	0	a	Multiplayer is absolutely broken and unusable
5801	1	a	its a piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ but i love it
5803	1	a	Saw this game for $1 so i bought it... 
5805	1	a	Orion: Prelude (Or Dino Horde, when I had this game) is a game where, you guessed it, kill dinosaurs. But it doesn't just stick to slaying gigantic creatures. You also get to pick from a hefty variety of gamemodes that change the pace of the game, sometimes entirely!  Would I recommend someone to play this game? It's $0.99. How can you NOT buy it?
5807	1	a	This game is quite good. I know that it got downvotet into oblivion by IGN and CO but this game is not quite good. Give it a try, you won't be dissaponted
779	0	a	HOLY CRAP! This game is amazing. There are no words to describe the fact 1$ and so amazing. And, it's on Unreal engine... so that results in stability.  I unfortunately at this moment, cannot recommend this due to the fact it currently doesn't have linux support. I'll be able to change this when it does.
5809	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing rad. you get to BE dinosaurs!!1 and then you get to KILL dinosaurs!!!1 how sick is that?! direct ripoff of halo by the way.
5811	1	a	Alright. A lot of things to say about this lovely game! It is so fun and awesome with co-op and friends! Playing this also works on really crappy laptops and desktops and you won't have overheating problems! Its kind of like a halo weapons with destiny costumes and the vehicles are too fun! Even playing with bots is crazy fun! $0.99 this dollar can be found on the floor. Hell people find 10 dollars on the floor! Get this now! Like seriously, bro! What you waiting for?
5813	1	a	bought the game for the cards....   Then I joined a game and had a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing blast... This is what happens when unreal has wild S . E. X with jurassic park lol. the combat seems pretty smooth some bugs here and there but what do you expect from a 1 dollar game. Was shocked that the player base is pretty decent with full lobbys in game.   I rate this game a 7/10 best damn dollar i ever spent in my life
5815	1	a	Got this game as a gift, very fun game. 8/10
5817	1	a	Punched a T-Rex to death.  11/10 would punch again.
5819	1	a	for a 99 cent game i'm suprised at what i got a chance to shoot dinosaurs in the face with my best buddy's  but other then that really don't go expecting the meaning of life  so for just an awsome mulitiplayer-dino-killing game, its worth the 99 cent tag as an evening game to be played with friends
5821	1	a	It's like PlanetSide 2, with dinosaurs!
780	0	a	With so many back of the box mechanics, how on earth could I possibly not recommend this game? Dinosaurs! Jetpacks! Mechs! Character progression! What more could you want?  Well, as it turns out, quite a bit.  From my mere hour impression of the game (and it might come alive later, I wouldn't know) the game feels like an absolute mess. Sure, they've crammed a ton of stuff into here. But I couldn't make out a *game* anywhere. It's hard to explain, but I just couldn't get a sense of what I was supposed to do, let alone why. I couldn't get any traction in this game, I coulnd't make any sense of it. Shooting, movement, everything feels loose and just *meh*. so there weren't any moments that felt satisfying.  I can't even try to comment on visuals, ripped off mechanics, or anything like that. I was just too frickin bored to even bother with anything beyond these meager first impressions.   If you can get it on sale, you're sure to get your money's worth. But if you buying games to actually play them and not just for the sake of buying them, at least wait for another free weekend so you can try before you buy.
5823	1	a	First review so bear with me guys. ;_; So, I was gifted this from a friend and we decided to play together for a little while during one evening. Needless to say, I had a blast from the short amount of time that I played it. Once I have some more free time at a later date, I will definitely play this game again! I loved playing with other people in an attempt to wreck some dinosaurs and stuff... Aaaand to get wrecked by the dinosaurs themselves at times. Worth the buy for sure.
5825	1	a	 Worth much more than 1 Euro/Dollar
5827	1	a	Probably one of the best games i have ever played.
5829	1	a	I could say a lot about this game being pretty standard shooter - but I have had some much fun playing this game. Shooting dinosaurs - levelling up and jumping around the map - this game is silly, surreal but fun.
5831	1	a	Ay it's a good one.
5833	1	a	Never Ever Play Versus on this - no autobalance means that if you choose to be Dino there will be 10 marines aganst you - Just totally unfair  Cooperative Play works somehow will be hard to coordinate while in the dinos are attacking - ofcourse after the wave ends it will be slightly easier.  I would buy this while this is now on sale when this was written - until major fixes are made this is only Co-op Survival Game and not worth to pay full price  But always better than Space Empires V. Never buy that game... or even look at it.
5835	1	a	how much sorry?!!! 99p?!! Thats a great deal but the recent updates have made it worse than better. Sad times :( Still it's fun to play coop
5837	1	a	A good survival game featuring defending a base against a wave of dinosaurs, capturing outposts, using vehicles to explore, buy different guns and much more. There are many different game modes to play and many different maps, my favorites are the conquest ones.  The graphics are good and the game runs smooth. The Level system looks pretty cool where you edit your loadouts but I'm not sure on how it works yet so I can't really review that.  All you need to know is you can shoot dinosaurs in the face...  7/10
5839	1	a	14 hours and still not bord so..... ya i have also put 270+ hour in terraria another game i highly recamend
5841	1	a	this game awesome! after update for conquest mode and world map this game jump from garbage (3/10) to nearly perfect game (8-9/10) share the games with your friends and survive this primal world!
5843	1	a	Suprisingly hilarious with friends, good for the $1 I spent on it. Don't expect variation and uniqueness.
5845	1	a	Played it for 10 minutes and got AIDS. Thanks Orion: Prelude! :)
5847	1	a	Awesome game, 9/10 only thing i could suggest is more work towards controller work.
5849	1	a	Good indie Sci-Fi shooter! Kill all these Dinosaur hordes!
5851	1	a	Pretty sick
5853	1	a	do you want to see how it is in jurassic park with a Scifi twist then you would enjoy this game where you feel immersed with the first person view where your helmet visor freezes over from the snow or get's rain drops that blur your vision when its raining. I Recommend this game for the Co-Op modes it does have PvP modes but in my opinion they aren't as fun as working with your friends fending off dinos to protect your base.
5855	1	a	if u have a computer that cant run games very well do not buy lololoolololl laggy af
5857	1	a	Hilariously fun! Only played a couple times but It's definitely worth more than a dollar
5859	1	a	Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!  This is a First person shooter game.    Interface/Menu/Settings
5861	1	a	I avoided this game for months. When it became free to play, I got hooked. I don't think I can go back to CounterStrike after playing this. Too much fun with friends here. Not much to the game at all, and once you figure out how to counter, it gets extremely easy even on higher settings, but for some reason I'm hooked.
5863	1	a	On it's price, I expected it to be another bad game on cheap sale price.  But it was actually Killing Floor with dinos and futuristic guns.   Very decent game, especially on it's price. You can customize your character, your guns and even your enemy dinos! Also graphics are pretty good and in this game there is even nice looking rain. Game has fun multiplayer too.  Game is based on planet where future humans fight against dinos. I don't know plot as this game doesn't have single player campaign but it's doesn't need one. Gameplay is pretty simple. Shoot some dinos, upgrade your skills (these reset in every game but you can unlock weapons so you don't need to buy ones) and defend your base. Notice that in every dino wave there will be stronger dinos like T-Rex. Also you can have mechs and cars by unlocking objectives. Also if you're playing solo, you can just free roam and kill dinos that gets on your way. There are also classes but you're gonna find them out ingame, but myself I like Assault as I can have jetpack.  This game has also workshop and map editor which is awesome. Steam cards and VAC to protect players against cheaters are also good. Only negative is that game runs poorly on high settings and I can run Skyrim on max settings 60fps.  Every player who likes Killing Floor, Black Ops Zombies or even Left 4 Dead should get this game. Also people that like any sort of FPS games should also buy this! It's cheap and worth on it's original price. 8/10
5865	1	a	This does have a feel similar to halo. Haven't gotten very deep into it yet but it also reminds me of playing Turok back in the day! Seems like a great game to play with friends!
5867	1	a	This game is actually really good...
5869	1	a	For 1$-0.50 cent there's no reason not to get this game at all, I'd say this game is well worth 5-10$ at least, the pvp a very well done, the dino-survival is fantastic, and the community, despite small, is very fun to play with. Anyone that enjoys a good fps, whether it be pve or pvp should give this game a shot.
5871	1	a	this game is alright a bit like call of duty and teamfortress 2 with dino's i found it a bit boring but if you like shooters with dino's then you might like this 7/10 forme
5873	1	a	love it all the wasy but sometimes a little lame when you bye your self fun with other
5875	1	a	I got this for .99 and it is awesome. I've already put way too many hours into it.
5877	1	a	This game possibly the best dinosaur shooter I've ever played. That is all.
5879	1	a	I nominate this game for: I only had 50 cents left award, cause you know ......MOAR GAMES
5881	1	a	This game is absolutely amazing and the fact that they are letting you buy it for 99 cents right now is an unheard of deal in itself for a game that is this much fun. Definite must have and it's the only one type of game that you can kill waves of dinosaurs for hours on end.
5883	1	a	Do you want fun? This is funny. You can laugh with or at it. The game lack a story? Narrate a creative one while you play at a random server or with your friends. At first glance the game may look stupid, but even though a second look reveals the same opinion, this is still worth playing. I wish there to be more friendly and helpful players, so the community can grow lively and strong.  Edit: Do I like this game? Yes, I do. I do really enjoy playing it. Is this game bad? Yes, it â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing is. I laugh at the poorly opmized game with clunky gameplay. But I do wish it was good and well made, with more time dedicated to it. But the developer left it to rot and went on another project that is an even worst clusterâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. I wanted this game to be something I could give to my friends and enjoy with them. But it is buggy and most of the fun comes from laughing at the game and not with it.  I still recomend it though. Even more now that it is free to play. Hope one day it will be open source and the players will be able to directly contribute to good development of this great concept and visionary idea for a game.
5885	1	a	Very fun to play, never gets old.  The amount of effort the Devs have put into this game makes it worth way more than $1.
5887	1	a	It's a gud game, only $1 pretty cheap m8.  360 no scopin' dinos like no tomorrow.  9/10
5889	1	a	I got this for .99 and it is awesome. I've already put way too many hours into it.
5891	1	a	For 1$-0.50 cent there's no reason not to get this game at all, I'd say this game is well worth 5-10$ at least, the pvp a very well done, the dino-survival is fantastic, and the community, despite small, is very fun to play with.

5893	1	a	this game is alright a bit like call of duty and teamfortress 2 with dino's i found it a bit boring but if you like shooters with dino's then you might like this 7/10 forme
5895	1	a	This game possibly the best dinosaur shooter I've ever played. That is all.
5897	1	a	one of the best shooter everyone should try
5899	1	a	This game is ridiculously fun!
5901	1	a	Addicting - Not sure if it is because of the different achievements - the fact that you get to shoot Dinos , the fact that you get to drive vehicles over dinosaurs.. or what ... but it is definately addicting.
5903	1	a	very fun and addictive game with quite a few game modes. fans of dinosaurs and a halo mixture will likely enjoy this
5905	1	a	You can be a futuristic guy or black guy or girl from the future and kill other guys/black guys/girls from the future or you can kill dinosaurs with your friends or alone. And you can wear hats. I got it for free and not gunna lie its pretty fun and entertaining if I've got time to pass (unlockables would be nice). I guess its worth it though. Buy it unless you're scared
5907	1	a	Thumbs way-up.  The most fun I have had playing a FPS in a while. It reminds me of early Quake LAN parties, constant gibs, and non-stop action. There are several different ways you can play (survival, FFA, conquest, etc), lots of weapons, vehicles, various difficulty levels, etc.   So far, I have only played one class - 3 to choose from. Don't forget, you can play dino classes! Favorite vehicle so far: two passenger assault vehicle with rear mounted machine gun. You can ram/crush hearding dinos, but bosses toss vehicle and crew into the air.  This game is not thought provoking, deep, and will not solve any of the worlds problems. It is entertainment. There are games for solving puzzles, this is not one of them. Low metascore, but hey, it's easy to be a critic. You can stare at the idiot box, or you can roast some Raptors!   When was the last time you had this much fun for $0.99? Keyboard finger cramps included at no extra charge! Buy it. If you play for more than 5 minutes (and you will) it is worth it.
5909	1	a	Holy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, this was 1 dollar? And Ride to Hell can be sold for 60?  â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
5911	1	a	This game has come SUCH a long way. In fact, I don't remember the last time a bad game was patched into a good one.  First off, this game is not perfect. There are still a few bugs and glitches here and there that occasionally mess with the game, but nothing gamebreaking from what I've seen. Mostly minor things that can easily be patched, and from the consistent support that the developers are providing for the game I suspect they quickly will be.  That said, THIS GAME IS SERIOUS FREAKING FUN.   Seriously, kudos to everyone who worked and continues to work on this game. It's nice to see a developer take enough pride in their game to maintain it and keep improving.  The dinosaurs are vicious, there's a nice spread of weapons to use, and teamwork is actually a legitimate factor in this game (unlike a lot of popular FPS games in the market now).   I can't remember the last game that let me jetpack around a hulking T-Rex to headshot it with my bow. Pure awesome.  The community is nice and helpful for the most part and there's always a variety of servers online with plenty of people playing.  The game is definitely still a bit rough, but, considering the mess that it was during release, I have high hopes that this game is just going to keep getting better as more updates come along.
5913	1	a	Good! Best played with friends or randoms. When playing co-op or multiplay, there are like hardly any Australian servers to jump on that are free; they are either full or there is none. So you need to make up your own listen or dedicated server(or get one of your mates to do it) if you wanna play with people. And the servers overseas, yeah unless you like playing with 400+ ping, don't bother....  Otherwise fun game, to me it feels like a cross between KF and Halo, except instead of killing zombies or aliens, it's dinosaurs!
5915	1	a	I reccomend this game simply on the basis that it has guns and dinosaurs without even getting into the fact that it has jetpacks, tanks and lightsabers
5917	1	a	This game is much â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
5919	1	a	ORION: Dino Horde is an awesome game for gamers all alike. It has all of my favourite in-game things: dinosaurs, guns, death, blood and dinosaurs. Now who doesn't (except for girls) like killing huge prehistoric beasts with futuristic weapons or being the beasts and eating people? WHO FRIGGING DOESN'T LIKE THAT?! Oh and the gameplay is great, although a little laggy and buggy in places, but still great! I give it a 9/10.
783	0	a	boring
5921	1	a	Ran over a pack of raptors in a Humvee. Later, while running away, got my head chewed off by a T-Rex.  10 of 10. Would play again.
5923	1	a	Fun, tough, and addicting. Going into the survival mode solo is plain suicide, but it's very fun just to see how far you can make it. The plethora of Steam Achievements is wonderful, and if you are big on trying to 100% games, then you will have your hands full with this, in a good way. At the end of the day, gaming should be a fun, enjoyable time, and that is exactly what this promises and delivers. Walrus Approved.
5925	1	a	The new update(s) have definitely put this game on a better place than what it's earned on Metacritic. It's what the newest trailer explains: Killing Floor x Halo mechanics vs Dinosaurs. If you haven't tried it yet, do so.
5927	1	a	This game is like a First Person Balloon Tower Defense, but with DInosaurs! I love how you cna buy perks from eliminating enemies! All in all I think Orion is a great game.
5929	1	a	THIS GAME IS AMAZING 
5931	1	a	Holy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, this was 1 dollar? And Ride to Hell can be sold for 60?  â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
5933	1	a	This game has come SUCH a long way. In fact, I don't remember the last time a bad game was patched into a good one.  First off, this game is not perfect.

5935	1	a	Good Game But With One Major Problem.......The Lag Can Be Overwhelmingly Bad With A PC/Laptop Of Around i3, If The Curators Of The Game Could Fix It Then I Might Give It A 9/10
5937	1	a	Great game for the price, lots of fun!
5939	1	a	This game has more content than some milky milkers,but hei its fraking Hilarious and lovely,much better then some big blockbusters!
5941	1	a	Best played with friends for a stupid good time. I got mauled by a knee high ankle biter.
5943	1	a	can 360 noscope a t-rekt with a racket launcher  `10/10
5945	1	a	Fists are more effective than guns on dinosaurs, who knew? 11/10
5947	1	a	Okay, now you are sitting here looking at the trailer for the game and see its like a dollar USD... I got it on sale for .50 cents just because I like to collect random steam games. After seeing some of the cool mech and helicopters I decided to try this, mainly out of bordom... then it happend.... im flying around, blasting t-rexs in the face with machineguns and rockets and had to keeping, The only thing I really dont like is how the dinos look. Theother things such as the terran, buildings and mechs like unique awesome and theh multi player is not horrible!  Do it... spend a dollar and have fun!
5949	1	a	I seriously can't recomend this game enough. I don't know why I havn't written this review Earlier, I've had teh Game since day one and have watched it grow from it's pretty rough and shaky start into one of the most fun Lan party games I've ever played. Sure it's not the highest quality games but It's certainly one of the most fun esspecially with Friends.  I can't thank the Developers enough for all there hard work and sticking with their product until it became the game they always wanted it to be. Also Seriously the Game is only $1 now so if you havn't got it yet shame on you. It's the best value you'll ever get from one dollar. Can't Recomend enough. 
5951	1	a	The Godfather of video games
5953	1	a	Still learning the game but had a ton of fun with friends playing it and seeing all the features like the mechas and tanks. It's a pretty simple shoot and follow objectives kind of game that's fun in group. It's silly and has a good base but definitely room for improvement. No worries though since the developers have been working on constant fixes to bring it up standard.
5955	1	a	Shoot dinos in the face!
5957	1	a	Honestly, This game is actually kinda ok. People put down you pitchforks! Almost reminds me of killing floor in terms of gameplay (of course jetpacks now included) and a lot of fun can be had from this game, just not shinny sparkly graphics fun and can be repettitive at times. But seriously, this game is basicaly F2P now with its new price and the updates have seroiusly boosted my score of the game, For the price of a Yourkie at a corner shop, at least try this beacuse you kinda-maybe-hopefully wont regret it...maybe.
5959	1	a	This game is a awsome first person shooter with a great survival tatics. teamwork is one of the most importent thing in this game. Love it
5961	1	a	The game has a excellent premis, but is about as polished as decaying squirel poop. It is becomming a much better game with every update, and its eventually comming out of it's shell as 'One of the worst games polluting The Steam Library'.  Its pretty original, unlike exploitation games like Revelation 2012, and it has allot of 'good seeds' in it, waiting to 'bare fruits'.   All in all, with the price in mind, its definitly worth it. And for a few hours of cheap, guilty fun with the potential of becomming a good game with time, I'd recommend it.
5963	1	a	For how inexpensive this game is, and for how many free give-a-ways they've done with this game, you'd think it's absolutely terrible, but this game is actually one of the most fun multi-player games out there. Everything is cooperative, the gameplay is fun, the leveling system is okay, the people who play this aren't absolutely toxic, and the game in general isn't that difficult. Also I'm one of the highest level people in this game so I have major streed cred amongst the players on this game which automatically gives this game a 10/10.  8/8 m8 gr8 I r8.
5965	1	a	To be honest, i only played the free trial, (3-5 days) but i have to say, i am quite surprised how AWESOME this game was ;)
5967	1	a	One of THE BEST games I've ever played. You can fight each other, team up and survive or just plain muck around. Orion is DEFINETLY in my top favourites.
5969	1	a	Before the update of March 1st, this was a fairly average game with a few flaws. I found it fun to shoot dino hores with friends, and would find the whole experiene to be banterous. However with the update it has just revolutionsied the game and made it so much better. I would honestly recommend everyone with friends to buy it, (but if you dont then dont bother). 10/10, would recommend to a friend.
784	0	a	it is nothing like Jurassic Park
5971	1	a	I fap to this well spent 0,99$
5973	1	a	I personally really enjoy this game, especially with friends. The graphics are surprisingly good (though I had to turn them almost all the way down to get it to work on my laptop) and there's plenty of variety in weapons. Sometimes a bit repetitive, but over all I'd say it's a really good game. Definitely worth the $0.99.
5975	1	a	Shootin dinos with broselfs is dope.
5977	1	a	it is like Orion: Dino Beatdown only worth the price
5979	1	a	this game would be horrendous if it didnt have coop
5981	1	a	When i saw the meta score for this game i though it was bull dust. But this game has been so underestimated by the score beacuse of early scoring by meta. the Game is the MOST fun to have with freinds . Sure it has glitches But the graphics and the gameplay makeup for it all the way. The guns are all even when in pvp. this game is up there in my books for indie
5983	1	a	Very easy to pick up and put down. Fun with friends.
5985	1	a	This game is entertaining and fun. You get to shoot dinosaurs. It's not the most fluid game I've ever played, but it's well worth the money.  7/10.
5987	1	a	Bloody brilliant, great for the whole family
5989	1	a	It's Killing Floor with dinosaurs
5991	1	a	Very cool gameplay, rampage/dino vs humans is my personal favourite
5993	1	a	Fun Game watch out for those t-rex's!
5995	1	a	game is fun to play coop. Good for playing with friends.
5997	1	a	a t-rex ate me and i turned into a playmobil while my teammates were trying to run over a triceratops with a bike  game of the year every year
5999	1	a	Rather fun game when you play this game with friends plus it was only 1 dollar yeah.
6001	1	a	Got it cause it was only a dollar and im loving it! has replayability because you never know what might happen. Wouldn't say its worth $15 though. More like a $10 game but its still good and you should buy it while its 93% off! played a few hours and been having a blast with my neighbor!!!
6003	1	a	Dino Horde is the best horde
6005	1	a	I think this game was a smash hit a real 2/10 effort. whoever made this game did a great job with the following: putting dinosaurs in their game. i found myself on the edge of my seat as the T-rex's would throw boulders at me and charge at a break neck pace, and with a great storyline you cant go wrong. you will find after a solid playthrough along with the only other 1 person in the world that plays this game will enlighten you on how to fight dinosaurs with ridiculously strong weapns with zero recoil. i rate this game a 4 out of 5 out of 10. I hope to never play this game again within my lifetime. if someone held a gun to my head and told me to play this game, I'd choose death.
6007	1	a	Awesome for the .50 cents price tag alone!
6009	1	a	Personally, I think this game is one of the best co-op games I have seen..., even though the price is incredibly cheap.
6011	1	a	Great game for the money, but don't expect much more than shooting dinos with various weapons.
6013	1	a	So I had no idea about this game just that someone called it Killing Floor with Dinosaurs in past. Got surprised by it's low Meta score so went on YT to check review of Cynical Brit which was full of rage and hate. Followed by this I went ingame to actually try the game ready to experience utter garbage product but...  .. after understanding beginner's confusement (mechanics, level system, classes, perks and weapons) the game actually became a fun o.0  It IS Killing Floor with dinosaurs.. and vehicles (Woo). There is more modes (including one where you play as Dinosaurs against players) but the most common is Survival -&gt; 10 waves of defending, where every 3 waves you need to go to secure the outer outpost for better vehicles/choppers, healing/reviving team mates and repairing vehicles while being swarmed by tons of meat-â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s.  Simply if you have so low expectation of this game it can surprise you (hopefully) + only for 2,7 Euros.. bah.
6015	1	a	Spiral Games Studioâ€™s newest game set in the Orion universe is Orion: Dino Horde. A supersession of Spirals previous game Orion: Dino Beatdown, Dino Horde expands the game mechanics and universe in every direction into something worthy of having James Cameron or Ridley Scott putting their names on. The cinematic visuals and lighting are some of the best Iâ€™ve ever seen in a game, and are something to be expected from a Spielberg film.   Check out my full review at     indieNewsNow.com   [indienewsnow.com] 
6017	1	a	By buying this game you spend money unnecessarily for Neak crap.  I would recommend this game to people who have a lot of friends, so that they can play (quite good) multiplayer, which  with a bunch of friends definitely enjoy.   Gameplay: 8/10  Graphic design 7/10   The price is a little overshoot.  servers are half-empty.  Even some bug is avoided.
6019	1	a	Got it on sale, afked was like lucky to get a WHOLE set of foil cards. PROFIT MADE  10/10
6021	1	a	trex scope acoos map 420\10 would rek dinosaurs again
6023	1	a	The metacritic score is misleading. Orion: Dino Horde is a wonderful game. Its like halo: combat evolved with dinosaurs and hats. If you buy the game now, it will update into the new game by Spiral that is coming out near the end of the year. And make sure to check out the kickstarter for The Orion Project  https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/orionprelude/the-orion-project 
6025	1	a	cool game for $1 but, if you have a cheap computer/work laptop i would not buy this game. if you have an old computer with low amount of vram game will be semi unplayable
6027	1	a	A great game with dinos.  + Cheap + Many game modes + Nice graphics + Classes + Design style + Many maps + Weapons + You're able to play as a dinosaur.  -/ 
6029	1	a	I got this game when it was on sale for a couple of dollars, personally after playing it it would have probably been worth 3-5 times what I paid for it. I don't know why the rating score is so bad but this is a very fun game, not necessarily an enormious amount of depth, but still very fun and fairly memorable. Sometimes thats all that matters, so definetly if it goes on sale go ahead and try it, you may not LOVE it but who doesn't like killing dinosaurs :)
6031	1	a	Simple, Low Price, Dinos, BadG &amp; Laggy Menus.  IGN 11/10
6033	1	a	This game is the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing best, Shooting dinosaurs whiel flying around. 50 cents? are you kidding me this is the deal of the century.
6035	1	a	Worst game? think again. This game is probably the best game I ever played: It is totally worth it for the price, it's a lot of fun with your friends and it has more gamemodes than any game out there (and good ones, like gungame, the usual survival and 1v1). The game is perfect, I mean, I played counter-strike for a long time and I thought it was like really good and the same happened to skyrim, but this one is different, in this game you are gonna have twice as much fun as you would on any coop game or even not coop games, you are gonna have way more fun in this game than in games like killing floor or portal (those games are pretty good as well tho). What I am saying is 'buy it, and buy it fast' cuz it's probably the best game you'll ever play in your entire life.
790	0	a	Eh you have to have a really good powerful PC to play this game and this game is terrible.
791	0	a	DO not play this game. It's not worth the bandwidth to download. Uninventive, ugly as hell, stiff, 99cents would still be a rip off
792	0	a	Here's all the 'strategy' in this game, fill a dino with bullets, buy a bigger gun, fill a dino with bigger bullets rinse and repeat.
793	0	a	Bought it for 93% off, one dollar, and was still disappointed.  At least the sound track is good. That's really the only compliment.  PS: They have a cash shop where they sell taunts and other stuff that is majorly unrefined, and is a blatant attempt at your money.
6037	1	a	I've paid a lot more for games not nearly this good. Halo plus dinos.
6039	1	a	got stuck into the body of a dinosaur  best experince of my life 10/10
804	0	a	For a game I have played for less than an hour, ORION: Dino Horde left a lasting expression on me. Not the kind of lasting expression that leaves a pleasent taste in your mouth, like tasting Auntie Anne's fresh home-brewed strawberry lemonade, more like the the type of expression that horribly scarrs you for the rest of your life.  I bought this game for a very steep price, like, dirt dirt cheap. I could have bought gum instead of this game, if that puts in perspective. This game, unlike gum, did not leave a good taste in my mouth, and I'm pretty sure a piece of Trident layers would have lasted me longer than this game.  Upon launching, I was greeted with a nearly 780 FPS loading screen, which subsequently dropped to an FPS of about 20. I can run solitaire at a good 25 FPS, so this game had no excuse. When entering the very first game ever with one of my friends who I talked into buying this game, promising him we can shoot dinosaurs in the face until the early morning. He called me a nerd, and he was right. I was a nerd who was sucked into this game under promises of shooting dinosaurs and having fun.   My hopes were smashed, and upon dying to a lag-spiked Triceratops who appeared to be doing the thriller, I called the game 'bad.' My friend also agreed, telling me I sucked quite an exorbant amount of male genitalia for making him buy this game. Alas, he was true. I do suck.  Not as much as this game though.  
6041	1	a	Its a good game worth .99 cents i love how strange the guns look
6043	1	a	.99 cent i played it longer then i ate a mc chicken... its better then some games i've paid more for.
6045	1	a	Mant people say this isn't a good game but it actually is. Give it a try and see how cool is to fight those dinosaurs with friends :D
6047	1	a	Fun, dumb game dont take it too seriously :)
6049	1	a	You can run dinosaurs over with a tank 10/10 
6051	1	a	This game, after playing it for 8 hours, has shocked me. The gameplay was way over my expectations, as well as the graphics. The game has many different modes to play like rampage, a ctf like game, survival, and many others, making it an all around fun game to play. I mean â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, it was $0.99
806	0	a	Back when this game was known as Dino Horde and cost $20 it was actually worth it however with the update to erase their metascore AGAIN they almost reverted back the wonderful interface they had from DH into the garbage beta interface that it is now, the gameplay is the same. Everything is pretty much the same except for the armors which now look even more horrible than how bad â™¥â™¥â™¥ they looked before. Its a good thing its only a dollar, because thats about how much its worth as of now.
6053	1	a	This game gave my friend an existential crisis and made my eyes bleed. All for the low fee of 0.99â‚¬  10/10
6055	1	a	I play this game when my thirst for life goes dangerously high
6057	1	a	Never wrote a review this long about a game but the reason why i wrote this was because i was tired of the negative reviews so here is my story: Bought the game when it was 99c and can say its 110% worth it, dont listen to the metacritic score or even listen to the negative people posting about this game. MOST people say its too much like halo.. but really? just because this is a SC-FI FPS game doesnt mean its halo.. the Damn game has dinosaurs how can you even start to think its like halo. i might as well say this game is like the movie avatar because they both have SC-FI and Mechs in it..then i might as well ALSO say that this game is like the new game coming out called TitianFall just because their is jetpacks and mechs..  Think of this game off a crossbreed off halo+killingFloor+Turok Halo beacuse it has SC-FI aspect to it Killing floor because it has a survial aspect to the game ( such of waves of dinos after you with side missions ) Turok simply because the dinosuars  Anyway their is plenty of game modes in it, very fun COOP, and so far loving the conquest mode. has day/night cycle , large maps that keep you exited ( Open world ) Mutliple basses and can loot boxs for gear/money to buy new weapons. And if you are tired of pairing up with teammates you can pick from the PvP game modes thats just as fun and can have a good laugh from it. even has GUNGAME mode in it and to top it off, you can even play as a dino yourself  you can also customize your guy as well which is pretty fun, stand out from the other players.   Graphics wise is pretty good so far, don't expect a battlefiled 4 style graphics but for what your paying for your getting a top notch game that the devs are constantly updating. even though the Orginal game they made back in 2012 ( dino beatdown) had negative reviews and didn't go so well, the devs didnt give up and made a huge update on this game.   Also check out there new project they are also working on called ' The Orion Project ' will definitely take some time before their new game comes out but check out the link below and you will be amazed at the ideas they are aiming for  https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/orionprelude/the-orion-project   Long story short, Dont judge this game and say its halo.. alot of games now days have zombie survial and having dinosaurs just makes this game different
6059	1	a	For others I guess it could be ok, more in F2P way. For me was a bad game overall. So I'll be never going back into playing this. But maybe you can check this and see how it suits you.  This seems to be the kind of game you need to try and see the results.  
6061	1	a	A game for 1â‚¬, and its still a fun a game, thats very rare. Its very fun if you have some m8's.
6063	1	a	Awesome game! one of the best in this genre!! just try it. 10/10
6065	1	a	This game is a great shooter that is tons of fun. A great game to play with friends and to play either PvP or rounds of horde against monsterous Dinos. The game can be a bit laggy and the animations are a little off but if you can put that aside it is a very addicting game and promises lots of fun. There are a decent number of weapons to equip and there are 3 classes you can choose from giving the player a nice variety when playing. Try out new guns and see how they destroy dinos as you try to survive.
6067	1	a	Funny. I liked it very much! :D
6069	1	a	Pure dumb fun. I mean, how often do you come across a game where you get to use lighsabers and flamethrowers and mechs against dinosaurs? It is certainly worth the dollar.
6071	1	a	this is a good game. great to play with friends
6073	1	a	Ten times better than Call of Duty. 11/10
6075	1	a	for 99 cents yeah.
6077	1	a	Glitch Simulator 2014 is an awesome game.  The overall experience is better than War Z. I give this game 9/10 because i couldnt find any dinosaurs! If the devs would add this, it would be Game of the year, all year.  Buy it, and give the devs extra monies via paypal!
6079	1	a	Would be flung by T Rex again and make love to on dark nights. 24/10
6081	1	a	An interesting mix of Dino's meets Killing Floor. Not a bad game but the lag is noticable, even as host which is annoying. Animations could be much smoother and enemy AI leaves much to be desired. Still though, for 1 dollar, it's a steal.
6083	1	a	It may be Glitchy as hell. Contain more bugs then any other games. Issues with just about everything but damn is this fun with a few friends!
6085	1	a	Now, I'm not going to say this game is great. It's pretty good. I enjoy playing it. But only the survival mode, usually on my own aswell. The rampage mode, where you play as the dinosaurs aswell, is buggy as hell. Humans are way too op. Can't wait for the Prequel, but right now, I'm not amazed. Still good game doh.
6087	1	a	If you have friends, you are going to love this game.  You will need a decent computer to avoid fps loss, however.
6089	1	a	I get it. You're looking at the Metacritic and going '36?!'  This is a SOLID game. It reminds me of Halo's horde mode. There's vehicles, jetpacks, perks, and giant dinos trying to eat you alive.  Many times, a game that is garbage is released and left to die. Not these guys. They kept working. After 2 years, they finally have the game that they promised.   http://artistryingames.com/spiraling-control-incredible-journey-spiral-game-studios/ 
6091	1	a	This game is EXTREMELY underrated. It has improved so much since all the crappy reviews it got 2 years ago. This is probally one of the funest games I have ever played! This game is pretty much Halo and Jurrasic Park put into one fun Multiplayer funtime game. You get to kill Dinosaurs, blow up Dinosaurs, stab Dinosaurs and get Turrents to kill Dinosaurs.  Did I mention you get to kill Dinosaurs?  Get this game while it is $1.00.  You will not regret it.
6093	1	a	You wake up, drenched in sweat. 'That same dream again?' Asks your wife, you glance back and your wife is now an oviraptor. You scream and nothing but bullets come out of your gaping mouth, the words appear on your wall, written in blood. 'ORION: Dino Horde'. You scream the words 'â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING BUY THIS GAME' (5/5)
6095	1	a	i recommend this gamne especially at co op
6097	1	a	This game reinvented the genre of railroad building tycoons for me! It is such a fast paced, off the wall rail shooter that really shines when it comes to famliy building exercises. The game is centered around an unnamed protagonist who is giving birth during a dinosaur attack. Now if that sounds crazy this will really knock your caboose right off your sockle doos, you are black!!!1111!!11!1!!1   Only if you decide to heal people like a little buttpooplickingâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. This game is a great baby care taking simulator because it has everything that a little rhino would need in order to get a hexakill and get 123125 AP. This game is also a great addition to anyone's collection of games because it redefines the entire genre of tower defense!!! Without only 0 towers to place you have to be sure to place them in very strategical places in order to stop those pesky brazillians from breaking into the dunkin donuts across the street from you. All in all this is a fantastic game that all pregnant mothers should pick up instantly!      Also includes one free C-Section.
6099	1	a	Halo with Dinosaurs
6101	1	a	This game is soooooo underrated its not even funny. I bought i for myself and three other friends and played it. I have to sa that i didn't expect to play it for 5 hours straight. Its amazingly fun and has many game modes. I was also impressed witht eh amount of detail the developers put into the game, the simple fact that you can play the newly added map and have to worry about your visor getting iced up is so funny and cool. The game is much better than the meta-score entails. If u read this before the free week is up try it out, and definately try out conquest. I would say more but i would be here for a while :D
6103	1	a	Don't trust in the Metascore rating, they're still upgrading the game. Best dino-killing game ever, give it a try!
6105	1	a	This game is comically bad. Kind of fun for short bouts of mindless shooting but it will never be the Halo it so desperately desires to be.
6107	1	a	Do you love COD zombies? Do you love to kill mobs of Dinosaurs? Do u love guns?  Then this game is great and very fun for you and friends.  Worth the price! Enjoy!
6109	1	a	It's aiight.
6111	1	a	Sold a duplicate Portal 2 trading card to get the money for this game. Went in, played, and was eaten by a t-rex.  11/10
6113	1	a	I was hiding on top of a cliff I accessed with my jetpack wielding a rapid firing grenade launcher since everyone knows dinosaurs only hurt when they bite. T-rex proceeds to pick up rock with his mouth, throw it, and instakill me.  10/10 would Michael Bay Jurassic Park again
6115	1	a	I've seen the steam key giveaway in the begining of the month... so I tried... Everytime I could not get one. Well the heck with that, I decided to buy the game some days ago (1 dollar is cheap) well... WELL... WELL.... MOST AWESOME GAME OF THE TIME. I mean FOR REAL! No micro transaction, no paying dlc, fun games, dinosaurs and kinda old school: all I searched for! A plus is the community ;) thanks for making this happen! I have faith in the future of video games again because people like you put passion and pleasure into your games and the players can enjoy it fully! :) Well be right back I have to eat some humans now
6117	1	a	This game is as terrible as its metacritic score, Steam should be ashamed for selling this junk...
6119	1	a	If you've got like 4 friends who really like either dinosaurs or shooting things this is going to be a blast for you. Easily 10 hours of gameplay.   And then theres people like me who like driving people around in awesome vehicles. I'm kinda wierd but this game scratches that itch too.   Just call me Mr. Transporter.
6121	1	a	Ever want to kill Dinosaurs?? but you never had the chance because they're dead? Well this is a game for you. All you do is just kill dinosaurs and run around doing small task and kill dinosaurs!  10/10
6123	1	a	You can powerlevel like mad  10/10 would grind again
6125	1	a	This game is truly a masterpiece if anything this deserves the top list i never found a game company who was willing to work on a game this long this people are comitted and are really nice the game is badass GET IT!
6127	1	a	Awsome game, very fast-paced and it can get overwelming at times, but once you get used to it you will enjoy it. now watch out for compies
6129	1	a	Now when I bought this game I thought it would just be a cheap dinosaur game, but I was wrong. This game is amazing, I recommend it to everybody who loves Halo because it kind of has that halo futeristic style feeling. Good Job guys at spiral!  Pros: 1. So many achievements (I'm an achievement junkie) 2. Gamemodes are great 3. Fun single player and multiplayer experience 4. Great gameplay 5. Great controls  And why did Metacritic hate this game so much?
6131	1	a	omg, this game is my game of 1994, the graphics are amzing, no bugs and a huge amount of servers to choose from with an active community.  10/10 would run on vista again.
6133	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
6135	1	a	The support class has a bad â™¥â™¥â™¥ black man voice. 10/10
6137	1	a	There are lightsabers.... 11/10
6139	1	a	its a kick in the â™¥â™¥â™¥ cream and a Super Fat Dirty â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to the face
6141	1	a	WOW, this reminds me of unreal tournament and at the moment just 79 its incredible value, fight against dinosaurs or other human players, fantastic 
6143	1	a	This has to be one of my favourite games ever. yeah its a bit buggy so who cares. the graphics are not the greatest so what. the game is difficult who cares. You get to mow down the cast of jurassic park. i could make a whole list on why i would recommend this game but i don't really have to play the game and youll see why i think this is a great game
6145	1	a	the graphics look like Halo CE. Other than that great job :melon:
6147	1	a	If this game was an old dog, i'd have it put down. 10/10 will never play again.
6149	1	a	this game is everything i was looking for
6151	1	a	ARIZONA Vs. ORION: Prelude  I played this game for a total of 33 minutes, this includes the time I spent trying to find a server to play on. The game is worth $0.99 with no sale. Do you know what else is worth $0.99? A can of Arizona ice tea. I caculated the time I would spend to consume the beverage. ORION: Prelude gave me more time of enjoyment than an Arizona ice tea for the same price.   PLEASE READ: I didn't caculate the amount of enjoyment that one may find playing with the aluminum can after the liquid is consumed. Activities like squishing it aganist your head, stomping on it, cutting it open than poking your friends with the sharp edge and playing the game where you flick the can opener to see if you can flick it off. All these activities are equally, if not, more fun than ORION: Prelude, ORION: Dino Horde, Dino Beatdown etc.  
6153	1	a	This is one of the greatest steals on steam. For the money you would spend on a 2-liter you can have hours of dino-shooting-madness with 3 friends.
6155	1	a	Besty game 2010 cooldnt ask 4 betr game to b made, jk! This game peice of crap in bumhole! Cant even no scope nothin caus guns only pistols god damm jesuz plz! orio prelube is 0/100 even for 1 dollar is still squabbly to play. Cant even get startd to play be4 i die to DAMM RAPTORS OF DEATH! dc approved this game because of marvel iron man. plz ackowledg me cause i really good at leegue of leggings.
810	0	a	There is no learning curve or anything. When I started the game, I just got dropped in a menu, which let me connect to a game. I joined a game with the easy difficulty, and found myself dying very often in the 15 minutes I played. Furthermore, the game feels unnatural, and the graphics are weak for the system requirements. Furthermore, I experienced lots of lag when many dino's spawned.
6157	1	a	Cheap and awesome
6159	1	a	I saw the rating for the game was a 36/100, but that was a bit of a lie. This game is actually quite fun and challenging. I highly recommend this game if you liked Killing Floor or Sanctum. It's a bit of both games.
6161	1	a	We all bought this game as a joke because of the price and we had read the reviews of how terrible this game was. At one point, yes, this game was probably the worst game on Steam. Whatever the developers did in between then and now, it actually turned out to be quite fun. The graphics are actually pretty good (especially the weather effects), the controls feel solid, and it's fun to shoot dinosaurs.  There aren't are lot of classes (four) but the ones they have are unique and fill their roles admirably. The maps are huge and the vehicles are a blast to drive.  This game is 100% better if you have a small group of friends to play to log on with and just joke around killing dinos. For $0.99 everyone should probably own this game.
6163	1	a	i havent played it but from markipliers video on it i would have found it pretty enjoyable. my pc was too much crap to run it.
6165	1	a	this game is really fun, worth playing. totally worth it 
6167	1	a	This game isn't exactly one that has deep gameplay but well, shooting apart a bunch of dinosaurs with friends is just plain fun. If you grab it during a sale you'll probably get your money's worth.
6169	1	a	This game doesnt even work :) turn off!
6171	1	a	Good ol' dinosaur vs. human gameplay. It's similar to Dino D-Day or Primal Carnage.   You can play as a variety of dinosaurs in the Rampage gamemode, including a generic dromaeosaur, T. rex, Spinosaurus, and two pterosaurs. In any other mode, you'll play as one of three human classes; the Assault, Support, and the Recon.   It's fun to play with friends, but playing alone can be a challenge.
6173	1	a	'Just Do It' - Shia Labeouf
6175	1	a	Mmmmm i wouldnt say it's bad.. but i wouldnt call it that great either... servers need more workin on... other than that if u like hordes and hordes of crazed dinos chasin u then be my guest and get this game
6177	1	a	A bad clone of killing floor mixed with a bad clone of unreal tournament mixed with a bad clone of jedi academy. What's not to love?
6179	1	a	The metascore is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, this game rules.
6181	1	a	i love the game but every time i try to play multi player it frezes right as it loads the map
6183	1	a	awsome game
6185	1	a	The last few times I played this with friends I was eaten by a T-Rex 4 different times. A+ would play again.
6187	1	a	it's like halo but with dinosaurs 10/10
6189	1	a	One time I was killin a trex and then out came a mother flippin jet and I was like ahhhhh yeah.
6191	1	a	this game is underated but buy it on a sale
6193	1	a	Why did I buy it. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
813	0	a	Wonky Animations and Low Res Menus that will make your eyes bleed.  ****/10
814	0	a	This game is so confusing I have no idea what the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ was going on but there were dinosaurs. 0/10 game 10/10 dinosaur experience.
6195	1	a	I nominated it for the 'i'm not crying, there's something in my eye' award.  I'll never see that 49 cents again :(
6197	1	a	Pretty much Halo with dinosaurs.
6199	1	a	Orion: Prelude, more like Orion PreLUBE ME UP AND TOUCH MY â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ THIS IS GOOD.  Not as catchy but I feel like the 2015 GOTY Edition Should be named that.  My Review- Ever wanted to be sent back in time and forced to shoot pixels at larger pixels making 18bit roars that you pretend you can hear so you dont instult the artistic immersion of this 2017 GOTY Blockbuster. Then this is the game for you. It has been designed with such pazaz that even Micheal Bay would be put to shame.   As for the graphics; they are so sharp and crisp I really believed I was sent back to 240p Jurrassic Era to slay Pixel mosters. The MMO elements work so well. You get all the satisfaction of playing WOW (staying a virgin for life, being fat and contemplating suicide) but it occurs even faster as the community is so polite. Honesty is the #1 Policy with these kind kiddos. They're all so honest as they're all 'banged my mum'.   The story is truely the most immersive experience since the holocaust. It's the most realistic story of any Pixel Dinosaur FPS Potato Teir PC Blockbuster in the history of this Klan.  The developers are a small team of PJ wearers from Tennessee. They have simple values, slaying blacks, white supremecy. The stuff us normies are too afraid to admit. They stand for whats right. AND OMG Their XMAS decorations are the best. They string up black folks on trees. So romantic. Regardless they're storming the white house soon to remove the ape who kidnapped Mr Bush. Y'all should join in. Unless y'alls some filthy ape lovers....  Regardless, 10/10 game with and amazing multiplayer, Potato Teir Graphics to make even the IRA proud, and last but not least a small indie team that has true murican beliefs. MURICA
815	0	a	This game is so confusing I have no idea what the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ was going on but there were dinosaurs. 0/10 game 10/10 dinosaur experience.
6201	1	a	I nominated it for the 'i'm not crying, there's something in my eye' award.  I'll never see that 49 cents again :(
6203	1	a	This game is easily the best game ive ever played, you get jet packs and advanced weaponry and the dino AI is easily the best i've ever seen/played/worshiped in all my years of gaming. Not only that but the super realistic rag doll physics will blow your mind and leave you on the edge of your seats when you kill a T-rex and watch in awe as it does double and even triple back flips and then proceeds to break dance on the spot. Truly the best experience one could hope to have killing dino's with advanced technology.   And at the low low price of 1$ (during the steam sale) you would be an absolute fool to not buy this game on the spot and giggle in glee as you and your friends shoot and destroy dinos with various vehicles and weapons.   Game of the year 2013/2014/2015.  Buy it now.  9001/9001  2 1337 4 M3
6205	1	a	This game is easily the best game ive ever played, you get jet packs and advanced weaponry and the dino AI is easily the best i've ever seen/played/worshiped in all my years of gaming. Not only that but the super realistic rag doll physics will blow your mind and leave you on the edge of your seats when you kill a T-rex and watch in awe as it does double and even triple back flips and then proceeds to break dance on the spot.

6211	1	a	Shoot dinos and hope for the best   9/11 i give
6213	1	a	A fun, Action, Adventure, and educational to how Dinosaur's hunting habits in a way. :3
6215	1	a	I rode around and killed a T-rex on my jeep with a machine gun mounted on it, shortly after, a Triceratops came from around a rock and ambushed it, hurling it 50 feet up into the air. It then blew up and i nearly died but escaped. Once out I hid in a dead stegosaurus's hollow body to shelter from the hordes of raptors. 10/10 especially with friends
6217	1	a	literally the best game of all time  â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ dilos tho  11/10 buy now
6219	1	a	Since its $1 im going to ask myself this: Was this more enjoyable then something on the dollar menu at a fast food joint? Short answer Yes Long answer HELL YESSSSS brings me back to when i played turok as a kid 8/10
6221	1	a	great game.
6223	1	a	Orion: Prelude is a mixed bag, but definitely a lot of fun...and for the price you really can't go wrong. Co-op with friends is a total blast.  Also, dinosaurs!
818	0	a	10/10 would recommend
6225	1	a	wtf were those guys smoking when they made this
6227	1	a	A decent and simple game, basicly you just shoot dinos :D it's a lot of fun

820	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game i bought it and now i cant play it â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥!!!
821	0	a	Not even worth the dollar I paid for it. The dinosaurs always charge straight in on you. You have 60 seconds to run halfwya across them map to restock and back again which is unecessarily short. Most of the time I have no idea what's going on or why.
6229	1	a	You can kill T-Rex'es with a Lightsaber. You can also get eaten by them. 9,8/10
6231	1	a	Well worth it's price tag of $1. It has Dinos and guns! That's all you need. Dinos come at you in hordes/waves and you fight them off.
6233	1	a	Classic survival game,can be fun with a friend and there is a lots of achievements for hunters!Graphics are not that bad there is a day and night cycle and rainy weather.8/10
6235	1	a	I love this game, better then tripple A titles such as AC Unity and Arkham Knight. 7/10.
6237	1	a	0/10 would not buy again
6239	1	a	A lot better than Dino Horde, absolutly love this from a open-world/dinomode/co-op perspective
6241	1	a	This game is very entertaining. Even though the graphics are'nt the best and the controls take a while to get used to it is still a fun game.
6243	1	a	Punched a dinosaur. 30-10
6245	1	a	You paying only 99 cents, you can play the great game like paying 59 dollars 99 cents.  Very fun, many mode, good graphic, but you paying only 99 cents.  It's the best!!!
828	0	a	Crashes when i change mouse sensitivity or anything else in options. Not buggy anymore my perforated â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
829	0	a	this game lags on my god computer, with glitchy dinos bad servers and weapons that feel as unsatifying and hard to aim as possible. the game mecanics arte repetive and often break. i went int this agem thinking this look reasonably good. NO dont even try. its all well and good adding more items and features they are good and its a good idea but they need to fix the gameplay and i dont think they would be able to address thewse issued as they would probibly have to rebuild the engine. F*** no never again.   as of 25th feb 2014 (i dont think it will improve)
6247	1	a	A good game to screw around in, if you fancy a coop game of driving around it a turrented jeep, while your friend uses the turrent to kill the bigguns, you simply run over the smaller one. Or if you fancy a minor challenge go to conquest and save up cash for a helicopter and then rain death and destruction on the ground. Not complicated, fun to play, and easier to adapt too i reccomend this game
6249	1	a	Very few developers keep in mind what makes games fun but these folks are on the right track. Yeah, sure there are things needing improvement here and there but overall this game is F-U-N. It's old skool, it's ridiculous and cool at the same time. I've paid 60 bucks for games not even nearly as fun as this. My gaming buds and I find this title very pleasing to play and doesn't look half bad either :)
6251	1	a	This game is very entertaining. Even though the graphics are'nt the best and the controls take a while to get used to it is still a fun game.
6253	1	a	Great game so far!
6255	1	a	Don't believe the metacritic rating. Fantastic constantly updated co-op shooter in the style of L4D. Here's to hoping that dinosaurs are the new zombies.
830	0	a	Junk.  Laggy, boring, ugly and (as should be obvious) very few people play.  This game has been out for 2 years, gotten several updates, and is still unbalanced and glitchy.  If you paid a buck for this, you got ripped off.  If someone gave you a copy for free, slap that person for having anything to do with this and get a real game.  Edit:  You know what? I'm not even done. I'm going to rant a bit more.  I gave this game extra time, hoping something, ANYTHING would get better. My time was wasted.  Most of the guns feel the same, aka single or burst fire, and very very weak. Depending on lag, a raptor may take up to 2 - 3 pistol clips to kill, and half to a full rifle clip to kill. The poison spitters, in addition to being able to hit you almost anywhere, shooting nonstop and leaving toxic puddles everywhere, seem to have maybe 25% to 50% of a boss dinos health (aka ridiculously hard to kill, especially early game, on easy, and considering how many spawn).  The average credits per dino is about 100, and the guns/upgrades start at about 1500 (for weak pistols) up to around 5000 for the better upgrades and guns.  And when you die? You lose it ALL.  There is a lives system that's actually more like the pickup system in Borderlands, but if you get locked in a corner where your team can't reach you and you can't get a kill (which happens quite a bit), all those extra lives basically mean nothing.  And while you do get some credits for damage done to a dino, it's going to be more like 20-30 credits if you have teammates helping.  There's not very much to say about the sound, as aside from the occasional roar, there is the non-stop, annoying TAPTAPTAPTAPTAPTAP of you putting dozens of rounds into a single dinosaur, over, and over and over.  Oh and hey, there's a leveling system, where you do get very very minor buffs in exchange for long hours of slow grinding. 10% damage boost for my super weak pistols? Yes please! Each class has levels of it's own with almost exactly identical skills as other classes, to give you that wonderful feeling of starting from scratch for trying different characters?? Woot!  Ok, Now I'm done.
6257	1	a	Probably one of the worst games I own. This is the most fun I have had in a LONG time.
831	0	a	What do you get when you cross rampaging dinosaurs with jetpacks,explosions,sci-fi action and co-op gameplay? An awesome videogame idea.What do you get when you play ORION: Dino Horde? A terrible,terrible experience. Dino Horde is easily one of the worst games I've ever played.Not only is it badly made,poorly executed,ridiculously framed, and badly coded.It's just unplayable game  Donâ€™t bother.Save your money.If you want an engaging sci-fi cooperative experience,buy Natural Selection 2 instead !!! :)
6259	1	a	Simply Outstanding, the game co-produced by Peter Jackson really emits a sense of feeling and character to the player. The narrative is excellent, one in which all games should follow. The scenes have so much depth to them and when jimmie was molested by a pterodactyle i may of even shed a tear. The attachments that you grow with the players is like no other game i've ever experienced. The title of this game is extremly misleading, i thought it was going to be a wrestling game but i found out it was no other than a RSPCA animal saving simulator. The crew is incharge of rescueing the remaining dinosaurs of southern uzbekistan. One of the standout scenes of this game was when the raptor had recieved a splinter in his foot. You could see that the team were really doing their job, helping out with the local wildlife. Not only is this game compelling in both its narrative and its gameplay it also manages to be one of the must humour-filled experiences of my life. I couldnt help emitting into a cacophony of laughter clawing my eyes out in hysterics, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ uncontrollably. There was even one stage when me and my friends where laughing so hard we liquified and proceeded to melt into a puddle together amongst feces, urine and blood. Samuel L Blackson also makes a cameo aswell as amanda todd, trying to join the crew. I still cant believe this was only 10 dollars, aswell as the extremly raving metascore it recieved. This is definataly my GOTY for 2012, and i have already logged over 2,300 hours. This game has shifted me as a person into a new form, and provided me with enjoyment of monumental levels. Im very grateful that the developers removed dino pubes in patch 3 or this game wouldnt be as enjoyable. With a trilogy in the makes and a movie directed by Steven Spielberg, aswell as its extraordinarily amazing soundtrack produced in studio by mozart and beethoven and snoop dogg (snoop lion). Aswell it is now sponsored by burger king, with their new Onion-Rings-In-Oil-Now item and Mountain dew's patented Dino Dew. This Is As Good As It Gets. 100/100
6261	1	a	Best Game for under Â£1 Great fun pure bants
6263	1	a	0.5 dollar play with 4 friends worth it.
6265	1	a	in this game u can shoot with guns so if u like shooting game u like this game but also not every one like shoot animals(dinosaur) so if u hate animal shoot u dont like this game :)
6267	1	a	If y0u like Killing Floor , then your g0nna love this game :)  Watch out for the T-rex   x
832	0	a	It's ORION: Dino Horde.
833	0	a	A shoddily made wave defense game.
6269	1	a	This game is really, really bad, but it's also pretty fun.
835	0	a	Terrible, 'nuff said
836	0	a	tHIS GAME IS THE WORST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!tHERE IS SO MUCH LAG AND IT IS LOW quality. 1/10
837	0	a	A game of the year contender for 1492. A great pile of dog â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is this game. I love the lag and how poorly optimized this is. I got for the price of free. My 'special' friend gave it to me. The multiplayer is just as great* i was a laggy T-Rex munching on wannabe Spartans from Halo. Of course the object of this game is to survive the world's laggiest envirments and cute Dino puppys. Overall this game is the aborted child of Jurassic Park and Halo. Its a gr8 b8 m8 i r8 8/8 jk i h8 this game and id rather masturb8 to german dungeon porn. A book of the year and a gr8 contender for the Grammys. In the end this game gets 0/0 would not rate again.   * Great=Bad Kids if you buy this game full price play russian roulete with a RPG. I am not liable for any injuries from activities i have suggested in this review.
838	0	a	I know why it's 99 cents. 'MICRO TRANSACTIONS'
839	0	a	The only thing that is cool about this game is that you get to shoot dinos otherwise it is like quake went stonage minus the fun.
840	0	a	i wanted to throw up
841	0	a	The budget for this game must have been $2 :(
6271	1	a	Is geym of shot dinosuar. Meny fun time to have. Can have roketlaunch an go boom on dino hed. HAHA! 10/10
6273	1	a	This game has some serious future. Only read new reviews, old ones are from the Beatdown period.  Ingame purchases aren't needed because you can get as much points just by playing.  Graphics are amazing, and if you put low-number-of-bugs besides, this is a hell of a game.  9/10, would recommend to everyone.
6275	1	a	Mad, Frantic, Buggy, AWESOME. This game has got it all. Punch a raptor in the face. Done. Get eaten by T-Rex. Done. Get carried away by a Pteradon. Done. A crazy game who's charm far outweighs it's buggy nature. Great fun to play survival. PVP is not the best but you be the judge. Check it out.
6277	1	a	Rode a T-Rex then got eaten - 9/10
6279	1	a	This game is like halo and dinosaurs combined into one! I would reccomend it to anyone even if your new to the game. 
6281	1	a	It has potential.  First Game - My ping was way too high, I couldn't communicate with my teammate, nor hit a computer controlled dinosaur. (I disconnected) Second Game - I hosted it myself, FPS was SO bad, said game in question isn't even close to being optimized for any gaming computer known to man. I lower all my settings which did nothing, so I decided I need to restart the game for this to take effect. (I disconnected) Third Game - I join another matchmaking game in progress, my FPS is fine with the graphics settings all at plebian tier levels, ping is fine, I have no clue what I am doing, the game is telling me to go from this point to that point. YELLING out commands. Host has left the server. (I am forced to disconnect) (I exit the game in disgust) 
6283	1	a	If you love Horde mode, and you love dinosaurs, get ready for the ride of nothingness, because this game is terrible.  EDIT: OK, it's currently a dollar. You can't NOT buy it for a dollar. You and 4 friends can get down for less than having 5 on it. You put FIIIIIVE on it. Dino Horde; get Steam Keys. You put FIIIIIIVE on it. Play it on that low end riiiig
6285	1	a	Nice game  good graphics
6287	1	a	I r8 8/8 m8 Totally worth my 50 cents
850	0	a	This game is literally not even a game. Like, what gives, dude. I played for thirty minutes and could not join a game and it would constantly crash. Then, I actually join in a 'game' and see nothing and I have to run 2500m to get to the 'playing' area. Then, there were dinosaurs and they
6289	1	a	This game fondled me greately. With such beautiful graphics and a compelling storyline how can you not have fun with it?  Definately worth the Â£1 i spent on it and I would go as far as to say I feel like I ripped off the creators! 10/9 what a steal indeed
6291	1	a	If you ever thought 'Man, I lreally ike Halo, but what it was really missing was some dinosaur action' and then they took away all the Covenant and Flood, all the story, and added nothing but dinosaurs that seem to want to eat power stations, and your job is to commit genocide on the dinosaurs....  Then this is the game for you! p.s. If you paid more than 99 cents for this game, then you paid too much
6293	1	a	To be completely honest this game really isnâ€™t that bad, it has become a better game than it was before. The graphics are decent, the music is great and the gameplay is pretty smooth and fun. The game still is a bit buggy but it is worth a buy in my opinion. 7/10
851	0	a	save your money...bad optimization, poor framerates, super laggy even with good internet connection.
6295	1	a	One dollar and you will be addicted. This game is just so fun and simple to play. Team based fast paced shooter where you kill a bunch of dinosaurs. 11/10 a must have for everyone library for a simple dollar.
6297	1	a	Let's be honest - this game is seriously outdated. But you can still have some fun if you find any friends willing to join you, cause multiplayer is almost dead. I bought it for 13 russian roubles (which is $0.25 now) so it's the cheapest non-free-to-play game ever. Dirt cheap.
852	0	a	Wouldn't recommend it but can be a fun distraction. Depending on what you like you can find some enjoyment out of it.
6299	1	a	Do you like killing dinosaurs and are on a budget?! Then grab your high powered bow cause its killing time.  A simple arcane like defense came where you gain credits after every round to buy new skills and perks along with weapons depending on your class (and some neutral ones that everyone can buy) to help you survive the increasing hordes of small an large dinosaurs.  Featuring a couple game types, you defend a generator from waves of enemies with vehicles and weapons. They perks allow certain feats to be obtained, like jumping high, being able to heal machines (as a medic) and many many more.  Several different types of dinosaurs are present in this game, like pterodactyls, raptors, t-rex and spinosaurus. Depending on the round and which objective is present, certain dinos will spawn. These large giants are considered the bosses of the game, having very high health pools and insanely high damage.  While the game isn't hard to master, and very easy to understand, I found it got boring playing by yourself or with random people online. I would recommend playing with a friend or two if you can.  Its really cheap when its not on sale and a steal when it is. Give it a try, you will get atleast a couple hours out of it at the very least.  Personal Rating: 2.5/5
6301	1	a	Doesn't seem to run very well with AMD graphics cards.
854	0	a	I wouldn't call this the worst game in the world, but it is definitly not a quality title. Before playing the game for free, I saw the trailer and instantly knew that the developers were giving their own game praise. The quotes about the game being good had no references. After playing the game, I can say that my theory was right. The human vs human games were poor man versions of halo and though the human vs dino parts are sorta fun with other people, there were three things that dragged this down; lag, crashes and extremely poor level design. It could be worth getting due to it being on sale for a dollar, but if you want to survive waves of enemies with friends, I suggest playing the man vs machine mode in tf2.
6303	1	a	''The most fun I've had since watching a hippo with explosive diarrhea. 10/10''
6305	1	a	This game doesn't deserve as bad a meta-score as it has been given. I can honestly say, I was happy to purchase five copies. And everyone I know who took a chance and bought this game on a whim have all been excitedly surprised and have maybe even had as much fun as I have. The survival (which is all I can speak for) game-mode is really satisfying and definitely scratches that itch the original 'Zombies' console shooter infected me with. As far as I'm concerned, all the other game modes are just extra fun icing on a really yummy dino-blasted cake. If you were expecting Halo6Doom128 with the super epic plot twist bulletquicktime minigames...please resume playing the other shooters. But if you wanna try somethin' a little different and you enjoy shooter games that have 'vending machines' and waves of enemies to eliminate give Orion:Dino Horde a try, you'll probably really have fun with it if you give it a real chance.

6309	1	a	ORION: Prelude is really simple. Just get your damned weapons and shoot the damned dinosaur. Recommended weapon would be rocket launcher. P.S. I don't remember much of this game.
6311	1	a	I'm shooting giant crocodiles with tanks, buy it now it's on sale.
861	0	a	Well it turns out that my review of 'Don't buy this it's junk.' wasn't helpful. So here's a more in depth one.  ----  Don't buy this! Even at 0.79p it's to expensive! The net code is rubbish. The leveling system bad. The AI terrible. The guns, well, not to bad actually. It just feels unfinished and slow even on my over the top PC.  If you want to spend time on a computer game you can find much better ones out there.
6313	1	a	update for v3.0 This is my review of Orion Prelude I will not be comparing it to its past versions Orion Beatdown or Orion Dino horde, nor go into the devs back story. You want to know about THIS GAME not of its past. Orion Prelude is a first/third person shooter where its main game modes are to kill dinos to survive or to try and kill an opposite team.     There are a couple pvp modes but there aren't many people(you may find one or two servers) playing. The only pvp mode that gets love is Vital. This is a interesting Idea and is fun, but can have problems. Vital you have two teams of five each of you have a generator which you must protect from the dinos which only thing they do in life is kill you and your generator. As you kill you get credits you usually use them to upgrade yourself and get weapons but in Vital you can mess with your enemy's dino spawn. you can increase damage that dino deal, how many dinos spawn, and give them big dinos as a present and I feel its balance there. problems are with the players. It's doesn't have a balance system so instead it can be 4 old with 1 new vs 4 new and 1 old player its fun but you have to be careful . also this game mode will take you 1-3 hours(it may drag on) to beat and is really the greatest with a full team.    There are also three survival modes one named survival, conquest, and Slaughter. survival last around 40-50 mins in the most of the difficulties and your goal is to survival 10 rounds of dinos, how? by protecting your generator also you will have to go to outposts and capture them every 4ish rounds. You can buy weapons and upgrades in between rounds before the killing begins again.    Conquest is a copy and paste of survival but on a HUGE map, has 30 rounds, is 2-3 hours, and you can also buy jeeps, tanks, heles, and so on. It's fun but only use dedicated servers for if the host leaves then the game ends.    Slaughter is endless slaughter( I know what a surprise!) there are no rounds for you just keep getting hit by dinos you will be given guns and ammo over time and the longest I have survive is 20ish minutes and it's a good mode. in all, I play them at different times but each one is different and all are fun so I would suggest you try them all.   now that will give you a idea of the game itself I'm sure you have some other questions. (if I miss any please do not be afraid to ask for I will add it to the list, thank you.)  1. how does it run: it has always run well for me(60fps or higher) on ether of my pcs but I have heard that it runs better now than ever for some people who have had problems before.  2. sounds: Since 3.0 all weapon sounds have been redone/edited this has really made the games feel deadly. I have found one or two that I don't like but its an overall improvement.  3. graphics: Improved since 3.0, all maps look and feel better then they were and the new maps (2 which have been added in 3.0) are really well done.  4. how does it control?: good question, on mouse and keyboard like other good fps and controller  support is only for the 360pad, from what I hear its good there to.  5 modules: great don't have any problems with that. Although it's fun when the T-rex model flies in the air after killing it!  6. guns: you will see some guns that look semi normal but many are very cool and fun to just look at.   all in all its a great game. Its not a AAA title but you can sink some time in this. I would suggest this to poeple who loves first person and third person shooters. I feel you would have as much fun with yourself as you will online. also there is steam workshop to make maps so If you like making maps then you might want to get this to. (Note: workshop is stuck in beta mode until a bug can be fixed)  7. score: 9/10. v3.0 really has made this game shine its not prefect but its a great game.  p.s. If you have a question please ask.
862	0	a	Don't waste your time on this one.
863	0	a	the only fun thing to say about this game is to say how bad it is.
864	0	a	THIS is a paid game..? Even for 99 cents, ist a waste money...

866	0	a	6/10
867	0	a	You are wasting money if you are going to buy this game for 0,99 cents,believe me it's not worth that money. The game is buggy and they are too many glitches,bad gameplay. Anyway it's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥!
868	0	a	The best thing I can say about this is: 'it's a game.'

872	0	a	Hands down one of the most boring games I have ever played. I suppose if you're interested in killing waves of dinosaurs in mundane locations you may enjoy this game, but the game is awfully boring hence the dollar price tag and constant sale for .50 cents. Plus you have the fact the developer is shady and probaly about to be sued.  'Just so people are aware, this game's name use to be Orion Dino Beat Down, and they changed the name and re released it multiple times as a new game just to keep people from seeing all of the negative feedback it was getting. This is the same game that utilizes stolen assets and the head of Trek Industries, formerly spiral game studios fired the real team working on it just before release without paying them. I'm writing this review now because they are attempting to get out of a DMCA and possible suit of their new game 'Orion' where they are literally doing the same exact thing and trying to play the victim. I bought this game before even knowing all of this, and felt so dirty for doing so, and im hoping and urging people away from buying into this mistake and scum of a company.' - ViziTronMan 
6315	1	a	Awsome game
6317	1	a	This game makes me think I'm retRded 11/10 but it's still kinda fun
6319	1	a	Emotionally charged, rampant with memorable imagery. Orion: Dino Horde is a philosophical adventure that only one with a liberal amount of experimental sexuality will properly enjoy. The rush of adrenaline is unparallelled to any carny ride or action film in current existence. Fun with friends and loved ones, not really recommended for young children or pregnant women.  In short: more fun than it has any right to be
6321	1	a	This game is the reason Ebola struck back. Let me explain:  Ebola was having a nice day on Steam playing a bit of DayZ. He went onto the store page and there it was, for the 7th time that month - Orion: Prelude was on sale for dirt again. Ebola wept for humanity as he clicked the 'purchase' button and supplied Gabe with a 79p donut.   Ebola joined a game with his friend Aids and started playing this badly ported Xbox original indie game. Ebola said 'â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥' , went out of his mudhut and infected the West Africans.  The end.   INCASE YOU DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT, THIS GAME SUCKS.
6323	1	a	this game is so cool i love it 
6325	1	a	This game gets a lot of bad reviews that are very true but what did they think the game was gunna be? its about Storm Troopers killing T-rex's and it cost way too much but if you by it on sale and want a fun lan party game its very good becuase of how bad it is like a lot of old movies. Artemis the space ship simulator game is a amazing lan game that i would recommend before this and is worth the large price tag but is as of now not avalible through steam. 
6327	1	a	The Customer base is relativly small, but this game has come leaps and bounds from when it was released. It is a satisfying experience upgradding your favorite class and taking down a T-Rex 1 on 1 or maybe even a spinosaurusl. So give it a chance and you wont be disappointed.
6329	1	a	It is fun :)
6331	1	a	When it first came out, it was totally â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Now, they actually polished it real well and it is pretty fun. Great team game.
6333	1	a	Great dinosaur arena game eventhough the meta score is low i love playing it with friends. There are ten different types of dinosaurs and six different types of vehicles. You have to make it threw a few rounds and capture a couple outposts to win the game but all in all it is definantly worth the money it costs!
6335	1	a	Doesn't take itself seriously at all and doesn't really need to, either. Basic but fun.
6337	1	a	when i had this game for two day trail i was like AWESOME (when is this going to be another two day trail)
6339	1	a	Haven't played it, but it sure looks gewd
6341	1	a	This was such a mess after release xD But 3 years later and for a price of 1$ defenetly worth it. This is the best example to change a hughe mess into something decent and fun. See it as a Dino Survial shooter with vehicles and really nice maps. Grab it up for 0.49-1$ you cant do anything wrong for that price.
878	0	a	â˜†â˜†â˜†â˜†â˜†   Pure trash. That's why it went down in price to a mere .49 cents. But go ahead purchase it. Because some of you will think 'It can't be that bad is it?'.
6343	1	a	Bought it at 99 cents and it worth every penny and more! Haven't played it a lot yet but from what I did play it was already worth the 99 cents.
6345	1	a	someone said it better then cod ghost LOL for me this game cost 1$ i think it too low because quality of this game is good then cod ghost sorry for my eng and i hope you guy understand me :) 
879	0	a	It's Left for Dead with dinosaurs. Except you're protecting a thing, and it takes too long to get to the thing from the shops.
6347	1	a	I don't even own this game!
6349	1	a	Played this during the free weekend. Not a good game by any stretch of the imagination, but if you can grab a few friends it quickly becomes a very silly and entertaining game.
6351	1	a	Orion: Dino Horde is an interesting, multi-player game. Although the concept of Dino Carnage With Friends has already come into play, Orion Dino Horde does it well, with science fiction laser weapons, the ability to play as a dinosaur, special objectives, and three special classes, all with a useful mechanic to help win a game. However, I found lag an issue on a computer like mine, 500 mb hard drive, 4 gb RAM, and lowest quality on the game, but i still had 20 fps. If you have a good computer, its a good game, but otherwise invest in something else. I still recommend it though. 7/10
882	0	a	yeah if we could stop it with all the dinosaur games  that would be nice.
883	0	a	Don't buy it... you'll never play it
6353	1	a	dont play this game
884	0	a	Don't buy it... you'll never play it
885	0	a	yeah if we could stop it with all the dinosaur games  that would be nice.
886	0	a	Piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
6355	1	a	Fly through the air with a jetpack cutting up T-Rexes with laser swords. 10/10
6357	1	a	the trexes are almost impossible to kill 
6359	1	a	better than sex
6361	1	a	Its amazing and awsome but pleas fix the lag and also add a allasaures. 
6363	1	a	Seriously, do not be fooled this game can provide hours of fun alone or with friends! The dinosaurs are bad â™¥â™¥â™¥ and the gameplay is way better than you would expect. Buy it on sale though 15 bucks is a rip off. I got it for like 3 or 4 dollars.
6365	1	a	A must have Coop game to play with your fellow friend, family and your lovely girl friend. -Character customization and gender! -Hot graphic! -Ton of vehicle to drive and fly! -Large map to run around! -Time cycle and Weather systems! -Big dino! ETC  Cant believe this game cost me just 1$! Where are the donation button. 
888	0	a	Abortion of a game.
889	0	a	Why am I constantly strafing left?
6367	1	a	This game has improved a lot. Honestly, it's worth the $15. I have played it at a friends house quite a lot, and on my own PC here. I stopped playing when ti first came out, because to be honest, it sucked.  It doesn't suck now. It is suprisingly fun.   I think if you're on the fence because of the old reviews, you should go to youtube and find some newer gameplay, or ask some people here about the state it is currently in. I reccomend it.
890	0	a	There is a reason this game is 99 cents, because it's god damn awful.  The voice acting, the gunplay, the driving, the dino AI, and the PVP. Pvp is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, thats it, the voice acting is horrid, the gun play if you can call it that is like having a stroke seizure thing while in a whirl pool shooting a gun with a broken arm. Awful. Dino AI loves to run into rocks, and they can't understand that if your on the rock that means they can't get you.  Also, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ the god damn flying â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing awful trash. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ em.
6369	1	a	One of the best games i have ever played and i suggest getting it. 
6371	1	a	The best 79p you will ever spend, probably.
6373	1	a	Good Shooter game! Nice graphic!
6375	1	a	A first person arcade, survival style shooter versus dinosaurs :D It feels like Halo 1 with dinosaurs in it :)
6377	1	a	6/10
6379	1	a	This game is very underrated. It is definitly a lot of fun to play and I have yet to come across any of the bugs that it has been critisized for. It is deffinitly avery pretty game. Only issue I can think of are the dinosaur actions as they can get a little derpy. Still very fun.
6381	1	a	this game is great fun, shooting and being eaten by a dinosaur is amazing and for just a low price it is amazing.
6383	1	a	I think this game gets too much hate. It's an ok game.
6385	1	a	The game may have bad reviews, how after a few updates it has become a much better game, I say this from the free play weeks not from owning, but the game is still rather enjoyable.
6387	1	a	Just simply amazing!
6389	1	a	i love dinosaurs,when i was 5 i had a jurasic park themed bd party i had a shirt with Jurasic park logo,tons of plastic dinosaurs (i still have them) and a huge scaled jungle model now i have this sht and what can i say? just amazing,the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ t-rex ate me alive,tons of raptors and the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ one that spits venom,plus the small ones(i think they re Compsognathids) that come in hordes of 10 or 20,too small to shot and too fast! 30 minutes of pure action scenarios are big too you can roam around and shot around the jungle to get objetives ,the folliage helps you and them to hide(like in real life) and you feel like a prey special effects are cool and weapons are nice pistols are my fav cheap price,great game
6391	1	a	Kinda like Primal Carnage, but different. Really difficult with out a team, but add in some friends and its really fun.
6393	1	a	Such a fun thing to play with friends, definately reccomend giving it a try. I got addicted.
891	0	a	i wasted 0.99$ in that ....
892	0	a	Graphics are crap, but whatever it costs a buck, the community is terrible, but that's to be expected, and it kinda just plops you into a game with no tutorial, at least no tutorial that I could find, and if you have to search for the tutorial you're not doing your game right.
6395	1	a	Best game in the village
6397	1	a	1. Open map not open world 2. lots of cool weapons and upgrades 3. Great online play 4. Not alot of fun single player 5. Graphics pretty good.  This game is alot of fun online if your able to work as team. I find it most fun playing with just friends or family because team work is key its not like COD. This is NOT open world however. It is a small to medium sized map.  Guns+DInos= buy it
6399	1	a	The finest hour for FPS.
6401	1	a	great fun for your spare time
6403	1	a	F.U.N    Orion: Dino Horde is Halo &amp; tribes together with Dinosaurs   Its FUN GET it and join Dolla &amp; me in some dino killing!
6405	1	a	i recomanmend this game i played its beta thats why so i think its awsome i think u shoud try it thats all for now see ya :3 
6407	1	a	Just One Word...... AWESOME!!!
6409	1	a	I think this game is the best dinosaur game besides primal carnage 
6411	1	a	Greatest game ever you kill dinos and then you die the end. fantastic 10/10 nothing compares buy now
6413	1	a	I keep seeing reviews about steal this and theft that, who cares. 'In today's news, company sells stolen game for an entire dollar! 49 cents on sale!! What happened to this world???'  This is by far the most fun game i've ever played in this price range. A friend of mine bought it for our group of friends because it was so cheap, little did we know that it would be damn good fun.   Classes, plenty of weapons, vehicles, upgrades, lots of modes, and dinosaurs. Though i admit the graphics aren't top notch but honestly not bad, lighting and shadows aren't bad, the dinos look sorta low res but who cares. And glitches galore but thats all part of the fun if you ask me.   The only downside i can see is that probably not many people host lobbies, not sure for certain. And that all the visual upgrades for characters is handled through a slew of microtransactions, but this game is only a dollar. Atleast its not like Rockstar's wonderfully overrated and squeezed for every last penny with microtransactions GTA 5.   AAA studios take note! This is genuine fun for the whole family.
6415	1	a	IDK if it worth $15 but what I DO know is this. As someone who hates online games, I have found my first Online Gaming Addiction. Since picking this up for a buck during one of the sales; I can't stop playing this game. I fricken LOVE it! The best way to describe it is Turok: Dinosaur Hunter... if It had wave survival/horde mode. You blast wave after wave of dinos &amp; completing objectives with insane weapons weapons and vehicles while earning money for upgrade &amp; more weapons. I know the game use to be a buggy pile of **** and the devs pulled some shady â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on Metacritic early on by astroturfing its user score on Metacritic then relaunching it under a new name. That said, since then the Devs have worked their asses off fixing and improving the game and it shows. The devs may have ****ed up in the beginning but have since redeemed themselves IMO.
6417	1	a	Really enjoy this game, they've hit on a great formula; especially the co-op conquest maps. It's one of those games with a very simple concept done flawlessly. Graphics are great too, I have a fairly old graphics card and this runs nice and smooth at full res.  Vehicles are great, the ballistic tank weapon is great. It's fun. I really like how when you go up levels you have a decent starting weapon too.

6421	1	a	You can be a small dinosaur 100000000000/10
6423	1	a	hey look this game is awesome man i really think this game is worth 15 dollars man
6425	1	a	orion dino horde is realy awesome and i am going to play again 
6427	1	a	L4D2 meets Borderlands... but with Dinosaurs. 10/10.  Also, Santa is a total Jackass in this game.
6429	1	a	PLease, get this game, its alot of fun you can even do pvp and they are planning a new title to be announced this month or coming one.
6431	1	a	Orion: Dino Horde doesn't look special at first glance. However, the gameplay is extremely fun and the developers CONSTANTLY add new content such as new game modes, new dinosaurs, new maps, and new weapons. Highly recommended.
6433	1	a	This game... i was extremely skeptical at first. But after playing it for a while, i'm in love. Definitely worth a shot. BUY IT!
906	0	a	wanna waste your money? Well, this game is for you!
907	0	a	I cannot put into words how painfully bad this game is.
908	0	a	Atleast refund the money for the people who spent money on your game before making it free. Kind of lucky i didnt buy more than 1 copy for the game.   If you didnt buy the game, go play it. It definately isnt bad, but the fact that the devs dont care that we spent money for nothing makes me not play the game now.  EDIT:  Although it has gone back to paid, Alot of people recieved the game for free, which still isnt fair
6435	1	a	Spawend and a Dinosaur immediatly bit my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off. 25/24 would â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing have my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ torn off again.
6437	1	a	funny game to play with friends
6439	1	a	Its still after all this drama a good game!
913	0	a	It feels like I just dropped a 1â‚¬ coin on a rush sale. I open the game try out the solo and I notice how the dinossaurs movements looks like a plank with robotic legs. I still had some faith and tried joining a multiplayer game but all the servers I could find were either on the other end of the world with over 420 ping or were password protected. I mean, holly mother of dino jesus, even the T-Rex's struggle to move between wee litle dinossaurs.  Oh look, it also has hats, taunts and mutch more fun looking things, surely they are earned by skill. Nope just by money.    So remember kids, just because the trailer and pictures look fun it doesn't mean that is fun.
914	0	a	Feels like a PS2 game, very clunky and basic.  Devellopers are thiefs and fire their employees with no pay and steal 3D models and assets from other games.  Do not buy even for 1$ and do not buy their future â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ products
915	0	a	Welcome to the dark side of indie games! Where games have little effort placed into them and we do our very damndest to make Minecraft's money because we can't make anything else but blocks!  'OMFG!!! Peetor! u fokn wot m8?! u oly hav 10 hrs in dis musterpeese!' hold your horses! I'm doing the internet a favor by reviewing this game! I'm surprised I played this for 2 days without drinking acid. Have I played 10 hours? yes, is it enough to review a game with a fair amount of game modes to choose from? no. But, this game is being sold off as a 'Unreal Tournament/Halo/Quake/Star wa-- wait wait wait! What?! Star wars? you mean to tell me a light saber knock off is enough to count this as a Star wars game? who rated this? 12 year old's? I'm sorry but the only thing that makes Orion related to those games are: regenerating health (Halo) and vehicles (Unreal Tournament) As for Quake, I'm not even sure what sticks out as being inspired by Quake...If you're talking about the rocket launcher...Sorry kiddies, but almost every shooter has a rocket launcher, so I guess Halo. Half-life. Unreal Tournament. Dues Ex. Doom. Battle Field. Star Wars: Battle Front, etc. Are   all   Quake clones.  This is a ADS game with   zombies   Dinosaurs and classic PvP. But that does not mean that this game is anything like what I have just listed! Do not f***ing confuse good games with this buggy indie mess!     the gameplay
916	0	a	So... The rewiew... Bought this game for 1 euro so i dident know what to expect. Now i know. This is the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥iest game ive ever played. I dont think you can make a game any more bad. I put the graphics up to full and it still looked like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥... When i got into my first game there were no other torturial than 'Use wasd to walk' And thats it... Nothing else was there and i just walked around without knowing what to do..  1/10 ....
917	0	a	This game is poop.
6441	1	a	Have you ever wanted to play a video game with state-of-the-art graphics, intuitive controls, and creative multiplayer modes? Neither have I, and the developers of ORION: Dino Horde seemed to understand just that. They have pandered to what is assuredly a golden niche market: true hardcore gamers. Because I am the type of person who can confidently identify 'skrubs' who 'get rekt' because they are indeed CASUALS, I can say without a doubt that this game is not for the faint of heart. To really understand Dino Horde, you've got to have the HARDCORE GAMER attitude. Just remember our mantra: 'Anyone who doesn't enjoy a video game that appeals to a select group of people for any reason- be it the challenge it presents or because THEY JUST HAVE A DIFFERING OPINION- is a casual and therefore terribly pathetic.'  I think I speak for millions of elite gamers when I say that ORION: Dino Horde is the next Dark Souls before Dark Souls 2. Some folks just can't get into it because they find it too hard and give up in the early stages of this masterpiece. What these NAIVE FOOLS need to understand is Dino Horde is the type of game where you learn by experience. Once you get the hang of the game and start to understand it for what it really is, it presents you with new challenges that build on knowledge you have acquired by simply playing the game and not giving up. That is the beauty of ORION: Dino Horde.  The controls are FLAWLESS. Anyone who says otherwise clearly has no idea what they are talking about. The HUD and the gameplay do not at all feel like crummy ports of the Halo franchise with dinosaurs. Each gamemode is unique and has an entirely different feel from the last. Everything about Dino Horde is so fresh and invigorating, you will never want to play Call of Duty again, which as we all know is one of the most ever-changing game franchises in existence.  American author and journalist Ernest Hemingway once said: 'Sarcasm is difficult to detect on the internet,' and apparently so is honesty. What do dumb ol' books have to do with ORION: Dino Horde, you ask? You didn't hear it from me, but word around the office is this game is the best of its time, and will be for years to come.  I'll leave you with this final thought: Why buy ORION: Dino Horde? No, really, why?
921	0	a	free to play and didn't get anything for supporting the game, bought it for the original 15$ price tag, it was a complete waste of money
922	0	a	How the heck did you mess up a game about Dinosaurs and Jet Packs?! Between the horrid control scheme, barren environments, and things don't even make sense, this game is horrid. Not worth a dollar.
923	0	a	I played the 'game' for 30 minutes. I put game in quotes because i can hardly call this a game by definition. Honestly i have no idea where to begin with this horrible excuse for a 'game', so i'll start with the interface. I was greeted with screen prompts made for a 360 gamepad. I didn't even have a gampad plugged in mind you, apparently I am supposed to use a gamepad instead of my keyboard. Even if it was a port to PC, which it isn't, why would they use 360 controls as the button prompts?   Next, i tried to join a game; 4 times, each time unsucessful. It displayed a list of servers you can join, but may of them had a ping labeled as 'lobby' tell me, what exactly is 'lobby' ping? I finally gave up trying to join a server with people in it, and decided to join an empty one just to get into the bloody game. Hindsight being 20/20 i should have just shut the game down, and unistalled. It was free however, I was naive and wated to give this 'game' a chance. How very foolish of me.  Upon entering the match, the sound was bugged. I kept hearing a repeating sound of some sort of dinosaur trying to bite my head off every 10 seconds or so, even though no enemys were to found anywhere nearby. I had no idea what the objective of the gamemode was, but it displayed an enemy generator and friendly generator health bar, as for what the hell these generators did, I couldn't honestly tell you, but somehow my team's was down to 10%. I shot a couple pterodactyls and raptors; which I could barely see because it was on some winter level, and apparently my character didnt have the ability to wipe this all consuming frost from covering his entire visor. Seriously, it was like someone took a jar of vasaline to my characters face and went 'off you go! time to kill some dinosaurs, i think!' Very shortly after, the game crashed, which was the best part of the game in my experince, BECAUSE IT WAS OVER.   Honestly, just 30 minutes of this game gave me a headache, and im pretty sure if i kept playing i would have had a brain aneurysm. Do i reccommend this game? That is a hearty and concise NO. I don't care wether or not this game is in alpha, beta, or what have you. If you are going to allow people to play it, make sure it is actually playable. 
6443	1	a	  well i played for the first time now after 1 year, and its a lot more buggy than before, it has a cheap price, but i find it frustrating and almost unplayable now.
6445	1	a	Okay so this game is pretty cheesy, let me warn you. But that's what happens when you have a Republic Commando-esque soldier firing a bow or wielding some kind of lightsaber against a T-Rex. Also, one of the reviews the devs chose to display on the trailer said 'Its not buggy anymore.' So it has that going for it.  Anyways, lots of fun, better with friends, graphics are a bit pitiful but not terrible generally. Except for the 'water.' Definately worth the 99 cents I paid for it, probably not worth the 15 it normally is. Also, you can explore dino innards.
924	0	a	I played an entire game of this, A WHOLE 50 MINUTES. Word's cannot describe how bland and dull this game is if it was a sandwich it would be 1 slice of white bread, no butter, folded over a sliver of corned beef thats been opened and left in the fridge so it goes all dry and hard. Not enjoyable at all.
6447	1	a	still better than Halo 4
6449	1	a	Love this game, basically The most fun i have had playing a firstperson shooter against players that arent the same as you, 'dino VS Human' you really need to get this game :)
6451	1	a	This game...is just...Dinotastic, although it could get a bit repittive after a few rounds and I've expirecned some wall glitches I think if you like murdering things without 0 guilt, Orion is for you, I'm always willing to play, just send me a PM... Treyarch just got a run for there money. R.I.P. COD 7/10  -PROS- -Graphics are legit. -Gameplay is quite fun -VEHICLES+A FRICKEN MECH. -Weapons aare cool. -Rewards are rewarding.  -CONS-  -Involes real life money for extrap maps. -A bit glitchy -3 Classes gets a bit boring -No customization unless you spend real money -Playing it alone could be life dangering.
6453	1	a	I can't stop playing this game, and neither can my friends. The game can be described as, 'Did we just play for 3 hours straight instead of studying for our final?'  'YES' 
6455	1	a	This game is awesome! It's just $1, but this game is just a gift! Anyway it's cool! Buy it now!  EPIC GAME!
6457	1	a	I've had this game since 2012.   It sucked back then.  Now, it is flarking awesome.  This game only costs $1. That's one less breakfast buritto, and 20hrs. more of entertainment. This game is so much fun with friends, you get to llaugh and cry together as you puch and shoot hordes of raptors and T-rexes.
6459	1	a	For a game that you can buy for less than a dollar, this is the best you could ever hope for.  Yes there are some bugs and it doesn't exactly feel like a complete game, but shooting dinosaurs while flying on a jetpack just feels fun. I highly recommend this.
6461	1	a	this game is the best game i have seen in my life but realy the laser guns is not good
6463	1	a	The game cost $1 during the Steam Summer Sale and was the best $1 I spent. My brother and I had no clue what the game was about or how it worked. We jumped into a survival game and instantly enjoyed it. I expect that there will be many more hours spent on this game in the future.
6465	1	a	Left 4 Dinosaurs is a wonderful game
6467	1	a	very good game defiently worth your money
6469	1	a	You can kill dinosaurs with a lightsaber while flying with a jetpack....Need i say more?
6471	1	a	5/10
6473	1	a	Chum is fum

6479	1	a	Fun to Play with friends
6481	1	a	This is the creation of the smartest minds of this generation working together to create the worst game in history.  10/10 I was mindblown. 
6483	1	a	Great game
6485	1	a	Very fun gushies
6487	1	a	Awesome game! Work together and kill some dinos.
6489	1	a	Lam as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, don't bother buying.
6491	1	a	Amazing Game nothing else to say  just amazing
925	0	a	The graphics are pretty good, and there are some cool weather effects. I also like the voice acting. Other than that, it's not very good. All you do is activate a generator and defend it against dinosaurs. Why are the dinosaurs attacking the generator anyway? This game is basically a lesser Borderlands/Halo with a Jurassic setting. I did have some fun playing it with my friend, but I can't see myself going back to it.
6493	1	a	Yes, yes, yes, yes..... all the best parts of Halo, L4D, and Borderlands combined into one epic co-op multiplayer survival shooter. Hopelessly addicting, endlessly fun.
6495	1	a	Downloaded the game 4 days ago but only played it today. First match we were doing pretty well, holding off the dino's and progressing steadily. We then have to take an outpost. On our way there, my friend and I ran into a Triceratops in our 4x4. It rams us and we are sent flying across the map, we fly off the cliff and land on the side of the mountain, where we somehow remained alive. We manage to fall through the mountain and we are glitched into a cave. Our entire team rapidly failed and we were the only 2 left. Took us 10 minutes to discover we could teleport home, and when we did we lead the charge and emerged victorious. 5/10 opinion not yet fully developed...
6497	1	a	This game is much beteer than it's predecessor.I love it.
6499	1	a	If theres anyway to describe this game, it certainly is no Dinosaur on a technical level. With Hi-Tech Dino-Devonian physics,Cretaceolicious level design, an Jurrasictastic story, and Jaw dropping Weapon Array. There's certainly no going wrong with Orion: Dino Horde/Prelude especially for the outrageous asking price. 8/10
6501	1	a	Halo, with dinosaurs.
6503	1	a	Imagine if someone made a fantastic game that was a fusion of Jurassic Park, Halo, and Planetside 2.   This is not that game.  This will never be that game. This is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. That being said, it's very fun with friends.
6505	1	a	It's 99 cents. Buy it you cheap â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
930	0	a	Trash.
6507	1	a	Vass: 'Have I ever told you the deffinion of insanity?'  Me: 'No, but I have played ORION Prelude so I think I know it'
6509	1	a	I bought this back when it was orion dino beat down, i bought four copies and i still have two,the game? its well worth your time if its free ,but the money I spent? Well worth it, I love this game honestly ,my computer has a hard time with it but my pc has a potato graphics card.   In conclusion,should you get it? yes,of course it always been good,even when dubbed 'worst game of ever' It was good,even the community is good so just play it already you â™¥â™¥â™¥
932	0	a	This would have been an awesome game in 1999, would have competed very well with Half-Life 1. But in today's gaming landscape, it is garbage.
933	0	a	Not so good of a game, badly-optimized too. Developer stole assets from other companies, lie/threaten legal action to the community to protect themselves, and get away by removing those content when caught, excuses attached.
6511	1	a	Great game. Killed a TRex with a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in lightsaber. Then got â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ by a Robot Santa that drops bombs disguised as Christmas presents. 7/10
6513	1	a	Great game to burn an hour or spend all day on when you need to! Has great graphics and concept. Cheap and easy to learn
6515	1	a	The only game where you can slap giant crocodiles to death. 100/10
6517	1	a	Jetpacks, Tanks, Helicopters, what do we need more?  ORION: Dino Horde is an awesome game which you won't be able to stop playing this. First few hours will make you flustered since this game does not provide you any tutorials. Especially, fighting with big-sized dinosaurs when you are a newb will drive you crazy. However, after you finish learning how to play this game(It'll take no longer than 3 hours), then the real fun begins.  Teamwork is the key point of the game. Without it, you and your mates can die before you even hit the round 5. The great point of this game is, 'teamwork' and 'dino' can create a great action movie. You and your squads will face hundreds of dinos coming toward you. After your squad captures the checkpoint. Most of cases Hummer style vehicle equipped with a machine gun will be given to you. Then, somebody will drive while others take the shotgun, or grab the machine gun and feel like his playing Call of Duty.  Not only because my English sucks, but it's just hard to explain all the positive elements which this game will give to you.  9.5 / 10.0  P.S. It doesn't mean the actual graphic is bad, but screenshots uploaded on the steam store page is way better than the actual graphic.
6519	1	a	I've spent countless hours playing this game.
6521	1	a	its like call of duty if you replace the word call with dinosaur the word of with killing and duty with simulator. 10/10 IGN
6523	1	a	ALL CAPS BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO  GOD DAMN  LISTEN TO ME.    THIS IS THE BEST VALUE THAT YOU CAN GET ON STEAM.
6525	1	a	The sheer amount of content in ORION: Prelude is impressive. Not just all the equipment and weapons that you'd expect but also lightsabres, portable turrets, jetpacks, bows and arrows, not to mention the vehicles, from jeeps to tanks, planes and walkers, like the developers decided to make the game as purely fun as possible, and they succeeded in a big way.
6527	1	a	kind of simple still good
6529	1	a	this is the best game for such money ! some times big ping but still nice , so i can recomend it if you are bored or wanna kill some time!!!
6531	1	a	Knife OP! Dinosaur stabbing simulator!   IGN: 11/10 worth the price.
6533	1	a	8/10
6535	1	a	This game is so much fun, when you make fun of how bad it is with your friends.
6537	1	a	This Dino killing game is very fun to play, it is super cheap and the gameplay is satasfying.

Fun for first five minutes. After that it's problems show. Firstly, the dinos are all very static. Static in the sense that all the dinos ever do is just run at you with the same animations straight at you to attack. No lurking, no ai intelligence. The dinos are like tracking missiles just running directly at you. Next the vehicles feel very basic. The game's mech is a clunky mech which you click to fire a turret which is pretty much the same turret on every vehicle with a turret. The vehicles feel slow and not fun to drive. It is just endless waves repeating after each wave of dinos increasing in number and doing the same thing until you die.   The game's mechanics could do a little better at some things also, like when a ptero picks you up and flies if u kill it while it is flying it drops u and u die from fall dmg(wth?). Weapons in this game don't feel powerful at all. Imagine just firing at this dino and the dino does not even flinch or stumble. There is just the same blood splatter backwards and you grind him down until he dies. The music is loud and makes it feel like some arcade shootout. Even without the music, the dinos sound even louder than your guns.   This game is actually just Dino:Beatdown but re-released to try to get more players to buy after dino beatdown got bad reviews.  Now don't get me wrong the game is supposed to be co-op fun, but even with friends after awhile it will be just the whole team split up running in circles around the rocks shooting dinosaurs which are herded behind them.  What's good about this game though is that it had a nice concept and could be fun sometimes, but either buy it now at $1 or don't buy at all. READ MORE  Was this review helpful?

Previously known as Orion: Dino Horde, and previously known before that as Dino Beatdown. It's a nifty little FPS about...well, the mass killing of dinosaurs. The name changes, despite what the developers will claim on their forums, are repeated attempts to avoid their perpetually low metacritic scores. Each iteration of this dino slaughter game is merely just a shameless repackaging, in an attempt to shed it's horrible metagamer score. Perhaps neither here nor there, but it does give you an idea of how dishonest this publisher is willing to be to ensure the game continues to sell.  The game has a glaring lack of polish, tends to run at very low framerates, even on powerful machines, and has the nasty habit of crashing...repeatedly, for no apparent reason. Notably, some people only rarely experience these crashes, but for many people, the game is rendered unplayable. And of course, when you're not crashing, your friends are disconnecting. Playing through a single match of any appreciable length becomes rather difficult.  Pair that with the repetitive music and downright embarrasing voices the humans feature, you get the distinct feeling that there was a notable lack of love going into the visuals and sound in this game. Seriously, though. The voices are reminiscent of an athsmatic in a bathroom with seasonal allergies and a horrible headcold. (Looking at you, support class! If you call me 'homey' one more time...)  Notably, the lag and the crashes and the disconnects are issues that have persisted for me and my friends over a year, since the game was called ORION: Dino Horde. If you are among the lucky people who can play this game without crashing non-stop, then I suggest you immediately stop to thank your lucky stars.   The game features a variety of modes, but most modes involve slaughtering dinos. (There are a few that allow you to play as dinos.) The game contains 3 classses of humans you can play as, support, assault, and recon. (Think of a clunkier version of Tom Clancy.) While assault is fun to play as with his jetpack, and the recon is nifty with her invisibility, the support class wins hands down, with his ability to heal himself and others....to an extreme degree. He can tank just about anything with his healing gun.  Even though the support class is massively overpowered, playing the game as any other class is quite difficult. Between massive dinos that create unavoidable earthquakes, or even bigger dinos that merely swallow you whole, ORION exists on a strange difficulty spectrum.  So long as one uses the support class, and uses the turrets on the backs of the vehicles you can ride, the game seems relatively easy. If you, like me, decide to explore what else the game has to offer, you'll run back to your support class/turret combo relatively quickly, as you find that the world of dino horde is quite a cruel one indeed.  In short, Orion: Prelude, under any name, is a glitchy, laggy, poorly thought out PVP shooter/dino killing game/dinos vs humans, that attempts to excuse its mediocrity with a low price point. Considering the legions of pvp shooters out there, you're probably better off picking up any one of those and leaving this one be. READ MORE  Was this review helpful?

After reading all the negative comments about this game, I thought to myself; nah, it can't be THAT bad. So, stubborn as I am I decided to buy it anyway. Boy, was I wrong. Nothing in this game works. It starts with a buggy main menu; sounds cutting off, the server list not refreshing, unable to even connect to anything or anyone or even starting a solo game. Finally after restarting the game 3 times I was able to create a solo game. It's supposed to be a tower defense sort of game, but deeper. But it's terrible. It's buggy, it isn't fun, it's glitchy, it's... It's probably the worst game I've ever played (and I've played quite a few, thank you very much). Virtual garbage bin material.

6541	1	a	Shockingly Good. Must Buy 2014-2015.
6543	1	a	Lots of fun to play with friends but not many people play so the servers are kind of empty.  All in all though great game!
6545	1	a	Dis game? Best 0,99â‚¬ I've spent, EVER. That hooker I bought to give me a rimjob last week? Comes nothing near to the satisfaction I get from this game. This isn't what you would expect form a 0,99â‚¬ game.   10/10, would fly around on a helicopter with a MECH again.
939	0	a	This is not one game.... this is a lot of games (and even movies)  Weapons : Cod AW/BO3 T-Rex : Primal Carnage Helmets : Star Wars (Boba Fett, Kylo Ren)  it was also released twice....  source:  https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4q6xo5/activisions_dmca_claim_on_orion_is_legit_orions/ 
6547	1	a	The sky makes me lag. The ground makes me freze. The enemys make me die. I think my computer came from the time of the dinosaurs. plz fix my computer.
6549	1	a	If this game was a dinosaur it would be a 'pretty-good-for-a-dollarsaurus.'
6551	1	a	Join game.  guy asks me, 'Are you having fun?'  'No.'  'well then have a nice life f*** boy!'  gets kicked.  10/10, would get kicked again.  
6553	1	a	'ORION: Prelude' is an indie Sci-Fi shooter (FPS/TPS) that seamlessly blends together incredible visuals and addictive combat. It puts you and your friends together into intense, cinematic battles using some of the most incredible weaponry and amazing vehicles in which you must work or compete against one another to accomplish mission objectives, explore giant worlds and survive the devastating Dinosaur Horde.   In addition to the return of the adventurous, survival-based cooperative gameplay and retro-inspired Arena Combat, 'ORION: Prelude' features massive, Open World Cooperative and PvPvE.
941	0	a	The good part of this game is that i only waisted 50 cents 10/10 would buy again
6555	1	a	- Walked out of base - Chased by huge horde of dinosaurs - Watched teammate get taken by a Pterodactyl - Ran for cover - Found tank - Jumped in tank - Destroyed angry Stegosaurus with tank - Massacred dinosaurs for a 'MONSTER KILL' - Triceratops bashed tank to death - T-Rex ate another teammate - Died to horde  10/10 - Would die to play again!
6557	1	a	Better Than PRIMAL CARNAGE !!  Jst give it a shoot
6559	1	a	I paid for this and now it's free. Volvo and GaybeN, explain plz
944	0	a	this game is complete â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, and i think i may have received cancer from playing this game. Please do NOT ever develope another game to save the human race as we know it.
6561	1	a	yes it very GOOD........ i was spend 5 hour per day for level up it very good than old
6563	1	a	Let me start by saying when I first played Orion: Prelude (or whatever they were calling it) a year or so ago it was a terrible terrible game, and I really did not like it at all. Since then however Orion: Prelude has changed significantly with the updates it has gotten in the year or two since I first played it. It is at a state now were I can say that its no longer a 'bad game' per se just not one that I enjoy. By all means Orion: Prelude or whatever its called at the time you are reading this has gone from being a terrible empty mess to being a decent although somewhat mediocre Dino survival game. I still would not buy it myself, but for the price currently 0.99 cents I have got to say if you like the idea of a Dino survival game, this is worth looking into.    I myself still prefer Primal Carnage over Orion: prelude, and Dino D-Day is also another game I like significantly more than the Orion game. I even hear that game Stomping Land is pretty good, though I have yet to try that myself. All I have got to say in the end though is that you may like Orion: Prelude, it has come a long way since its (imo terrible) launch. Orion; Prelude may not be as good as the other games listed above (Primal Carnage, Dino D-Day, Stomping Land) but it is the cheapest, and that counts for something I guess. Orion: Prelude goes on sale all the time, so If you are interested I would get it during its next sale.
6565	1	a	One of the best dollars I ever spent on a video game. Take on waves of Dinosaurs in Survival modes, using a wide array of weapons, skills, vehicles and classes. Customize your character with hats, capes, Armour colors and more if you are willing to spend an extra couple bucks. If you a PVP player their is a wide variety of Deathmatch and objective modes as well although this game really shines in its survival mode in my opinion. Something adrenaline rushing about fighting against waves of Raptors, Pteradactyls, Stego, Rex's, Spinosaurs and a lot more.  Game Showcase-    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5-0QSalIis 
6567	1	a	This is a great game but I feel that the fight to survive feature is not good because you CANNOT kill a dino with a pistol.But still the game rocks :D
6569	1	a	Very good game and a lot of fun for not much money :) recommend for everyone that want to grind some prehistoric animals.
6571	1	a	Honestly for the price you will easily get your money's worth. This game isn't going to way you on graphics necessarily but it has so many game modes and enough jokes and craziness to make it worthwhile.
6573	1	a	ONLY FOR 0,49 eur, seriously WTF??!?!?44! Nice game brooooos!
6575	1	a	It was a fun game in its original form, had many flaws though. But after all of its failures it came back as an amazing game and is a great example of developers being able to turn a game around for the better!
6577	1	a	This game is very good, you have dinosaurs and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, very dramatic. I like, good weapons, strong and powerful. It is game for real men and fake women
6579	1	a	Punched a raptor in the face and got 125 points.
6581	1	a	  Karate chopped a T-Rex to death, roleplayed as Daisy Buchanan by running over a crowd of raptors, and then played as a dinosaur suicide bomber. 10/10
6583	1	a	  Dinos, explosives and robot suits. What's not to love!   [The good]:   - Pretty much everything is balanced. The guns, the creatures, the vehicles. Nothing is overpowered to the point of being gamebreaking.   - Map detail is really pretty. A bit like Rust on low-graphics or Firefall. And the texture models for the dinos are quite realistic.   - Literally just about every weapon and vehicle you could imagine. Sniper rifles, flamethrowers, rocket launchers, smgs of all sizes, heavy MG's, bows, melee weapons, mech suits, tanks, ATV's, assault aircraft. If you can imagine it, this game has it.   - Everything is nicely porportioned. Distances between objectives and timings between waves of dinos are quite fair but not tedious.   - The weather. Probably my favorite thing about the game. Realistic rain is almost impossible to find. The drops actually fog up your visor and add a small but amazing touch.   [The not-so-good]  - Animations. Though the artworks is pretty and all, its not uncommon to see both dino and human models with their limbs contorted at unnatural angles.   - Clipping. Suffice to say, its possible to get stuck inside a dino or a rock.   - Optimization/latency. Random ping spikes ^300+ from a ~80 avg. Random fps drops to &lt;20 previously running at ~50 avg. If you die while inside a creature, after respawning your weapons will sometimes not fire.   - Map design. Looks aren't everything. In terms of playability the 4 maps I played on had fairly dull gameplay. Mostly flat/hill terrain. Little to no high ground for snipers. Too narrow of an area for vehicles to do work, yet too wide for explosives to be effective.  - Hitreg. Even perfectly placed shots will not do damage and shots that really shouldn't hit, do.   - Economy. While the weapons themselves are balanced, the prices really arent. On medium servers, there are ~13 waves of dinos. Assuming you kill 50% of the wave, you're going to spend more than half of the game grinding up to buying some semi-decent weapon other than a starting pistol. (protip, always go for the c9 revolver if you cant afford a good rifle. its a 2 tap headshot and deadly accurate for a reasonable price)   - Drops/loot. Mainly the fact there is none. It'd be nice to have the occasional airdrop of ammo packs or something. Having to rebuy ammo every round is really tedious.   All in all, its a really fun game and worth the price. The devs could do a few things too improve it but as it stands it's totally worth the price.   Full disclosure, I did get the game for free.
951	0	a	Dont buy this. Even for just a doller it is not close to anything near ready to play. Just a warning to people new to steam, if a game is on sale for a ton of and it is not a store wide sale it is not doing good. The driving is made on a 16 sided shape. wich means that you cant just turn right you make wide turns that feel like the game is laging. But no its is just a crap game. The store looked like a thing a young kid made on ms paint, The textures are blurred and ugly. The gun play dosn't work because the engine cant keep up and just feels slow. DONT BUY
952	0	a	this game was better a year ago when it was alpha and barely ran. this is now terribad and in the span of an hour it crashed on me three times, i couldnt host a multiplayer game for anybody, let alone friends, and microtransactions. id rather watch The Kardashians than play this steaming dino poo pile
6585	1	a	very very fun game 
953	0	a	worst game in history
6587	1	a	Best. Full with actions. Recommended.
6589	1	a	I've recieved shots that where more fun than this game
954	0	a	The optimisation of this game is horrible. The game itself is very repeditive, some of you may disagree but I guess the $1 it is currently on sale for is the chance for you to try it yourself. Might just be another number to add to your account. I'm not telling you not to buy it but it still may tickle your fancy. It's just not my kind of game.
6591	1	a	Body turned cold.
955	0	a	I got this game for a dollar and i'm not sure it was worth it. The premise seems fun, but the lack of people playing it makes it pointless to play.
956	0	a	Unfortunately I was not able to play this game; when it would get to class selection, it would lock up. I couldn't even ALT-TAB out of it, as it was holding the rest of the computer hostage.  It isn't as though I don't have a beefy machine though:  Intel Core i3 CPU with 4 processors nVidia GeForce GTX560 OC video card 8 GB of RAM (unfortunately, 32 bit Windows 7, so 3.45 GB available)  I may try this again later, but not interested right now.
957	0	a	I'll give you 10â‚¬ if you delete the game from my library!!!
958	0	a	Very basic shooter, I got... Well 0.3 hrs in according to the game timer. And the game client crashed. And I've seen more than enough. This is another game I suppose could be fun in a lan party or something like that... but it might be worth the 99 cents they're asking for it while it's on sale this week... If you're bored....
959	0	a	Buy? No.  And that suggestion is after all the praise quotes from the current trailer about the game being improved and deserving a second chance.  Dino Horde is a sequel/successor to Orion: Dino Beatdown with was universally terrible. It is a first person horde shooter much like Killing Floor, but with dinosaurs, a between round weapon and augment store, and vehicle mechanics from a poor man's Halo. I felt a little disgusted after shooting my first weapon, which had a tinny sound effect and no recoil. Oddly enough, the recoil does come up sometimes. The guns just have this weak and unfinished feel. Dino waves are sent to you at lightning speed and most half-decent teams can wipe them out pretty quickly as they are sent in a couple packs that's easy to spray and pray at. When you're new, you might miss the opportunity to kill enemies or at least get a hit on them so you can get some assist credit. What makes the waves system even more terrible is the pacing. While you do have a variety of enemies, with some being faster than others, fighting them still often ends up being mass killing the Raptor-types, then finishing off the stragglers of larger, bullet sponge dino's and 'godd**ned bats' trope pterodactyls. Killing Floor has a better variety and pacing of enemies, as the speed of different mobs are more noticible and require proper prioritizing and handling by your group depending on the map you're playing.  Ammo is all handled by an ammo pack at the weapon store, so better hope you killed/assisted enough dinos and be able to make it back to the stores far away in the base after the game told you to go to the other side of the map for an outpost. I can accept the texture, model and animation quality for a cheap indie title. I think the texture quality is pretty good in comparison to Killing floor, and the animation is perhaps finicky in some cases, but the dinosaurs generally look life-like. Sound assets are pretty terrible as guns sound weak, majority of the voice acting sounds ham-fisted and terrible, save for maybe the announcer and the female scout, and the same one or two tracks repeat through the entirety of the game - menus, gameplay and all. Vehicles are extra handy in later waves, but can be a pain to drive, and lead to you demise if you get stuck and a Triceratops rams the ride, making it explode. The land hovercraft kept wobbling on the ground and I had annoyances managing the tank. Regardless, the game ended up feeling shallow very quickly - the fun factor wasn't there and I didn't see any reason to stay and level up.  I think the vast majority of the player base are probably younger types who got this on sale/as a gift and may not have much else to play. I'd hate to have played this before all the 'improvements'. There are plenty of better alternatives like Warframe, Payday series, Killing Floor, Left 4 Dead, Mass Effecct 3, even Call of Duty Co-ops and Transformers Cybertron co-ops.  That being said, this game seem to have carved it's own niche, as there were a decent amount of active servers to join (like 20 or more), though that could be due to the recent .99 sale. That's probably telling alot about the quality and value of the game if it is going for 93% off when it's not a big Steam seasonal sale. I think kids and teens with more time and less money are willing to deal with this game (in fact, I probably would have been ok with it in my childhood), but adults like myself and most people on my friends list only have limited time and shouldn't waste it on this when there are better alternatives.  Don't buy it.The premise of Dino Horde FPS sounds cool, but you can get a similar and more entertaining as well as solid experience from Killing Floor. Once I got my opinion of the game, I only stayed longer to get my card drops....which I probably shouldn't have because they're pretty worthless.
960	0	a	Seriously, take the 99p you'd spend on this game during the sale and buy one of those saver menu Cheeseburgers from McDonald's. It would be more beneficial to your health than this.
961	0	a	This sucks dino balls! Literally!! But it was only 99 cents.
962	0	a	This game is a bit like Halo meets Turok. My problem with this game is that the trailers, like most games, don't really do it justice. The trailer looks pretty awesome but it misrepresents the movements of the dinosaurs and the players. It is much more choppy. I would recommend personalizing the controls as well. One big thing that would make this a bit better are things like, headshots [either instant kill or massive damage]. I don't know how many times I drilled into a raptor's face and it was still chewing on my gun... Very frustrating. It has potential but it is not there yet, in my opinion.
963	0	a	While .99cents, I would not buy this game until it is functional at least. No audio normalization, no customization without actual money, survival mode is a gimmic and fighting dinosaurs with guns that feel weak and disconnected. Servers are hosted locally. Vehicles are a joke. Healing is a joke. Damage feels like nothing. Controls are sticky and numbing and there is no replayability except if you want to achievement â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.   I guarantee you that your money will be wasted on this game. I would relate this to a 500 year old ghetto house. You can buy the house for cheap but everything inside is crap and falling to pieces. This game was hastily cobbled together and updates are pathetic. This game needs a complete rework, with effort actually put into designing the gamem
964	0	a	I would like to start my review, with the utmost important point i'm trying to make here:  It's not worth your money, not even one euro ! Aah do not let yourself get fooled by their enticing videos in which the metascore is told to be a lie,  for this metascore is very much correct.   Let me now continue with disecting this horrible game, as one would do with a dead frog (very respectlessy and relentess). This is best chewed-out, overhyped (i dare say if you only glare once, on the videos provided in the store), piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you can buy with money.  The models are truly horrible, quake live has more detailed models, than this game. The dinosuars are really stiff and inanimate, they appear the be dead before you shoot them. Never in my life have i seen such pixelate artwork being used in a game, for instance the loadout screen in which you select what class you want to play, it's so pixalated i would dare to say it's resolution is 256*256 and no more. Also the matchmaking system is realy buggy to say the least, also in the 20 minutes or less that i 've tried this game i couldn't play with my friend since this game wouldn't allow us, the lobby screen is so underdeveloped it's laughable.  But hey if you want some braindead dino killing action without even taking the slightest notice of the actaul game and the playability of it, this game may be very much for you.  Probably all these things added up makes the price 1 euro and no more, money spent on a bread is better spent money. If you are thinking to buy this game you might aswell donate one euro (or whatever currency you may use) to a charity.  Please do so for the sake of humanity.  After paying for this game, i felt so much shame that i was disgusting and thus as a result of it i automatically was inclined to donate a euro to a charity. as if it were to pay of for the sin that i had commited by buying this.  Do not bego the same mistake as i did. For your humanity ! 
965	0	a	The game is horrible. The idea is good, implementation is very bad. I wouldn't even pay the 99 cents because nobody plays it.
966	0	a	This game sucks in every way.
967	0	a	Buy Primal Carnage instead.
968	0	a	No i feel like I wasted 99 cents so yea its pretty bad
969	0	a	Played the game for about 30 minutes. About 2 minutes in I got stuck in the geometry of the world and survived several waves stuck. And then I fell through the world. I really don't understand why anyone would say this is a good game.
970	0	a	This game is very laggy and it isn't very nice if you dont know how to play the game. The dinosaurs are to hard to kill and it is very hard to aim the gun! DON'T BUY THIS GAME
971	0	a	ONLY BUY ON SALE! This game is not worth full price. How they can sleep, selling this game for $15 is beyond me. although when it goes on sale for 99 cents it is worth it just play this hilariously bad game. You will definately get your dollars woth out of it, but only a dollar!

975	0	a	I would love this game if every five seconds I didn't crash. Now note I have a very nice and fast gaming computer. Other then that though the game is very well rounded although it needs a litlle work.
976	0	a	I personaly dont like it if its 1 â‚¬ then u buy it but no at full price bcs its always same kill 30 mini dinosaurs kill 1 gigant kill 30 minis kill 2 gigant and so on
977	0	a	It's horrible! The game play is bad, the graphics suck and overall it is horrible quality. Why did I even bother spending money on this garbage.
978	0	a	Constant problems with server connection, ingame user interface was poor/poor game play. Did not feel like a complete game
979	0	a	Killed some time on this game, so glitchy. I had fun though, guess it all comes down to who you play with.
980	0	a	Terrible texture,animation and model quality, 90% of servers are either lagging too much to be played at or empty/full of afk players, over 200 useless achievements which is probably the place where the budget went(kill 100,500,1000 enemies with 'insert weapon name here'). Not even worth your bandwidth, more-so your money. 2/10
981	0	a	Grab the smallest vehicle, the biggest sniper and rock the dinos hard. However, it is pretty much the same every single game. Defend this, capture that, return and defend. Over and over and over again. It gets pretty fast pretty boring. I played it for like 4? hours?! And i guess I have seen everything. I took the advantage of the free-days-to-play, but I dont bother buying it even for 99 Cent ...
982	0	a	Game described in 2 words: Connection lost...
983	0	a	Don't buy this. save your 0.99p on the sale!
984	0	a	This is just horrible.
985	0	a	I tried this when it was a free to try for x number of days. To me it wasn't a bad game, it just wasn't for me. It plays like a 3D tower defense game if you play solo. Which I dislike tower defense games. It has a lot of VS modes which gives it a lot of competative game play options. Which again is not what I was looking for out of the game. It looks like halo with dinosaurs but doesn't play as such.
986	0	a	This game is terrible.
987	0	a	this game is horendus â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. do not EVER buy it. everything is done wrong, its laggy, clitchy and even that the idea sounds cool, it is done very poorly.
988	0	a	couldn't join matchmaking and single player was not fun or challenging. would not recomend buying
989	0	a	its decent, have potential but the fact that you can just hide on something up high and never get hit makes it too easy :l
990	0	a	There are a lot of things to do, a lot of modes to try, and a decent selection of weaponry but overall it is very boring, glitchy and slow.
991	0	a	Game's a piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, but as with every game, screwing around with your friends and finding glitches in this game is fun.
992	0	a	This game is tragically bad. The creators should drink bleach.
993	0	a	Piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
994	0	a	I've had my heart broken several times in my life. Once, on Christmas Day 1989, I eagerly ran downstairs and gasped at the sight of what was clearly a crudely but lovingly wrapped skateboard. A skateboard that I had wanted ever since I had seen Marty McFly cruise through the streets of Hill Valley as a stowaway behind an unsuspecting SUV driver. A skateboard with a custom deck, with artwork that would cause my fellow skaters to shout 'rad'. A skateboard whose wheels would send me gliding across the streets as I headed for the nearest half-pipe. A skateboard of majestical proportion.  I grabbed it, and with shaking hands and a heart beating against my chest, I tore that festive wrapping as hard as I could. Through an intricate web of sticky tape, ribbon and ever expanding wrapping paper, I dug through. Years later, I wondered that this is what Andy in The Shawshank Rdemption must have felt like as he dragged hinself through the tunnels. My own redemption was in sight. My prize was near. Finally, the last shred of packaging fell away to the floor. And there it was... a plastic skateboard from the local store. With stiff plastic wheels. And a picture of a clown on the deck.   That's what playing ORION: Dino Horde felt like.
995	0	a	this game is total dogshit. don't buy it. the developers are scammy as hell and tried to do some shady â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to hide from their terrible reviews. Don't buy it.
996	0	a	Peter the Pterodactyl killed my friend
997	0	a	Just no.
998	0	a	i had higher hopes for this, it was very disappointing -_-
6593	1	a	Want Call Of Duty with a prehistoric twist? Want Jurassic Park with Team Fortress 2? Then get this game: seriously, get it now! It's awesome, has a tonne of awesome weapons and unlocks, there are 10 playable dinosaurs, and the last major update is AWESOME!!! A definite 1000000/10.
999	0	a	1 of the worthless games i ever played too bad i cant get my mony back
1000	0	a	Where do I start... well this first-person shooter video game developed by Bungie and published by Microsoft Game Studios. The first game of the Halo franchise, it was released on November 15, 2001 as an exclusive launch title for the Xbox gaming system, and is considered the platform's 'killer app.' More than five million copies were sold worldwide by November 2005. Microsoft released versions of the game for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X in 2003, and the surrounding storyline was adapted and elaborated into a series of novels, comic books, and live action web shorts. The game was later released as an Xbox Original for download onto an Xbox 360 HDD.   5/10 only semi-enjoyable with friends. Other than that sucks major grunts ya feel me.
6595	1	a	I love broken pieces of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
1001	0	a	boring
1002	0	a	theres a reson it costs a dolllar
6597	1	a	10/10 I love this game with a burning pashion, if you have 1$ i reccomend this game.
6599	1	a	Very fun and addicting game. Lots of game modes to keep it interesting.
1004	0	a	guns need better sound effects, open world is nice but leaves much to be desired, there is no cover to hide behind or in or building to shoot from roof tops or towers, no cities or city ruins to run a muck through... just a couple guns, open area to run around and dinos to shoot that spawn in waves. i would say it's 'back to the drawing board' guys. the game mechancis are solid and create a good foundation for what could of been a really fun game had they taken advantage of level design and gameplay is poor and instantly repetative.
1005	0	a	This game is so confusingly bad, I honestly cannot tell if it's intended to be shovelware or simply a product of poor production.
1006	0	a	About as fun as masturbating with sandpaper.
1007	0	a	This game gave me AIDs and that means alot because i got it for $1 
1008	0	a	A horrible, unfinished piece of buggy trash. Not worth $0.99. Broken animations, terrrible and boring gameplay, typical class system with a unfinshed upgrade store, just avoid. Run, run while you can.  -1000/10
1009	0	a	If you like hearing really loud beeping coming from your PC, piecingly loud, and enough to upset the whole family with no way of turning it off, your going to love this game.
6601	1	a	I Love To RolePlay With My Friends On Here. I Also Like Conquest. But I Wish They Could Add A Bit Better Stuff To The Dinosaurs...... Espeically The Pteradactyl And Raptor. WEIRD FACT: I Met All Of My Good Friends On This Game. :P
6603	1	a	This game is so bad BUT if u want to have fun with ur friends u goota try this out ! If u like to own dinos by trickshotting or quickscoping them this is ur game :D
6605	1	a	This is the best $1 i've spent since i boned ur mum
6607	1	a	Tons of fun if you are looking for a mindless shooter.
6609	1	a	Great game I love it the Meta Critic score is bs atleast give it a GOOD try and its amazing!!!!!!!
6611	1	a	its cool but it makes your computer hot
6613	1	a	Dinosaur wave game. Kill dinos, get paid, buy upgrades/weapons.  Good pace, easy to get the hang of, and very fun!
6615	1	a	To be honest the gfx arent the best and there are a few glitches in the animation but for the price you cant go wrong... its great fun and well worth it!
6617	1	a	The survival/horde gamemode of this game gets a bit repetetive after the first area has been cleared, and becomes very easy, since all the waves are as the first ones...
6619	1	a	cool game
6621	1	a	Fun. Cool too.  I want that song from the third video.
6623	1	a	This Game Is Great......Very Glitchy Though hahaha But that my friends is what makes this game AWESOME! 
6625	1	a	Well, it's okay for a cheap game.
6627	1	a	Dinossaurs, Jetpacks, and Rocket Launchers. Enought said.
6629	1	a	What can you buy for 99 cents? You can buy random iPhone games. You can buy a very cheap packet of chips from Maccas. You can buy a frozen Coke from Maccas. You can give to a busker on the street.  Or you can buy Orion: Prelude and nuke dinosaurs with rocket launchers... in empty servers that crash a lot (at least they did when I played).  Angry Birds/10 would buy chips from Maccas again - IGN
6631	1	a	So. This game has a horrible rating from years ago that it's been struggling to recover from, but it's not terrible. It's a fun game to play with friends once in awhile. The main reason I originally had any interest in it was because it wasn't another boring predictable zombie shooter like 90% of other shooters on the market right now.   It's not flawless. There are bugs and glitches and exploits and optimization issues, but overall, it's like a 6.5/10 game, pretty solid. At least where PVE game modes are concerned.   Every single match I've ever played of PVP, lowest ping won. The game seems to just have awful netcode as far as PVP is concerned, and ping makes more difference than skill 100% of the time. There's also a lot of major balancing issues, and a few game-breaking bugs. Like, one of the first times I entered the PVPVE game mode, there was just one guy cloak knifing everyone. There's an awful exploit on the Cryo Knife that allows people to spam knife attacks instantly as fast as they can click their mouse, and it hasn't been fixed over the last several updates, so meh. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ anything pvp-related in this game. If you want to have a good experience, stick to survival and/or conquest with friends.
6633	1	a	Definitely underrated, but still gets boring relatively fast.
6635	1	a	Edit: After giving the game another chance, it seems to be running fine now, weirdly enough, and is performing much better at a stable 24 fps. Gameable with friends when looking for a light shooter with something different. Easy to pick up and play. Still I'd like the guns to be a bit more fleshed out, with one pistol being mentionable as possibly being enough to play with as it can effortlessly take down everything and comes with infinite ammo, no recoil and it's fully automatic.
6637	1	a	This game literally gave me cancer. Thanks asshat chek ur privlege shitbirds sdufaisopjdfa;si9eruuuuuufhnoas
1010	0	a	The metascore is NOT misleading, the trailer is. Do not get this game, even if it is on sale for .99 cents. DO NOT listen to the quotes in the trailer, those were probably from the devs of the game. Seriously though, this game really sucked hard and there were so many bugs and issues with optimization. Not to mention the animations of the dinos, which were some of the worst animations i've ever seen. Don't get this game.
6639	1	a	To be honest, when I first purchased this game in 2012, I didn't enjoy it. It seemed poorly optimized and a little too hectic. I chalked it up as a dollar lost and let it gather dust.   I came back to it in a 'what the hell, I've got nothing better to do' mood the other day, and holy cow, was it a world of difference in perspective. Everything was fluid, the gameplay was solid and intuitive, and everything ran without a hitch. Within minutes of joining the lobby I was cruising around manning a gun on the back of a jeep, blowing up tyrannosaurs with a rocket launcher, and mowing down hordes of raptors and compys with a laser sword. And I was having a blast doing it. Honestly, this seems a testament to an early access indie developer that cares about the feedback of the community. I probably wont log any more hours on prelude, as I just purchased Project and look forward to playing it.  
6641	1	a	This game is amazing! for the price and download time it is the best hoard game I have played!
6643	1	a	Best Developers ever! Game can't fail, only developers can! 11/10, best game for only 0,5 - 1$
6645	1	a	This game is amazing! Definitely worth 50 cents
6647	1	a	I enjoyed this game, Gets really hard after 5-6 waves or so, If you enjoy a challenge this MIGHT be the game for you. 6/10
1012	0	a	It's really bad... its confusing, ugly, pointless and crashes all the time
6649	1	a	Let's not be roundabout. This game is fun.   Killing Floor + Halo + Jurassic Park = WORTH
6651	1	a	Okay, a few months ago, this review would've ended up being pretty negative to say the least. But I must admit, these guys don't give up and keep updating and improving the game - to a degree, where it has not much to do with the initially released bugfest you might have laughed at or being so mad of, that you've refunded your money on Steam. Right now, the game is at a point, where it is stable, runs (finally) fluid, has a decent gunplay and most importantly: it's fun. Yes, with jetpacks and dinosaurs and mechs and that stuff, it is rather cheesy, but it doesn't take itself too serious, which feels kinda refreshing. They've also polished the look and added quite some content. I think, this one deserves a second chance. When there is a free weekend or a sale, go check it out.
6653	1	a	I really like this game. It has dinozavers inside. I mean - dinozaveri. THE TRUE POWER OF THE UNIVERSE.   U kill the dinozaveri and u look like a cool robot. Robots will zavladeqt the world, if they are rabbits, ofc.   i recommend this game. PLAY IT, FEEL IT, DONT GET DED AND REKT !    With alll my love, PeikaPLS
6655	1	a	Very fun game.  Also, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Activision.
1014	0	a	Now I haven't played this game in a few months, but it's still safe to say for me that this game might not be what you are looking for. Now some might say that for the low price, it is not that bad, but I think it is actually pretty dull and boring. The gameplay gets repedetive after only a few hours and there is almost no variety. For one there is a pretty big set of weapons, combined with multiple (I think 4) Perks, but they are just soooo boring, and there is almost no sense of progression to be seen anywhere, what is especially disappointing for me. The graphics aren't to bad, but just like everything else in the game, pretty dull. The dinosaur models are alright, and interesting, but again, the playing just gets repetetive quickly.
1015	0	a	Hard on any pc even with graphics on the lowest setting... Take care when playing.
6657	1	a	IS SO GOOD MYROM PLAY IT
6659	1	a	This game is far to fun to play. I do recommend this game. This game only COST .99, but it guys. It is worth it.
1016	0	a	Its like Jurassic Park, Halo, and Call of Duty had an abortion. Nothing else to say about it.
1017	0	a	Not worth it, not even for free.
6661	1	a	Tl:dr although this game is only a dollar, it's still fundamentally broken and loses it's charm after a couple of hours   Longer version. Orion prelude is a game about killing Dino's in space. It's a cool idea but it gets boring quickly. The main gamemode 'Conquest' consists of killing Dinos defending your base and capturing more land. It's fun, but after around 5 hours the different weapons and skills make no difference. The other game modes are more of the same and are not a printed are conquest. Although the devs fixed the Dino A.I the CPUs are still broken. I don't recommend playing by yourself for more than a hour.  To wrap up the game is worth a dollar, go ahead and buy it but it's not worth more than around 5-10 hours
6663	1	a	Got both my friends into a car, pressed shift (Turbo Boost) off a cliff, killed them, got an achievement. 10/10 would drive off cliff again.
6665	1	a	Run, gun, fly and drive just don't let the dinos wreck your reactor or eat your â™¥â™¥â™¥.   $1 game can't go wrong.
6667	1	a	not as bad as i thort it was going to be well worth 99p definatly reminds me of halo and turok :) good game for online playing :)
1020	0	a	still just as bad as it ever was...
1021	0	a	Absolute Crap, no wonder it was on sale
1022	0	a	I love how in the trailer the give us a bunch of random people who 'Like' the game and say it's 'Amazing' it's 99c for a reason. For you to think your getting a deal. If it goes for free for the weekend get it though, if you need to pass the time.
1023	0	a	If this game was paying you to play it then maybe it would have been worth the install.  This game feels worse than some of the 'Starseige: Tribes' mods I played more than 10 years ago.  The character animations are very clunky, most of the UI looks like it was made by a 14 year old in paint.  Weapons have no semblance of balance, the knife is the most powerful weapon in the game by miles.
1024	0	a	Very very good game! glitched around in a car for 20 minutes. 11/10 would play again.
1025	0	a	I just want to say tht the concept is cool, but it is kinda hard to play when the game won't stop lagging..
1026	0	a	tired of seeing this damn game in my library as free or in a deal. this game is trsah hence why its 1 dollar and they keep making this deals.dont get anddont waste your time.
1027	0	a	Shoot dinosaurs, get bored. Ai is terrible, some graphics belong back in doom or quake and the gameplay is bland. There is a ton of content but it all feels empty.
6669	1	a	But $h/t it was 99 cents.
1028	0	a	this is no game 
1029	0	a	this game is crap the quality sucks and the price is a rip off
6671	1	a	This game was a mixture of L4D2, halo and borderlands2. Very fun game 10/10.
6673	1	a	It has dinosaurs, lasers, guns, and swords.
6675	1	a	THIS GAME IS AWESOME! MUCH BETTER THAN DINO HORDE BEATDOWN! MUST BUY !   So people say that there can be zombies, Killer robots and Nuclear Bombs in Future Tech Warfare but... DINOSAURS!! HA!? Its Future Tech VS The Dinos . Humans Were weak against Dinos in stone age Now We stand on equal terms! Grab yer Gun And Friends And Kick some Dinos! I was playing yesterday And I punched A T REX when I was out of Ammo AND WOAH I KILLED IT! I PUNCHED A T REX AND IT DIED! THIS GAME IS EPIC! 3 AWESOME CARRIER ROLES AND LOADS OF DINOS AND IMBA GRAPHICS! I LOVE IT! YOU SHOULD TOO!
6677	1	a	Fun game! was well worth the $1.49 I would really love to see some south african servers though
6679	1	a	Dinos try to bite your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off
6681	1	a	Fantastic game! â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off? Go kill some dinos. Wanna punch a dino in the face? Go kill some dinos. Trying to impress the girl of your dreams? Show her how well you kill some dinos! A great play for any day!
6683	1	a	worst game I ever played, 12 out of 10
6685	1	a	This is one of my favorite dinosaur games the graphics is amazing the vehicals in this game are like halo vehicals also like the charactors like like halo this is a halo and a dinosaur game conbined you can fly as well with a jet pack and it is also game of the year and im going with that it is the best game of the year 
6687	1	a	It's like a horrifying but wonderess car accident, it looks dreadful but you can't stop looking at it.  Set you expectations to 0 and you'll enjoy playing a fairly bugy and at times sorta nice looking dinosaur shooter(but mostly kinda ugly) with run of the mill shooting mechanics and an inconsistent art style that looks like multiple artists got into a fight over how the game will look and just decided to put multiple styles into it because they couldn't be bothered to decide.  So, if you have 0.79 $ laying around somewhere, need to kill a few hours of your time and have no idea what else to play or do, then pick up Orion: Prelude because it's actully a bit of fun for a while and as i said, it's dirt cheap, actully it is the cheapest game you can buy right now on steam.  Bottom line : It's cheap,it's cheesy,it's glitchy but still can be fairly fun at times specially with a nice group of people.
6689	1	a	Great Game. Played with some friends. Some Guns are a lot mor powerful than others so if you pick and choose right you will dominate!
6691	1	a	Halo with dinosaurs
6693	1	a	Its like HALO but with dinos.
6695	1	a	if you like survivel games this one is pretty good along the lines of cod zombies and killing floor to name a few. this game breaks up the dull wave by wave play by adding objectives, cap the out post and kill the large boss dinos or the wave will just keep respawning. all in all this is a pretty good buy.
6697	1	a	Fun Game Like Halo 4+ Dino's Great game but OK Graphics and audio 7/10
1033	0	a	Horrible balance. I watched 10 dinos attacking one soldier and it never phased him while the dinos dropped like flies to a shotgun. Don't waste your time. While I get the idea its just not fun to be on a side so severly handicapped.
6699	1	a	I got this game for free on steampowers MAN ITS A GREAT GAME DONT BE FOOLED BY THE META SCORE
6701	1	a	This review is mainly for the multiplayer campaign, but wow. A tri-class Halo mixed with waves of dinosaurs! You must defend the generator that allows you to buy new perks and weapons. As you complete each level in the game, you push forward to capture new ground; rallying points containing vehicles of different types. Here are a few highlights:  - The pterodactyls pick you up and drop you. If you haven't invested in a parachute, you fall to your death.  - You may drive a tank, a hoverplane, or multiple other vehicles as you capture new rallying points.  - You may be targeted and charged by a triceratops.  - You may be eaten by a T-Rex, a 'Spinosaurus, ' or perhaps a seuch...sucha...oversized crocodile...  - Choose to wield pistols, a main weapon, a secondary weapon, or melee. Or just use a vehicle!  Overall, I dig this game, particularly with a good group of friends.  It bugs out on 32-bit systems. Deal with it by playing in windowed mode. Why wouldn't you do that in the first place? Either way, 8/10 for the time I (and many others) spent dealing with bugs.
6703	1	a	Unlike most steam reviewers, my review is about this game. Which I really like and have found it to be very refreshing and fun regardless of the problems. This developer obviously cares about us as players and I've witnessed the game evolve in all the ways it needed to from suggestions of players and fans.  Great Memories from playing with friends. Everyone hoping on a vehicle and the driver drives everyone off a cliff and we all die even though we were all wearing jetpacks. Classic!  The gameplay is straight forward. Kill dino's in waves, get money, buy upgrades, go out on a remote mission, come back &amp; kill dinos in waves. If your generator goes down Repair!  There is nothing quite like fighting a slew of mini dino's to look up and see T-Rex chomping down on your head, or getting that last pistol bullet into a dino right before you die for a self rez. Or getting that last Dino down while all your friends have fallen and are watching you complete the wave.  This game is awesome, great fun, great memories, and refreshing to see a developer that cares and a game that grows.
1035	0	a	The gameplay is boring. In the PvE mode dinosaurs differ mostly by size and HP amount. Their AI is closer to Space Invaders. Real dinos were smarter than that. The guns are uninspiring and gunplay doesn't deliver.  Looks like something from 2003 with some effects such as motion blur and depth of field slapped on to mask the ugliness.  Wouldn't play even if I was paid to.   If you want a good co-op game look at Payday 2, Left for Dead 2 or maybe Killing Floor.
1036	0	a	t-rex stuck in a small tree... kinda say it all. it sucks
1037	0	a	Unless you are mentally ill, and or a masochist, who like to torture yourself, I cannot recommend this game. Its just a reskin of the older game, Orion: Dino Horde, still has the same bugs, broken mechanics and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ balance.
1038	0	a	they should give us back our money 
6705	1	a	Survival mode is very fun with a friend. There are a number of balancing issues and bugs but these don't really spoil the game. The game is so cheap that I would recommend ignoring metacritic's outdated review and giving it a try.
6707	1	a	Only $0.99 to kill dinosaurs? Amazing. 11/10
6709	1	a	good game to play with and a decet amount of people play it but it lacks in weapons.
1039	0	a	when i seen partial controller support i didnt think it was this bad... there isnt even a button for E so i have to put down my controller as a dinosour throws me through the air and get glitched into a wall. lol im getting off topic anyways when in wepons and adjustments menu i have to go to my mouse... the assignments of the buttons are so bad that some of the same buttons do differnt things   W8 M8. 'August 10 F2P Is Live! ORION: Prelude is Free-2-Play!  Dinosaurs, Jetpacks &amp; Mechs  PvP, Co-Op,&amp; Dueling' they been had all of this
6711	1	a	thx for my GPU, playing dis game under 30 fps on low-med settings #LoveGrammarNazi
6713	1	a	DINO-RIFFIC 11/10 HOLY CRAPPP
1041	0	a	I unknowingly killed a dev and insulted the game in their face. I felt pretty guilty but then I thought, 'this game is so terrible adding Bubsy into it would make it better.'
1042	0	a	This is so terrible.
6715	1	a	I don't understand the hate that this game gets, though I had never played the earlier versions as I am a new player. The value this game has at 99 cents is very high in my opinion, with a decent variety of multiplayer modes, weapons, maps, enemies, vehicles, and more. The addition of AI teammates is a plus as I enjoy playing offline shooters. The scenery in the game is very well designed. Its not the most technically sound shooter I have ever played and it is not quite the kind of game that I could sink a large amount of hours into, but anyone who nitpicks a 99 cent game too much is taking things way too seriously in my book. I genuinely believe this game is better than some FPS games that I have paid $60 for in the past.
1043	0	a	A long time a go, I bought this game, 4 pack, because my friend also request it, but it turns out only 1 who really want it, so i keep the other 2, for trading purpose, but that was a mistake, nobody want this game, time after time this game price is decreased from 15$ into 1$, that was shocking, THAT WAS A HUGE LOSS. well, if that wasn't crazy enough, this game is free to play now, GGWP 10/10 will never use a game as investation again                                                        
1044	0	a	nothing new...
1045	0	a	Terrible, just really, unfortunately bad. Laggy and buggy controls, poor gameplay, just not nearly as fun as it should be.
6717	1	a	Coop is a blast but the team vs team is wonky and needs to be fixed I found my self nearly unmovable on some maps as a dino.
6719	1	a	I have played the first beta of the game ... it was â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ . But i have to admit that this has been the best transformation of a game i have ever witnessed
6721	1	a	I have SO much fun on this game. So many play styles, and it NEVER gets boring. Just more dinosaurs please!
1047	0	a	To be honest this is the second worst game I have ever played! It's even worse then civ 5 which is a waste of money. Never buy this game even if it is free.
6723	1	a	In many ways the spiritual successor to half-life 2 and most fun I've had in a game since fallout 3.  11/10 'it was decent'
6725	1	a	What else do you want in under a dollar?  the good: -cards -its cheap -plenty of modes  the bad: -graphics -optimization -empty servers most of the time  Score: 5.5/10
6727	1	a	'But â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, it was 99 cents!' Not only that this game only cost me 99 cents, It's better then some games that I bought at full price.  What I like about this game: -The devs are active in the games development -It's a fresh idea (You don't see alot of Dino killing games, amirite?) -Great Value, and all DLC and Updates are Free! (Who doesn't like free?) -There is a cash shop in where you can buy most items for a doller -The cash shop only sells cosmedics -Tons of Replayability -Mechs, APC tanks, and VTOLs -There's a Lightsaber  What I don't like: -If you join a game late, you are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed -If you have bad internet, you are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed -Sadly, not alot of people play this game :c  â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†
6729	1	a	This game has rose from the ashes. When I first got it the game was buggy AF. But now the game is fun.
1048	0	a	Remember Dino Crisis 3? Play that instead. This game is poop.
6731	1	a	Excellent, needs more players...
6733	1	a	While this game definitely had its rough beginnings, Spiral has really kept moving forward to make a great game. Yeah there are bugs and problems here and there, but you can be sure that Spiral is trying their best to fix as much as they can. With that said, the game has a great concept to it and is fun to play so always try to take problems with a grain of salt. Like others have said already, metacritic ratings aren't accurate as the game has evolved immensely since its origin as Beatdown. If you purchase during the sale, it's a steal for 99 cents since you get so much more than a dollar's worth. So put in that one dollar and help Spiral out, who knows? You might find the game just as fun as any other game out there on steam.  A great game with hard working devs, definitely worth your money and fun to play solo or alone. 9/10
6735	1	a	Really great game. Worth the price you pay.   Bought the 4 pack and it was the best. I recommend you buy it to.
6737	1	a	When someone dies everything goes slow mo and it sounds like the inception sound effect  wabawaba/10
1051	0	a	Hardly any servers to go on, single-player is boring as hell, and the graphics are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. 4/10
6739	1	a	Like Counter-Strike with dinosaurs
6741	1	a	played 8 minutes and got eaten by a t-rex 10/10 best game ever
6743	1	a	As of right now, the game isn't highly polished. Nut it works, and that's what matters. Fun game, low price.
6745	1	a	This game ruined my life and love of video games 0/10 would play again.
1053	0	a	Put this game in the trash.
1054	0	a	This game is fun to play. IF THE ONLINE MULTIPLAYER WOULD WORK PROPERLY FOR ONCE
6747	1	a	this is only my third day of playing and already my hair is starting to grow back and I find myself constantly surrounded by chicks in bikinis. 9/10
1055	0	a	Bahahahahahahahaha! *weez* HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! *cough cough* HAHA! *cough*  HA! *cough cough cough* *gargle* HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA *dies*
1056	0	a	If I knew what I know now about this game I never would have bought it I'd say the current price of 99 cents is a ripoff. Unless they changed every single broken â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing aspect of this piece of turd since I played it then its still the worst game I've ever played. And I've played some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in my day.
1057	0	a	Don't
6749	1	a	Halo with dinosaurs. Could it get better?
1058	0	a	This is most likely the worst game i have ever played. I would literally need so many combinations of drugs just to tolerate the bugginess. Its legitimately horrible but its a great joke gift for friends.
1059	0	a	This game sucks in short. It has improved sence the last free trial but this game only live between sales on steam. The loby is broken and in total disrepair, the dino AI is crap and, the objectives are hard to find. At best this is a early bata game but not a finished product or worth $00.99.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct92YOQE3Ks 
1060	0	a	The metacritic might reflect a previous version, but it isn't that far off. Graphics are decent, flying around with a jetpack or the hoverbike is entertaining, but that's about where the good news dies off.  -Guns jerk around like the player is inside a paint mixer every time they pull the trigger. Using anything but a pistol is a waste against all but the largest of targets, sheerly because the odds of you hitting them while spazzing out is increased. -Tanks will get stuck or flip around if you get too close to anything. Anything. Even inside one, large mobs virtually one-shot you as they charge and gnash. The slam move they perform seems to have a 200 yard radius. Flying a heli late in the game is more about shooting down other flying enemies chasing you than helping your team directly with rockets. -Shooting lacks 'feeling' and there is a noticeable disconnect while firing. The enemies don't react to it, so combining those issues you more-or-less spam fire and wait until you see an enemy flop to the ground like a water balloon and aim at the next one.  -Guns sometimes don't even animate. You'll fire and see a flash but your avatar's hand doesn't jerk back, the gun remains frozen on screen. -Barring fliers and spitters, enemies cannot react to players on a cliff or anything other than a flat plane. Using a jetpack to reach something off the ground lets you fire at fish in a barrel as they pace around trying to find a way to reach you. -To limit this, flying mobs sometimes grab a player and lift them into the air. Shooting them drops you, which can easily be jetpack'd right back to where you were. Better yet, slowly strafe a foot left and right to avoid being picked up by them in the first place. -You can punt small enemies in the hoverbike, though speed doesn't seem to matter. Flying at max speed usually drops them, lightly tapping them usually punts them up or away a huge distance. My only guess is Aliens. -Did I mention this has an in-game cash shop, too? For only $50 you can get 75,000 coins to get skins, hats, and only the best priced bundles this side of Jurassic Park. -When you log in right now, you are promptly reminded that not only can you get this masterpiece on sale, but they also have a Kickstarter campaign starting in just over a day from right NOW! What are the odds of that? What luck!   End result: Thumbs emphatically -down-. If you like dinosaurs and cannot resist the urge, feel free to get it now while it is a dollar. Heck, get the four-pack so if any of your friends in the future, even long-term future, decide to want to get this, trade it to them for a TF2 hat or something. Spare them, anonymous review reader.   Spare them.
1061	0	a	Someone has found a way to make dinosaurs not awesome.
6751	1	a	cool game
1062	0	a	For a dollar, I would say give it a try. However, since a dollar isnt how much it usually is, I won't reccomend this game. Now, I've only played two gamemodes, but they seem to be the main ones, nor have i put much time into this game. But here goes my first thoughts.  First off, I'll go over Survival, a classic Horde-survival. However, it seems very broken and simple. While on top of a building, well out of reach of a Triceratops, it hit me and sent me flying, even though there was no way that could've possibly hit me. The raptors and compies are also far to easy to kill, as they are unable to jump to reach you. This gamemode seems simply to easy.  Now onto Rampage. The Dinosaurs attacks have simply HORRIBLE hit-markers. As a trex, I bit right on top of someone, but the game simply didnt count it. The eggs also simply floated in the air, sometimes out of reach for most dinosaurs, when the carrier was killed in mid-air. The vision was also weird for me, and sprinting doesn't seem to make anything move faster, but that's probably just me.  Overall, try the game for free if you have enough space and feel like it. However, I highly reccomend against this, as the game is pretty broken in several key-aspects at the moment.
6753	1	a	I don't own the game but I can write a rewiev. So I think it's a cool game and I give it a good rewiev.
6755	1	a	so a while back this game was on sale for 0.99 I loved Dinosaurs they were so cool, almost as cool at he game eets muchies 5/5 star game I mean if you wanted to be as cool as the FieryPepper, Definetely By this game! Now into the very detailed and serious review of Orion Dino Horde Like I said this game was 0.99$ when I purchased it Great Price and I LOVED DINOSAURS OMG PERFECT GAME.... thats what I thought, When I found out the point of the game was to fight off hordes OF â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING DINOSAURS I WAS VERY â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ OFF, I mean NO WONDER THIS GAME â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING IS ALWAYS ON SALE IT SHOULD BE LOWERED TO â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING 0.00$ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, NO NOT EVEN -100$ THEY SHOULD PAY US TO PLAY THIS CRAP MY GAWD...
6757	1	a	Teabagged a dead T-Rex on slow motion with an helicopter.  9/11 GOTY
6759	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is cash as my balls
6761	1	a	10/10  Best game I've ever played.
1071	0	a	The trailer is right: don't believe the Metacritic review. 36/100? I don't understand where they got all those points from..  If you enjoy things like: Loadout customization where your Primary Weapon choices are: 'Connection Error' and six other blank slots Bleeding ears after the T-Rex roars 20x louder than the rest of the game Crash on alt-tab Graphics from the 16th Century A wide variety of 3 classes that all spawn you with some kind of generic block thing Running 3000m to start the game  Then I would recommend this game for you, you stupid â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
1072	0	a	Ok, so this game is a bit misleading... 'The metacritic score is missleading' Notice none of these quotes have actual citation... Because noone but the developers said it. Don't be fooled by the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t comments. Good thing it's on sale. This is the most revenue this game will ever generate.  WHY IT'S BAD: Ai is terrible, gameplay is simplistic and boring, artwork is meh. Don't waste your penny's. I fully intend to ask for a refund because I bought the 4 pack to play with friends.  1/10 (Because every game created deserves a little credit)
1073	0	a	You can get 6 cards from this game. I recommend you play the game until you get the cards, otherwise you're missing out on about six nickels' worth of value. The best way to play the game until then is to idle out in the main menu and read a book.
1074	0	a	This game has potential.. to bad the controls are all wonky and bugged. .99$ meh...
6763	1	a	100/100
1076	0	a	Dont buy this 'game', not even for 0,99$. Not only is the game an unfinished, bugy piece of trash (even after YEARS), but the devs have shown on so many occasions that they are just in it for the money, and that they are willing to do EVERYTHING in order to milk the last cent out of this horrible 'game'. I could ramble on about how they tricked consumers into buying, but if you are interested just google it yourself you will be slain by articles of fraud claims etc. Total Biscuit reviewd some earlier version of the game, his review is very accurate.
6765	1	a	+1
1077	0	a	Before this huge update, the game was fun and I enjoyed it. But now I'm experiencing a lot of frame drops, bugs and other gui problems. Seems to me like this version was not tested enough and released too early.
6767	1	a	It's Borderlands, but with dinosaurs.
6769	1	a	Oh Dino Horde. I love this game, one of my reasons to join steam. It has a few flaws, what game does not, but in the end it is a very fun title that will give you a lot of happiness and will let you loose, as much loose as you can be while charged by HORDES (title does not lie) of prehistoric Reptiles that try to either get you or crash the Generator you have to protect. This game is built on team wok, so it is going to be based on what people you play with either you going to have a lots of gunblazing fun or running back and forth fixing your generator while being munched on by some compy, because other players have left to do whatever. Beside that, the only other thing that can spoil your play time is an occasional lag (hopefully they have fixed that since the last time I have played). So yeah, if you would buy this game, it would be great. No seriously, it is 0.99 right now, and it has Guns, Dinosaurs and awesome vehicles, go get it.
1079	0	a	This game has its moments, and it might be fun for the first 7 miliseconds but after that it gets rediculous, sadly the game had some potential. It has exciting graphics, and thats it! Don't even get me started about the 'eaten mechanics'. The game also suckers us (the consumers) into buying it with its few over-average screenshots. Please dont buy this....
1080	0	a	Update 29/06/16: My original review was for Orion: Dino Beatdown, which then became Dino Horde and now Prelude. Despite the game going through several name changes to put itself back on the steam frontpage for more sales and to reset it's bad review scores it's still an unenjoyable mess of a game with a developer surrounded by controversy of stolen assets and crowdfunding fraud. Read here for more info and sources:  http://www.thejimquisition.com/trek-versus-activision-how-orion-went-from-victim-to-villain-in-one-night/  Just because it's cheap does not forgive the fact it's a bad game and run by asset thieves, the shady dealings of the developer are well known and should never be supported even if the sale price was $0.01. DO NOT SUPPORT THIS DEVELOPERS GAMES FOR ANY PRICE.
6771	1	a	Open the door, get on the floor, errybody shoot them dinosaurs. Makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, but its essentially COD zombies plus Halo's firefight with just a dash of freaking dinosaurs. Have you ever played another game where you got to shoot freaking dinosaurs wit yo homies? NEIN.
6773	1	a	This game is a fun little title where you fight horde after horde of zombi-, I mean dinosaurs. Even though the game is pretty glitchy I still think that this game is a fun FPS to play with friends. One thing I disliked however is that there is an ingame store that requires real money to make any purchases, which is a shame. Seeing as how the game is on sale now, I would suggest buying it.
1081	0	a	Sorry but once I played it.... It was horrible.. I didn't enjoy it.. I was excited about it, but yeah.. Hope the next game you make is actually being a dinosour, story mode. Would be awesome or having them as pets. I didn't get far but if you can do this in the game. Well that would have been interesting to see in trailers.. Something new and epic would be interesting. Not common and same as every other game. Even though this one had lot of different things, It's basic. But it had some pretty cool stuff too. more down than ups..
1082	0	a	This game actually sucks. Bugs, bugs and more bugs. DONT BUY
6775	1	a	I played it a while back on a free weekend and saw it was only Â£1 and i had just over a pound left so i got it and its an awesome game
6777	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing sick game omg its like a mix of The Last of Us and Bioshock Infinite
6779	1	a	ORION:Dino Horde is a dinosaur survival game. If youve ever played nazi zombies or extintion then this is like it. You have a certain ammount of dinos to kill each round. Overall a fun game worth playing. 
6781	1	a	nerubian dino hord is a revolushonary game that blends the horde mode made by halo reach and jurassic park to make an incredibul gamig experiense
6783	1	a	Technically terrible. Could get you some fun if you can get over that.
6785	1	a	Got this game for $0.99 on sale, I would have paid more. This game defiantly deserves another chance, I just played almost 2 hours of it in a row after buying it up and will defiantly be playing more with my friends. It is one of those games that is just much better with friends, so i highly recommend finding friends to play it with.   This game deserves an 8.5/10, and i heard they are still planning even more updates in the future. I would consider it a game that is in Beta stage, but at least they finally got it out of that horrible Alpha stage.  I can see it turning into something amazing once they have finished.
6787	1	a	Really fun in co-op
6789	1	a	This game is amazing and suitable for kids to play
6791	1	a	It's like Battlefield, except with Dinosaurs.
6793	1	a	This is the only game ive ever played that let me run at a horde of dinosaurs with knife while wearing a dinosaur mask. 10/10
6795	1	a	Great game! Ignore the meta score! Lots of changes have been made and you are missing out if you dont spend a buck to buy this! Better yet buy the 4 pack so you can give some to your friends.
6797	1	a	There's just so MUCH to this game! Granted, it is all about killing dinosaurs, so if that's not your thing, this game will not be for you. BUT, if you DO like to kill hordes of dinos... You've found a game that I can almost guarantee you'll enjoy.   This is a great game to play with a group, though. Solo, you might find it slightly daunting. But come on, who's really going to take on a horde of dinos on their own? That's what I thought.
1088	0	a	
6799	1	a	9/10 AMAZING!  I'd had my eye on this game for a while then it went on sale for $0.99. TOTALY worth it. The co-op is great even with only 3 classes. The music is nice and the visuals are breataking. I get such a rush too, there's nothing like gunning down a charging T-Rex and there's nothing cooler then having the game shift into bullet time when you take down one of the big boys.  Furthermore the extra modes are just as mun, pvp dules, rampage, conquest (don't get me started on conquest).  The only downside I find is the lack of diversity with the builds. It's not horrible but having three classes where their only differences are their abilities (Jetpack, Heal gun, and Stealth) does take away from some team elements that could be there.  Honestly, I'm having a blast (even more so than I did with TF 2!). $1 or $15, get this game .
6801	1	a	Game is a big surprise. Very engaging co-op. The dev took some serious â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ over this game when they rebranded it but it's a damn fun experience now. I'll be putting some hours into this with friends. Dont get it if you're a lonely man, but if you have lots of people to play with it's gonna eat up some hours.
6803	1	a	Suprisingly a very fun game. 7/10
6805	1	a	if it was crap first, they fixed it now. Reminds me of a mix between Section 8: Prejudice and Killing Floor. stupid not to get it at one eurodollarz
6807	1	a	GAME OF THE YEAR 2013.
6809	1	a	Just awesome, i have no idea whats going, just press play and kill every damn prehistoric motherhubber you see. Damn Turok wouldve been proud.  Just awesome.  Ah yeah ps:  â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ pay2style systems.
6811	1	a	Love this game!
6813	1	a	AMAZING JUST AMAZING
6815	1	a	this is the wost game ever made
6817	1	a	really fun game!!! 1$ now so get it 
6819	1	a	0/10 it ruined my life. Okay, without joking, this game is too fantastic to cost only a dollar (however I should not complain here, I can save up more money), great dynamics, epic slow motion, the only things I don't like: the music is a bit boring for me and the other thing what disturbs me even more is that I can run through the dinosaurs (so, a not neat texture bug) but if this bug will be fixed, and more music will be added, this will be a perrrrfect game in my oppinion. I can only suggest it to anyone, especially now that it is super cheap during this sale.
6821	1	a	Metacritic's 36 is for a very early version of this, and is way too low, considering Dino Horde is as good as most of the popular FPS games on steam. It's like COD Zombies/Spec Ops + Halo Firefight + Turok.
6823	1	a	Pros: Shank Dinosaurs Funny Accents Better version of League of Legends Masterpiece of Videogrames Gave me cancer Pterodactyls show you the world Aladdin Style Best game EUNE  Cons: Not enough dinosaurs Expensive  10/10. Tim Allen Approves 
1091	0	a	heavly bugged and has no orginal content that isn't stolen from other games
6825	1	a	A game so bad that it's so good.
6827	1	a	Its horse â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
6829	1	a	This game reminds me a lot of Killing Floor. Basicaly you face down waves of dinos, with the ocassional objective capture in the between, and jumbo dinos to fight off, all while protecting your base. Simply yet addicting. Totally the best $0.99 I ever spent :)  Loads of fun with friends and offers a good variety of classes (flighing, healing, &amp; stealth).
6831	1	a	epic, addictive what more could you ask? everyone is concerned about graphics and detail games are ment to be games and fun and stuff
6833	1	a	It's that one type of Halo game but with Dinosaurs!!
6835	1	a	at a buck, you gotta own this.
6837	1	a	Dino defense with more options :)
6839	1	a	This is the best game i have ever played on steam, it is perfect, there is nothing i would change about it. 10/10 i MADE all my close friends buy this game
6841	1	a	at 0.99c its worth it, you and your friends will have fun, my only problem is there isnt enough lobbies
1092	0	a	Very bad graphics and the game is still lagging, a lot of bugs, boring game (and yes even with friends) i'm sure that you can buy something better than this game.
6843	1	a	You definently get more than you pay for with this game!
1094	0	a	Dang it. why did I let myself get fooled by the trailer. I really wanted to like this game, I really did. And it looks so GOOD in the trailer, lightsabers, mechs, dinosaurs. sounds like a recipe for fun.  Unfortunately tons of velociraptors in your face that instantly blur because the textures blow isnt fun. guns that have a muzzle flash after you fire isnt fun. No tutorial what so ever isnt fun. microtransactions arent fun. And gameplay elements that are terrible.   I gave up playing as a velociraptor in thirty seconds because you cant strafe so the only thing to do to a human is run right at them. No way to out manouver, and considering the humans can kill you in two seconds.. Even as a human the game felt grindy and unpolished. You can unload TONS of ammo into the larger dinosaurs and get no results and not even anything to let you know they are taking damage apart from some out of place looking numbers on the screen and a bad looking blood splatter. Now, I don't usually care if graphics are bad. But I want my bulltes to line up with my fire, I want to not be the wrong colour and have no textures for three seconds after spawning, I want what feels like a complete game for my money.  At this tage, I have to recomend you save yourself tha embarassment of trusting this game to deliver.   EDIT: Ok they have recently made an update that seems to follow a particular theme, that theme, is that the devs are doing what they can to provide continual suuport, adn are constantly improving the game, basically all the issues I covered here have been fixed. so the game is ok now.
6845	1	a	It is fun enough said
6847	1	a	Love this game lots of fun!
6849	1	a	Played it for a while and it worked perfectly fine and it was wvery entertaining. Good game. Worth the money.
6851	1	a	play this!
6853	1	a	Borderlands with dinosuars.
1095	0	a	The survival gets extremely boring after 2 games of it. It ends up getting way too hard and without the weapons saving or loadouts saving its not worth the money.
6855	1	a	Funny game with ragdolls thats messy, but don't buy if you are looking for a correct gameplay its soo fa-doodled also graphics
6857	1	a	Its 99 cents, and its okay. I wouldn't say its bad, but could be better.
6859	1	a	If I could say one thing about this game...it would be dinosaurs
1097	0	a	piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game
6861	1	a	It's very cheap and very entertaining to play when you're bored. The graphics are really nice and runs very well on my computer.
6863	1	a	It is now allmost free,soon,soo im giveing this a like
6865	1	a	For 99p its a good deal, he maps are very big and open and everything looks pretty. Its difficult to keep track of players as they tend to die in two chomps, the sounds are repetitive and the voice commands are so cheesy they would be rated extra mature. Fun for multi player if you can have a laugh at some of the physics, its no Serious Sam and you get exactly what you pay for!
6867	1	a	nice game but the grapics kinda suck
6869	1	a	This game is so good i give it 9 360 no scopes out of ten. This game is better then call of duty.
6871	1	a	Lagged quite a bit when i started but when i put the graphics down it became great and quite a fun game.
6873	1	a	BEST GAME EVER GET IT
6875	1	a	dis game is good, had a rocky start with dino beatdown, but the developer has stuck with it and made it an actually good game, i had alot of fun playing this and its dirt cheap now, so there really is no excuse not to have this in your library!
6877	1	a	Dinosaurs. Jetpacks. Rocket launchers. Currently 0,75â‚¬. Totally worth it.
6879	1	a	I took what appeared to be a Future Tractor with a jet engine strapped to the back of it and proceeded to run over a line of 10 velociraptors, at which point I ran headfirst into a T-Rex which decided it was time to throw me and Future Tractor 300 meters through the air. Future Tractor didn't survive, but I somehow made it and then took my laser sword to some more dinosaurs.  10/10
6881	1	a	Great concept, lots of options, nice co-op, it's a keeper!
6883	1	a	play this game with friends... its way more fun that way... 8/10
6885	1	a	it is a video game 10/10
6887	1	a	Amazing amount of fun for the steam sale price, why did this game get only a 36 on MC?
6889	1	a	Killed T-Rex.  10/10 would save the Earth again.
6891	1	a	This game is absolutely amazing. The physics engine is flawless. I was wrecking dinos left and right and then a T-Rex through a boulder at me. 10/10 would buy the 4 packs for friends.
1100	0	a	Probably one of the worst games ever made.
1101	0	a	I tried playing this game, but not even the slightest indication of how to play or what you are doing is given. 0 out of 5 stars.
6893	1	a	Decent game, good with friends
1102	0	a	I purchased this game when it was $1. I mean for a $1 game, this game is decent and actually you can say it's a good price for what you get, BUT at $15, the game is just not worth it. The gameplay is basically what it looks like, slaughtering dinosaurs wave after wave until you just win the game. The gameplay is super repetitive and gets very dull easily, I guess it's a little more fun when you play with friends but still, the gameplay is the same each time. Reading the positive reviews about ORION, I'd have to say this game must have been a lot worse without all the updates it has had. I enjoy the game and all, but I would not recommend it if there are no discounts. There is supposably a big update coming this month, but I will change my review then if my opinion has been altered.  The Pros: - Co-op, play with friends!  - Vehicles: Jeeps, Hovercrafts, Tanks, Robots, and more (Fun!) - Dinosaurs: T-Rexs, Stegosaurus, and some other fairly big ones - Just a LITTLE character customization included  The Cons: - The gist of the game, very dull - Repetitive gameplay - Limited class choices - Small array of guns to select from - Limited amount of players in servers - Limited enemy types, considering it's a dinosaur game, there are a very limited type of species. (All there is is regular raptors, pterodactyls, and the larger version of them, then the big dinos that are similar to bosses) - Limited map selection (Maps have sub selections which allow you to switch the game from day to night and vice versa, but... it's still the same map) - Limited game modes  - There is no real motive to the game, it's just for fun (If you don't include achievements)    
1103	0	a	Launched it 2 times. 2 crashes in a row. 10/10 Auto-delete.
6895	1	a	Possibly one of the best Survival Genre games i have ever played
6897	1	a	I bought this game for 99 cents. I thought it would completely suck. It turned out to be one of the best games I've played in a long time. Buy a 4 pack and give it to some friends. You won't regret it.
1105	0	a	Though fun, the game falls horribly short as the dinosaur. They feel unpowered, squishy, and mostly target practice. Where this is good playing as a human in survival or even in versus; It leaves much to be desired as the supposedly powerful beasts. As the smaller dino's, you're so soft that you can rarely take more than one quick shot. The larger ones seem so clumsy and slow that it's nearly impossible to hit the humans. It could really do with some rebalancing of the team/species-based combat. The solo play is fun, and playing humans v. humans is also enjoyable, if not reminescent of another scifi shooter. If you wanted to play this game simply to be a titan, squishing puny humans and eating them up, this is not for you. If you wanted a good online shooter where you can switch targets between walking fossils and other sacks of meat; then you've come to the right place.
6899	1	a	I would complain about the sometimes ugly effects I would complain about how much of the game seems to be copying aspects from Halo and borderlands I would complain about the upgrade icons in the store being super low-res  But who the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ complains about a game that costs 80 pence when NOT on sale.
6901	1	a	AWESOME but slow load speed and shooting reaction 
6903	1	a	need optimization
6905	1	a	First of all. some of the latest haters are a little bit stupid cause they didnt noticed (like some big magazines ) that THIS IS NOT THE GAME WITH THE DMCA PROBLEMS. Most of them played the game for only 0.5 hours. Orion prelude isnt a bad game and ORION (2016) also.  And something i also want to say:'Activision' always have problems with everything and everyone.  I played this game long enough to know that the most haters never played the game more than 10 minutes. This is my second positive review.
6907	1	a	Dinosaurs, space, vehicles etc. are all totally worth the price
1110	0	a	Very poorly made game. Logic is cringeworthy but it has it's moments. Would reccomend ONLY on cheap sales.
1111	0	a	Kinda â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ but still dumb entertainment, recommended for the $0.99 price tag as opposed to the $14.99 price tag unless you are dumb enough to buy it at that price...
6909	1	a	This is the best game I have ever played.  Half-Life 4, forged in the greatest altar of the High Heavens, made from Gabe Newell's sweet, sweet, tears, could never compare.  Needless to say, this game gets me Tyrannosaurus-E-REKT.
6911	1	a	Rustalions always had a issue with 'The Dinos' this game helps teach my Rustalions warriors how to 'Deal' with them.
1112	0	a	NO, this game sucks, look at the old players from 1 year ago have to pay 6euro, now just 1 dollar, just not worth it, this game's developer should do something about it, because just changing the price over night ain't change the fact 1 year ago it was 10 euro!  Edit and add: the game became positive for some reason let me see what people see in the pros?  Pros: Memeing every possible way of killing a t-rex Memeing every possible way of bugging out Memeing every possible way of the potential nazi t-rex invasion  Cons that i see for myself: -Sluggish animation that is even worse than Ride to hell -Guns work like free FPS browser game -Dinosaur bugging the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out of u if u are in a vehicle  1st the Aligator will bug out in the water with the rest of the dinosaur if u are in a jeep that face backward to them at the begining of the round 2nd T-rex are sometimes invisible  3rd Flying dinosaurs are the worst thing to kill cause they â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing bugging out at the top of the skybox 4th Helicopter is the worst maybe worse in some case as it cant shoot flying dinosaurs without flipping out 5th Tanks will fly  - Map design are too big , making an attempt for (open world) . And there is a mode called open world but it is just a bigger map with some random crate that have the same modes of other maps in various part of it
6913	1	a	There is a $wagzilla, nuff said.  11/10
6915	1	a	damm this game is just superb for 79 cents itÂ´s worth it , if you buy it longside with friends and you play with them itÂ´s a really funny game
6917	1	a	Best game ever played it for DAYS!! Thumbs up god work!!!!!!
6919	1	a	Not only is this game the best of it's time, but its mechanics and gameplay is remarkable. The fact that it tells me to press 'E' and it does absolutely nothing causing me to die is a game feature that itself is a deal breaker. And the fact that it's a PC exclusive and not optimized for PC makes me leave this an 11/10
6921	1	a	A very fun game, and only for 1$!!! 
6923	1	a	Laughed at friend buying this game thought it looked â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. got given copy spent the next 2 hours epically fighting Trex's. A terex through a boulder at my face. 11/10 would take a boulder to the face again.
6925	1	a	Reminds me of Halo back when Halo was fun and had dinosaurs in it.
6927	1	a	The true CoD killer has arrived. For only $0.99 you can â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ up coloured blobs that are vaguely reminscent of dinosaurs.  Beyond that this game will give you crazy dino-fighting instincts. No reptile will escape your righteous fury. A Geko was crawling across my roof the other day and I just point blank shot it down with my trusty m16 assault rifle. No mercy.   Buy Oreo: Prenoodle for your children and watch as they turn from mewling baby into a roaring dinosaur poacher who will bring about a level 5 extinction event before they are even in preschool.  16.7/10
6929	1	a	It was....a fun game with friends.
1113	0	a	Just no no stop looking at, yeah you dont even for a second think of buying this turn around and go buy something else this is not worth time, Download, Hard drive space, or anything. Trex mechs no noooooooooooooooooooooooo 
6931	1	a	You can kill dinosaurs with lightsabers
6933	1	a	Still debating if my $1.50 was really worth it or not. hilaribad
1114	0	a	The thing is about this game, it is poorly made, bad shooting mechanics, bad AI, driving vehicles handle worse than GTA IV, and the slow motion is annoying (but can be disabled upon further discovery). Orion: Dino Horde is the re-release of ORION: Dino Beatdown. Just a copy/paste of the game to get a new score on Metacritic, but still recieves its old score of 36. You can't really customize your character, that part is microtransactions. You want to be red? Too bad! Have pitch black instead. Trust me, it doesn't really look good either.  But, there is a few good things Fun co-op Hilarious ragdoll physics A great game to make fun of.  I only got the game because it is 1$, as this game isn't worth 15$ in my book.
6935	1	a	This game costs 79 cents. 79.Cents. It's worth it. If you want a few hours of fun with your friends, buy this. It has dinosaurs, an in-game shop,did i mention dinosaurs? It's fun.
6937	1	a	Sexy fun all day every day. I loved being ravished by big dinos.
1117	0	a	after watching the first trailer on store page, and read the 'comments' in this video i thought 'wow that must be really cool- so much positive comments - and wow they say its like killing floor and borderlands and turok. wooow'. but it was not.  after few seconds on title screen the backround music makes you puke. then startetd the game. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ graphic, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ sounds, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ viewmodels, no atmosphere. this game maybe good.....if you are 12 years old and we have the year 1997 and you re totally in halo or dinosaurs.
6939	1	a	'11/10 like League of Legends with guns' - Carlos Donger
6941	1	a	i say 50 50 and this is a RE releash to put it  This is just a name change and more updated game (just saying) it was called   But back to the point it is a fun good old game  i say it a good game you may love it i find it fun and enjoyable i mentioned the top so you would know but i find it more fun then Cod Ghosts to put it it has a lvling systems and 3 classes
1118	0	a	WARNING THIS IS JUST ME RANTING ABOUT HOW â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ AND UNFINISHED THIS GAME IS.  The rant: This game is a cheaply made clone of halo trying to be original by throwing in some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing dinosaurs. At first I was excited when I booted up the game and played for a few minutes, 'aww yeah this is fun' then it hit me these guns all feel like toy guns that shoot little plastic balls and feel really underwelming. so you are either shooting at enemy players that all look like a ridiculous version of Zero from borderlands 2 but with more LED lights glued to their suits or you are shooting some stupid as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ dinosaurs. It is full of bugs, glitches and this game should of at least been finished before they released it. Oh wait this is the finished product, let me just shove that Â£0.59 up my â™¥â™¥â™¥. Oh and all the maps are big open planes with a few rocks and if you're lucky a puddle of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing water.  The pros: This game would be okay if you were playing it with friends for less than 30 minutes before deciding to go back on PAYDAY 2 because all your friends you were playing with have killed themselves.  Thanks for reading, now im going to go play with my balls.
6943	1	a	You can kill dinosaurs. This fulfills my childhood Jurassic Park fantasies. 12/10
6945	1	a	I have wasted $0.68, now that the devs made this game free-to-play. For me, this game is good, i just play with bots, because i live in Asia, and there are like 5 servers on this game. 400 if not 500 ping on every server, do you expect me to play with that ping?  But overall, good game. DEVS made this game free for those who want to try.
1120	0	a	&gt;Last played February 21st 2014  As it should, and always will be.  I really have no idea what they added since then, but based on what other negative reviews have said, I don't think I have any other insightful comments to add, so I'll just a story if you want to read more.  I got this game in 2014, probably the 21st of february to be exact, all because someone I knew back then told me to get it to play with them. They really enjoyed playing this piece of tosh $1 arena dino shooter game at the time. Well I guess their taste in this game was indicative of them overall, garbage. The end.  Just play TF2, Dirty Bomb, any other F2P game besides this.
1121	0	a	Terrible Halo ripoff however it's still mildly fun for a couple of hours to play regardless of how bad it is.
1122	0	a	This Game is a Dinosaur.
6947	1	a	this is such a awsome game but i wish the performance for it would be better on my laptop :x -highly reconmmend dont worry about the meta score its false the developers are doing a awsome job adding new stuff to the game so far ; 0
1123	0	a	Since it got free to play for a few days I decided to give it a go. I'm not a real fan of shooter games but if they're interesting I play them. From the videos I thought I should give it a go.   After installing the game started and I was scurrying trough the options (I always do). Out of the blue I got my first achievement, yay! Anyways, after that I decide to 'Play Game' apparently you first have to FIND a game so I did that. However the room list doesn't update and it takes forever if you make one by yourself (because it doesn't update for anyone)...   So I went solo. I don't like solo. But hey I tried! Apparently the goal is to steal eggs and drop them off somewhere, while you keep shooting like a madman on the dinos. However the game wasn't very smooth for me so aiming was not an option, and you can't shoot while carrying eggs. I tried many, many times to do this game and when I finally put down the T-Rex, IT RESPAWNED. Yay! So you can't even really finish this game anyways because you get â™¥â™¥â™¥-raped the whole time -.-  Sorry to say but, personally I absolutely hated it.
1124	0	a	I do not recommend this because it's a buggy, unfun mess.
6949	1	a	The Metacritic is misleading , the game got completly remade after the bad critics wave they eaten up with courage and now the game is combination beetween halo and a survival game with dino ! Simply awsome , the coop aspect is essential to keep being alive. 7/10 With more updates it will become epic , oh yeah and there an open world gamemode.
6951	1	a	ORION: Prelude has changed me forever. It has made me a different person.
6953	1	a	This is an awesome game I really like the idea of the game but its a bit overpriced :D Recommended if the price drops
6955	1	a	anything with dinosaurs and guns is AWESOME
1125	0	a	Worth the dollar to laugh at how utterly terrible it was, but only barely.
6957	1	a	Hell yes. This game is awesome. Reminds me of the wildly inventive mods of the early 2000s.
6959	1	a	Dinosaurs are destroying your generator! Are you a bad enough dude to kill them all?  Dinosaurs/10
6961	1	a	One of the greatest games I've ever played.
6963	1	a	very fun game  i would recomend it to my friends
6965	1	a	In a lot of ways, this isn't a very good game. However, it's incredibly fun, and there's a lot of attention to detail.
6967	1	a	Shooting Dino's and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Hell why not.
6969	1	a	A very awesome game i Love the whole Dino feel and hunting them down i rate this game 7/10
6971	1	a	Pretty fun party game
6973	1	a	Fighting against hordes of dinosaurs? How much better does it get?!
6975	1	a	Dinosaur genocide simulator with T-Rexes that do flips.
6977	1	a	halo + dinos = 8/10   Never pay full price for this game, buggs out too much. That being said really fun.
6979	1	a	Better cost to replay value than BF4
6981	1	a	Personally I don't like this game, just don't like it and I still want to recommend it anyway. L4D 2 is way better and I got it for free.  3/10
6983	1	a	Sold my AK-47 and m4a1-s on Cs go then purchased this game for 0.99$ Totally worth it.
6985	1	a	For the two hours i've played. I highly rated this game, considering it cost me a whole 4 dollars on sale for 4 copies. However, i just wish the multiplayers worked for me, as it seems to for my friends. I want to murder some dinosaurs :( I'm going to blame the game, but i should probably blame my ISP. Would buy again, if on sale for 99c.
1129	0	a	This game is so broken. I haven't experienced any actual bugs, but the Dinosaurs are so overpowered that all the gamemodes aren't even that fun. Survival is okay for a couple of hours, but it is the only DECENT gamemode. All the others are just boring, overused by most games, and if there are dinosaurs involved, considerably unbalanced. For this game to go on 93% to get some sales just shows the desperation of this producer...   I would give it a 4/10 at most, and that is being generous. This game is pretty much a waste of a dollar, so unless it is on sale that much, I highly recommend not getting
6987	1	a	  Sure, it might not be the greatest game ever and there are some funny â™¥â™¥â™¥ glitches at times. And sure, maybe there are many FPS games that are funner to play. And sure, maybe one of the dinosaurs i ended up looking inside of.  But you know what, i enjoyed the wackiness of this game and plus the developers seem to have no problem admitting the faults of the game either! So yeah, you could say this game grew on me....a LOT. I would highly recommend buying it since it's so cheap, but if you can't buy it, than maybe you could get a friend to gift it to you like mine did.
6989	1	a	Very Good Game heavily suggest it... however get you connection ready for the amazing dino chaos; they swarmp you litrely it's... SOOO COOL!!! 9/10 (could improve on the paid customizations make a in-game monet system for to look awsome without spend too much money *not complaining on the prises*)
6991	1	a	Played one game of survival...................... WHY IS THIS GAME ONLY 49 CENTS TAKE MY MONEY TAKE ALL MY MONEY! I have only gotten a chance to play the survival mode and what I saw was well worth the 49 cents and then some, I loved watching the T-Rex tear my teammates to shreds..... 10/10 would let them get eaten again
6993	1	a	Oh look. A bunch of people jumping on a witch hunt and ruining someone's livleyhood based on activisions unprovable claims on a non-competing franchise.   Get real people -- errors have been corrected; hence why the game is back up for sale. The worst are the people changing overhelmingly positive reviews based on here-say like truly ignorant white knights.  If you want to go blast something go hate on the re-re-re-released version of the WarZ -- Shattered Skies. Those people deserve all the hate the world has to offer and more.
6995	1	a	  even though i tried this game for abut half an hour while it was free i love this game there are a lot of dinos and cool weapons and to make this even better this game is really cheap.   Definitely better than it was in 2012
6997	1	a	i actually bought a skin for my character in this game with my hard earned cash. immediately regretted it  10/10
6999	1	a	(Going to update this as time goes by, but just know that the dev does update the game to this day, and it's really good fun! I'd suggest the reason a lot of people don't like it, is that it's in a different gameplay style than they're used to. But seriously it's a 8/10 for me.)
7001	1	a	Picture a mix between starforge and killing floor, Ill be playing this for a long time
1130	0	a	Dinosour games should be like dinosours...extinct.  3/10  -SÑ—á¾”á¹§
7003	1	a	this is the best dinosour game ever creatide  
7005	1	a	great game and very cheap! I boght this for 24 cents :D 11/10 just buy this game :D
7007	1	a	This game is probably the best game on steam for 99 cents. It has really unique graphics, and stuff. However, there was one glaring problem-- I don't know if it's just for my computer but I keep on getting a connection lost message even though I can play CS:GO for 3 hours with no wifi errors, as far as I know. If you know what's going on, please reply.
7009	1	a	The game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, the graphics are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, the mechanics are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. they only good thing about it is the hour i spent laughing at how â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it is
7011	1	a	Not ground-breaking, but not bad either. The devs have been really nice to the community, making continuous content updates and patches. It's fun to play with friends.
7013	1	a	This game is great grahpics may not be the best but content has lots of things in it definatly recommand this game its quite cheap too
7015	1	a	Imagine Killing Floor...BUT DINOSAURS AND JETPACKS!!!!!! 10/9  A T-Rex eated me and i deaded.  SO MANY LAUGHS with friends. Must get. Especially when it goes on sale for $0.99. Good dollar spent.
7017	1	a	This game is good for simulating human VS Dinosaur. The rampage mode allows you to be a dino and is fun. I highly reccomend the game
7019	1	a	Actually reason it lagged due to video settings my bad turn them down if you don't have a very good pc.
7021	1	a	This game's change soo much! Multiplayer with your friends is a blast. Killing the dinos is always soo satisfying!
7023	1	a	I have had so much fun with this game. I bought it as a joke to my friends and me to laugh off but its kinda hard when its acutally a good game :I  Its really entertaining, and seriously, where would you go if you wanted to shoot a dinosaur in the face with a shotgun while flying over it with your jetpack?!  Can only recommend this game.
7025	1	a	This game is so horrible, it's awesome. The perfect choice of game to get bevved up with your mates and just screw around playing a game together. I would suggest waiting for the game to go on sale before picking it up though (Which it does frequiently enough) It's harmless fun of eating your friends as a dino and they try to shoot you in the foot.
1133	0	a	it ran like crap in 2013, still runs like crap
7027	1	a	This game is really awsome and if you have friends to play with,it'll be even more awsome. I just wish this game was more popular.  Also,you can    Noscope a T Rex and kill him in one shot     11/9    Because only America puts months before days    -IGN
7029	1	a	The Sharknado of video games.
7031	1	a	Just buy it play for 1 hour and never touch it again. 'Still better than FNAF' 10/10 ~Everybody
1135	0	a	- create a public room - a friend join - start game - wait for the 1st wave to start - wave start attacking - shoot at dinosaurs - client crash (2/2)  E5, NVIDIA 1060 6G,  This issue needs fixing before I can re-try this title and write more of my experience. Currently not recommend.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  I wanted to give this game another try, so I launched it on another PC with different hardware specification. This time it worked. So the above issue is only about hardware compatibility. However, now I encountered another issue:  - create a solo survival mode room and start gameplay - fight and capture the side objective point - mount a battle vehicle and continue to fight - a Triceratops appear - drive the car toward the dino and hit it - car get tossed over  Found: the view angle auto-switch to 1st person. I'm still inside the car. whatever button I press, like 'w' to move forward, the game mysteriously paused. the only way to walk around is by pressing Space button. But once press other buttons again, the game will enter pause state again. A dead cycle. Have to reboot the client. So appart from the gameplay itself, I still can't recommend this title on current stage.
7033	1	a	10/10 I saved a dudes life by quickscoping a Pterodactyl. Then I turned around at lightening speed and quickscoped a baby Velociraptor 300 feet away. This game is awesome!
7035	1	a	play this game if you bored with survive from zombies
7037	1	a	It's a very enjoyable dinosaur survival game, but it does have microtransactions and that is not what i was expecting from a game 9/10
1141	0	a	Do not buy this game. I bought it when it was under a different name which was Orion Dino Beatdown that game was a buggy mess and so is Orion Dino Horde DO NOT be fooled by it's new name it is still the same piece of trash when it was first released. This game has a small community if you can call it that and the servers are dead the peak is about 60-80 players. The guns feel like cheap knock off BB guns and the AI is just bad then combine that with the dinosaurs getting stuck in objects such as buildings, rocks and mountains that sort of thing. This is by far one of the worst games I have had the horrible misfortune of playing sure the devs seem to be making a vague attempt to make it playable but with it's dead servers and bad gameplay with a dash of microtransactions make this game a slap in the face to the gaming community and hard working devs who produce top quality games.

1142	0	a	When you paid to get f2play game that feeling is priceless...
1143	0	a	To be fair, the games not too bad. But thats it, its average AT BEST. Sadly its not horridly broken which wouldve honestly made it more enjoyable as sometimes glichy randome events are fun but thats not the case. I only gave it a negative review becasue i spent like $0.40 on a 4 pack of codes, which are now completely worthless. Thanks Spiral Games.
1144	0	a	...
1145	0	a	Im kinda angry that this went Free, but Im also not surprised. It feels like baby's first gaming project and a lot of the stuff in it just feels absolutely atrocious.  Good for drunken nights of fun with friends but just a mess of a game, I cant reccommend it.
7039	1	a	I got this game for a dollar. Definetly worth it.
7041	1	a	i ate chilli last night so i can take a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that is better than this game 
7043	1	a	Great Game! So worth the one dollar. It does crash often though.
7045	1	a	Best piece of plagarised content you'll ever regret spending 50 cents on!
1147	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ tier game, how do you â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ up dinosaurs 0/10 would rather fist my own â™¥â™¥â™¥
1148	0	a	NO DAD I DONT WANT TO TAKE MY PANTS OFF
1149	0	a	I tried this game on a free week. It always attracted me because of the nice screenshots and the coop mode, but because of the previous failure from this developer, I always retained myself from purchasing it. I'm also an indie lover, and I can bear with bugs and underdevelopment if the game is actually good and fun, and this one looked like one such case from the conflicting comments of the players.  The reality is this game is not actually fun, but funny. I laughed so much when I played it, because if you can do anything wrong when making a game, you'll find it here. Even the graphics, that looked like the only thing that was made good, looks so weird because of the bad animations (or lack of in some case).  The gameplay is a lagfest, even with a low ping, and amazingly it also affects animations, that will lag aswell, making it look like an old cartoon, when animations were made with just 3 drawings repeated forever.  Nothing is fun here. The shooting, the driving, the walking around for miles to catch up with teammates, the lag, the animations, the gameplay.  Seriously, this game has potential, but looks like a v0.2 of an ongoing free project made by an amateur team. And, for now, even at 91% off for 0.99 euro is not worth the time spent purchasing, downloading, configuring and playing it.  Go buy a bundle with those money. The worst it could happen is you'll get five bad games instead of just one.
1150	0	a	This game is trash the controlls are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and the combat is teribad. Humans are favored in this game with more then one attack, unlike a dino. this is by far the worst dino game ever. Prepare to die and lose everytime if your a Dino.
7047	1	a	In other games do you run into people with vehicles and think 'man I wish that was a dinosaur' If so orion dino hoard is for you.' Do you think 'man if I could only hit a tyrannosaurus in the face with a laser sword yelling 'Boink' everytime you hit them? If so Orion Dino Hoard is for you. If you never want to know why in the heck dinosaurs friggin love power generators soo much, then Orion Dino Hoard is for you.  
7049	1	a	ORION: Prelude is a very great game for a very cheap price, simple as that.
7051	1	a	spent 99c to buy this game.    it goes free 1 month later, rip asian cheap life
7053	1	a	I regretted not buying this when it's on sale. Who wouldn't want to fight dinosaurs?
1152	0	a	I bought this games and its F2P now? Do i get a free in game bonus?
7055	1	a	Reasons to play! 1. Super fun  2. Completely free!  3. Supportive and open developer  4. Character progression and customization 5. Different classes for different play-styles and class roles 6. Dinosaurs (Duh!) 7. Jetpacks, mechs, helicopters, tanks, hovercraft, jeeps etc. 8. Lasers Swords and good sword play! 9. PvP and coop, and PVPVE too (players protect bases in teams and can sick dinosaurs on other teams) and gamemodes where you can be the dinos too 10. You can surf on the hood of your buddies jeep/hovercraft/tank/helicopter  Reasons to not play :[ 1. You hate fun?
1153	0	a	This is absolutely terrible, the PVP is awful the Horde mode is okay but the animations and sounds are beyond awful, But I guess thats what you can expect from an indie developer pfft.
1154	0	a	Literally the worst thing I've ever played.
1155	0	a	What can I say? This is it. This is the game we have been wating for. This game accomplishes so much and gives us gamers a truly next-gen experience. With all the content bundled in this game, for just a dollar you would be crazy to miss out on such a wonderful deal. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to playing.
7057	1	a	surprisingly good fun this game. if you have a bunch of friend to play with then you can have hours of fun with it. wouldnt recommend just for singleplayer
7059	1	a	I do recommend this (as many problems of the past have been fixed) to people who like survivalist style games like: Killing Floor Serious Sam  Its a fun game if you can get it $15 or less. The idea is certainly very solid. The only problem is, dont take the game too hardcore or serious, because there is NO balance whatsoever. Any big dino can one-shot your tank which you probably just spent an hour trying to afford.  Best way to enjoy: Get a group of friends, play Co-Op in the Survival style gamemodes, play casually for fun because there is fun to be had here.  Tips: *Land Vehicles suck, youre actually 10x more powerful on your feet.  *Do not play PvP game-modes, too many cheaters, too little done about it.  Graphics: 7/10 Some lighting issues but its acceptable. The weather adds real conditions to your situation. Cant help but feel like im playign Command and Conquer Renegade when im flying and looking at the bases. Sound: 4/10 Generic stuff really, music isnt all the good and the voice actors are your racist stereotypes. The sounds let down the game a little. Gameplay: 8/10 Lots of FUN to have, just dont take it too seriously aight? :) think non-competetively. Go shoot stuff!  Overall 6.5/10 - Great Potential, but its not quite there yet. Besides some polish, the game needs a greater feel of direction.
7061	1	a	orion: dino horde is like the steve urkle of steam games. 8/10
7063	1	a	This is a good game. Maybe even great. It sure isn't the best game in the world, but it's certainly worth playing.   I don't care about what this game was called before or any negatie reviews. I sure as hell don't care about Activision going after the other ORION game. This is not that game.  Picked this game up on a sale for 50 cents. Haven't tried the PvP modes, but right now I've sunk about 30 hours into the PvE wave mode. Sure the bots are absolutely terrible, the graphics aren't at Crytek levels, and it gets fairly repetitive, but I've enjoyed all 30 hours. The survival mode is fairly simple: defend a generator for three waves, move to capture an outpost somewhere on the map, repeat twice, then finish with a final tenth wave. The waves of small enemies, ground and airborne, are accompanied by a few very large, very strong dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurs and Stegosaurs. The game can be very challenging or very easy depending on the settings. A personal favorite of mine is to turn the dino health down and spawn rate up to dramatically increase the size of the wave.   Recomending a game is all about the value-proposition. Do you get a sufficient amount of enjoyment for what you pay? I payed 50 cents for currently 30 hours of game. That's a 60 hour per value ratio. 60 hours per dollar is equivalent to 3600 hours in your standard $60 AAA game. Very few people spend 360 hours on a game, much less 3600. I am completely satisfied with my purchase. Even if I don't play another hour of this game, the value of my 50 cents is apparent.
7065	1	a	Got given as a gift but would pay full price for game- really suprised me.
7067	1	a	Definetly a good co-op game for 99 cents
7069	1	a	This game is amazing. I LOVE it when my games have ps2 graphics yet still lag. The lasers the dinosaurs shoot out of their mouths is beautiful, and the texturing is so good it makes me want to vomit and cry in the bathtub for about 3 hours.   If you like being depressed, I highly reccommend this game.
7071	1	a	I really like this game...its retro and fun and i can play with or without friends...good game just to have a change of scenery
1156	0	a	this game was NOT a good game. even if you have a awesome graphic card it still lags. played it for an hour and I was done with it. i dont recomend this game please DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!
7073	1	a	Played one match, meh. good for a dollar I guess.
7075	1	a	Good game, couple of bugs, but you can get used to live along with it, great gameplay
7077	1	a	Great Game! So worth the one dollar. It does crash often though.
7079	1	a	The halo man fights dinosaurs in space, then uses dino-bones to buy upgrades and level up.  It's pretty much dark souls meets megaman.  Megaman and halo are the same person, right?   10/10  I mean, one is blue, the other is green, alter ego. I'm a cat and I know things.
7081	1	a	this game is like COD zombie but it is dinosaurs

7085	1	a	More fun than porridge. Also dinosaurs.
7087	1	a	Lax a little in the content area. But at $0.99 its worth every penny.
7089	1	a	I hit a pterodactyl with a stick and it died. 10/10
7091	1	a	This game is absolutely hilarious at times, yes it's buggy still, but playing it with friends makes it all good to be honest. Especially now that it's only 99 cents, get it, you won't regret it!  The in game sound pack is horrible though, vehicles sound really bad, and so do weapons. On the other hand, the lightning and weather looks amazing for a game like this. So Dev's fix your sound!  10/10 would cape again.
7093	1	a	The T-rexs throw rocks better than a MLB super star pitcher.
7095	1	a	it's like blood n bacon but with dinosaurs!
1162	0	a	WTF, THIS SUCKS, NOW IS F2P, WASTED. I QUIT THIS GAME CUZ IT'S â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ LAGGY. HAVE TO WAIT FOR WHOLE GAME TO SPAWN BACK. SUCK LIKE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
7097	1	a	This game is awesome and worth more then its price i recommend this game for evreyone who want an amazing cheap game. best 99 cents i ever spend, 10.5/10
7099	1	a	Played one match, meh. good for a dollar I guess.
7101	1	a	This game is brilliant! it's tons of fun! me and a few friends just got it for the hell of it to have a go and oh my god! it's one of the best games i've played it's addicting looks nice and funny as hell!  Trust me grab a few friends and try it out!  Don't let me play time say otherwise!
7103	1	a	Not even gonna bother reviewing it. 80 cents for this game is great. You got dinos and guns and pew pew pew and stuff. Just buy it.
7105	1	a	Nice game
7107	1	a	There are SPOOKY dinosaurs dont play!  10/10 WOULD â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ PANTS AGAIN!
7109	1	a	Imba gameplay and gFx  A must for all Jurrasic Park Lover's &lt;3  Unlimted fun !!!!!  Just go for it
7111	1	a	Bearing in mind the price of this game, it's pretty okay!!
7113	1	a	Why can't you hear a Pterodactyl going to the bathroom? Because the P is silent.. thank you this game sucks.
7115	1	a	Imba gameplay and gFx  A must for all Jurrasic Park Lover's &lt;3  Unlimted fun !!!!!  Just go for it
7117	1	a	Bearing in mind the price of this game, it's pretty okay!!
7119	1	a	This is the greatest game ever made.
7121	1	a	It's a good game .
7123	1	a	Lax a little in the content area. But at $0.99 its worth every penny.
7125	1	a	Everyone! You must get this game! This game is sooo good. They lowered it to .99 so that everyone could get it!
7127	1	a	Love this game &lt;3 i even thought it was awesome when it first was realesed
7129	1	a	Would vote for biggest improvent of a game I've seen.
1175	0	a	Traditional score - 4/10 Recommendation - Avoid. There are much better alternatives.  I found this to be intensely generic.   The gun physics are a joke, the weapons themselves are entirely too expensive for how much use they are, the enemies have intensely stupid AI, and the player skills are almost entirely useless.  The graphics are pretty, but the sounds and music are utterly forgettable, the level design is generic and repetitive, and the waypoints the game sets for you are way too far away. Especially given how the game allows you 60 seconds between waves (even if pterodactyls attack you continuously).  It quite possibly may get much better later, but you know so does Killing Floor, and it's fun from the get-go.  But hey, give it a try, you might love it. I have 2 free passes if this review didn't scare you off.
7131	1	a	Very addictive.
7133	1	a	Dinosaur halo for $1? Why the hell not. Fun game, still a little rough around the edges though.
1180	0	a	About as fun as masterbating with sand paper.
1181	0	a	Ill note good and bad things with + and - +i got it cheap +trading cards -stupid AI -bugged guns -bugged animations -laggy commands the list can go on overall DONT buy it
7135	1	a	Everyone! You must get this game! This game is sooo good. They lowered it to .99 so that everyone could get it!
7137	1	a	Killing Dinosaurs,in one moment scary and adrenaline rush. Great MP Worth Price 9.9/10
7139	1	a	I bought this game for two of my friends and I.  Now all three of us hate me.
7141	1	a	Rather than review the game, I'd like to point out a few things about it.  1. What's new and groundbreaking? Nothing. What's fun? Everything. What's a ripoff? MAYBE some of the aesthetic items from the in-game store, but they don't change the game at all.  2. Remember the days of Blockbuster? Pay five dollars and you can try a game for one week. If you don't like it, you're out five dollars and you have to give it back anyway. Well for 20% of that ($1) you can try this game, and believe me when I say it's worth trying. If you don't want to spend that dollar, just sell some of the trading cards you picked up from other games.  3. If you get only four hours of fun out of this game, it's a victory. That's $.25 per hour of fun. To get that same value from a AAA title you need to have 240 hours of fun. Be honest, did you play CoD: Ghosts for 240 hours and enjoy it the whole time?
7143	1	a	I do recommend this (as many problems of the past have been fixed) to people who like survivalist style games like: Killing Floor Serious Sam  Its a fun game if you can get it $15 or less.

7145	1	a	orion: dino horde is like the steve urkle of steam games. 8/10
7147	1	a	I was triggered by the unrelistic dinosaur physics simulations. But it does have jetpacks.  5/10 Heavily somewhat kindof recommended.
7149	1	a	Bought this game for about 50 cents, and although its a little glitchy its just a fantastic game. For the money, its definately worth it.
7151	1	a	(UPDATE) i cannot belive how much i downplayed this game. since they devs began to update this game it has become one of the most unique and fun fps games out there. THE METACRITIC SCORE IS A LIE. THAT WAS A REVIEW FOR DINO BEATDOWN WHICH WAS THE BIGGEST CLUSTER â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ STORM OF A GAME. BUT NOW IT HAS BEEN UPDATED AND REVAMPED AND YOUR MAKING A MISTAKE NOT TO PLAY IT.  This game is actually not that bad. the graphics are pretty decent and everything else is pretty good. too. the reason why metacridict is so low is because it is the review for dino beatdown, which is a game that was a sin towards humanity. but after all the patching and updating this game is pretty good. reminds me when i played turok on the n64......
7153	1	a	Good Game, you can play dinos or humen.
1190	0	a	Not only is the controller so horribly optimised that you can't use your controler in any menu, but the game literally crashes every 5-8 minutes... and I have a $2,200 PC.  .2/1 Morgan Freeman's :(
1191	0	a	This game is so freaking bad. I'd be hardpressed recommending this game for $1, don't be fooled by the interesting looking screen shots. This game is extremely 1 dimentional and quite unrewarding.
1192	0	a	Ill note good and bad things with + and - +i got it cheap +trading cards -stupid AI -bugged guns -bugged animations -laggy commands the list can go on overall DONT buy it
7155	1	a	You shoot dinosaurs.
1193	0	a	i played this when it was free, and basically it's alright, if it were 15 years ago. sadly, it's not, and this 'game' can't hold up to today's standards, not even to indie standards. what fun is coop if the ai ain't good, the guns ain't satisfying to use, and the game is repetitive all round?
7157	1	a	Muahaha.. its free to play this game now!!   i got this 2 months ago, then refunded it 'cos the game wasnt played nicely on my pc. Multiple crashes in the game, laggy in some parts.  Should just lower the price to .10 cents so those trading cards will still get drop.
7159	1	a	A game very hard, really worth it to try it. 10/10.
7161	1	a	the computer that i play on is not very good and the internet is worse so i had to turn down most of the settinng and even then the game lagged so its not ment for my computer but still for the price and the ammout of content its pretty goodd
1199	0	a	it sucks 
7163	1	a	With this new update i am shocked with what i am playing. doesnt even feel like dino horde, it feels like a brand new game and i fell in love with it all over again. i liked it b4 and now i like it even more. great game to play with friend :D
7165	1	a	This game is the best. GOTY 2014  In all honesty this game is fun. A good time killer fun with friends.
7167	1	a	A game very hard, really worth it to try it. 10/10.
7169	1	a	I gave a weird review, so now here is a more specific review on why you should buy this game. Now when I saw the game, I wasn't expecting a lot from it. That was because of the price. But I was truly wrong.  So first pro; Price. The game is very cheap. Next pro is the combat. You can fight (obviously, DUH) dinosaurs or players in the game with futuristic weapons, like various guns, melee weapons, turrets, and grenades. You can roll to avoid attacks. The combat is fast kind of like today's DOOM 4. Next pro is gonna be the shop. Get some credits and get spending on skins for your armor, weapons, swords (for their color or beam), and dinosaurs. Get new taunts and fancy capes, too. Now a cool feature that I like is the vehicles. You get a wide variety of vehicles from your standard car but with a machinegun, helicopters, tanks, even a robotic thing straight out of CoD AW. So that'll be it. Sad part is just the fact that there are still some annoying bugs since 2012, but I can ignore them. Normally THOSE bugs are, glitching inside big dinos, which is annoying.
7171	1	a	its a good classic
1206	0	a	A great concept with poor fit and finish, Dino Horde/Prelude has come a long way but has farther to go before securing a lasting place on my hard drive. Score 6.0
1207	0	a	This game is like the last guy to be killed by Kony before everyone stopped giving a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about him. Forgotten....
7173	1	a	Never Played a better game. I love it I wish that everyone could experience what i have experienced. The dinosaurs were photorealistic, but I guess you would expect that from a top quality studio like ummm... whoever makes this bloody game. 10/10 very good. btw i love the jurassic park movies if anyone has a spare copy of jurassic park 1 id be happy and id probably blow you. Lots of love Adolf Linkin.
1208	0	a	It says that I own this game so I am reviewing it. It is not a good game. I have not played the game, but I have read what people are saying about the game. They don't like it. Plus, how good can a game be if it was released for $15 but now is routinely sold for $1?  I also think that the developers may hate dinosaurs. Don't support saurian prejudice.
1209	0	a	I only have this game because I bought a four pack so I could taint my friends' libraries.
1210	0	a	i played this when it was free, and basically it's alright, if it were 15 years ago. sadly, it's not, and this 'game' can't hold up to today's standards, not even to indie standards. what fun is coop if the ai ain't good, the guns ain't satisfying to use, and the game is repetitive all round?

1211	0	a	OK, I did not mind the game, heck I am astonished by how it had improved since I last saw it when it was Orion Dino Horde *Watch that video by Total Biscuit by the way, I'm not being paid for it but he's just fantastic.* However it has problems which turned me away from it, or at least 2 problems.  Littlest one: The game is not very well optimized, I play this on a laptop but given I can run some high speed stuff with no problem, this is a problem....Though it is one that CAN be fixed so I will not hold it against the deveolopers.  However our biggest problem: The Community, sure the games can be fast but honestly, no one helps you either because the game doesn't do a good enough job of telling you 'Oh your teammate is down', and even if they did, there's a number that would let you die just out of SPITE, often killing any dinos you shot so that you would NOT get up.  Overall its an OK game but the community...just the community is all.
1212	0	a	Traditional score - 4/10 Recommendation - Avoid. There are much better alternatives.  I found this to be intensely generic.

1220	0	a	About as fun as masterbating with sand paper.
1221	0	a	Runs poorly for the size of the maps and the graphics.
1222	0	a	While the game might well be worth the dollar price it dropped down to, I cannot recommend the game simply because of the actions of the developer. The game was buggy, simplistic, and took a few tries to get to work, but was an amusing dino horde game. I'd be the first in line to recommend it for a few bucks.  However the name has been changed twice in an effort to throw off previous negative reviews, and I've heard numerous stories of saying the developer didn't propperly compesate his employees. If you don't care and just want a cheap dino horde game, this might be for you. Personaly I'll wait till the next one comes along.
7179	1	a	I got this game on sale for 50cents. Definitly not the best game ever, there are some issuses with it. But the game is fun easy to play and great for you and your friends. its cheap too. I boughtit for some of my friends.
1223	0	a	Not good, shady practices, but â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, it was only 49 cents!
7181	1	a	Its good.
7183	1	a	I liked the mechanics, the waves, the round stores and all that jazz that came along with this game. I'd have to say that it was worth a dollar. Although 'Guardians of Orion' has left a dark mark on my the developer's history. I still appreciate the small price and content of this game.
7185	1	a	The only game servers I can find are ones where I have a ping of 150+  Otherwise its a good game
7187	1	a	Dinosaur heads that run around, pirate dinosaurs, soldiers riding dinosaurs and idiots, your teammates who will better camp on a rock than revive you. 10/10 would die again.
7189	1	a	Good Game, you can play dinos or humen.
1229	0	a	This game is ok it has a few bugs and it is just dead its fun to play with friends but if you want to play online, theres just no point.   I woud rate it 5/10
1230	0	a	This game needs to make it's mind up weather it's a free 2 play, or a payed game.
7191	1	a	A great game . Very addictive . Would get chomped by TREX again 10/10
7193	1	a	One heck of a game if you start playing it ,hard to stop. Cuz so much fun ^^
7195	1	a	It's enjoyable, and better than most FPS I've seen on the PC. They allow a large amount of room when it comes to how you want to play and develop your character depending on the group you are with. Of course if you keep playing the same people you will eventually develop a routine and some amazing synergy with your fellow hunters.
1231	0	a	Basic wave survival and was not worth the money (even your spare change). Try it if you want to get some trading cards or to pad out your Steam library.
1232	0	a	This game is literally cancer, whatever you do... don't even consider buying it! It first wants you to pay for it, and then pay for in game currency, just after you bought the game. Worst... P2W... game... ever!  Edit: they changed the name... again!
1233	0	a	Awful game, waste of 99p

1241	0	a	Avoid this game. Broken beyond repair and it's just no fun this way. Had some hopes for this game as a fun survivor shooter, but broken mechanics, overwhelming amount of bugs make this game unplayable
7199	1	a	Wow. Just wow. before i was saying this game is bad because it was having a lot of bugs and glitches. Now with the new update its the best game EU and the cheapest game and awesome i really do recommend this game.  Gameplay 8/10 A.I 9/10 Graphics 7.5/10 Soundtrack 8/10 Multiplayer 5/10 (Because it does not show a lot of players and servers)
1243	0	a	Lol besides the fact that they changed the games name...Its a pretty bad game
1244	0	a	This game is garbage. The devs are shady scumbags that have changed the name of the game twice to dodge bad Metacritic reviews. Look up Orion: Dino Beatdown and Orion: Dinohorde. Those two games, and this one, are all the same. Their other game, Project Orion, was taken off steam because of a valid DMCA by Activision where these devs blatantly stole assets from Black Ops 3. And now they are trying to bleed more money out of gullible steam users by having an indiegogo campaign that was allegedly to let them fight Activision in court, but has now been changed to claim its to make up for damages Activision has caused them. Don't fall for their lies. This game is garbage. Project Orion, or whatever they decide to change its name to, is garbage. Don't give these people any money.
1245	0	a	What could have been an awesome game is ruined by bad performance and even worse FPS mechanics. It just isn't fun.  Verdict: PASS

1248	0	a	'we will not be pursuing legal action...'  ...because we would lose so fast our heads would spin.   â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ DEVs that steals assests, lies about it, gets caught lying, then gets all defensive and self righteous when the whole communbity turns his 'evidence' upside down on his â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ filled head.  for the record, those photos which 'prove' he didnt steal assests have been pretty much proven to be lies as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s of better non biased photos showing clear copying have surfaced.  for the record, I think Activision are a bunch of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s too, but at least they put the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on a nice silver platter for you to see before you eat it. and they don't rerelease the SAME game under different titles to try to cover up negative reviews...this is now the 3rd or 4th name change since 2012.  oh, the game you ask?  .... it sucks.   it has and pretty much always will regardless of all the stolen COD/starwars/other assets.   (keep in mind I paid 10 â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing dollars for this garbage back in EA) *(working on refund for Gaming's sake)* deleting it regardless to make my own point if it fails.  gonna go play a GOOD game, like ARK.
1249	0	a	Literally an atrocity.
1250	0	a	Orion: Dino Hoard is an extremely bad game. I also think it's pretty cheesy. It's just a wave defense game featuring dinosaurs with bad servers and a dead community.  Bad gameplay, bad online multiplayer, bad story (it's non-existent), bad production value, bad developers, bad time.  Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.  **Do not buy Orion: Dino Horde!!!!!**  And this ignoring the fiasco of how bad it was when it was Orion: Dino Beatdown and then having the developers change the name to get rid of the negative stigma (and reviews) surrounding the original game - this is a review of the current game on the market! It's terrible.  Don't take my word for it though:  Reviews:  Impulse Gamer - 4.5 / 10 - 'Dino Horde is not the improvement Dino Beatdown needed...it never feels like a finished product...this goes deeper than just a lack of polish...rudderless.'  NZ Gamer - 3.0 / 10 - 'Shoot in the back of the head and bury it. Awful. Dino Horde is easily one of the worst games I've ever played. Unplayable. Abomination. Broken.'  Gamespy - 1.5 / 5 - 'Jetpacks and dinosaurs in the same game? How could this possibly fail?...the same way as if Jurassic Park had used sockpuppets for the dinosaurs and someone had accidentally set fire to the final reel mid-way through the premiere.'  IGN - 2 / 10 - 'Painful. You probably deserve a beatdown if you waste your money on this disaster.'  I cannot recommend this game in any way, shape, or form - it's not even a worthwhile gag gift for a friend. Don't even buy it for your mortal enemies as the developers are shady. ORION Dino Horde is a stain on my Steam Library and if I could remove it I would. It is easily the worst game in recent memory that I've EVER played and I have no problem giving it an F

1252	0	a	Wish steam refunds existed when I paid 14.99$ for this pile of garbage. Might be worth it at 99 cents but not at what I paid. I'd say the only real selling point of this game is that it has dinosaurs.
1253	0	a	This is the worst game ever created all things considered. If a free Android game is bad, you don't really care because your expectations were so low to begin with. When a Dino game is this bad, it can be considered to be near the top of the list of worst games of all time. With the budget and the supposed good reviews this game received, David Prassel should be sued with a major class action lawsuit of everyone conned into buying this game. The graphics are terrible, the dinos were mindless, and the multiplayer is idiotic. There is no strategy, the maps are way too open and large for nerds to play. With the jetpacks your game becomes broken as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.  9.9/10 ~ IGN legit reviewer
1254	0	a	Just an awful, awful game. Even at the cost of a Euro the price is too steep.

1257	0	a	It's like Left 4 Dead but with slightly more advanced weapons and Dinosaurs. Oh and vehicles. Oh and there's no map that you progress through, in Orion it's more of just defending a generator (which for whatever reason these Dinosaurs have a vendetta against) and occasionally running away to capture some point that has no relevance to anything. You also get an in game currency for killing the dinosaurs which you spend on other weapons, which are quite expensive. There's a microtransaction shop as well in the game which is a huge turn off even if it is a very cheep game. Third person animations are ridiculously stiff. Also what's with this misleading 'Work together to survive the devastating Dinosaur horde in huge, endless environments.' on your store page? Is it huge or is it endless? It's neither. How can you legally just throw words like that around when it's completely untrue? 3/10, Dinosaur poop.

1272	0	a	This game has some very nice maps though some of the things are too spread out....very nice objectives....and some not too bad models for things. Even the controls are not too bad....  The problems though.....wow....alot of them...going to slowly go down the list here.  Like int he game 'Killing Floor' the enemies simply go in straight lines try to get to things....like for example if you are playing the protect the genrator....they will go to the generator...no matter what like a homiing missile....only good thing is that the developers ont his game improved the engine a little bit...so unlike killing floor the enemies dont ignore up down physics.  If a player gets in a certain radius of any dinosaur....they become the next magnet...all enemies ignor everything else and go after that one player. The only time they lose interest is when the player goes into fight for their life mode.  Weapons....i dont know...they seam sub par.....they do barely any damage.....i was one shot killing by using the standard melee attack and because the AI was so bad.....i just had to stand in one spot....let the line of enemies come at me while i punched them all....didnt take much skill.  Grenades seamed to not work much at all and the grenades and my own gun fire seamed to be able to destroy the generator more then it could the enemies....and when i say grenades didnt work much...out of 20 being thrown, only 3 seamed to detonate...kind of annoying.  Another issue aside from the magnet enemy AI and poor performance weapons...my character always seamed super fragile...and my powers seamed kind of pathetic....like the assualt guy gets a jet pack....which is sort of neat yet any form of fall and you take massive damage....in real life i can jump of a 1 story building no problem...in this game such an act gets me badly hurt....yes i am inthe future with advanced armor and unable to survive very well...the irony does not escape me. The recon character class gets a very short sub-par cloak field....as in everything sees through it.....but then with the way the game auto tracks to you well guess thats just how it is.  Now when you die...you do get a fight for your life....which made me laugh alot....because as soon as you get to that state the dinosaurs ignore you and run off....and weirdly enough your weapons start doing even less damage. I had to melee 3 times instead of 1 time to kill things....that actualy made me laugh on the bad mechanic.  The game mode i played had a genrator i had to defend ala like a tower defense....waves of enemies would hsow up to assault that generator from all over. Each wave made enemies stronger and also would introduce new enemies. Between each wave i was given 60 seconds to spend cash i had recieved for killing enemies.  Ok first off the generators are always far away from the resupply points...you take 20 seconds to get to the those points even while sprinting....bad machanic....they should have made it so you can buy what what you want then maybe activate the generator to start the next wave....but no...the made a stupid way of doing it....ala like killing floor.  now each wave shows how many dinosaurs you have left to kill....these are shown with markers over them.....unfortunately anothe rbug makes more enmies appear inthe game who will randomly appear right be hind you or somewhere else and attack you.....again a flash back of killing floor and its poor game system.  Those random not needed to be killed enemies will appear right behind you...no matter where you are...inthe air...on a cliff....back to a wall.....suddenly you are getting hit....you turn around and see a dinosaur is on top of you and the wall and attacking only you.  I dont like games where they suddenly appear like that....with no defense....doesnt make this exciting...just makes it stupid.  Purchase of weapons requires alot of cash to get them...you wont be able to buy the next pistol untillyou have killed 10 enemies....you cant even by a rifle until you kill 30 of them.  My total time playing was maybe 10 or 15 minutes....why so little time to pass judgement....my game library on steam and raptr, and xbox live, and u-store...and a plethora of places speaks for it self.  I am biased...becasues i have played really good games and played really aweful ones...and this one although its not the worst....its still bottom of the barrel....i am surprised the meta-critic score is not lower. Persoanly i would rate this a 10 or 9 out of 100.  In my opinion the develoeprs failed bad onthe AI and the spawn on top of players mechanic. They failed on the run to the store to buy new stuff in 60 seconds mechanic...and they failed onthe cloak mechanic whihc doesnt seam to work.  Multiplayer death match following these mechanics simply will make the matches un balanced and no point to play...as it will follow the system the winner will get cash to buy new slughtering devices to kill faster and better while a person who is unlucky and loses to much will be left far behind.  I dont recommend this game to anyone in its present state....the being on sale for a dollar....well not sure if its worth the trouble to get it.   Pictures onthe site do a great job of showing its art work...game play though is not getting shown at all...they show movies....but no real game play...and the reason is becasue its not too good at all,
1273	0	a	needs to be optimized for amd graphic cards
1274	0	a	Incredibly underdeveloped, Incredibly broken, Incredibly boring. Stay away from this.
1275	0	a	Beware this game is not for everyone.  I give it 6/10 and here's a few interesting things about it.  The game feels like a Halo 1 mod. The locations, the power armor, the weapons, most of it's design choices. You could pretend you where playing master chief and you'd feel somewhat at home.  There's a reason for this beyond the art style. It's because many of it's game resources where lifted or â€œstolenâ€ from Halo 1. I've played Halo 1 for 5 years give or take and I've really got to know the game, it's physics, it's weapons, maps, everything.   Playing Orion: Prelude I saw a warhog, then I saw the exact same animation when you get off the turret. Then I saw animations from using the melee button from guns. You also realize for a new game it sure looks like it came out in 2001 same as Halo 1.   I had no idea this game was a kickstarter, and it's a perfect example why I've never supported a kickstarter and probably never will. (including paid Early Access).   https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/orionprelude/orion-prelude/description   The number of things they say in the Kickstarter and it ends up just all being â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t. Even the in game shots look nothing like this game when you play it. Just watch the video and then compare it to screen shots and videos of the actual game. They promise things like a deep lore, etc. I'm sorry this is just a Horde mode game, and a easy one at that.  The game itself is lots of mindless fun, but so many other games do everything this one does better. There is no sense of challenge, you can easily go on a mountain and shoot all the dinosaurs out of range. You have many weapons and augmentations you can buy to make turn this game into Very easy mode even on medium settings. I can't say for the higher settings.  The game does lack polish. Things like getting stuck in graphics, warping dinosaurs, unpolished animations, etc. When I said it feels like it's a Halo 1 Mod, it sure does due to it's unfinished quality.   The creators are already on their sequel so I wouldn't expect this one to be polished, they probably learn that from EA games.   In itself the game can be lots of mindless fun, but don't expect anything amazing, just like a cheap mod, it's fun to try out, but rarely better then the original.  A few annoyances;  One thing I'd like to point out, you know how in Halo 1 the sniper rifle leaves a white trail, well in this all the bigger guns seem to, so after a while you only see cloud lines and not your target so well. Then you got rain on your screen, you know the dripping water, I was never a fan of this. And in this game it's constant. There are a number of things that make it harder to see your targets but it's mostly just annoying and pointless. Especially then it's raining on your screen in third person view.   I bought this game for 1$, I would be willing to pay up to 2$ but no more. If you want a good horde mode game I'd say Killing Floor tops this hands down.   This is the type of game you have fun messing around and shooting easy targets, but you'd probably never recommend it as anything worth wile. Not â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, but not great.  
1276	0	a	I used to play it with my bro but now the addded an update which for us ruined our fun i loved how you could be the dinosuar but now its not the same,thank you
1277	0	a	Incredibly underdeveloped, Incredibly broken, Incredibly boring. Stay away from this.
7207	1	a	I'm almost ashamed to say that this game is stupidly awesome. It's HALO crossed with Jurassic Park. Co-op play is really fun.  Dozens of weapons, ability upgrades, maps. Lots of game modes including PvE, PvP, PvPvE. You can even play as a dinosaur and eat your friends. Custom (Prehistoric) difficulty is where it's at. There are vehicles, explosions, jetpacks and much, much more.  The persistent leveling system unlocks permanent bonuses; if you ever get the itch to feel like a complete badass, this game is for you.  The best $1 you will ever spend. Just do it.
7209	1	a	The idea behind the game is awesome! The game itself ... not so much... Support the KickStarter they are bringing up i think on the 27th i have high hopes for this company and expect them to do well!   But this is what i think of Dino Horde  Buy while its onsale for 1$!! Not for 15$! Why?  The game is poorly optimized for one, the crosshairs on weapons are the same color as the winter enviroment so it's difficult to even aim at anything unless you are using something you can hip fire with the PvP is bad because any sort of lag just is killer lag is handeled very poorly. The 'Open' World map they released theres no sense of freedom in it all it is, is a bigger survival map with nothing to do between points i did run in to a t-rex once out side of a point that was fun but out of every other time i played i never once ran in to any real engaging fights.
1289	0	a	I might change my opinion, but for now, my review is short and to the point - like my play expirence. It SEEMS like a really good game, and soloing with bots it feels like it would be fun with a group, but joining a server is impossible because of the numberous issues that come up.  Yes, yes - I know the forums list solutions, but there are a zillion to try and they are insanely involved - more so than one should expect to go through for any 'finished' game. This feels like a buggy alpha, not a full release.
1290	0	a	Did not like it, felt horrible and bulky to play, UI is horrible, idk how there are so many good reviews?! Lack of server hosting, customisations is minute to nothing, would not play again, did not enjoy  3/10
1291	0	a	The game has horrible optimization and it crashes all the time.
1292	0	a	What do you get when you release a buggy game, with stolen art assets that are slightly modified, glitched sound files, and gameplay that randomly restarts? Orion: Dinobeatdown.   What do you do when the community rages at you for it, do you:  A: Create new art assets completely from scratch. B: Smash the bugs as quickly as possible. C: All of the above or D: Rename it something else, add another game mode, and don't do anything else?  Well, these folks went with choice D.  D, For Don't Buy. Not Dinosaur.
1293	0	a	This is a Terrible UT mod. Ideas stolen from other good game out there. Changed, and made bad. Really awful animations and poor game play with extensive maps that are really boring to get around.   It sounds cool by premise, but honestly, this game sucks hard. Avoid it!
1294	0	a	Don't buy it. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on almost every level, and no where to be worth $8.99.  Bggest issues are sound cutting out, constant crashing, horrible and ugly UI, dumb AI, god awful animations for everything.. etc. Another reason not to buy is because the guy who created it is a crook.  That is all I have to say.
1295	0	a	MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS ARE A JOKE  I am at least double the requirements of this game and cannot play at anything but 1fps on the lowest settings!! Fix this game and I will change my review 
7211	1	a	Very interesting 1 euro game. The game is nice but the achievements are boring... too booring.
1296	0	a	Awful textures from 1998, hideous color schemes, poor draw distance, ugly menus, the worst sound design and weakest musical score you will ever hear in a game. Ever. This game is bad and a major waste of your money.
1297	0	a	  Cool game but i dont play it very often.
1298	0	a	Even at a dollar this 'game' isn't worth it. Developers are shady, gameplay is ancient. Level design is a joke. Nothing is intuitive. This company deserves no support what so ever. They even turned off comments on their facebook. i want a refund.
7213	1	a	Honestly the best 50 cent game I think exists. Literally paid for itself from all the laughter and fun between my friends and I.   9/10, worth it.
7215	1	a	Im not a graphics guy so I dont care but, the graphics were meh.  But besides it being rushed, and not really telling you what to do, its a fun game!
1299	0	a	this game is absolutely terrible. i bought a 4 pack when it first came out. (at full price) they its had its name changed twice since then. terrible terrible game. dont believe my hours played either. the game didnt close and kept running in the background. save youself some money and shoot yourself in the leg for the same experience.
1300	0	a	waste of time and money.
1301	0	a	its badly designed,not very good looking, not very fun and not even worth 99 cent, and the metacritic score is misleading it should be under 20 percent 1.5/10
7217	1	a	  Worth a dolla if u like killing hundreds of dinos + want trading cards and achievements! Fun to play with ur buddies
7219	1	a	This game... if it can even be called that... is   clearly   the most awe-inspiring and story driven interactive experience to date. This trumps almost every form of entertainment I have ever experienced. It outright blows other games, and even movie and television mediums, out of the water with its sheer impressiveness.   Truly a masterpiece  . It is outrageous to think that one could recieve the right impression of ORION: Prelude just through words upon a screen, or any other known method. Nothing can capture it's raw beauty and power, which still keeps me awake at night wondering what all the other asshat game developers are doing so very wrong. This experience can only be compared to the wonder of birth itself. ORION: Prelude has given me new eyes with which to see the vast, empty existence we call life. It has allowed me to percieve more than you or I could ever imagine.   I have now seen the face of god,   and he wept at the absolute majesty of what can really only be the end and beginning of a new age. He has rightfully submitted himself, as this creation of mortal men has towered above everything God himself has done. ORION: Prelude has begun humanity upon a path to beautiful absolution. I can not rest. Not until every soul of this wretched sepulcher we call Earth has been awoken by ORION: Prelude. It is impossible to tell where its gentle hand will lead us, but I am certain it will not be astray. I place my faith in thee, ORION: Prelude, as I know you will show me the release that mankind has been missing since its very roots.   May ORION rule forever more.

1315	0	a	This is a very clumsy and bad game. Fuzzy controls, horrible game play and sub-par graphics. Seriously overpriced even at .99 cents. Download the free weekend version for giggles and mourn the disc space and band width wasted. The metacritic score is not a lie. Couldn't stand more than five minutes of this stuff. The dinos do look rather nice even though they move like sorry stop motion animation puppets. Maybe the devs should reprogram this game as a screen saver?
1316	0	a	Concept is great, but all I got while playing it was a game designed for human characters, with poor handling on the dinosaurs and other reptiles. Difficult to navigate and figure out how to play in the first place.
7223	1	a	Spent $1 and a few minutes convincing 2 people to also spend $1. Got the three of us in a hummer and drove it into a Stegosaurus.  We exploded and died.  10/10

7227	1	a	Cool
1321	0	a	Honestly...this is my opinion, and mine alone...but this game isn't as fun as I was led to believe it was. Granted, my frame rate issues didn't help much at all...but either way, my interest in the game quickly faded after about...maybe half an hour into my first match. Sure, I love the fact that it's basically a zombie horde game but with dinosaurs, but...it was just far too repetitive to keep my interest for long. The dinosaurs were...in all honesty, they don't have great AI. Sure, they're good at surrounding you and tearing you to pieces; sure, they're good at charging you and running you through; sure, they're good at taking you out before you have time to react...but their attacks were far too predicatable and you could easily skirt them without receiveing any damage. The weapons were a bit...iffy, in my opinion. The pistols just sound like the automatic rifles, just in single bursts. Oh, and don't get me started on the fact that some of the sound effects for two or three particular weapons are taken straight out of Command and Conquer: Red Alert 2. I'll likely go on a tangent about that. But the rifles just felt...unbalanced to me. It was far too easy to get kills with them since they have next to no recoil from what I was able to see through my low frames. And the accuracy wasn't all that great, IMO. The last thing that really irked me was the fact that objectives were so damn far away from the bases. I mean, 500 meters is fine and dandy, but 1000 meters away from the main base? And you have to get there before dino's overrun the objective. What annoyed me was that you find out about the objective right at the start of a wave, so you have about 3-4 minutes of running to do in order to get to the objective while dino's are spawning already halfway to the objective and overruning it. You have no time to get to the objective before the raptors and ptera's are all over it. Granted, my frame rate issues were a large factor in me not enjoying my time playing the game. But I couldn't fix it for the life of me. But regardless, it was about fun for the first five minutes while I was fighting off raptors and compy's on my first wave. I mean, let's face it, anything with dinosaurs in it is going to be fun. I can overlook most of what I stated above simply because I can understand just how this game might be entertaining for the majority of players. But for me...there's no fun in repetition. For meticulous players like myself, I would not recommend this game However, if you're one to not be bothered by what I stated above, then this is a $0.99 game worth getting if you're simply looking for a fun time blowing the heads off of raptors. In that case, I would recommend this game to those players.
7229	1	a	Best played in Co-op...
1324	0	a	A â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ poor game with laughably bad mechanics, a lot of bugs, guns that feel like a weak ejaculation and ugly looking graphics. Not even worth it if it were free.

1329	0	a	Dont understand why people are saying metacritic is wrong? The game is beyond broken, probably one of the worst games ive played. Rampage is the only game mode worth playing and thats just a flipping mess. The whole game is a mess, its in a sorry state and no update can fix this.  Its like the developers released a half â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ alpha and said it was the finished product.
7233	1	a	These are the type of developers I support. They admited their mistakes, they started working on it and updated it for 3 years. They deliverd a stable game--for only 1 euro. This is Worth A Buy, even when you're not into this type of game, I advise you to buy it. We needs these type of developers on Steam or we will pay the price eventually.  
1331	0	a	bad copy of csgo and borderlands 2
1332	0	a	They changed the name of this game several times. The name changing is so out of hand that the review on the game's page is from the wrong game. It's constantly being discounted to 99 cents for a reason. Not very fun, and multiplayer is a real challenge to get working. Plus no one plays it. Still doesnt feel like a polished game for some reason.
1333	0	a	Played for 30 minutes and failed to find a reason to ever do it again. This could in theory be a really good game I imagine, it just doesn't quite work for a number of reasons. I didn't get any good explanation as to how anything works. The weapons and upgrades system is fairly basic and a little overwhelming at the same time for a newcomer, all the guns look and feel the same. The gfx/sfx are oddly bad in some places while decent in other places. Enemy models will often chaotically twitch for a moment, making it hard to aim where you want to, not to mention I saw every single raptor who got close to me from the inside because the camera was inside the model, something that shouldn't really happen.  Overall the game feels horribly unpolished and lacking any real substance. Then again it's dirt cheap and not downright terrible so I imagine it can offer some fun for good money if you find it more entertaining than I did.  P.S.: V as the default melee key and a second wind game mechanic that allows you to avoid death by getting a kill quickly enough... why does this feel familiar?
7235	1	a	Really fun game
1335	0	a	Wow they made the game worse. Gimme back my dollar!
7237	1	a	IT GOOOD GAME PLS BUY DO IT 200$ PLS OR I KILL YOU MY TIGGA
1337	0	a	This is so bad, not even worth 49 cents.
1338	0	a	I paid for this game and now it is free to play !! WTF ?   Game is not that bad btw...
1339	0	a	Do not buy this piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
1340	0	a	this game is stupid
7239	1	a	  Got 5 hours out of a $0.49 gift. Worth.  Actually pretty fun with friends, not sure about this whole copyright issue though.
7241	1	a	Did you love Turok on the N64? Did you love Halo when it was cool?  If not, still doesn't matter because this game is pure fun.  This game brought back sweet memories when I used to play Turok 2 on the N64 and then when I played Halo CE for the first time on PC.  You haven't lived if you haven't punched a T-Rex till death with your bare hands.  1$ and tons of fun!
1346	0	a	LITERALLY the worst game I've EVER played.
7243	1	a	It's like Halo with dinosaurs.
1357	0	a	I just got this game. I don't know wtf is going on but I can't connect to any servers. It either takes me back to the main menu or doesn't do anything at all. It won't even let me play solo mode. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game.
1358	0	a	it wuz gud during da free weakend wen da jitpaks wrkd, butt gayral studios did sumthin to maek da gaem soopr s h i t bitwween then n now!  5/10 cuz da gaem cuntanes dinosaurs
1359	0	a	I don't know how this game is on steam. Constant crashing, disconnecting, bugs, etc. This isn't a finished product, not even close. Sound design is pretty bad, animations are mediocre, player and weapon models are kinda bad too. Dinosaurs are alright, but the environment is actually shockingly beautiful.  A bundle of bad/boring/broken mechanics, a generic grind game style, and no real reason to be grinding have this game coming in substantially worse than almost any other multiplayer free-to-play game, making it a bad purchase. Only played for about an hour, but most laughter and enjoyment came from just how absurdly bad some aspects of the game were.
1360	0	a	Hilariously bad coding, icons quite possibly stolen from Apple's iOS, and unintentional surrealism (read: bizarre ragdolling) combine to produce a quite mediocre dino-killer surprisingly reminiscent of Halo (with dinosaurs), but nowhere near as good.
1361	0	a	This game is a peice of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. It was gifted to me..so thank you for the gift...but my god....no...nononononononononono
1362	0	a	all comments in trailer are lies. this game is not worth to 1 dollar... lets just end it there...
7245	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ matchmaking, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ programming, could have been great
1364	0	a	Do not buy this game. No matter the discount, it is not worth the price. There's too much to go into, and I really don't care much. Just noticed that for some reason I had a positive review on here, and since it's on sale wanted to update the review to reflect the current game.
7247	1	a	I paid Â£0.79, to ram a Triceratops with a car, he flung me across the map and i landed on about 5 velociraptors. 10/10
1368	0	a	Meh, it's incomplete, glitchy, ugly, and repetitive- but it can be fun for a couple hours, i think it'd be worth a dollar if you have friends willing to play it with you- but otherwise , it'll be just another game to become untouched in your library after the first couple plays or so
1369	0	a	Prelude to what? Oh god, what am I playing?!
1370	0	a	Orion: Prelude (previously known as 'Orion: Dino Horde' and before that 'Orion: Dino Beatdown') exemplifies poor design with just about every detail, from the graphics to the gameplay. Visual effects (Motion blur, lens flares, water droplets) are overused to an extreme, actually making it very difficult to see what you're doing in some cases. It's as if the developers saw an effect they liked and put it in because it looked kind of cool, without any thought to how it meshed with the rest of the experience. This pattern holds true for the rest of the game: features are either half-baked (class system is totally useless) or just poorly done (sound design and animations are just awful).  Perhaps the only thing worse than this game is its the community: they really put the 'cult' into 'cult classic'. Look at any review online and the comments section will be littered with comments ranging from claims that 'the game is much better now and deserves a re-review' to outright accusing the reviewer of slandering the developers. It holds a 'mostly positive' ranking on steam simply because fans bombard the review board with meaningless positive recommendations (probably so they can appear in one of the games trailers).  The idea had potential, but there really isn't anything redeeming about what Trek Industries made with it. The only selling point is that it's so cheap, but I'd actually recommend not buying the game just on the principle of not supporting such a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ product.
1371	0	a	I never asked for a 90's shooter.
7249	1	a	.
7251	1	a	Bad game. Don't play. Play Halo instead.
7253	1	a	Orion (insert subtitle here) is a super low budget crappy looking Halo ripoff that pits Master Chief look-a-likes against wave after wave of brainless angry dinosaurs that want to bite him to death.  Its not creative, deep, or original. It is a crude and simple game. And it is fun enough to be a guilty pleasure. The enjoyment doesn't last for long however, since Origin gets impossibly difficult a few waves in. For $1, you get what you pay for.  Its the ultra low quality attention to details that amuse me the most. I like how when most of the guns are fired, the recoil animation is the model's hands sliding up and down their forearms. Or how one of the character poses for holding the pistol is the same as holding a rifle.
7255	1	a	I never enjoy buying games. But I got pressured into buying this because of my friends. I was thinking 'It'll probably be a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game but it's just a doller.' But holy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ was I wrong. This game has a major lack of fun when it's singleplayer but the fun is all in co-op. 10/10 dank meme m8.
7257	1	a	Finally, a christian game developer that knows dinosaurs lived alongside humans.
7259	1	a	This game is has a few rough edges, but it's really fun.   If you enjoy Killing Floor, Sanctum or Team Fortress 2 in Mann Up mode you should give ORION:Prelude a try. It's like playing Sanctum with bots instead of a maze, but on the island from Ark and with special abilities and hats.   I suppose every game has hats now, but still.  Give the zombies a break and mow down dinosaurs for a change.
1379	0	a	Huge rip off. I paid about 80 cents for the second time this was released (this is now it's third release and it's free 2 play now). Wish I could get those 80 cents back.
1380	0	a	Became free to play because it was not even worth 1 cent
1381	0	a	This game is a piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. dont waste a dollar on this thing. This game is so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that i almost choked to death on my own â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing hand
7261	1	a	So bad its good. Pretty much just a crappy halo but with dinos as ur enemy would say u should play it with group of friends or else it may not be as humerous it just a silly game u can mess around in with friends, ull have more time laughing than actually bothering about wats going on
7263	1	a	Good, but a bit hard.
1383	0	a	i honestly don't have a clue what is going on
7265	1	a	A glitchy buggy mess of game with broken ai and Laggy hitboxes. They were smart to make their tagline 'It's only 99 cents!' And to their credit... It is only 99 cents.
7267	1	a	Had this game for a while now,  10/10 would always recommend
7269	1	a	ORION: Dino Horde is a great game that i got for only Â£0.99!!!! i was amazed at how good it was as i had never heard of it before, it has a great singleplayer and multiplayer experience and the graphics are phenominal!!! 100% must buy!!!!
1391	0	a	I purchased this when it was still called 'Orion: Dino Beatdown'. It looked very promising. It turned out to be the worst game I had intended to buy.   If any difference came in 'Prelude' then it should be celebrated because changing literally anything about Beatdown is a positive.
1392	0	a	Orion : Prelude is a step back from Orion Dino Horde. More lag, crappy gameplay made for controllers and a ingame cash shop ...... blargh!
1393	0	a	If you like broken games that uses about 100% of your GPU and still looks like crap then this is the game   for you.   It's like Goat Simulator, only that this game is unintentionally bad.
1394	0	a	Even when it's fun, it isn't.
1395	0	a	No one plays it, the physics are uncontrollable and it's laggy, other than that good game. 3/10
1396	0	a	paid 99 cent... then it was free :(
7271	1	a	For $.99, you can kill dinosaurs with 4 friends or play PvP with 9 friends! Best decision in years!
7273	1	a	Games can't fail, only developers can. This game is by far the greatest bang per buck value. It plays a lot like Unreal Tournament 2004, combined with a bit of HALO all mixed in with dinosaurs.  Grab a couple of friends and go nuts in this game. You'll have a blast and I don't think you could spend that little bit of cash anyway better. This developer should get way more praise, they are like the indie CDProjectRed.
1399	0	a	Not worth even 99 cents !!!  Don't buy IT !!!   Too booring!!!
1400	0	a	Characters run like they have sticks up their asses. Had no animation when firing weapons. No clue why dinosaurs are attacking energy generators. And I'm told this game has been greatly improved from what it originally was? Do yourself a favor and play something else.
1401	0	a	ThatÂ´s the first game I bought in the new steam interface....couldnÂ´t be sorrier. How come 73% of more than 10,000 user could possible recommend this crap!? One visit at metacr... site and all I see are terrible reviews by the critics and a very low metascore, but I had already bought it.  Difficult to play, need to put all video quality on low and still bugging. On other computer with more power the game was a little better but the gameplay is not ok, too messy and confused. 
1402	0	a	Even when it's fun, it isn't.
1403	0	a	No one plays it, the physics are uncontrollable and it's laggy, other than that good game. 3/10
1404	0	a	its nice but the controls are very crazy wierd and the attacks of the dinos are not very well made when u attack it feels as if ur not even doing any damage to the enemy humans players can win easily needs moore very crucial updates will change review if changes are made correctly.
1405	0	a	Steam says I own this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥... I DON'T
1406	0	a	It's just plain bad.,,, Don't buy it, not worth the 40 cents.
1407	0	a	6 minutes well wasted.
7275	1	a	It's like playing Left 4 Dead but with dinosaurs that are also mentally challenged. Also you're mentally challenged. And the big dinosaurs are especially mentally challenged and op 8.75623/5 stars
7277	1	a	Great and Cheap for $1
7279	1	a	STRONGLY, VERY STRONGLY RECOMMENDED!!! 10/10  The game has been updated to make it like 100 times better now.  My goodness, this game has evolved to something unbelievably good. I played it for a couple of hours three months back when I purchased the game. I didn't like it then. I uninstalled it and thought I would never play it again. Back then, the whole world looked blurred and murky. It deserved the $1.00 that it costs. But today, the evolution of this game is unbelievable. It is so so so beautiful. The gameplay is good. I just kept running randomly in my first game to appreciate the scenaries. Plus there is Steam Workshop supporty, I mean you really get a lot for the $1.00 you pay. My appeal to those that have not played this game in the past couple of months - visit the game once... you won't believe you had such a beautiful game lying in your library (probably hidden by now).  STRONGLY, VERY STRONGLY RECOMMENDED!!! 10/10
7281	1	a	ORION: Prelude (formerly ORION: Dino Beatdown and more recently ORION: Dino Horde) is easily one of the most underrated games of the last 5 years. It's been torn apart constantly and consistently by the gaming press and given a right beatdown of its own. Since its release in May 2012 I've put a solid 100 hours into the games and I can say with great confidence that it deserves much more credit than it is given. Spiral Game Studios has come a long way with this title and ORION: Prelude is a fresh, fun, and exciting gaming experience.  If you've ever played Left 4 Dead, Killing Floor, Gears of War Horde Mode, or Halo's Firefight you know what to expect from ORION: Prelude. It's a co-operative FPS where up to 5 players work together to defend or capture objectives by fighting off wave after wave of dinosaurs. To vanquish said dinos there are three classes to choose from at the start of each match; Assault, Support, and Recon. Assault sports a jetpack, Recon a cloaking device, and Support a healing gun. Each kill earns a player cash depending on the damage they contribute which can be spent on upgrades between waves. Those upgrades range from bigger guns and bigger knives to Augmentations like a double jump or stronger melee attacks. There's enough to choose from that you'll be mixing and matching with the different classes to create unique builds each match. This really helps the game stay fresh.  On top of the class customization there are plenty of different modes available to chose from including a VS mode called 'Duel' which is akin to elimination style modes in other games. There's Survival, King of the Hill, Free for All and many others including a mode where you are able to play as the dinosaurs themselves VS other human controlled characters. Controlling the dinosaurs is a bit difficult at first as they are large and stiff feeling, but after a round or two you'll be crushing human face like a true prehistoric behemoth and laughing the whole time.  When it was first released in May of 2012 as ORION: Dino Beatdown it was, admittedly, a mess. The word 'glitchy' comes to mind with a hard lean towards broken and many of the game modes mentioned above weren't available. It was playable, but dinosaurs didn't behave intelligently. They would clip through the stage and animate like caffeine loaded squirrels with rigor mortis, guns wouldn't make noise and would even sometimes disappear altogether. Not to mention the announcer getting stuck repeating lines such as 'threat eliminated!' and 'threat down!' over and over until the match ended. But, for what ORION: Dino Beatdown was at its core, a co-operative horde-mode FPS with dinosaurs, it was amazingly fun.  Yes the game had its moments, to put it lightly, but it wasn't so bad that it deserved the media meltdown that ensued after its release. Spiral was quick to respond to community feedback and within a few short weeks issued a number of patches that corrected graphical errors, class balance issues, optimization problems, all the while preparing large and free content packs that were released the following months. Eventually the game was re-branded and soft re-released twice to what it is known as today: ORION: Prelude.  If you were to compare the two games side by side it would be like night and day. Should Spiral have released Dino Beatdown as it was? No, probably not. But I'm glad they did. After playing the game day in and day out over the past few years my friends and I all realized that playing it together was the most fun we'd had since Super Smash Bros. Melee on our old GameCube. Time and time again we found ourselves laughing to tears and getting chomped. Much like Melee, L4D and Street Fighter did before it; ORION: Prelude has earned itself a spot on the shelf as one of our go-to party games for years to come.
7283	1	a	This game has had some improvements, ignore metacritics, its being constantly updated. The only problem I have is micro transactions. 8/10
7285	1	a	Ran over a herd of velociraptors. 12/10
1408	0	a	Should've purchased goat simulator.
7287	1	a	This is the most underrated game on steam.
1409	0	a	this game sucks its sooooooo laggy they did not make this better than the last one it  suuucks
1410	0	a	Dont waste your money on this game its really slow for average computers as well as a bad game keep looking for a better dinosaur shooter like primal hunter!
1411	0	a	Sucks. You get what you pay for.
1412	0	a	Won't even start up. Tried to restart steam, computer, and reinstalling the game itself but nothing works. I just get the loading wheel then it just says it crashed :/  Honestly I was looking forward to this game but now, I can't even play it! Quite dissatisfactory.
7289	1	a	Steam Free-2-Play â€˜ORION: Dino Hordeâ€™ event / 75% off sale
7291	1	a	Worst FPS i have ever played! But cuz i love huge cluster â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s that dont make sense i give this game 10/10 Bad game! But good game..........Im bored..........seriously im bored............
7293	1	a	wtf is this game? It`s so funny, that i slapped my mother so hart in the face, that she started laughing too.  10/10 would slap my mother again for this game!
7295	1	a	its a nice game, but before you ask no i wouldent pay the 15 bucks for this game but 99 cents yeah its fun.
7297	1	a	best 1 euro spent of my life
7299	1	a	Game of the year
1423	0	a	REALLY I WAITED 3 MONTHS FOR IT TO GO ON SALE  FOR A 4 PACK then i bought it for $2.99 NOW ITS FREE AND I DONT GET â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ TO SHOW FOR IT AT LEAST GIVE ME A COOL WEAPON THAT UNIQUE OR EVEN A CUSTOM SKIN  HOW ABOUT A REFUND? oh no steam will not cover that you played to long other than that game is fun just gets to boring tedious and repetitive  but if u love 2 grind play this   EDIT 1: i bought this game Feb 22, 2014  and i still got 2 copies left which i can trade but since the game is free  WHAT IS EVEN THE POINT
1424	0	a	The only good thing about this game is driving your teammates off a cliff.
7301	1	a	This game taught me about the diversity of cultures that our small little corner of our universe has to offer.  10/10
7303	1	a	Get It While Its Free 
1429	0	a	its not even like they genuinly tried, its just such a lazy game.
1430	0	a	This is one of those awkwardly medicore games. Even their options menu is clunky (with typos). With resolutions that are a bit off (especially if you show windowed). Hell, you can't even turn off things like head bob, so even your human bobs his head like he has a two foot neck (great for headaches). The combat has the awkward down with the dinos twitching around as they run half sideways as their attack.   Funny enough it even has a store to buy 'Spiral Coins' from, which is impressive for a non-F2P game. Though they seem to be putting a lot of updates in, so they probably are working for it.  I picked up a 4 pack on sale, just because even a bad game can be amusing on co-op. So I really wanted to like it, but it looks like I'll just keep those for gag gifts.
1431	0	a	I decided to play solo, and I've been killed by a raptor who was at least 5m away from me. Then I decided to run a little test on their AI = basically walking heat-seeking missiles with claws. -10/10 would not play again
1432	0	a	Terrible... Just terrible. The least they could do is make the in-game purchases menu look a bit better right?
1433	0	a	I paid 16 cents and I feel like I payed too much
1434	0	a	Screaming 'Team mate down!' is more fun than actually playing this game. It's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in short. Dino chasing you? â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing cloak. Bam. You're invincible. There's nothing fun about it. The slow motion is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and the dino ai is atrocious. I'm glad I only installed this for free week. There's also some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing 'spooky christmas' map or some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. There's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing ghosts and robo reindeers with lasers. Only buy it if you won't miss a dollar and have friends that have a sense of humour. Like no â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing joke it's hilarious how bad this game is.
7305	1	a	Basically dino D-Day but in the future, and with more tanks. Gameplay is janky and hard to follow, and the majority of the weapons make no sense to use, even for fun. But it's good fun, again don't pay retail for it
7307	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Game.. never before i played such a broken and poorly devloped Game, stay away from it.. only Revelations 2012 is probably worser then this,yeah i know hard to believe, but thrust me lol
1444	0	a	This game would be amazing if I could actually start it up. All my friends love the game, they bought it for me... I can't even â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing play it. Fix your game please. I did everything this is the 5th hour I've tried to get this thing working. Please fix it. Steam support doesnt help me at all, someone please help me.
7309	1	a	Ohnestly You Realy want me to buy this im a evil AI i already have it!
1447	0	a	meh. It's ok
1448	0	a	If you're buying this game recently, don't it doesnt work.
7311	1	a	An absolutely awesome game to play with friends whether it's a co-op survival against a horde of dinosaurs or a deathmatch between players. Although this game has quite afew bugs and things that they should improve on, I would definitely recommend this game to a friend!
1451	0	a	The game is okay. The developers are not.
7313	1	a	This game has improved a lot since it first came out. It is a very fun game now, especially when you play with friends. A fun game+giant boss dinos that tower above you = Recommend.
1453	0	a	I bought this game for a doller. I was suprised that not only did i get a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game but that I was not able to refund it!
1454	0	a	graphics and gameplay sucks
7315	1	a	I don't care what people say, this game is worth at least $15 but I payed .99c for it. I killed a Triceratops and a Stegasaurus with an op tank but was run down by a massive Spinysaurus. Get it, play it with friends and enjoy it. 10/10 It's Halo with dinosaurs.
7317	1	a	I remember when it was dino: beatdown and it was 15 dollars... So â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
7319	1	a	Perfect
7321	1	a	What is there left to say. I payed less than 1â‚¬ for this and it delivered such. Nothing to regret.
7323	1	a	that game iss very fun
7325	1	a	Good game!! worth Money!! (1$)
7327	1	a	You can go Chuck Norrirs on a T-rex from inside a combat walker a.k.a. mech. How awesome is that?
1462	0	a	WHAT THE FLYING FADOODILY â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥KKKKKKKK. THIS GAME SUCKS DIRTY BUTT HOLE. EVERYTIME I TURN AROUND THE DINOSAURS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ME IN THE DAMN â™¥â™¥â™¥. ITS A â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ STORY BORING AND â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ X2.â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ THIS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ASS â™¥â™¥â™¥ DAMN â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. THE GUNS ARE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ AND MADE IN AFRICA BY CHINESE MEXICAN ON CRACK WHILE GETTING â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ WITH A FROZEN BANANA. BYE
7329	1	a	I think this is a fun small game. Sure theres not much to do but its still can be fun.
7331	1	a	Got in a jeep and was eaten by T-rex. 11/10
1471	0	a	Where the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ do I begin? I have a machine capable of running this game on 60 FPS but it's so terribly optimized that it lags atrociously. I don't understand how this game could possibly have such high reviews. Even with such a low price on it, I still feel until it's optimized better I just can't suggest this game to anyone.
7333	1	a	As a man of simple tastes, this game strikes my interests at heart. I like shooting and blowing things up, and I also have a tender love for dinosaurs. When I saw this game, a game where these two interests collide, I bought it. I have not regretted it one bit. Although the game doesn't have the amazing technical aspects of other shooters, it still retains the fundamental goal of the game; make dinosaurs playable and shootable. That's all I need.
7335	1	a	You get to be a dino which is f*cking awesome
7337	1	a	Make the large dino spawn to 400%, huge clusterâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. People except you healing the generator, no problem. Guy goes afk for most of time and then comes back, takes your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Nice game to play with â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing idiots  10/10 would call someone a jew again.
7339	1	a	An enjoyable way to pass time
7341	1	a	the only thing i dont like is that i dont know how to get the mechs 
7343	1	a	One thing I can't figure out... I bought this game awhile back when it was on sale. Now, all of a sudden I have to buy it a second time, and at full price? Why is this happening, I thought I already owned this game.. Other than that. The game itself is awesome in my opinion, I love the halo-esque feel when playing it, then throw in dinosaurs. Done... All in all, it's a great game and would love to continue playing it, if it wasn't for the fact I apparently have to purchase it again. Hopefully this problem will be fixed one day.

7349	1	a	fantastically cinematic shooter action, listening helplessly to your friend scream as he's torn apart by a T-Rex in slow motion, and avenging him with your bare hands is a rare experience, play with voice chat for maximum adrenaline
7351	1	a	You can ride an entire mech ontop of a VTOL in this at full speed - it's seriously ridiculous fun.  It's unpolished, but the old reviews don't take into account that this game has gone a long way through updates.  It's cheap, with lots of content and gamemodes sure to keep you playing for many hours.  While it has buggy animations and other small problems, it's still a really fun game and the scale of fighting huge dinosaurs is fun - refreshing from the zombie game crowd.  Lots of gamemodes, maps, and things to do.
7353	1	a	If It only didnt lag as hell I could write a decent review.
7355	1	a	This game is the description of 'so bad it's good'.
1485	0	a	This game is still HORRIBLE after three years of support. Please stop supporting it and let it die. If this is seriously 3 years of effort, you need to find a new career path.
7357	1	a	A lot of people rip on this game, but it really is a fun game. For me, I don't have a lot of free time, and this is an easy game to pick up and play in short bursts. Only have 15 min? Enough time to fire up and play Rampage for a bit. Have a few hours? Conquest mode will take that.  With that said, some of the complaints are true. Early on bugs were pretty frustrating, but offset by a lot of free add-on content. None of that is really much of an issue anymore - the worst bugs are worked out, but there are still some (minor) issues.  The online community isn't large, but what is there is pretty welcoming for a casual gamer like myself. Typically the online games are set to the easier modes (which are a little too easy). It is a little annoying that it's hard to find people willing to play on harder modes...  Overall, the game is fun, and for the price that it is, It's worth an add to your Steam library.
7359	1	a	7/10
7361	1	a	this is an awsome game please make more of thease games there awsome
1488	0	a	Look at the pretty screenshots.... This game blows.
1489	0	a	WORST GAME IN THE WORLD IT SUCKS DONT WASTE A DOLLAR ITS A STUPID GAME
1490	0	a	I just don't like the game, my personal opinion.
1491	0	a	I do like this game but not as good as everone said (i got it for $0.50) but its ok i guess....... 5.6/10
7363	1	a	its an amazing game for its price the grapics are good i would recomend anyone getting it
1495	0	a	as humorous as i thought it was playing for the first five minutes, this game did not sway me into buying into it. even with the sale price of 99 cents at the time of this review. is it entertaining? i'd like to think so? is it worth a dollar? debatable, at times it feels literally unfinished. wait, I take that back, pretty much all the time it feels unfinished. but I did enjoy the few minutes i played it but didn't see it go anywhere past 1 or 2 plays. if free gameplay and a 93% discount doesn't sway me into buying your game then i'm sorry i cannot reccomend buying this game. do play it at least once though. it'll be interesting.
7365	1	a	awsome 
7367	1	a	thank god they lowered the price
7369	1	a	i mean, its bad, but it IS a fun game with friends xD
7371	1	a	I love this game a bit laggy if u play on a laptop with pretty nice graphics but still awesome
7373	1	a	Honestly, I'm torn as to whether it's actually worth a dollar or not.  On one hand, it could be great fun if you've got a full group of friends to play with.  On the other... good god, the bugs, the pointlessness of an entire class (of only three!), the repetitiveness, and the fact that a god-awful player can screw you over on Conquest by stealing your vehicle...
1499	0	a	Why did the name change and re-download. No. I got this because I thought it was funny. It runs poorly.
1500	0	a	This game is more shity than my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
7375	1	a	It has dinosaurs. What else can be said.
1502	0	a	download this game  
1503	0	a	This game was a pile of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ when it first came out. They have came a very long way than what it use to be.  Give it a try but only think about how lame it is already.
7377	1	a	bought the game for 50c, got trading cards sold for for 80c. Profit :)
7379	1	a	its is quite a fun little first person shooter i think if you like these sort of games you should defenatly have a try
7381	1	a	Loved the game it was by far the best dinosaur game ive played i got to do lots of things be dinosaurs, kill dinosaurs, ride vehicels, lots of gamemodes, it was the most fun ive had.
1505	0	a	...
1506	0	a	Clunky and unattractive menu just generally something you'd make on scratch its just ehh 
7383	1	a	Team Fortress with dinosaurs, spawningdinos/10 would play again
7385	1	a	it is rilly fun
7387	1	a	This game is VERY FUN! I would highly recommend it! 8/10
7389	1	a	its ok
7391	1	a	LOVE IT
7393	1	a	They have a Turok reference in Achievements  15/10
7395	1	a	what am i doing with my life
7397	1	a	what the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
7399	1	a	ORION: Dino Hore is a action packed RPG MMO with robots. It is a forth person shooter with many different guns to choose from including, My favourite, the pistol. The Graphics are revolutionary for the dinosaws moths move and even when you die you get a very good insight of what a dinosaws digestive system looks like there for it is also educational. You can play many classes such as the mage, the rouge and soldier or even the random guy who does not do anything and still win by pure luke. Now i know what you fink, Meta score ist bud but screw the sustem. What the lego movie taught me, dont trust the government for they give you false information 99999999% of the time. I give this game a 11111111111111111111111111/1 in my opinon. The specil ting bout dis gam is you can play as a dinosaw which everybody wanted. Overal, ds gam is gut and i prefer th tim i cilled a dinosaw but relized it was my friend with a hat on. 
1521	0	a	very poorly made game
1522	0	a	dont bother with it, its crap.
1523	0	a	This is the worst game I have ever played. The graphics are terrible and the best computer can't handle it weith the worst graphics on possible. And the game is just laggy and glitchy. This is the worst game to ever be in existense. The dinasours just like to fly around and attack you while you can't see because of the laggy peice of shot game â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ tits.
1524	0	a	It was really cool until i played it
1525	0	a	This game have good gameplay but you get bored preety fast and there are a few players.Don't recommand it.
7401	1	a	10/10 would shoot dinos again
7403	1	a	I've played it once with a friend and actually had a fun time doing it. While it may be underwhelming on the surface, it is very fun if you're willing to relax and just play a game a bit without too much thought involved.
1527	0	a	bought this game as a joke after betting with my friend whether this game is worth a $ . played this game only for cards and later deleted this game . 10/10 would rate meh8/h8
7405	1	a	I think this game is pretty fun, but I cant say that I like the devs. Most of the reviews that are negative have to do with the devs, just disreguard that stuff. This game is $1 This game is 100% worth $1 I wouldn't say that its worth $20 by a long shot
7407	1	a	its an fun amazing chaotic game!
1528	0	a	Horrible game. The guns feel horrible like they aren't doing anything. The devs say that they've improved the game, I would argue that they made it worse. The jetpack DOESNT work off the jump. The gun skins feel just thrown in.
1529	0	a	its a bit crap  more like oreo precumlube/10
7409	1	a	It's like Borderlands with dinosaurs.
1530	0	a	Back when this game was call Dino Beatdown the game have fewer dinos the graphics were 10x better and the gameplay was smoother. Now updates dino horde and prelude came changing the game into this bloody rubbish, and a major graphics downgrade to make the pretty ok looking game look like 32bit S*h*i*T and the only good thing to come out of it was the weather effects for the snow lvls  i used to love this game in 2012 but the updates ruined it
1531	0	a	Not working with Linux (Ubuntu) ?
7411	1	a	This game is so much fun, and so under rated. Don't pay attention to the metascore because if it was me scoring it, I would probably score it maybe a 83 or something around that, it has decent graphics, fun and addicting gameplay, and i'm sure that a lot more content will be added in the future. Let's help this game grow and get even better than it already is by supporting this game. It is awesome.
1534	0	a	Its an ok game but SEVERELY BROKEN did you have to dip down in quality after you almost got sued Step up guys seriously
1535	0	a	Terrible. I got this for almost nothing and I still want my money back.  For one thing, I can literally buy iron boots or w/e after one wave, jet pack up on top of rocks, and then become immortal because nothing can touch me, including the large Dinos like T-rex. The Pterodactyls can ram me, but they do so little damage its laughable  There is a day-night cycle, which makes the game basically unplayable because you need to kill all the dinosaurs in a wave to advance, including pterodactyls, which are completely invisible at night.  The big weapons like rocket launchers you cant even USE, or I havent figured out how without looking it up.  You can literally farm credits nonstop during non-wave missions, because unless you kill the large dinosaur, weenies spawn endlessly, and during non-wave segments you can buy power ups at any time. The first Non-wave mission I sat on a rock, untouchable, as pterodactyls rammed into me, shooting things with my peestol and making tons of cash, only going down to buy more ammo, then I bought almost every single power up and the highest power gun in every category.   The game itself is terribly optimized, and even though I can play skyrim decently, I cannot handle orion without disabling nearly every graphics option and even then, it's still like 20 fps. On the high settings, IF it ran right, it looks like something from the early naughties, not the 2010s. No reason at all to be so poorly optimized for pc.  2/110, good for some cheap laughs, but so much other stuff is much more fun.
7413	1	a	All of the reviews are steam ones.  10/whydoesthisnumberevenmatter.
7415	1	a	Very good game overall. It has great graphics and a huge variety of game modes and playable characters. You can get levels, encouraging you to get higher and higher levels to get better. I think personally the music is great too. I'd have to say a 10/10.
7417	1	a	It's not a deep game, but a very fun one. If you combine this with the good gameplay mechanics and decent graphics, this is a really good investment for $1.00.
7419	1	a	Best 69 cent spent in my life.  Online FPS with many guns, upgrades, superpowers, vehicles and DINOSAURS!! The game is easy to get into, has nice graphics, is well optimized and most importantly, it is damn FUN!  9/10
7421	1	a	It will change your life for ever.

7423	1	a	ayy, thats pretty good, 10/10 good priced and great game. great fuc king deal
7425	1	a	This game is a ton of fun. It got bad scores for coming out incomplete but has been updated a ton soon after. It's a good coop survival game to play with some friends.

1558	0	a	what can i say this is a dino day clone not very good 
1559	0	a	very ugly, very boring game...looks like it is from 2009 so ugly. The gameplay is very boring too. Looks like Dinosaur meets killing floor.
1560	0	a	this game is really good but the massive lag spoils what could be an amazing game
7435	1	a	This game is awesome AND very cheap,in fact too cheap for being this awesome~! :D (not that i am complaining~ xP) In the beginning i was 'Meh,this games is hard and not that good,but after a while,when i got the hang of it and started to have fun,i thought,hey it's not bad,actually it's very fun~!' xD
7437	1	a	This game is beyond amazing. This is a cross between Halo and Ark. This game is worth the money also very fun with friends and it wastes sometime are you hands and its just a very good game overall.
1566	0	a	the developers are snakes
1567	0	a	Sure am glad the specs keep changing
1568	0	a	what can i say this is a dino day clone not very good 
7439	1	a	Don't belive metacritic on this one, it deserves atleast a 7/10. If you like killing floor you will probably like this and is well worth picking up on sale.
1571	0	a	Ugly. Awful. Bad gameplay. Waste of time. Sorry I gave this game a shot and it's just bad. Looks cool and fun at first however it's not.
1572	0	a	No thanks.

1573	0	a	They make jokes that in 2012, they made the worst game ever, but now theyve turned it around.... NO.. The gaame is still pretty bland. i may have found this game interesting back in 2005, but here we are 10 years later and their gfx still look 10+ years old. the community seems pretty dead... there is barely a choice of server/game mode to choose from, i still cant get past the fact that this game looks like it would be ok back in 2000-2005. I wouldnt recommend playing this game unless its the very first game you play in history, that way you cant compare it to anything else.
7443	1	a	addicted with this game :)

7447	1	a	One of the best dinosaur games I have played in a long while. I would have happily paid around $5 for a game like this.  Pros -It is a steal for 99 cents! Far better than any 99 cent iphone game - It has dinosaurs! -Every battle take part in seems unique, anything can happen! -It is moderately open world -Contols are easy to use -those particle effects! -any multiplayer game mode you can think of -Hats, hats and more hats -it can run on anything if you know how to adjust your system settings and the game initialization file  Cons -the game can be a bit buggy and has lots of random FPS drops even on my gaming rig - The Ai dinosaurs can be a little goofy at times. - No single player campaign (I got over that since the game was apparently made by 2 people and I don't want to put to much pressure on the devs,) -The maps are all very similar in style and design. -the 3D characters, guns, props and textures are not as high quality as i would like. (still very good though!) -its not as realistic as crysis 3 (Get over it) -I felt that the devs could have taken this game just a little bit further to make it trully amazing  Awesome dinosaur game,  good multiplayer indie game   Rating: 8.7/10  
1584	0	a	i played one match and thats good enough for me i had glitches every room i walked in i had teammates that just stood there when i was down and had no fun
1585	0	a	  A masterpiece that revolutionises the gaming industry. Truly a spectacle to behold. The best game in my library without a doubt. Worth every cent.
7449	1	a	  Not a bad game. It runs well on my ancient box too. I wished we could play as dinosaurs though.
7451	1	a	Halo and Borderlands had a lovechild with Turok. It has lots of flaws but its fun with friends, and its only a buck.
7453	1	a	The Best Halo Games on pc lol just kidding  Orion prelude its a good game for just 1$  if you have a spare money on your wallet you should check this game out
7455	1	a	I think that despite the criticism that orion prelude has been given I think it is a very solid game... for only ONE dollar. Its so cheap that it doesnt have to be good but they still made it decent. It is a vey fun arcade shooter and I would say it is the most casual out of the three dinosaur shooters that I own. Its a great game to buy a friend who has naver used steam perhaps and is multiplayer so you can play together. It is very satisfying to kill large hoards of dinosaurs. Personally I would have liked to see a few more guns as well as bigger differces between the character classes that you can choose. It is also too easy to camp because of the jetpack although there is a brid that will sometimes pull you off your camp spot after a while. Lastly there are not so many servers for the vast number of gamemodes that the devs have created.  Pros: -fun arcade shooter -cheap -decent graphics -good game balance -many dinosaurs -many gamemodes -good powerups -multiplayer (you can make your own lobby)  Cons: -repetetive after a certain amount of rounds -some glitches -maps are sometimes too easy to defend -few guns -classes dont do much -after upgrading guns and armour ect the game can become unbalanced -Should be different types of bosses in harder levels, not just more of them   
7457	1	a	Please nominate this for game of the year 2017, This is seriously one of the best most innovative games on the market. It is wuite a shame that people are missing out on this gem, if you have $1 and a friend who doesnt have this game, buy them this game and they will love you forever. Basically this is the best game ever made and will easily win Game of the Year if nominated.
1588	0	a	its graphics are terrible and its gameplay sucks
1589	0	a	This game is full of glitches and problems and should be labelled early access with a disclaimer. When I shoot, I don't see bullets coming out of my gun and when I use a vehicle turret the screen just shakes, with nothing coming out of the gun. It somehow still does damage to the dinosaurs though. I would not recommend buying it, even at the price of $0.75 unless you just want to get the trading cards or something.  I was wondering how the game got a rating of 'Mostly Positive', but after looking at several other comments, I found out that this game has been removed and re-added to Steam several times due to terrible ratings, so I wouldn't expect long-term support for this game either.
1590	0	a	Before I begin, I would like to point out that I can run Far Cry 3 on high graphics.   This game could be great. It already would be great, if not for one killer - fps. On low everything, this game lags like hell, and my gun appears to be hovering in my hands, which often go through it. Also, there are no tutorials. I know you can probably find them online somewhere, but it would be nice if there was an optional one you could participate in if you needed to. I really tried to enjoy this game, but the fps, which was probably about 7, ruined my experience.   When they fix the fps problems and major lag, then, and only then, will this be a reccomendation.  It will be an awesome game when that happens. But for now, it is terrible.
7459	1	a	0/10 They're changing it.
7461	1	a	The best 79 cents I've ever spent.

1596	0	a	I have literally never played a worse game.
1597	0	a	It's alright for like 20 minutes at a time but gets boring pretty quick and it's hard to look past the gleaming flaws to actually enjoy it. Needs lots of work.   The price of a game is irrelevant, the fact that it's less than $1 doesn't excuse a broken game, too many lazy devs these days seem to think so though.
1598	0	a	the graffic's ar HORRIBLE AND TO MUCH LAG
7467	1	a	Its awesome and worth the money! I have not bought it but I will try to as soon as I get the money. I have this far only played it when it has been free.
7469	1	a	Didn't play the game Still get to make a review 10/10 would review again
7471	1	a	FRICKING REDIC LAGG JHOLY CRAP IT TAAKES A WHOLE SECOND FOr MY MOUSE TO START TO FOLLOW MY MOVEMENTS EVEN WITH EVERYTHING DOWN ITS STILL SUPER SLOW! PLEASE FIX, as well as the controller support!

7475	1	a	OMG! BEST! GAME! EVER! totaly worth a 10/10
7477	1	a	Just great !!!!
1603	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing terrible, even worse than Dino Horde
7479	1	a	This game has gotten some bad reviews but I actually enjoy this game. While the lack of documentation or tutorials was a poor choice, the combat mechanics are similar to Borderlands 2 or Payday and my friends and I (after the initial issues getting to connect together) had quite a bit of fun in it. I feel it's worth the price while on sale if you enjoy quick action games with some replayability (although the same maps over and over will get old after a while). I mainly play it for the co-op and not the competitive styles (but the Rampage mode where one side can play a dinosaur is entertaining).  It's not for everyone, but if you enjoy games like Payday with repeatable missions and a persistent leveling system for unlocks it's quite an entertaining little diversion.
1605	0	a	The third release of Orion: Dino Beatdown is no better than the first, they fixed some issues but a lot of technical stuff is still broken, and even for a dollar, a tenth of what i paid, I don't beleive thisis worth your time. There are better free games on steam.
1606	0	a	It's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, but when they decided to make it look better, they just made the game more â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, so now its â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ covered in â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ 10/10 its â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ `ign
1607	0	a	A poor quality game, poorly optomized, barely functional, and all around garbage. Everything that this game does, is stolen from other games, which do it a hundred times better. I mean this game isnt a -20 out of 10. but its like a 1 out of 10. its not even so bad its funny, its just dreadful. I got a four pack of this game for like 3 american dollars on sale, and I want my three dollars back. Id rather buy a soda or something.
7481	1	a	Got It Free Cant Really Run It Got Bad Specs
7483	1	a	super great game u have to get this game
7485	1	a	Is good... Don't let those damn critics let you down... Give it a try for pete sakes! Though this review may not sound promosing, try it, play it, and then come here and try to prove me this game is a downfall.
7487	1	a	Some of the most fun I have had in any FPS besides the half life series.  It's worth 5 times the pricetag.  You get dual pistols, flamethrowers, jetpacks, and mechs, and you fight FRICKING dinosaurs, with beautiful gameplay, this is one of the best co-op FPS's ever made.
1609	0	a	this is the worst game ever I paid for it and the grafics are bad most of the game is noobs the worst thing there is no planes or tanks 
1610	0	a	One of the worst games I've played in a while. Worth about $1. Maybe. Player has one life and that's it. When you die you lose ALL progress. Every weapon you purchased, every augmentation and you start over at the beginning of the game. That's honestly worse than the arcade games I used to play in the 80'S. At least with those I could put in another quarter to continue.
1611	0	a	This Game is Horrible
7489	1	a	ITS FUN at bit laggy but fun all the way! 
7491	1	a	Great fun, cool cartoony graphics, bugs seem to have been cleared up pretty neatly showing that the developers behind it care and are willing to support the game and its community.   It is extremely cheap so I do recommend buying a 4 pack to share with your mates as the most fun is offered in CO-OP with friends. :P overall, definitely get this game! :D
1615	0	a	Server's dead. Bored now
1616	0	a	I remember playing this game on launch. Multiplayer was unplayable, singleplayer was barely playable. Since then it has come a long way, now I can call it a game without feeling too bad about myself. BUT saying it's a game now, doesn't mean it's good. Weapons sound like peashooters, graphics are washed out and ugly (this is what happens when untallented person gets hold on an Unreal 3 engine) and the general gameplay is not very entertaining. But it is much more stable now and you no longer see raptors spinning in place, so that's a step up.  There's just one more thing that needs to be mentioned: the game has changed it's title multiple times, it came from Orion: Dino Beatdown to Orion: Dino Horde to Orion: Prelude. Why is that? To escape the bad reviews it's gotten in the past? To trick people into thinking it's a different game?
1617	0	a	This game is so bad, it's like watching Louis Smith doing maths and english AT the SAME time.
1618	0	a	The worst game i ever bought! Bad graphics, not at all fun game mode, ugly looking character, not creative weapons and the boring dragons.
1619	0	a	The frame rate is so low, it is unbelievable, I had an incredibly low resolution setting on, and on an I5 Processor Windows 7 Ultimate hardware and it was unplayable, my friend has a fully working operating Windows 10 Computer, his was still laggy, DO NOT BUY, laggy to hell.
7493	1	a	This game got a 36 for a metascore. Are you kidding me? This game does not deserve a 36. It's a great fps, and the different modes are really cool. The graphics arent great, and there are some bugs. I've gotten stuck in many rocks and stuff, and dinosaurs get stuck too. Also, the game should have bots. Sometimes i just feel like playing a team deathmatch, but i wanna play alone. But you can't. Your guy just stands there and it says waiting for players and every few minutes a dino will run by. However the game has some very cool features including many guns and upgrades. Plus, I bought the game for only 99 cents. It goes on sale all the time. In fact, as I'm writing this it's on sale 1.49. With a few updates it will definetly be worth the $15. I'm not sure it's there yet though. It's definetly worth $1 though. If it gets really cheap, you should try it. Some people love it, some hate it. Overall, I'd give this game a 7/10, because it still needs a few changes in my opinion. But it's still fun the way it is.
1620	0	a	Do NOT buy this game unless you have a very good gaming computer. I can normally run any game at 50-60 fps on good video settings. This game? Absolutely not. To get it to run at 60 fps, I have to make it look like it was made a looong time ago. At that point, all the intensity and excitement are pretty much gone, the tall grass blocks half your screen, and its pretty much just pointless to play. Worth the money but if you want a fps with dinosaurs, buy Dino D-Day.
7495	1	a	Its okay, it could use ALOT of work.  The Good Multiplayer/singleplayer Tons of weapons Tons of vehicles Customization Gamemodes  The Bad Weird Animations Being unable to connect to the servers  Buying outfits (Really Trek -_-) Glitchs/bugs Able to get to spots and survive for insane amounts of time TEH LAG!  Thats about all I can think of. No game is perfect, I like how Trek is stil working on this game and updating it.  My opinion: Would play 6.5/10
1621	0	a	It's endless rounds of the same objectives over and over, there is no winning this game. You instead keep fighting hordes of dinosaurs until you die, then you can try to do better again I guess. It has ZERO plot, dinosaurs and unnamed futuristic Soldiers. This game must have taken the designers all of three minutes to come up with. I was hoping fr something like Turok and was very disappointed.
1622	0	a	its a crappy horrible game. 0/10 wouldnt install for anything.
1623	0	a	Doesn't work. Thumb down.  Pc specs:  Asus 8GB ram. Intel core i7.  The game doesn't even work on low settings... 
7497	1	a	This video sums it all up.  https://youtu.be/zoHFWd1qi0c 
7499	1	a	This game is amazing it has warthogs lightsabres hornets and spartans. If you like star wars and halo this game is aids
1626	0	a	Nearly reached 1hr of gameplay i played 59mins in fact it was so awersome that i decided to delete it right away By the way devs i enjoyed best uninstall simulator evur gg iluminati out of 10
1627	0	a	I thought I'd give this a shot since it was so cheap but honestly I could not enjoy this game in any way, shape or form. This is just my opinion and who knows, maybe you'll like it more.
7501	1	a	i love it I GET TO KILL ALOT OF TREX 
1628	0	a	Game sucks
7503	1	a	ORION: Prelude is the best buck I've ever spent on Steam. That single dollar got me a game that's half Turok half Killing Floor with awesome weapons, fun perks, expansive maps, nearly ten different game modes, and offline bots. Admittedly there are still some glitches to mend and polish to apply, but for the dirt cheap price of the game, you get what you paid for and more! So what are you waiting for?  Purchase the game Download the game Launch the game Open the door Get on the floor Everybody kill the dinosaur
1632	0	a	Very confusing for someone who rarely games, and even my brother who games a lot said it was very confusing. In at least the demo there were absolutely no instructions at all on how to play/what the controls are. I had to search a bit online for some help, even then I didn't figure out all the controls(I just started pressing random buttons to see what happened). Glad I didn't buy this game to be honest.
7505	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
1633	0	a	This is absolute trash. Avoid.
7507	1	a	It is an ok game and it is definitely worth the fabulous price of 1$, it is pretty fun with multiplayer, there is workshop content and it can be played with a controller. It is laggy a lot but worth 1$, I had fun with this game. it is decent
7509	1	a	Best game for 1$ you can find on steam.
7511	1	a	This game is LOADS of fun its like a combonation of Halo and Jurassic Park!
1635	0	a	What a waste of 99 Cents.
1636	0	a	Play it only with friends.
7513	1	a	Its a game about killing dinos with swords,lasers,bows,rockets,etc. and theres hats and its 1 dollar  It be stupid not to get this game No seriously buy it! You think i left? im still here. Waiting for you to buy it...... I can do this all day........
7515	1	a	Killed a stegosauraus by shooting it in the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. 12/10 BEST GAME OF ALL TIME
1637	0	a	I did not like the game
1638	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥/10
1639	0	a	bad optimization. I meet minimum specs but still forced to turn town resolution and graphics-everything looks like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
1640	0	a	Orion: Prelude a game where you get to protect power generators and shoot dinos! Sounds fun right? Tried it out, guns sounded generic, abilities seemed a bit uninspired. Dino models looked great, gun models looked pretty decent, but the game crashed. Combine that effect with a lack of single player story and well... you get to shoot dinos right? Unfortunately the games not for me, you don't get to build anything permenanet, design any dinos, and from asking around all the matches, waves, and spawning rates are typically the same. I am not able to recommend this game.
7517	1	a	Graphics: 8/10 Gameplay: 9/10 Performance:10/10   When I bought this game I was expecting a broken peice of crap game. HOLY &amp;%$# I was wrong This game is addictive fun and great for co-op teamwork though a few of the gamemodes and a little broken. But the makes that up with Halarious Ragdoll glitches like a T-rex doing a flip. or a Raptor freaking out halfway in the ground. This game is not something new it reminds me alot of other co-op games but thats the point of this game it's a time killer game, for say you got 40 minutes to kill. This game will eat that 40 minutes right up. My verdict is a 9/10
1641	0	a	I dont realy like this game, the graphics..nah not that good.Best graphics since Atari 2600 :/ the gameplay, more like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ play.the idea of hunting dinosaurs in the future,what i thought they were dead.sorry 2/10 :/
7519	1	a	The best game you can get for that price :)
7521	1	a	really great game! Zombies gameplay but with dinosaurs is brillant! the weapons and graphics fit quite well with the era(whatever era it may be anyways) and the objectives and conquest are deffinitly the winning game mods here! they've done an amazing job with this game and i can't see it going anywhere but to the top!
7523	1	a	Although I have only put about 5 hours into this game (as I have to update it and been wanting to install other games first), this game is addicting!! Halo meets Star Wars vs Jurassic Park! Incredibly broken but my brother and I couldnt stop laughing from the sheer insanity of it all!! Shows what a .99 game can do and outshine some of those games that want $19.99 and are just subpar. What are you doing here still? BUY IT MEOW!!!
7525	1	a	It's a fun game, simple, slightly stupid, and way more fun than I had expected from it. It's worth the 15 dollars you can usually get it for, but I've seen it on sale for 93% off a few times, and i'd recommend you stock up on a few copies for you and your friends any time it's on sale.
1645	0	a	Game is ok if you are borring. This culd be Free to play... not worth spending money for this. 
7527	1	a	the best thing is if they will come with a dino mode where you can play as a dino vs the humans  
7529	1	a	I have this game from 2013. This is my review. -2 million copies sold becouse game is good and only cost 0.79â‚¬ (for me idk for dollars) -good snipers -while being downed don't need player to get you up.just kill dinosaur! :D -skins for pistol? i perfer golden one. :D or magma -Customizing charachter and showing middle finger as taunt :D -Can be Fps and third person -i didn't play 2 weeks game and i accidently got 12k. Was that helpful to buy game? Maybe
7531	1	a	This game is amazing... Screw all the hater... Any game that you can use a piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ piss colored lightsaber is obviously a pretty amazing game. This game is so good that you can run into a trex and he doesn't die. The creators of the game should now own call of black ops 5 san andreas fault edition. It makes me want to make love to a dinosaur... In my dreams I picture that dinosaurs are still alive and ready to be made love to. I have completely changed my way of life. I now worship dinosaurs. I love dinosaurs. Dey R mye fyverote tyng. Eye Love them with a passion.. Withoute Dynosurs i would have no luve in my life.. If i could make love to evey dino every I wood.
7533	1	a	When this game is on sale, it is TOTALLY worth it. Its a fun, fast paced, easy to get into first person shooter. I bought it for $0.49 and it was worth every penny. I have only played about 2 online rounds but still like it a lot and will be playing it more.  If you're looking for some kind of long story line, and tons of depth, this isnt it. Its meant to be SUPER easy to get into and get out of.  Although, it is buggy and I think the dinos get way to close to you and its hard to see them. But all the settings are there, FOV slider, textures, AA, so forth... Like it is going to get more and more attention as more people buy it. But it is not meant to be this super realistic game, just meant to be fun.
7535	1	a	better than takedown 10/10
7537	1	a	This is Halo of Jurassic Duty 2 or Call of Jurassic Halo 2. This game is so cool and very fun to play
7539	1	a	This game is the reason I wake up in the morning.   Acid shooting dino/10
1650	0	a	WHERES TUROK ??
1651	0	a	this game contains so much aids
1652	0	a	it sucks  
7541	1	a	This game is wierd. Dinosaur nazi zombies, except without the nazis or zombies. I have a mixed view about this game. It is well animated and the graphics are great. The weapons work well and fighting huge dinosaurs in a round system could not have been done better. I feel this game isn't deep enough, even though you pay to play, you have to pay to customize, which might not be so bad. Also I think it would have made a good freeroam game. Not survival. But for what you pay for, I suppose its all right.
7543	1	a	Such a fun addicting game worth 100x the price I bought it. Deserves GOTY. What. A. Game.
7545	1	a	Worth a dollar. In all other regards-... god awful.  Glitchy mess, feels like premade unity assets.. controls in general feel muddy. Could also really do with a tutorial.
7547	1	a	Killing dinosaurs was never this easy!
1655	0	a	Didn't have any intro or any tutorial. Graphics are bad. Really, I don't like any part of this game
7549	1	a	This gud game make me happy, fun playing with friend.. ( can i get spiral coin without paying real money? maybe i can get it with complete a leve? )
7551	1	a	I LIKE IT BUT IT REQUIRES A VERY GOOD COMPUTER TO PLAY..
7553	1	a	This is a mainly multiplayer game but you can play versus bots if you really need to,though it is really not recommended to do so since that really takes away from the whole 'stay with your team to survive' feels. There's alot of diffrent gamemodes to choose from but mainly there's 2, atleast what I found, which is survival and Deathmatch. The game dosen't take that long to learn and the controlls are relativly easy to learn.It's a relativly fun game to play with some freinds on a LAN party.  It will most probably turn pretty boring after some hours of gameplay.    **** PROS AND CONS****  + Easy to learn +   Only cost 0.99â‚¬   Free-to-play + Lots of modes   - Edit: Early supporters that bought the game gets nothing in-game for their support - Not alot compelling about the game after yyou play certain matches on the main modes      *** Overall rating***  ***6/10***     
7555	1	a	Buy this game , if you want to waste your money.
7557	1	a	this is a great game. even if you dont play it you should buy it just because of what these guys have achieved here. to take an absolutely terrible game and turn it into this is just magical!
7559	1	a	For 99p you really need to be scummy to give this a bad review. (I'm surprised halo hasn't sued)
7561	1	a	Such a fantastic game for such a low price! Really like the concept of the game and the gameplay is ridiculously fun :)) I could run around and stab dinosaurs in the face all day! :D
1658	0	a	Its not a game with bugs, its bugs whit a game.
1659	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Graphics and Textures and Really boring
7563	1	a	nice game for the price :)
7565	1	a	If you're a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ like me who wants to invade dinosaur habitats and then slaughter them all for no valuable reason as they try to defend their home, then this is the game for you.  11/10 No need for meteors -IGN
1660	0	a	Stephen Hawking runs better than this game... -10/10
1661	0	a	jesus christ i know its cheap but you can buy a bag of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ for the same price and you would be â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ of
7567	1	a	Love it, but dunno why cause i'm bad at â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ like this.
7569	1	a	This Game Is Great It Has Alot Of Bugs But they can be forgotten as its gameplay is great and for $1 its a great deal
7571	1	a	This Game Is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing Awesome!  Pros:   You can kill dinosaurs. There are tanks. There are helicopters. You can knife dinosaurs. There is a giant â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing aligator. You can play with friends. You can knife dinosaurs. You can fly around in a jetpack You can knife dinosaurs. You can get hit by a dinosaur and launch 5000ft in the air. You can knife dinosaurs. Lots of guns. Lots of boss dinosaurs. Lots of game modes.    Cons:   This game is awesome. 10/10 And if you didnt know   YOU CAN KNIFE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING DINOSAURS    
7573	1	a	BEST GAME EVER !!!!!  Even stronger than Jurassic World ;)
7575	1	a	THIS GAME SUCKS. I PLAYED 5 HOURS AND I DON'T LIKE THIS. IT CAN IT MY NUTS. WHY SO BAD? WHY? PLEASE DON'T DO THIS TO ME! PLEASE!!!
7577	1	a	Least expensive time passer in a while.      10/10
7579	1	a	Pretty fun for it's price. It's not a game that I could see my self playing for days on end but overall it's pretty good.   Cons: Graphics could use some improvment
7581	1	a	-1/10 Worst game ever. Not even worth 99p
7583	1	a	playing with friends, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing fun game :D
7585	1	a	I play this if im downloading a steam game but OMG ITS SO â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ AMAZING MUCH SIMPLE MUCH WOW
1664	0	a	Even free it's not worth it. Don't waste your time.
7587	1	a	punched t-rex in leg  got eaten  11/10
7589	1	a	I love this game sooooooo much I quit playing CS:GO for this game.
7591	1	a	Joins hard difficulty server that starts off with little cash Doesnt buy a weapon for a round Finally gets a few perks and has a little money left over Buys Cryoknife 1 Shots all mid sized raptors plays 3 rounds and buys perks 40 minutes later STILL USING THE $2000 KNIFE THAT I BOUGHT ON ROUND 2 20 minutes later Finally gets $40k for a fancy VTOL helicopter Gets less kills and less money with a Helicopter compared to a knife  Best investment ive ever made in my entire life...
1667	0	a	loaded up game, game crashed 10/10
7593	1	a	$1. $1 $1 $1. ...... it's still better than advanced warfare 
7595	1	a	It's not great but you can get a dollar's worth of fun out of it easily.
7597	1	a	  Got this game for super cheap one day, and it is actually a lot of fun, you will run around with no idea what you are doing and still enjoy yourself. No it isnt the BEST FPS out there, but it is absolutely worth playing.
7599	1	a	what
7601	1	a	This game feels like halo 4
7603	1	a	amazing game would reccomend to 9/10 people if you like cool dinosours then buy this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is some good â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ like even dj khaled would play this game if he wasnt always riding his jet ski on the path to success
7605	1	a	Why'd you make it Free2Play? It's a total waste of my money!
7607	1	a	A game where you run around a huge, picturesque map killing dinosaurs what else do you need
7609	1	a	Friend bought this game as a joke. We played it for 3 hours straight. 10/10 we're getting more friends involved.

1676	0	a	didnt grabet me on first plus but i have to say that this game was the first game that i see a ''team vs monster''game
1677	0	a	The single and only shitest most unbalanced laggy peice of crap that I love for no reason. Now I'm off to uninstall.
1678	0	a	Do you recommend this game? a big NO
7611	1	a	This is some good â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ right here
1680	0	a	I can't even joke about this. One of the worst games I've ever played.
1681	0	a	Get to the chopper
7613	1	a	Very great game to play for only $1 its got the best graphics
7615	1	a	I love this game, mostly because it's simply dinosaurs and futuristic guns/stuff. Also, I recommend the prelude to ITSELF, Guardians of Orion. 10/10.
7617	1	a	I honestly thought this game looked awful at first. Then i played it! Its a freaking fantastic little game, its fun, its different and it has dinosours! what more could one ask for?! The meta critic reviewers are just pompus ignorant $#*!'s who rate CoD:ghosts 73 for christ sake! Ignore the professional reviews and look to the actual gamer reviews that are mostly positive. The game is best played with a group of friends as playing with randoms can get a little iritating but over all its a good game. For its price, its un-beatable!
1682	0	a	like dinosaurs but with jetpacks and guns kinda  not very good
1683	0	a	I'm not going to rate Orion Prelude positively, as I found it to be lacking in different aspects such as soundtrack, regular updates, optimization, animation, ai, balance, etc. I will however say that you may as well give it a try with friends now that it is free
1684	0	a	Literally only 10 people are allways online
7619	1	a	This game was bad, now it is good
7621	1	a	its a fun little game if you can get some of your friends together, and with its cheap price its nearly impossible to say no... Now all i need to do is make some freinds...
1687	0	a	Pretty damn horrible even after 60+ updates The audio oh god , Sounds like it was made by a retard Grahpics were ok it did render horribly gameplay was ok it could get fun but it was mostly boring  voice actors gave me ebola 3/10
7623	1	a	Needs mor of that japanese puss puss
7625	1	a	A friend gifted this game to me. Though I'm not a big fan of these types of games (in fact, I suck at most shooting games), I decided to give it a try. At first I wasn't expecting much from a game that was a buck, but boy did we have a blast.There's a ton of crazy shenanigans you can pull off. Sure, the game has its own share of flaws, but the point of a game is to have fun. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got more T-Rexs to clobber.
1689	0	a	I dont know what i bought it was 99 cents
7627	1	a	its cooh 
7629	1	a	You shoot dinosaurs.
7631	1	a	This game deserves all the money and high ratings it can get.
7633	1	a	Best game I have ever played in my entire life. My single life goal is to become a dinosaur and attack furturistic humans that have outdated weapons and jetpacks that last almost 5 seconds.
1691	0	a	Horrible, I feel ripped off for 99 cents right now. Bad game.
7635	1	a	Fun and super cheap right now
7637	1	a	THIS GAME IS AWSOME
1694	0	a	Buy it only on sale.
1695	0	a	officaly the worst game i have ever played thank god i only spend Â£1 on this peace of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. I have a pritty good gaming PC and this game can only run on 20 FPS on high settings and it looks like a monkeys â™¥â™¥â™¥. It is falsely advertised as the screen shots look nothing like the game its self please just on one els buy this game it want even be worth it if they made it free!!!
7639	1	a	It's pretty good, but gatling gun is way too op. Just get it and you've already won.
1699	0	a	Orion: Dino Beatdown is an entirely broken FPS.
7641	1	a	A little buggy , glitchy and of course WTF Game , but for 1â‚¬ its just amazing with lotta game modes , Dinosaurs and that meh things . BUT! yes , There is BUT! If u have a slow Connection DONT BUY THIS GAME !
7643	1	a	really good game.. the rate of this game is not updated.. really fun worth the 1$
7645	1	a	this game needs a steam workshop for mods. NEEDS.
1701	0	a	Not bad but the animations are a 'bit' weird and not worth 11 â‚¬,i would take primal carnage and dino d day any day of the week..
1702	0	a	Worst game i've ever bought
1703	0	a	Not even worth 99 cence, this game is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing pile of dog â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ topped with asscheeks
7647	1	a	You NEED to have this game compatable with mac. all steam games should be for that matter.
7649	1	a	Extremely fun with friends. Casual game that yet requires skill and team work.
1707	0	a	Don't be fooled by the trailers. This game is surrounded in controversy, mainly due to it's main developer David Prassel. Among a long list of nefarious acts, Prassel has been accused of stealing elements from other games, laying off employees without paying them for work, and manipulating message boards to deflect negative criticism towards the game. In addition Prassel tried to rebrand the game formerly known as 'Dino Beatdown' into 'Dino Horde' to increase Metacritic scores; claiming it to be a sequel when it's more of a content update. Even if one were to ignore the game's depraved upbringing, the game with it's comically short T-Rex arms fails to grasp the lofty claims and over-hype created presumably by Prassel.  Ignoring the game's heavy influence from Halo, the gameplay revolves around a stereotypical group of 'space marines' defending bases against swarms of prehistoric predators, which in of itself sounds okay on paper. However, within the first hour of playing, any seasoned gamer with a critical bone in their body will start to see the game's inherent flaws emerge. The game which marketed itself around commiting mass dino-cide features a surprisingly laughable AI that would make a Stegosaurus roll in it's sedimentary grave. The dinos tend to path in a completely linear fashion towards the player which makes 'Dino Horde' feel more like 'Dino Queue' which really brings the atmosphere in the game to extinction. Taking high ground will often result in dinosaurs running around in erradic beelines as you frantically spray at them with shoddy hit registration until they die. Don't worry about the hit registration though, because all of the basic ground dinosaurs can be run down inside of invincible ground vehicles such as the Wartho- I mean 'Gladiator' combat buggy, making firearms completely pointless outside of killing large dinosaurs. No seriously, I ground dinos into lizard burger for an hour and was awarded top score for being the most unskilled player on my team before I logged off in bitter apathy.  I tried giving this game a fair chance, I really did. I tried looking past Prassel coddling his 'baby' like an overprotective parent, his apparently questionable business practice and his deplorable attempt at dodging Metacritic rating, Underneath it all though was only the husk of a game, a grand idea with poor execution, and unfortunately it will not keep the interest of experienced gamers. Don't get me wrong, this game can be a fun waste of time with friends, but you should be laughing WITH the game, not AT it. Until someone can nail the 'dino defense' game on the head, my dream will remain fossilized in amber until it's DNA can be extracted and brought back to life, which sadly will most likely not be anytime soon.
7651	1	a	What Can You Say About Orion Dino Horde??? Well This Is All BUY IT
7653	1	a	Super Random game that kicks â™¥â™¥â™¥

7669	1	a	A little laggy and unresponsive, but probably because I barely meet the minimum pc requirements. Great from what I've seen. More than worth the dollar I paid for it.
7671	1	a	is this even a game-dankay kang
7673	1	a	Escaped by holding ctrl. 10/10
7675	1	a	Great game play it with friends :DDD
7677	1	a	This is the best FPS I've played in a long time!
7679	1	a	Awesome game! I was able to get it for â‚¬0.99 and I have to admit that the game is really worth it!  I love playing this with a bunch of friends, good times! :)
7681	1	a	IT LAGS LIKE CRAZY BUT THE CONCEPT IS REALY COOL SO PLAY THE GAME AND SUPPORT THE DEVS
7683	1	a	This game is Great but the thing is you need good graphics to run it my pc was running the game so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing slow but if you got the graphics then buy it
7685	1	a	Amazing. Purely amazing. First i want to say, 93% off? That's freakin cheap. And i love it. I first played this yesterday for the 'limited time free game' thingie steam has. Instantly i checked the store page to see how much it costed. $0.99. Wow. Here is what i liked/didn't like about my experience.  PROS: Ya get to kill freakin dinosaurs with machine guns and rocket launchers! Great weapons (depsite being only about 25) Various gamemodes (There were only like 1 or 2 that i didn't like) Amazing concept, which was executed perfectly. Co-op PVP PVE Solo mode Slaughter mode (i freakin love it!) Play as a freakin dinosaur  CONS Single player is a bit too hard (so ya better have some friends) Could use more customization  Would i recommend this? Heck ya! i give this an 9/10 
7687	1	a	Wow... got this for a dollar, sooooo worth it. Funnest dinosaur game ever, and you can play as them, well how bout that ;)
7689	1	a	very nice game still better than battlefield 3 :D
7691	1	a	THAT IS ONE BIG PILE OF â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥!
7693	1	a	ITS AWESOME YOU HAVE TO PLAY IT 
7695	1	a	there are dinos and i guess one mode is kinda like halo. its really stupid... like really really stupid, but i paid a dollar for it. i've played like only 10 minutes of this game and i don't ever plan on playing it again but i guess it's like kinda okay. it seems like just owning the game is some sort of like elite club or whatever so it's kinda cool. the game itself sucks though. it's pretty boring and i didn't really have fun. if it's on sale for less than 2 dollars buy it though i guess.
1714	0	a	this is a buggy piece of shiz i literally have not gone one second in this game without it lag furthermore its not even a good game in the first place
7697	1	a	This game is very fun, although I doubt it before I played it. Absolutely worth buying. This is actualy great. I rate it 9/10, but it has sound problems and takes too much PC performance.
7699	1	a	Yeah This game is great the graphics could be alittle better but im not complaining . if natural selection 2 and halo had a baby, this would be it (even though u cant play as dinos) overall awesome game
7701	1	a	Just got it, can't wait to play
7703	1	a	DO NOT BUY. I BOUGHT THIS GAME FOR 99 CENTS AND ITS NOT WORTH IT
7705	1	a	Selling gift of this game, invite me, we will make a deal! :)
7707	1	a	Hell, if I didn't have ping problems, it was 9/10
7709	1	a	Love this,not the best but it's really god :D
7711	1	a	Brought me a pizza.  10/10
1716	0	a	How to remove game from my account?
7713	1	a	I dont know .... like 7/10 -2 becouse the gameplay -1 becouse i waned to be DINOSAURS VS ROBOTS or something not BOTS DINOSAURS i want like in Dino d day .
7715	1	a	One match was really all I needed. It's my type of game but not polished enough for me. The graphics and sound aren't very good and the music is nothing spectacular either. Not to mention that the animations are really clunky and stiff. The gameplay is okay; it has a Turak and Halo combo. I must warn you though...I got bored right after my first match. There's no story or anything to this game. You just simply jump in and fight dinosaurs. There's 3 classes to choose from and they all have their own abilities. Assault has a jetpack, medic of course has a medic gun, and a stealth class that can go invisible for a short time. I also noticed I had a lot of connection problems which shouldn't happen since I have a gaming laptop. But some games will do this. I recommend it for a dollar only. 6/10
7717	1	a	Worth it
7719	1	a	This game is awesome! The idea of the game is that dinosaurs are trying to eat your team but you all have a different idea! Blast your way to victory! I really like how you can do like in Halo and have one guy drive another shoot the turret and as many people as will fit ride along and shoot there own guns like mad! It is really awesome when a T-rex grabs your car in its mouth and trys to eat it with you in it! Eventually it just throughs the whole lot up into the air! Tons of fun and you can play with your friends! The gameplay is awesome and the grahpics are too, especially at maximum! I defenitly recmomend this game!
7721	1	a	What a blast to play with friends. Some minor annoyances allong the way but for &lt;1$ I reccomend this to any and all people
1725	0	a	This is one of the worst games I have ever played.
7723	1	a	Steam tells me I already own this game. I do not. What gives?
1730	0	a	Its pretty terrible. Not even worth .99 cents.
7725	1	a	It's fun but for a few hours play it doesn't look like a finished game but it's fun and i recommend it if you are looking for a game to kill half an hour with
7727	1	a	This game reminds me of Turuk
7729	1	a	dino's and swag 10/10 would jurassic
1733	0	a	This game is terrible, luckily it is the type of terrible that you can laugh at, do not buy in uless it goes under 2 bucks
7731	1	a	It is the best story game i have ever seen . Play and you wont cry!!
7733	1	a	super fun game but it needs work it has stability issues with random crashes and im geting 40 45 FPS but wan it works super fun i hope they add more guns maps and dinos
7735	1	a	5/10
7737	1	a	Its an amazing game, cheap and so worth the money. I'd definite suggest it, but i will warn you that the graphics could use some work, as well as the frame rate, if they could fix that, this game would be out of this world!
7739	1	a	10/10 would have rocks thrown at me by T-Rexs again
1740	0	a	its still pretty bad
7741	1	a	i played this game before when it was free for 7 days (twice) and now im waiting for a friend to buy it
1742	0	a	What a pile of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ for the third time.
7743	1	a	Played this game before seeing the metacritic review and was surprised to see how low of a score it got. It's actually been a lot more fun than i thought it would be, I've found myself putting hours into it so far and for the price it's worth it. Maybe because I grew up playing turok and loving dinos ( especially Killin um) that makes this game so much fun!
7745	1	a	Awesome game! Soldiers with hi-tech weapons and equipment against Dinos is just soooo cool hahah!! Really fun game, there are a few bugs here and there but It wont be a waste of money if you like First Person Shooter games AND KILLING T-REXes!! Plus the GMs are really active, so if there's any bug and they find out, they'll fix it as soon as possible!!
7747	1	a	Halo+Borderlands+Dinosaurs = The best 80p I have ever spent EVER!
7749	1	a	its not GREAT but i mean you can kill dinosaurs, and face it, how many other video games can you fight dinosaurs in? for .99 i would get it
7751	1	a	For $1 it has better graphics than call of duty and less glitches than battlefield.
7753	1	a	its trash 
7755	1	a	So I tried the free week with this game, its worth a dollar, but I wouldn't pay much more because the dev's are double dipping. Their selling you a game for $14.99, and than charging you for content in game using their in game shop.  Gameplay is really fun, it plays like a really big mod from a game like halflife 2.....its main downfall is lack of players really, thier co-op gameplay is pretty interesting, it feels like a mix of tribes and halflife 2  If you haven't tried this one and are bored, the co-op is worth a try.
7757	1	a	This is a great shoot the dinos game and a lot of fun :)
7759	1	a	cheap and fun
1752	0	a	it is so bad i can even think anymore
1753	0	a	the trailer made this game look like it was going to be a spinoff of ARK: Survival Evolved... but it turned out to be an arena game. At least it was only 50 cents! 
7761	1	a	Favorite game.  10/10  Maximum fun achieved with a group of friends.
7763	1	a	Don't go out and buy that packet of Doritos!   Spend it on this, it's amazing! Be sure you have friends you can play with though. Then you can 1v1, survive hordes of dinosaurs, or 5v5 pvp and even lightsaber duels!
1756	0	a	boring game don't buy.......... :P
7765	1	a	nice coop shooting game, they made the graphics better even.. well worth the euro 
1757	0	a	What am I even doing here?
7767	1	a	It was okay.  More towards a Halo Theme.
7769	1	a	This game's best quality (its price) is also its worst. Nobody knows how to play. Nobody seems to have their sound/monitors on to hear/see the giant 'Objective: 0%' sign in front of their faces. Nor can anyone hear 'protect the generator'. Its fascinating, really. Its like I'm playing this game on Xbox Live.
7771	1	a	omfg,evolve must be like this.There is 0.50$.T-rekt 
1762	0	a	LAG.......GY......A......S......HE.......CK.....
7773	1	a	This game is okay...   16 Hours worth of okay. 
7775	1	a	catchy game!!!
7777	1	a	Upset I bought this game and got nothing in return for them making it free.  Was a good game years ago.  EDIT:  I got helmets..
7779	1	a	This game is an amazing exmple of great developers. A few years ago, this ame was everywhere on steam with the reputaton of one of the worst games to be made and sold on steam. However, the developers instead of doing what a lot of game designers do (abandon their game), they stuck with it. They knew they had an interesting idea and in there, they just neede to improve upon the game, and they did. This game is now one of the most stupid fun games I have. I the developer's new saying, Games cannot fail, only developers can.
1769	0	a	i purchased this on my windows pc that meets the recommendated software and stuff but then when i go in the audio is all f'ed up and i get 1.5 frames per second and you said you fixed it if its not fixed in 1 week (a week because i dont think you did bug fixes in a while and i want a refund if its not working) ill get a refund
1770	0	a	Oh wow, this is free now?  The optimization is complete â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, and motion blur is only noticable on dinos, not the camera.
7781	1	a	Much lag, is a hard game for the lag
7783	1	a	I buy this game and now it's free to play wtf DUDE i want money back please.
7785	1	a	i cant play it seid i had to donlode what i had 
7787	1	a	Paid Â£5 for a free game 5/7
7789	1	a	it's a game that's all :D
7791	1	a	A pretty awesome game I bought a year or two back, back then it awesomely sucked. You could walk through walls and the textures looked like super mario 64. Today me and my friend (that bought the game too) were bored, we thought about this but it just seemed TOO bad. Now, after I tried it , I can say this game is amazing. Its incredible to see how they developed it from a crappy dumb game to an actual good FPS . I was skeptical at first, but this game is ******* awesome. 
7793	1	a	Doesnt work properly.
7795	1	a	  This is a great game for only 2 quarters, it has actiojn, custom characters, good gameplay and nice graphics. This seems like you could charge like $20 for this. I really like the game and i highly reccomend it
7797	1	a	Orion Prelude is a weird game, you either like the game or completely hate it in every way, but for $1 i had to try it out and in my opinion its a decent game. Its not utterly terrible, but its not an awesome game, its an all around fun dino shoot em up. If you have a couple of spare bucks then by all means try the game out, if you like Halo and Dinosaurs then this is your type of game.
7799	1	a	this can all be decribed in one word... superfuntaculasamazeingaddictingbestthingeverdinosaursfulmazeing (pronouced- super funtaculas amazeing addicting best thing ever dinosaursful mazeing) NOW PLAY IT OR DIE OF OLD AGE!!!!1111ONE ONE ONE ONE UNO UNO UNO UNO BEARS BEARS BEARS BEARS  now walk the dinosaur
7801	1	a	I love this game. Its definitely worth the 99 cents. My friends and I like to take the cars and run the dinos over or take the flying ship things and have two people on the sides so 3 of us get air lifted to the next site. Its kind of a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ when one of us falls off and doesnt have the no fall damage perk.
7803	1	a	needs more harambe
1771	0	a	I hate it
1772	0	a	ripped my money
1773	0	a	The frame rate was horible, but its probably just my computer. I dident see an Open World gamemode only a Humans VS Dinos mode but i only played for 3 minuits because it was too laggy for me. the game looks really cool (the open world part) but i cant play it on this computer so i returned it.
7805	1	a	Cool
7807	1	a	Pay .99USD and then 2 weeks latter its free
7809	1	a	when I saw the game I fought it was bad, but when I started to play it. it was so awesome. Give it a TRY.
7811	1	a	Epic graphics, Epic weapons, Epic cars, Epic helicopters! Even better with friends!
1775	0	a	Interesting concept, trying to be a 'survive the wave' type game, I guess like a cross between Halo, Left 4 Dead, with dinosaurs. You can level up your characters to give them better skills, and drive around in various vehicles and buy new weapons to help kill the dinosaurs.   Very dated graphically, but even worse is it's not particularly interesting/barely existant gameplay, AI on the dinosaurs is a bit rubbish, they just run straight at you. Nowhere near as entertaining as the teaser trailer seems to imply. The level ups aren't particularly interesting, and the game maps are poorly designed.   Sure it's only a dollar, but there are a number of Free to Play FPS titles that are more entertaining and a better use of your time. I can only guess that all the positive reviews are trolling.
1776	0	a	this game is as bad as me being alive.
7813	1	a	Very nice game for only 0.49 euro :D
7815	1	a	So many people complain about such a failure the game used to be, just stop complaining and play the game for FUN, and not constantly talk about business within the game. Try it for yourself if you think you'll like it, thats why the price is down.
7817	1	a	I enjoyed this game for the first bit. It was better when there were more than 2 people online.
1779	0	a	One playthrough of 4 minutes and I've already been annoyed by buggy â™¥â™¥â™¥ bots, buggy â™¥â™¥â™¥ enemys and poor excuses for maps. I can handle the severely outdated graphics from a half life 1 engine but god damn this isn't fun.   Halloween Map titled 'Hell' is poorly recycled, with ear â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ sound effects and music in the startingbase. The map consisted of poorly reused flaming pumpkins littered everywhere. The only game changing feature being a incredibly unfair and seriously stupid looking pumpkin boss. This boss however made the game really frustrated by downing our poorly organised squad in the matter of seconds. Reminder that this all happened barely 4 minutes into our experience of the game and im already sick of this game.  Bad game 3/10
7819	1	a	bought it for cards. played it and its fun enough to play for a bit
1780	0	a	This game seemed good, but the graphics suck and it doesn't tell you how to do anything, such as buying new weapons. Also, the dinos horde around you after like 2 rounds and its pretty much impossible to escape that. DO NOT waste you 49 cents on this trash.
7821	1	a	10/10
7823	1	a	Some people hate this game others love it, if you are unable to play it is most likely your computer and/or your intenet connection.
7825	1	a	10/10 This game is pretty good. Also its easy get money to upgrade your weapons and the dinosaur are really  strong yeah. more games the dino are easily died and also i apperciate this game coz it really good and the map  are big and when came on the round 20 or 30 the dinosaur are getting to many. but the best for me the halloween  map 1 coz its pretty hard to kill the all the pumpkin dino. and this game is good. who make this good but the graphic  are not so good but anyway this game good.   ó €ðŸ†…ðŸ…°ðŸ…»ðŸ†…ðŸ…´
1783	0	a	Sure the game is less that a $1. But it's real bad. About an hour of gameplay before you'll get bored of it. I guess you get what you pay for.
7827	1	a	10/10 Orion Prelubbed
7829	1	a	It was $0.60 so I bought it, idk.
7831	1	a	I feel badass fightimg dinosaurs with a lightsaber 10/10
1785	0	a	Worst game ever, but is still alright 
7833	1	a	Great game!!  Addicting and simple. 10/10
7835	1	a	I Saw My Frined Riding a Cockroach-Like Vehicles... While I do 1080 With Helicopter.  'Best 1080-Heli Simulator Ever' - 11/10 IGN
7837	1	a	Spend a little bit of time this holiday season playing this... festive spirit 
7839	1	a	It is a great game, but i am unfortunately no longer able to play it (not enough RAM) which is sad, due to the obvious amount of great content.
7841	1	a	Great and educational.  Now I know the difference between a Stegosaurus and a Triceratops. Sadly my friends have not yet caught on.
1791	0	a	This game has some cool features but I don't think they executed their plans good enough for it to be a good game. Gunplay is terrible on this game, dinosaurs are poorly textured if you ask me. It's always the same, you can go on for ages. A little bit too easy. After all I wouldn't recommend this game, this is also the reason why it became so cheap in the first place. NO.
7843	1	a	It's on sale 24/7 jesus just buy the damn game it's decent for the price
1793	0	a	black screen at launch:(
1794	0	a	0/10
1795	0	a	I haven't played this a lot yet, but so far the experience has been quite terrible. When I play with others the game seem to randomly lag like crazy. Also, monster animations are a travesty. Completely boring combat. I think it's safe to skip this one.  2014.10.02: I've noticed the game has changed its name yet again. It's at least the third time it has changed name. Pathetic.
7845	1	a	Got this game i dont know why steam counts hours wrongly i've played it for 900hours its worth the price its loads of fun even though it has some glitches i bought this 4pack 30times to support the developers :)
7847	1	a	A few things that make this game a damn good multiplayer: 1. You get to play as a T-rex and a Spinosarus 2. You get the same kinda gameplay as Halo and other high tech shooters 3. You get to fight said T-rex and Spino with mechs and tanks 4. Im The Bay Harbor Butcher  And yup those are all the reasons why you need this game
1797	0	a	For 99p this game is well... it's 99p so it's not a waste of money.  But for anything more then Â£2.99 let alone it's original Â£11.99 price tag.  --Cons -Bad graphics -Terrible game machinics -SUPER repetitive -Simply the fact that it's normal price is Â£11.99 is stupid in all -SUPER loud sounds for no reason -Nothing is explained and nothing seems to works correctly -No good sounds for guns or hit markers sounds -Not satisfying in anyway to actually shoot the dino's -Terrible model detail -Lacks FOV slider from what i could see -Buggy (Terrible dino clipping and pretty unbalanced and random)  -Pro's It really was only 99p on SALE. It had good game option
7849	1	a	This game rox
1798	0	a	Played A while Back When It had a free weekend deal thing ( Before this F2P version) It was Okay Then. Now it is bad. I think people who paid for the first game should get a refund. (not including me)
1799	0	a	Why would you buy this? It's awful..  No really it's awful..  GFX are in line with PS2.. This is like one of those bad movies that's so bad it's good, cept nothing is good. Save your $ and buy something else.
1800	0	a	i got this confused with primal carnage... this is not primal carnage.
7851	1	a	-10/10 beats cod and bf4 grafics togeter -its hard to learn the mechanics (like master yi )  -it cost a lot more than killing floor 2  -community filled woth 10 year old kids  -is no fun  -BUY IT
7853	1	a	A mash up between the future and the time before man. Daring conflicts to defend things that aren't really needed to be there. A cheap game and worth a try.   Only problem is, if your computer's crap. You'll face lag.
7855	1	a	Fun for a few hours with your friends, and is incredibly cheap, so I'd buy it just to play for one afternoon
7857	1	a	Good Waist of time, and money...
7859	1	a	looks pretty in 4k and runs well too.
7861	1	a	I dont even know what to say. It's a first person shooter.......against dinosaurs. Its......brilliant.
1804	0	a	Bought this game as a four-pack for some of my friends with amazing computers. NO ONE CAN RUN IT!
1805	0	a	This game, although cheap, is not worth 79p.
1806	0	a	I don't write reviews. But when I do, it's cuz the game sucked.
7863	1	a	10/10 got butt â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ by a T-rex
7865	1	a	Dinosaurs, Guns, Vechicle combat and HUGE MAPS  What more would you want
7867	1	a	I actually expected this game not to be good.. Boy was I wrong. I love this game with a passion. It's better than games I've payed 60 dollars for. It's really fun. &lt;3
1807	0	a	As decent as this game is, it continues to randomly decide that I don't own it, and tells me to re-purchase it. It is in no way worth it's full price, but if you can snatch it for a buck, then you'd might as well.
7869	1	a	Be the only dude with guns to kill dinosaurs  They realize how good I am  Everybody in the server team up on me 1434/10 would play again
1808	0	a	its ok, crashs more than I would like and a lot of server drops.
7871	1	a	Things I got to do on Dino Horde: 1) Mech fight with a Stegosaurus 2) Knife fight with a Triceratops 3) Ride a TRex while shooting smaller dinosaurs from it's back  Why is this game rated so damned low?  Be interesting to see what happens if/when modders get ahold of it?
7873	1	a	10/10 would play for never 
1809	0	a	Boring Buggy Mess
1810	0	a	no server for sea, play at 200 ping
1811	0	a	I cant really play this game right now, until i get an better connection and see why this game is loved much, im not recommending it, personally i found it an bit confusing.
1812	0	a	played this and immediately hated myself for even buying it. 10/10 whould buy again.
1813	0	a	this game â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing sucks. The first thing you see in the game is the main menu. Everything normal right? Well it isn't. As soon as I launched it and saw the main menu I witnessed my graphics card's temperature ramp up from 40Âº to 75ÂºCelsius. I changed my graphics settings to the minimum possible and I saw no difference. My framerate was still locked to 60 and my GPU was still running hot.  That's just one issue: Optimization. Let's get to the next part: Gameplay I haven't tested any gamemodes other than survival so I can't really vote on this one but I got bored almost immediately, using every class and playing in different ways. The weapon system is lacking and sure needs work.  Just don't buy this. Even for 70 cents it's not playable. Don't kill your gpu for a 70cents game.
1814	0	a	Your bullets teleport to the target, this game sucks.
7875	1	a	Still Better Than Jurassic Park  I Like This
1815	0	a	I played 16 minutes of this game and i hated it. The game is very slow and laggy and yet I feel like even though that it is free, I still feel like I want a refund for wasting those 16 minutes of my life. 0/10 would never play again.
7877	1	a	A really addicting game, which with a group of friends and the help of the community can provide endless hours of dino hunting.
7879	1	a	It's certainly fun, however at the moment the current playerbase (very small majority but enough to notice) is either rude or constantly being vulgar towards (usually new) other players. -- hopefully the movement over to Free-to-Play will settle this down since there will be new players almost every day.  Otherwise, I recommend.   NTM it's going F2P, support it while you can.
7881	1	a	fun game i just need friends to play it with :(
7883	1	a	Extremely poorly made game. Devs obviously have no idea what they are doing. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ poor visuals. Utterly disgusting gun sounds.  The game even has an in game cash shop where you can buy hats and looks like a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥!
7885	1	a	i bought 4 copys of this game, might buy another 4..  its so great lol been gifting it to any of my friends willing to try it! it is crazy intense tho i only just got into the game i can see my self loving it for a long time to come
7887	1	a	defenitley worth ninety nine cents. I'd probably still get it for two dollars.
7889	1	a	1$? Must be some cheap little game not worth the time. Right? No, not at ALL. This game is L4D, Killing Floor and all those other survival games with a bigger and better twist! You gain levels similar to KF but you fight not zombie, not mutants but DINOSAURS! Not just cookie cutter dinos either, each and every dino has its quirks, TRex will throw boulders at you and eat you whole. Trikes will charge you and slam the ground. Oh, and don't forget the fliers, they will pick you up and slam your face on the ground! Best 1$ I've ever spent and its gone thorugh a big upgrade since then. I would definitly throw the dollar at it, as it is literally the BEST bang for a buck.
7891	1	a	Great game Transformation!
7893	1	a	Were the devs on an acid trip when making this game? 10/10 would have a good time with my best friends again.
7895	1	a	Sure, pick it up for a buck. It's broken, buggy, surface-functionable, and someohw the only game with a decent damn flamethrower, but it's HILARIOUS to start up a survival game with max $ and max dinos. It's like playing superman with no moral restrictions!
7897	1	a	I think it really is worth more than its cost. Good game
7899	1	a	Have you ever wanted to shotgun a T-rex in the face and fly away with a jetpack only to realise that he has the ability to bite the ground and throw it at you? Oh, you're in for a treat in this one...
7901	1	a	So this game is kinda like Turok. Like it's a dinosaur hunter  But it's also a defend the base, upgrade your weapons, ect. thing. Anyway. So we had a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing tank. Like full on Halo Scorpion. Like this thing was heavy. Missiles and turret and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. And I was a medic so I could also heal us. And I was likewell dinos, I've got the invincible tank of death. GO MATT (my driver)! And then out of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing nowhere a giant â™¥â™¥â™¥ crocodile dinosaur pops out and we're kiting it and then a Stegosaurus rams us into him and then he hits us back into it while it's ramming us and we literally just ALL (dinos and us) fly into the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing air while spinning as the dinos hump us to death and we explode in a firework of tankitude. Laughing so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing hard I can't even. What the hell.  It won't win any awards and realistically speaking it's not out of beta or anything but man. Worth the $1.
7903	1	a	For 89 cents per copy, the game is totally worth it. If only for the ability to shoot dinosaurs- its fantastic. Despite a plethora of bugs, its the best dinosaur fighting game yet. That being said, the developers are pretty marginal as a business and studio. But for the price it is, the game is amazing.
7905	1	a	If you ignore the politics over game assets then this is a fun game!
7907	1	a	Why is this so godamn addicting
7909	1	a	halo x jurassic park= best game â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing ever! make sure u got some friends to play with or skype and have a great time 
7911	1	a	A very under-rated game that with a few friends is a VERY enjoyable experience
7913	1	a	This game is so MLG PRO. People that dislike this game are all n00bs, because the game has de best Graffix ever. Its all about trickscoping the Dinosaurs with Snipar rifles.
7915	1	a	It's â‚¬0.99  You can't lose.
7917	1	a	great idea very simaler to alot of sandbox shooters/consturction games my pc had trouble handeling the screen rate
7919	1	a	Really cool game its like playing Halo with dinosaurs on it
7921	1	a	Guns and dinosaurs? Much wow, such bite, much pain, so hospital, much swag, much death.
7923	1	a	a sick game
7925	1	a	Make sure you watch out for those Spinosaurs, dem motherâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥as ain't just jackin' off in the corner, they'll â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in your cornflakes.
7927	1	a	Very good but too laggy for my pc and can't be played on my mac.Enjoy if you're not stopped like me.
7929	1	a	Great game only if it didn't try to burn a whole through my proccesor.
1819	0	a	should be a free game
1820	0	a	Definately no similarity to the Carnivores series of dino hunting games. Might be fun with friends, but when playing solo, it's nearly impossible to survive more than a few waves of dinosaurs. I hope developers create something similar to the old Carnivores games...this definately isn't even close to a real dino hunting game.
7931	1	a	This game is amazing. I'm woundering how could the metascore for this game is low. Coming from someone who loves playing co-op games, this is really fun. Gets really hectic and hard and it's just the way I like it.  Gameplay is Good Graphics is Pretty Awesome Scenery is Amazing if you take the time to look around  There are some bugs here and there that I found but nothing really significant that will alter the game.  Overall I really enjoy this game and is a blast to play with friends :)
1823	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
7933	1	a	Somehow a game so cheap can be so fun. 100/10 IGN
7935	1	a	I dont even own this
7937	1	a	Halo, with Dinosaurs. Enough Said.
7939	1	a	First off, Metascore is way off. This game is very fun, very fast paced, and can be very challenging. Think Killing Floor, but with dinosaurs. They're fast, deadly, and they are relentless. Raptors, Compys, Tri-tops, T-rexes, as well as many others make an apperance, and that's just the horde survival mode. Level progession system gives you more tricks to keep you interested, while scailing dinos keeps you from plowing through unhindered. Believe me, when you've got a T-rex, stegosaur, and dinosuchus chasing your â™¥â™¥â™¥ down, you'll wish it didn't. :P Highly recomended.
7941	1	a	It a ok game i think it need to look more realistic and have more graphics good job on the way the game work tho keep it up the work .
7943	1	a	Essentially, this game feels like Halo with dinosaurs and funny hats. And it's great!  Even by the time of writing this, I've not played much of it but I've already found it fun to play in. For the money you pay, the game is more than worth it. It's suprisingly solid for such a cheap game - the graphics are good, it has inclement weather and day-night cycles, there are pretty large maps, the AI work decently. It can also be pretty challenging in solo mode, plus it has multiplayer and co-op, so it can be fun for groups to play as well.  It's a well made game, albeit with a few bugs, but for the price you pay, why the hell not?  12/10 would dinosaur
7945	1	a	like halo... but with Dinos 8/8
1827	0	a	it doesn't seem to be running properly. i'm not sure if that's because of my system or an internet related problem, but its too frustrating to hold my attention.
1828	0	a	Barely playable.
1829	0	a	this game is very annoying everytime i try to play theres a computer type person who circles me the entire time i try to play. very annoying!!!
7947	1	a	fun PURE FUN the objetive is survive dinos or fight in team death matchs super fun glitchy yet fun i have ther way to say it 7/10 somtimes youll get fusterrated but thats ok just keep killing enemys i recomend survivle for people that like fight a horde of what evers but you survive grab objectives and rune back or even drive back cant wait to play some more :D
7949	1	a	LOl there is one question..... why is this game so demanding????????? i play chrysis 3 on medium settings with better fps then this game with low
1831	0	a	This game is the embodiment of an awkward child you don't want to sit next to at lunch.
1832	0	a	Just, not finished game...
7951	1	a	I AM CRAZY TO THE GAME
7953	1	a	I want a death match where a team is made â€‹â€‹up of dinosaurs
1837	0	a	This game is so broken it hurts.The dinosaurs glitch around,the animation is garbage,the game runs like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on my high-end PC on the lowest setting,and the fps keeps dropping and increasing every five seconds.Really don't buy it.Buy ORION instead.It's better in every way
1838	0	a	I expected a lot after watching the trailer for this game, but they still havenÂ´t fixed a LOT of bugs, they shouldÂ´ve started development of this game from the bottom. There is missing full controller support and itÂ´s just not as good as I thought it would be.  4,5/10
7955	1	a	I find this game extremely fun. Not sure why, but it is. Maybe it's because it looks like L4D2. I mean, the objective is to fight with the horde. Back to topic, i recommend it, you'll find a lot of hours of fun here. I like the vehicles a lot. I found only one little problem in steering some of them, but it's not something upsetting. The idea is so cool. I wait for new upgrades.
1840	0	a	It has potential but its not fully realized the game's menus are absolutely horriffic and the chat menu is annoying as hell in game. It seems like a cool idea shooting dinosaurs but needs more polish. ALOT more polish.
7957	1	a	Trash publishers; good game though
1843	0	a	Not only has this game changed its name 3 TIMES. But its hasnt changed anything in the game itself, infact with the new 'and improved'''''' Prelude update, NOTHING is different from what have i found. I paid 15 dollors for this. Now its less then one..... Lie honestly. i dont have many hours in this game because it honestly sucks, like seriously. It looks like it was made on the unity engine, The gameplay is terrible, and the new 'horde Bots' that theyve added are reeally just random characters FULLY decked out with all the pay to win gear, plus, they dont even get attacked barely, It would be as if the dinos dont see them and come straight torwards the player. The screenshots are nothing like the game itself, it shows itself as a fun and enjoyable game to play with friends. WHen in reality it goes as follows ' Hey dude you get Orion?' ' No it looks like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥' ' so what play it with me, il even buy it for you' I buy it for a bud, we play and after 20 minutes we give up, because its just that bad of a game. Multiplayers a drag, the guns are basic. The guns look all futuristic and that they shoot lazers..... No.... Its just bullets. No lazers or any of the sorts. The stuff that you buy in game affect the game in absolutely no way possible, There just ' Hey look at me i look cool i spent 5 bucks in game, Wait no one plays this game.' ALSO WHEN YOU HAVE IN PURCHASE ITEMS, AND THE LOWEST PRICED ITEM IS MORE THEN THE ACTUAL GAME ITSELF. IS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING. RIDICULOUS. Dont buy the damn game, after this review I uninstalling as i just spent 10 minutes in the game. NOTHING IS CHANGED. just the name, for the third time. The meta score is right, it sucks. Even the loading images are the exact same. the class pictures are the exact same. the dinos are the exact same. the maps are the same. The AI is still the same. It is still the same â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ass game it was a few months back when i regret paying like 15 or whatever bucks for a game. Stay away from this. Seriously, unless your absolutely bored and u have less then 2 GB of storage to mess with, along with a mouse that if you can click 16 shots in less then 1 milli then your absolutely â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed in online PVP matches, run by the little kids who think there cool Because they host a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ listen server off there parents internet. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, im out
7959	1	a	This game is one of the worst games I've ever played. The only two good things about this game are: 1. It actually opens, 2. It has an FOV slider. This game is an awful waste of time made by a bunch of lazy â™¥â™¥â™¥ devs who can't make a proper game. -5/5
1844	0	a	Wait times are too long to get into the fun. You join a game, have to watch other people play for 5+ minutes before any fun starts.
7961	1	a	:)
7963	1	a	only when its on sale
7965	1	a	Its a cool game i would buy it even tho its $1 but really fun game to play with other players co-op game 
7967	1	a	I am able to pursue my dreams as a dinosaur hunter. I also punched a T-rex in the face. My life goals are complete.
7969	1	a	take jurassic park into your own disgusting neckbearded hands
7971	1	a	Very addicting!
7973	1	a	Yes, worth the laugh for 99 cents.
7975	1	a	dinosaurs for a dollar what not to buy
7977	1	a	Despite the metacritic's score, I found myself coming back to this game over and over. While I still use the same strategy and class, it hasn't stopped the game from being fun yet. My only complain at this point is the difficulty in hitting flying dinousaurs, as they sometimes get stuck in strange places.  Apart from that, it's a really fun game to play with friends, or with others online.
7979	1	a	GREAT GAME!!!! GOT IT FOR ME AND MY FRIEND AND ITS GREAT!!! (Is 40p on summer sale) I WOULD PAY Â£10 FOR THIS GAME!!!
7981	1	a	This is cool. U did gr8 m8 20/10.
1849	0	a	To simply put....Stay far away from this game if you have really, really poor server connectivity or a bad gaming rig or don't have a gaming CPU to begin with first off 7,000+ are playing this game and that's because they have GREAT server connectivty these dev's want you to create your own lobby and sit on your butt for about 2 hours or so until it's filled up but that will never happened do to a laggy, or buggy interface during finding online matches   I really want to love this game but the fact that it doesn't have it's own 'sever check program' and what that means is that the game if it has online mode should've checked the player's online/internet connections to see if his or her rig is up to playing and or connecting to a game or even play it for that matter the fact that it may cause spazzing during loading time and has the main menu glitched into the loading screen causing THAT to spazz out....what that really means basically is that the game 'can not connect to host'   If you don't have the patience to wait hours and hours on end for people to join your sever then don't play this game, delete it and play something else with better server connectivity and a very next to nill buggy interface.  Lastly two things:  1. Don't trust Metacritic because that review was from a different game honestly the game by checking out the screen shots feels like a 8/10 for some but for me? a 7/10   2.Don't trust the reviews by the gamers for this game what they failed to mention is that this game will be great to those who have a really, really good gaming rig with best online and internet connections and really, really bad to those who don't have a great gaming rig
7983	1	a	My thoughts: At first this game was unplayable because all of the lag but I fixed it after playing the game I just have to say that it's 'ok' not the best game ever but it's ok this game is worth 99 cents.  About the game: This game is a shooter you go wave to wave shooting and pistol whipping the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out of Dinosaurs theres a bunch of modes. King of the Hill, TDM, Free for all and survival ETC.  Pros and Cons: Pros.  You get to pistol whip Dinosaurs.  Dinosaurs!  Mother ******* Dinosaurs!!!!  It has Coop  Cons.  A lot of lag on some platforms: how to fix it   http://steamcommunity.com//app/104900/discussions/0/864976115810928810/   It would of been better if it had a story.  Anyways I hope this helped you have a nice day :)
7985	1	a	fun game and now its one doller i couldent resist :3 thx for changing the price.
7987	1	a	i love every thing in this game i givce it a rate of 19/10
1850	0	a	the game seems like its an amazing concept. but thats it. after 5 minutes in game i fell through the world 4 times, failed to buy guns, was thrown into a server with no explanation on the controls and was eaten by a dino twice. after which i figured out how to use my mic by going into options and was explained to by another newb how to buy guns. the next time i respawned i couldnt move or use in game chat. i havnt seen a game this buggy since i played CS 1.6 with a ping of 800 on dial up. the developers are just trying to boom support for their kickstarter which i hope they fail because they dont desserve to be in business with a game this buggy. i fear to even consider what it was 'before' they 'fixed it'   0 stars
7989	1	a	i have never seen a company care so much about there players. they pump out updates every almost every month and there completely free. This game also has some of the best co-op of any game i have played. Keep up the good work guys!
7991	1	a	Drove my friend off a cliff while driving and survived. He's dead.  Watched someone use their final breaths to crawl towards the broken generator and I cheered him on. He's dead.  Chased some poor guy as a spinosaurus, caught him, and grabbed him with my mouth. He's dead.  Played Vital (PvPvE) against some guy and he was mauled by dinosaurs. He's dead.  I'm all alone.
7993	1	a	IT S COOOLLL AS HEC
7995	1	a	Game is actually really good. Would buy again.
7997	1	a	Too little time played, but I sure did enjoy what I have played. Don't mind any issues in the slightest, other than the disconnection my net caused. gunplay is fun, killing dnos = fun, price? not an issue in the slightest. 'Tis a must play with friends.
7999	1	a	Move over Turok, there's a new batch of Dino slayers!
8001	1	a	0.72 euro , preaty cheap for a game like this play cs:go one day , get this game , shoot some dinos , have some fun for free !
8003	1	a	The video game equivilant of the dinosaur toy you buy from the 99 cent store as a kid: you can tell it's cheaply made, but you love playing with it anyway. Also, it was only 99 cents.
8005	1	a	Have fun with your friends or the bugs or both.
8007	1	a	they changed the name 3 times now.
8009	1	a	i mean it was $.99
8011	1	a	Punched a rude T-Rex then a Pterodactyl tried to show me this really cool cloud and he dropped me, overall a very good looking and feeling game. A solid title worth picking up.
8013	1	a	Laggy and crashed during my first game but seems fun.
8015	1	a	good except I CANT CHANGE THE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING CONTROLS PROPERLY. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING FIX IT. IM TRYING TO CHANGE SCORE BOARD TO SELECT BUT IT CHANGES JUMP TO SELECT
8017	1	a	make a version of it for ps4 it will be awsome 
8019	1	a	This is a very interesting game. I've only played it for a little, but I think it could be interesting. However, right now it seems a little rote. Perhaps the more I get into it, the more I will like it.
8021	1	a	one of the only games where im better than everyone else one of the only games that cost 99 cents and i ask why a game where you can get chewed up though a wall  34/16
8023	1	a	A bit buggy at this stage, but at its heart a bundle of mindless fun!
8025	1	a	Charged into a pack of dinos with no regret, Didnt die 8/8
8027	1	a	Good game. Offers lot and lots of fun, even more with friends. Fun concept and easy to learn. High variety of guns, you can play with ( obviously not with dinosaurs ). I found it more enjoyable in co-op mode, not playing as dinosaurs that much. Again you have to decide on your own playstyle. Recommended!
8029	1	a	THIS IS THE MOST ADDICTIVE GAME ON SURFACE OF EARTH 
8031	1	a	this game is fun and very addicting.
8033	1	a	absoolutsly awsome, i would highly reccomend this to anyone who likes action packked FPS games
8035	1	a	GET THIS GAME!!!! I have played this game for 100+ hrs over 2 accounts, lvl 29 and 39. and its only a dollar, so u dont have to spend forever saving up you money if you are younger.
8037	1	a	For $.99, 10/10,000 BC/AC (In what year is this again?).     While flying I killed a flying dinosaur, then I landed to kil some walking dinosaurs, and then a person from the other came to sabotage our reactor/core/whatever it is and f***ed our team (but I don't care, I killed taht b***ard anyways). [/spiler]  
1852	0	a	Controls are bad, visuals are bad, options menu does not save changes.
8039	1	a	This game truley cannot make up its mind what it wants to be. One moment it was Orion: Dino Horde. Now it's Prelude It once cost Â£1.35, then it was free for a while, not it costs Â£0.79. Once it had a leveling system instead of a ingame real-money store.  Overall this is only good if played with friends.
1853	0	a	Eh this game gets boring after 30 minutes when bullet sponging, repetitive layouts, and terrible connections plague your experience.   &gt;inb4 gr8 b8 m8
8041	1	a	  DOPE game for 99 cents....
8043	1	a	i hate this 
8045	1	a	Cool game but I'm preety sure you need high graphic PC to play this game but it's really fun had fun shooting Dnosaurs and teaming up with people to kill and last a long time against fighting dinosaurs.
1856	0	a	One of the worst games I have ever played. No instructions on how to get started or what you're supposed to do.
1857	0	a	Very buggy, alot of glitches, fun for 10 mins... 
1858	0	a	not a very good shooter. Good if you have no money and a subpar computer .
8047	1	a	holy cow the uninstall button really works best 1 dollar ive ever spent 
8049	1	a	This game will leave no jimmy unrustled
8051	1	a	meh. better than cod i guess
1862	0	a	Even though it has a gamemode where you can play as a dino but its not that fun deinosuchus hardly works for me i cant kill anyone I hate that my fav dino raptor only has one attack never choose raptor if your playing with pro players I dont even try to play as compy ptera the only dinos that are good spino,trex,triceratops,stegasaurus i didnt even remeber the rest of the dinos if there are more even for the price its at i still dont like it
1863	0	a	I do not recommend this game considering it was gifted to me by a friend to play early, now they want more money again. Something wrong there. Not worth it as far as im concerned.
1864	0	a	Although it is much better then Dino Beatdown, it is a poor excuse for a game still.
1865	0	a	Horrible game with horrible graphics... Also there are a lot of bugs for example sometimes its not showing that the gun firing effect while I m firing... Also graphic optimization is horrible as well and there is not goal on playing any map. This game do not deserve to play. Do not buy it and do not make some useless pc programmers rich...
1866	0	a	This is Bad
8053	1	a	Get it on sell I bought a 4 pack for $3 me and friends love it so much
8055	1	a	this is not a good game i have to say. but if you have a day off at work. maybe spend your spare time playing this.
8057	1	a	this game is great!!!!!!
1868	0	a	Frame are complete â™¥â™¥â™¥, and it's not because of my PC. Worst optimized game of all time, uninstalled
8059	1	a	Drive around in a jeep with an auto-aiming gun, firing at extinct dinosaurs with high technology.  I'd play more if it wasn't extremely laggy for me. Fun game, though. Cheap, too.  Play it. 
8061	1	a	GET THIS GAME...just do it.....its â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing nice
8063	1	a	10/10  best game ever  because DINOSAURs
8065	1	a	If you combine Call of Duty Zombies, Halo, Turok, and Jurassic Park, you get this game.
8067	1	a	I shot a T-rex in the â™¥â™¥â™¥ with a bow and arrow and it died. 10/10
1870	0	a	i was tricked by all the good reviews into downloading orion,its nothing new and not worth ur time,terrible bad grahics,bad font,game screen looks dated and biggest downer was tht as i started playing i thought' what the heck?' im running faster than dinos and its almost like a arcade shooter or a shooting range hitting carboard like dionos,so u can hate me for putting it like this...but u dont want to do this - go play on ur mobile!
1871	0	a	I dont like this game and I dont recommend it to anyone,you will have to pay it for 6 days,you just shoot in this game it has no point,so if you like first person shooter games without a story this is for you,but if you dont you shouldnt play it.It should be free to play,because its to stupid to pay for it.
8069	1	a	Definitely worth $.99. You can probably get it for less if you trade cards for it on the trading forum.
8071	1	a	dirt cheap for dirt gameplay
8073	1	a	I â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING RECAMEND THIS GAME 
8075	1	a	I RECOMMEND THIS GAME! or mybe not? hehe
8077	1	a	This idea should be picked up by a more capable developer, updated with better graphics and gameplay tweaks and could become like L4D with dinos
1872	0	a	Heyyo,  I bought it because the devs continuously build onto the game and that's cool and all... but it's still sadly broken when it comes to the AI... lots of the AI can be easily defeated by just strafing in a circle and it'll never catch you... so with easy to defeat AI? I can't recommend this game. There's better Swarm games on PC like Hard Reset.
8079	1	a	some pretty fun co-op for a buck.  
8081	1	a	Ok, I finally figured out how to rig my settings up correctly so Mr.Thriller-Rex doesn't find me, so lets try this again. WITH FEELING!  Pros: -Dinosaurs -Vechicles -Jetpacks -Gameplay thats fun enough to make it worth a try -A.I. isn't just going to run after the objective or you, they actually have somewhat of a plan. -Did I mention a large selection of large maps for PvP, witch incorporate all the above elements into the gameplay? Cons: -All the guns feel the same -So do all the dinos -Not exactly understanding why my controler will randomly stop responding, but ok. -When you buy one thing from the shop, you get another. Verdict: Overall, if you want a fun game about shooting smartISH dinosaurs, with futuristic guns and jetpacks, this is your game, while I didn't get to play coop, I would probably reccomend playing though it with friends, and not random internet â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s.  Best of luck to the developers, Luigifan.
8083	1	a	this game is awesome enough said
8085	1	a	Kinda like if Turok meets Halo meets Counter Strike. For 99 cents it's really fun. Even though the graphics are on Halo's level for some reason this game cooks the hell out of my video card.
8087	1	a	Good fun with friends, though there are some annoying bugs every so often, it can still be enjoyable.  Got kinda boring though.
8089	1	a	Drove off a cliff with a bunch of people       10/10 would drive off a cliff again
8091	1	a	i played it... But, The Animations of the Dinosaurs and the People are sucky. cool and awesome graphics though! R-Really Awesome Grapics!
8093	1	a	Use to be free for a weekend costed 4.99 (or 0.99) then now Free to play...         NO MONEY WASTED! :D
8095	1	a	I love this game! Its one of few games that I own that I not only like, but I am pretty good at as well. You really can not beat the price of only $0.99 which I am not sure if that is what I got it for or not because I do not remember when I bought it, but its worth more then a dollar! Most times when I play I host the game, and most times I stream it via  Stream.AWFordJr.net  which I use D3DGear to stream to Youtube. If you like FPS type games, then you may like this one. Its well worth the low price its going for. So get it!
8097	1	a	Nothing can go wrong with dinosaurs!
1873	0	a	Altough its cheap its not bad, but its not too good, lets go to plus and minus  +Its cheap +Dinosaur +Good graphic +Good control  -It doesnt have any player online -Its single mode suck -Bad AI  Maybe you should buy the new Orion game, its on Kickstarter
8099	1	a	Everyone needs to buy this game!!! It's amazing, and should be sold for much more then $1!!!
1874	0	a	4/10 it's not worth the $15
1875	0	a	never let me go into a game i just looked at people and things run by
1876	0	a	This game has good gameplay, but the idea of having to WAIT in order to respond, is simply ANNOYING; I'd rather be the dinosaurs and hunt the soldiers, instead!  But no; the GAME DOESN'T LET YOU CHOOSE TO BE ONE! Not in Survival mode, at least. This game is a decent deal for 3 bucks, because it currenty acts like cheap overrated shovelware. So, for effort, the designs and music are great, but waiting for SEVERAL MINUTES makes the only fun of waiting, being a 'troll' by making cheesy puns and jokes. If the game doesn't allow you to do that, then I'd be having much more fun, by playing Xbox 360 'kinect' games; as long as the controls work okay, and the gameplay is ACTUALLY FUN!  My advice? You can probably find better USED games for less, from certain 'bargain' stores; heck, I even found a copy of Freedom Force, (which still has the code, on the back of the CD case) for only 1 dollar! Heck, if I can't find a patch to make it work on Windows 8, I'd probably have to buy it on Steam, so it WILL MORE LIKELY WORK!
8101	1	a	cool
8103	1	a	Best Graphics ever. Possibly the greatest dinosaur shooter ever. - 1/10
8105	1	a	Fun and Hard meat Boy stile but chaotic wih friends
8107	1	a	Bought a lightsaber went to play Star Was with dinosaur  Dinousaur didnt like Star Wars Killed dinousar 10/10 will fight over Star Wars again  P.S RIP Dinosaur 2015-2015
8109	1	a	great game love it good gun good game play maps and cars so i can give it a 10/10
8111	1	a	an combo of starwars, dirsic park, tf2 and lots of fun
8113	1	a	ORION is a great game, I love it so much!
8115	1	a	HOLY !@#$ THIS GAME IS THE GREATEST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED. DISREGARD THE METASCORE!
8117	1	a	This game is so silly. Play it with your friends without any expectations and laugh at how bad everything is. Hint: grab a car and run over veloceraptors and watch their bodies fly into the stratosphere. I'd avoid ramming a triceritops, i did it once and my car exploded, jettisoning me into a mountain and my friend into another time zone, dead on impact.   Buy this game for a dollar and enjoy a few hours of fun with your friends, then never play it again.
8119	1	a	Pretty fun game if you like facing off against waves of enemies.
8121	1	a	Kill the dinos
8123	1	a	Its a dollar, buy the freaking game. Its pretty damn good. Honestly, I think its worth 10-15, but im cheap. If you're cheap aswell, but it for a dollar.
8125	1	a	Fun, addictive game.  Arcade style shooter (think Counter Strike) with Halo fascia, and damn it's fun!   Graphics 7/10 Gameplay 8/10 Sound 5/10 (I've heard the music in other games, hmm..) Addictive 10/10  I can't wait to try out Team Deathmatch modes too (I've only played 2 'wave' type gamemodes, MANY different game modes)
8127	1	a	I highly recomend this game. there are dino's to kill people! bring this game back from the dead! as in there isnt many players nowadays.
8129	1	a	Halo 2 meets dinosaur survival.  One of the trailers quotes this game is a mix of Halo, Jurassic Park, and Killing floor, Id say thats spot on. I think this is the most fun game Ive played in a while. I reccomend everybody play this game for a few hours. Its just pure joy, and its not to intensive. Im playing on a laptop and it still runs very smoothly.  10/10 play this game
8131	1	a	Don't let the Metacritic review turn you away. This game is really good, and deserves another chance. Through months of vigorous patching and updating, this game is lots of fun to play. Really feels like Halo with dinosaurs plus mechs.
8133	1	a	Very fun game . PVP , PVE and shoot shoot and shoot :) Nice upgrades , nice weapons . I love it . And Nice Dino's :)
8135	1	a	-Installed the game because my friend said it wasn't as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ as it was before  -Joined a game  -Halloweene themed  -Fight a couple of dinosaurs and having fun  -Boss battle  -Friend says it's a T rex  -Same friend suddently starts screaming and yelling â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ we can't understand  -Keeps repeating 'PUMPKIN!! PUMPKIIIIN!!!''  -Turns out boss is a giant pumpkin that throws you in the air  -Pretty intense battle with jetpacks and a lot of reviving  -Boss has still almost full health  -Teleports on a mountain and rains giant fireball on us, killing us.  10/10 Spooked out of my mind.  (Actual game is pretty fun tho if you get with friends. Kind of a shame that the whole character customization is a cash grab)
1882	0	a	PLS, Make me a favor, and don t buy this game, it s a poor â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
1883	0	a	The game is bad. Probably one of the worst games I've played in many years. 0.5/10.
1884	0	a	This is madness
8137	1	a	- Disclaimer I am here for the gameplay, not the Legal issues, the amount of games that have had copy right strikes are deeply loved and no-one cared.  -Review Time. I actually enjoyed my time on this game, especially for a 1$ game, it is fun, character is customisable, aswell as being able to play as a dino.
8139	1	a	when people ask me if i like to play orion: prelude i look at them and say 'I CAN'T STOP TOP TOP TOP TOP TOP TOP TOP' DOO DOO DA DOO DOO
8141	1	a	After seeing the price and the screen shots and game videos I knew I had to get it. Gameplay is great. Although I do wish their were more waves with bigger/more bad â™¥â™¥â™¥ dinos. My only critic of the game is that it is extremely hardware intensive. Most games i play make my computer temperature around 40 at most but this game made my GPU almost at 56 at some moments.
8143	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game. Cant customise jack â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and the dinosaurs look like something my cat â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out.  -69/100 wouldnt play again.  Even for 99c it was â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing horrible.
8145	1	a	Rammed my friends tractor with a tank. Plenty of laughs for 1â‚¬.
1887	0	a	Its like a vegas wedding that you cant remember
1888	0	a	Selling tf2 key for a hat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
8147	1	a	i would recomd ths game only if they put some new guns and maps but otherwise a fun and time killing game
8149	1	a	its bad, you should try it
8151	1	a	mlg seal of approval
8153	1	a	SO this game from customer side, looks little boring. But. this game is much diffrent when you play. its AWESOME !!! kill dinos, buy weapons (but you will lose them after last wave). i dont know why its too cheap. but its cool.
8155	1	a	This game has everything. Amazing glitches, laser rifles, and dinasaurs!  MUST BUY!  IGN - 10/5! GameReviews - 11/10! FunHaus - 9/11
8157	1	a	Very fun to play with friends you will have lots of laughs but playing alone can be sort of dull.
8159	1	a	Very good action-fps game, with motion blur and all that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥'s.
8161	1	a	Amazing. Halo and TF2 mashed up with dinosaures and bathed in the madness of borderlands. Cheap houres of riduculousness .
1890	0	a	There's a reason its a dollar...
8163	1	a	This is my preferated game.
8165	1	a	Halo + COD + Destiny + Battlefield + Dino Day = Orion: Prelude  This game is AWESOME and I'm wondering why is so cheap?
8167	1	a	My friend got picked up by a pterodactyl. Then the pterodactyl dropped him and he got headbutted by a triceratops. 11/10
8169	1	a	U like killin dinos? Well i certainly did, funny game, though wont be fun to play solo or neither to long at a time.
8171	1	a	it didn't give me cancer. 5 stars.
8173	1	a	perfect game 10/10 easily best game ive played it has the fps feeling of call of duty but the strahtegy of chest. realist dinos its almost 3D horror action romance comdey all u can ask for packed into one game with famouse voice acter mr NOLAN NORTH!!!! vouce acts dinos and humans! at the same time! specialy desinged weapons for dinosores called dino guns you use ur dino hands to shhot people. grpahics like skyrim, action like mw2 and fun like league of legends get urs today and get urself a free dino gun in the mail.
1891	0	a	No wonder this game didn't cost more than a dollar.
8175	1	a	OMG LIKE LOL WTF ONLY 3 DOLLARS FOR 4 PACK AND 99 CENTS FOR GAME UNTIL FEB. 27!!AJSDKFOPIHPi!ohpou!UHP!!!!oihpOIHASPOIHIH!!!!!POIASDHFPAISHDFPOIDSHFPIHpoIFHpsdFpDFIHZSPODFIH!!!  
8177	1	a	Dinosaurs to sxc for me
1892	0	a	All i can say is the game is too repetitive...
1893	0	a	Polish a turd it's still a turd. Wouldn't recommend for anybody.
1894	0	a	I read some reviews of this game and heard it was really bad, so of course I bought a 4-pack to play it with some friends and laugh at the badness of it. I wish I didn't waste â‚¬ 2.24 on it, it's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing horrendous, don't â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing buy this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game, it's not worth it even with the 51% discount right now.
1895	0	a	I died of a brain tumor playing this game. Support my ghost by not playing this game.
8179	1	a	The Metascore is really bad, but the game is so amazing its like halo but with dinosaurs ! Who wouldn't want that?
8181	1	a	it is so fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:)
8183	1	a	I saw the meta-score. It was 36. I get demo. I fight T-Rex in a Tank. I buy :)  Tbh i have never seen a game transform so well. other than cod. ghosts was amazing am i right jk im go die now  9 out of 11 would crash jet into twin baracks
1899	0	a	Is boring!
8185	1	a	Well firstly,I thought is S**t,then i bought it and it was really cool,i do recommend this game
1900	0	a	BLAM THIS PEICE OF SH!T
8187	1	a	A great game to play with friends, sure it may be clunky but all in all a hilarious shooter where you can fight dinosaurs with mechs and tanks etc.
8189	1	a	the amazing prelude to Guardians of Orion, this game will give you endless hours of fun with friends online. definetely take advantage of the price, this game is worth well over the dollar you paid for it!
8191	1	a	Greatest game ever produced, the greatness is so epic, I am not worthy enough player to purchase such a godly title.
8193	1	a	The physics are terrible- in a good way!  The gameplay is exploitable- in a good way! The premise is stupid- in a good way!  A game so bad it's good. Dinosaurs are over the top and fun to fight. The visuals apart from the dinos are almost ripped from Halo (Which could be good or bad depending on if you like that) and has vehicles almost ripped from the same source (which once again, could be good or bad depnding on your opinon of the vehicles from that game) It took the jetpack, medigun, and stealth from Tribes and a gameplay very reminiscient of Killing Floor to create a game that is so unoriginal it is completely original. Too much fun not to play.
1901	0	a	THIS STUCK DAM T-REX CAME AND ATE ME 
8195	1	a	I may only have 0.2 hours on this game but let me tell you that with it being a mix of like Halo and a dinosaur game it is that good. rate 10/10 best $1.50 on the sale ive ever spent
8197	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
8199	1	a	Fun game, best one of the best Co-Op FPS game since Killing floor. Love the concept the maps are big and easy to navigate. Graphics are bad, some stuttering when switching guns and muddy texture. The reason I reccomend this game is it is CHEAP and easily playable with a group of friends. Would like to see the player count go up to 8 or 10 due to maps being very large.
1903	0	a	I paid $20.00 USD, for this. Now it's $1.00 USD, I feel ripped off honestly. I bought the 4 pack. So this is not putting me in a happy mood. i'm glad I can buy it for friends now, but change your price back to twenty. Or are you just that cheap, like the Thai Hooker down the street! - Crimson Bolt.
1904	0	a	This game for me was too laggy. Can't join or play. Even if I could, the gameplay wasn't as fun as one may think. Sorry, but this game honestly isn't worth it.
8201	1	a	10/10
8203	1	a	bought it at full price GIVE ME SPECIAL STUFF
8205	1	a	it was a good game with freinds but alone its boring
8207	1	a	This game lacks polish, support and a good PvP multiplayer. However, i think it has very strong coop/singleplayer gamemodes, most notably Survival and Conquest. These two modes (even with all the mentioned issues) are entertaining enough to keep me playing. There are vehicles, epic guns and battles on big maps with changing weather and time of day. The difficulty can vary from really easy to extremely hard, so there will always be a challenge. The game has so much potential, yet it is wasted by the developers, but I still like it.  The game provides a great PvE experience. I recommend the game for people who prefer PvE and don't mind minor bugs. 8/10
8209	1	a	i like the game. i bought this for like 20$ and it came with 3 gift copies. wife and i played it alot had a good time the only complaint i have is that you need a good graphics card to play.
8211	1	a	awesome game love it
1906	0	a	Horrid.  You are much better off with Primal Carnage and Dino D-Day.   1/10
8213	1	a	ORION Dino Hord is a firstperson shooter/survivel game.You need to protect a genarotor while surviving you gest it hordes and hordes of dinosaurs. The way you look is like halo and you acn bye cooler armor to make your person look better. in all this game is a 7/10 and maby not worth evry peni but a good game!
8215	1	a	I got into a knife fight with a Triceratops and lost. 10/10 would play again.
8217	1	a	Great game with dinosaur fighting and good stratergy :D
1907	0	a	Controller support is there but cant invert Y axis. So that's useless to me. Most servers are locked. I got STUCK on a building in first 3 mins of game play. Graphics look like original xbox.

8219	1	a	Cheap and fun.
8221	1	a	Flipping the bird while running over dinosaurs with tank -9000/10
8223	1	a	Fun game:  Pros: Great combat lots of action good voice chat for teamwork lots of maps lots of dinosaurs  Cons: only 1 air veichle only medics can revive the quickest game mode (if you do decent) is oven an hour. The longest is 4+ hours very bad port (it says press B (xbox B icon) to go back but you actualy have to press ESC and other stuff like this)  Overall I would give this a 6/10 because it is a fun time killer and game to play with freinds, I pearsonaly liked the game cube version better but then again 8 years ago that game was great for its time.
8225	1	a	what the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is this game and why do i like it so much   10/10
1909	0	a	unoptimized garbage runs terrible on beast machines
8227	1	a	Such a stupidly glorious game. Played with a group of guys at magfest and we just tried to kill triceratops with buggies  10/10 would allahu akbar into dinosaurs again.
8229	1	a	This game is fun. Do you like fun? well, if you do enjoy fun, get this game. It is fun.   For â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s sake IT'S 99 MOTHER â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING GOD DAMN CENTS YOU PIECES OF â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
8231	1	a	Nice game
8233	1	a	Had a great fun in this game and will be playing more during next lans. So good lan game
8235	1	a	contrary to what people believe on metacritic  its not a bad game anymore. ANYMORE. but this game needs alot more players to really become one of the scene. which I believe it has the potential to.
1912	0	a	unoptimized garbage runs terrible on beast machines
1913	0	a	Well you watch new vids, you see the price and look for reviews. You can imagine this game would be nice to play. Even for just few mins of fun... but no.  Fighting dinosaurs is funny one time. 5 sci-fi soldiers per map against waves of A.I controled dinos. Between waves , you have to purchase gear, each kill give you cash you can spend in your base (starting point). But devs didnt though i would be nice to bring the 2 damm buildings needed to buy weapons and upgrades close each other... Indeed when you have 50 secs after each waves, you loose nearly 20 secs to reach thoses two buildings... annoying.  Some weapons are nice, but others are just useless, in general weapons doesn't have this 'feeling' of power you can have in most shooters.   Vehicles are dispached on the map, the interresting thing is the ability of support class (3 classes at the end) to repair vehicles. The unlimited amount of vehicles wich is quite annoying in games today was replaced here by the need to spare them. Good idea ! The problem is that vehicles are horrible to handle. One guy told me 'this is halo's driving style'. Here this is worst ! You will scream against dinos who will knock back your vehicle especially the mech wich is a scam. Vehicles weapons overheat. The Hud overheat indicator is not appropirate and will stuck you many times during battles.  For foot fighting; you will hate this game when a big dino will chase you and, in an act of courage, you will take him down by yourself and die like a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ because one minor dino blocked you on the way of your retreat. Because you can't go trough them. In this game, movements are not realistics like third person view where your torso is stuck as if you had a rake in the ... hum... you got the idea.  But he most annoying: crashes. For many years i never had a game such impossible to stop ! After 100 mins of playing the game crashed. It it was just impossible to stop the executable ! Amazing... especially when you succeed by closing your session, again you launch the game and... nothing. The game launched apparently steam recognize it but... nothing. No executable, no icon, nothing.  When you enter the game you see a banner where devs are planning to launch a kickstarter for a new game with AGAIN sci-fi soldiers vs dinos BUT this time in an open world. Hey Devs ! If you wanted some cash for your kickstarter you got 1 buck but you won't get anything else from me !  Note they dared to add some kind of item shop in the game (with their scandalous promoting vids !) . I didn't really browse it but francly they've boasted a bit too much of their game to think people will buy more than this title.  If you wan't to slaughter dinos (and humans) go on primal carnage wich much more interresting.
1914	0	a	Honestly, after a second ''remake'' and content update...it is still as buggy, cheap and boring as before. Seriously dissapointing and a waste of money.  I highly respect the devs for their devotion and the love they put in the game...but it is not enough.
8237	1	a	For only $1 you can't go wrong if you don't enjoy it you havn't realy lost anything but I love it best to buy it for all your friends to play along aswell makes the game even better. So much potential still to come!
8239	1	a	Few bugs there and here. Little bad frames, but you kill dinosaurs.  I give it T-Rex/10
8241	1	a	Blows up car with grenade Car doesnt blow up Car bounces straight up I lose it out of my sight I miss my car.  10/10 would miss again.  Edit: After 40 years i still could not find car. I am thinking of starting a campaign to find my car again, please help me on this quest. Possibly in orion prelude 2.
8243	1	a	I found it a very fun co-op fps well worth the money, and I played it for hours on end.
8245	1	a	I love this game even if my computer can barely handle all the awesomness, its like I'm choking on minor lag multikills with the adreneline weapons (my comp's fault not the game). I give this game a solid 10.
8247	1	a	Savage Dino and Reptile killing simulator 2016    Best game..
1918	0	a	Purchased this game long ago and asked for a refund as it was THAT bad.   There are so many bad things to say about it:  1) Gameplay feels weightless and unsatisfying  2) Multiplayer is lifeless and unabsorbing  3) It feels pointless, unrewarding and repetitive 4) There is no demo, which means people waste their money buying the full version, which is dreadful
8249	1	a	Ad a campaing
8251	1	a	The best firest P shooter ever made and whith DINOS
8253	1	a	This game is definitely worth the price of a few cents. If played with friends it is extremely fun, however that won't cover the fact that the animations in the game were sloppy and jittery, the graphics were low poly, and the hud was too transparent. Yet despite all of that I really enjoyed playing the game definite reccomend.  TL;DR: Buy it to play with friends, it is like dino zombie survival.
8255	1	a	  â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ graphics but is funish
1920	0	a	Played this game for not even 20 minutes, I got into a game at everything at medium and I get constant stutters, my team mates teleport everywhere and I had no f_uck1ng idea where any dinosaurs were cause I crashed a car into a f_uck1ng wall and died.  This game is honest â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, I would've played with friends, but they refunded it, before it became f2p
8257	1	a	This â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game is always a damned dollar. just â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing buy it. It's really â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ but it's fun to play with friends. Or give the dollar to a homeless man. Whatever
8259	1	a	Gud game. Trailer sold me on game. Best 2k19. Worse than ark. Buy ark instead.
1922	0	a	Bad gameplay, horrible graphics, even worse optimization (I have 2x the reccomended specs!) And the lensflares are horrible, they burn my eyes!
8261	1	a	i wish if u can be a dino it will be so awesome
8263	1	a	This game is fun. Do you like fun? well, if you do enjoy fun, get this game. It is fun.   For â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s sake IT'S 99 MOTHER â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING GOD DAMN CENTS YOU PIECES OF â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.

1925	0	a	I want to like this game, so bad. but inbetween a terrible player base and constantly losing connection ive yet to play a full game from start to finish. the 7 hours i played is not alot relatively speaking, but â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, youd think youd at least play 1 game all the way through. Other players leave you to die, steal your vehicle leaving you stranded and take your equipment after you die. Not to mention the constant series of kicks ive gotton after simply going down once after i join 4 or 5 waves in.  If by chance these things dont frustrate you and you manage to hurdle past these issues, the connectivity is so wonky youll disconnect in the midst of a fire fight.  This game has a great premise and wonderful execution, iand i desperatley want to like it, but god damn is it hard. maybe my experience is unique to me alone but thats my review
1926	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t.. It doesn't ever want to work whenever i start it up. It loads for a second then stops working when i try to play solo. It also doesn't let me join any online games. 0/10 no joke.... i paid money for a game that should be F2P since it doesn't work 
1927	0	a	its currently $0.99 i would reccomend you spend that dollar on a burger from mcdonalds...yes this game is that bad
1928	0	a	Buggy as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Couldn't play as a result. You better off with a free flash game.
1929	0	a	Trash. but â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it was 99 cents
1930	0	a	Most terrible piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on the internet ever.
1931	0	a	A big steamy 75 cents worth turd. There's nothing else to be said.
1932	0	a	Don't buy this, no one plays
1933	0	a	Overall clunky and unbalanced. There is a lot wrong with this game that I really don't feel like making a big review about it. It's just not worth spending any money on.
8267	1	a	cool and good co-op 
1934	0	a	I hated the first ten minutes of it.

1942	0	a	Haha, it's even funny. It's REALLY bad! I don't think i have words to describe it.  Good thing it was only $1.
8291	1	a	This game is OK, but its not someting you HAVE to have. It has a lot of bugs, but it is playable. Though, IF you consider getting this game, do not pay more then $2-$3 for it. I played it during the FREE week when it was $3, but it did nothing for me. A week is more then enough of that game to get bored of it. The META score is a bit harsh, but it justified.
8293	1	a	I found it a very fun co-op fps well worth the money, and I played it for hours on end.
8295	1	a	what the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is this game and why do i like it so much   10/10
8297	1	a	Nice game
8299	1	a	  Holy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that hurt to play.
8301	1	a	DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY LOL!
8303	1	a	METASCOREâ“¡ is LYING !!!  Insanely fun coop survival / shooter game. Kill Dinos with bunch of guns and vehicles. ( Also lots of achievements for Achievement Hunters )
8305	1	a	it's A pretty addicting game! it is still a really rough diamond,but it has potential! Just needs a little more optimizing and better voice acting and this will be an outstanding game Hope it gets more updates!
8307	1	a	is good game, but is not quality game
8309	1	a	It's cheap, runs smoothly, has servers running, some always populated, can play alone with bots to learn the game, LOTS of game modes, looks pretty awesome, sounds are good to okay, BIG maps, everything is customizable, has full X360 for Windows pad support, you can remap all controls on mouse+KB, or controller, did I meantion it's cheap??? A very under-rated game IMO, if more people played it, it could become popular, these guys did a good job with this game, My only gripe is 'some of the dinos are SO tiny/hard to shoot, but mele works okay on them (maybe they're baby dinos)'... everything else about this game save a few sound effects is awesome!

1946	0	a	Okay, so. Basicly your a dude who fights humans and waves of dinos. Pretty cool right? Wrong I didnt like how it was, there was nobody to play with and it was really boring.
1947	0	a	Not worth 20$. When I play Orion:Dino Horde, I think I'm playing Halo but I'm slaughtering hulking dinosaurs instead of convenants. Overall, the graphics aren't too bad, but the AI for the dinosaurs are a bit messy.
8313	1	a	Jurassic, futuristic FPS multiplayer. Plus, its free (now.. those dang developers). Could disappoint but again, its free. Just stop reading reviews ad give it a go. Oh and by the way, you can get a jetpack.
8315	1	a	Maybe its not so bad if you turn all your graphics to low so you can't see the garbage you're playing.
8317	1	a	there is no blood on the ground, only at walls 
1949	0	a	Not worth 20$. When I play Orion:Dino Horde, I think I'm playing Halo but I'm slaughtering hulking dinosaurs instead of convenants. Overall, the graphics aren't too bad, but the AI for the dinosaurs are a bit messy.
8319	1	a	Such a stupidly glorious game. Played with a group of guys at magfest and we just tried to kill triceratops with buggies  10/10 would allahu akbar into dinosaurs again.
1950	0	a	Listen Ok I really enjoyed this game it was pretty fun but not for the price I got it for you guys got it for only a buck do you know what i got it for 15 dollars the only reason i wouldnt recommend this game is i didnt get my money back if i get my $14 back I will recommend it
1951	0	a	wad the hell am i doing with my life
8321	1	a	Really fun for a bit, but I get very bored very fast, which is not the best of things to happen in a game.
8323	1	a	0 hours played but hey its 1$ and it has guns and dinosaurs thats a winner in my book  will release a full extensive review on this game
8325	1	a	Astonishing gameplay - Extreme fun and proves a challenge.
8327	1	a	I wasn't expecting much  I am very happy I bought this, and in fact purchased a copy for my buddy in Mexico! I ried Dino D Day and it left a bad taste in my mouth, so I checked this one out and I LOVE IT! Yes it's a bit low budget, but it's not a bad game by any means. It has elements of a good RPGFPS that has some obvious influence, and a lot of dinosaurs to shoot in the face. Getting in a tank and blowing a trex out of the sky is awesome, but the cool part was that the tank wasn't over powered in defense and was quickly blown to pieces by a triceratops, which I was sad and satisfied at the same time with.  Overall there are enough guns to make some choices for, the classes are cool, and has a great value to it as well. I had to tweak some settings due to slow mouse tracking, seemed kind of laggy/choppy in the way the aim moved but tweaking some things, it's now working fine. I've not tried the PVP out yet but overall found this to be worth the dollar, and then some.  I'd love to see the devs add more to this game, and for the community to keep it strong. Loads of rooms online, very active, very fun!
1952	0	a	This game is really not that well developed. The graphics are very good but the game is not optimized well at all. I only get about 50-60 fps on max settings with a gtx 760. I can run more demanding games past 100 fps. Also not to mention th animations for the dino's are very cheap looking and in all I really wouldn't reccomend this game. The servers are not hosted by the game developers which means someone will be hosting the game through their internet so if they lag the whole game does and almost every game I joined everybodys ping was through the roof.
8329	1	a	Wow 'Worst Game Ever' to 'Wow i love this game!' I totaly love this it is amazing!
8331	1	a	One of the fun and funniest game that comes with good price
8333	1	a	Very Good Game,Amazing Multiplayer. 8/10
8335	1	a	really fun free game. i enjoy just slaughtering all those helpless dinosaurs. enjoyed this game over full priced games.
8337	1	a	Wtf i payed 1 Euro for this game and now it's free???? Give me my M4A4 Griffin back plz  (still a good game)
8339	1	a	I Paid for this game when it was first released and now it's free to play. No Bonuses for buying it either.. Thanks....  Game play is good though.
8341	1	a	Running with a knife looks like you are the duck from the swiggity swooty gif. Double jump makes your screen glitch. Dying crashes your game Its like Halo if Halo was not fun and had dinosaurs.  Overall a fun time for the price, buy it now before price increases. 7.8/10 Too much rain animation on my visor.
8343	1	a	Meh, it's a game made for kids. You can shoot dinasaurs for a little bit but not much depth or polish to the game.
8345	1	a	Shoot dinosaurs in the face for $.99.    What? Buy the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game!
8347	1	a	It's a game with Dinosaurs in it. Why are you still reading this? WHY HAVEN'T YOU BOUGHT IT YET? LET ME SAY AGAIN, IT. HAS. DINOSAURS. IN. IT.
8349	1	a	You can shoot dinosaurs with tanks and machine guns. 11/10 - IGN
8351	1	a	Good gameplay. Wish graphics looked a bit more realistic. 7/10
8353	1	a	Not bad for a 2$ game
8355	1	a	Great game, many great, fun, and scary times. first time i played. i cried, spinosauros are scary. played with friends. we all cried because T-Rex is much harder than spinosaurus. playing more than N00B difficulty makes it very boring tho. overall great game 8.7/10  My metascore would be 87/100
1957	0	a	there is a reason this masterpiece is only a dollar.
8357	1	a	10/10 like work  thanks :yay: good! all Rush buy  all -off summer sale
1958	0	a	10/10 would be eaten by a tyrannosaur again
8359	1	a	One of the fun and funniest game that comes with good price
8361	1	a	I cried, I laughed, I shot a dinosaur in the bum. 11/10 best accounting software Ive ever used! Makes my taxes fun to do every year! Rawr!
1959	0	a	The game itself has/had good promise. When I first saw it I thought 'Jetpacks and dinosaurs? Count me in!' But the game turned out to be decent fun, but with glaring issues. It is very poorly optimized. It was impossible to aim right to hit anything, and yet things still died. IDFK. The devs made promises (like fixing the technical issues, which is why I even played for more than 4 hours) which they either decided not to or never intended to keep, quickly turning this game (which has gone through 3 not very major iterations) into abandonware shortly after the prelude 'content' update. (It was really just a few logos, like train simulator 15/16/17/etc.) and then moving on to orion. Of course, I didnt realize any of this before putting down my cash for both games. (I'm a sucker for $0.49 deals). The second game is also crap, though i won't go into that here. Long story short, don't give these guys your money. Even for a $1.  TL;DR STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM THIS GAME AND ITS DEVS.
8363	1	a	This is a fun game and for 1 dollar you can't beat it.
8365	1	a	best, good game, idled for cards

1965	0	a	unoptimized garbage runs terrible on beast machines
8373	1	a	I LOVE THIS GAME AND THIS CO-OP OMG! CATCH A GAMERA OMG LOVE THIS GAME ^~^ ^3^ ;-; ===================================================================
8375	1	a	Because this is our heritage... if it wasn't for our forefathers, the dedicated shock troopers they were, Dinosaurs would have taken over the universe...   This is a piece of history and I demand it be recognized! -MURICA!
8377	1	a	uhh i got this for free but now it's gone why?
8379	1	a	PLEASE NOTE: IF YOU CAN'T RESPECT THE OPINIONS OF OTHERS, THEN DON'T READ THIS. THIS IS PURELY BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE WITH THE GAME, IF YOU DON'T AGREE, THEN GO WRITE A HATE SONG ABOUT ME AND UPLOAD IT ON YOUTUBE.  This game was not worth your time, and you shouldn't buy it Although this game advertizes for having immersive co-op, co-op is barely present. The only 'co-op' this game has to offer is swarming the larger groups with dinosaurs stiff as wooden boards, while your team shoots all the dinosaurs down, except the pterodactyls, which are so small that they're impossible to hit, while some random guy is screaming at people over voicechat to come repair his vehicle. The AI in this game is not that great either. Enemies often circle around in the tall grass a couple of times and then charge straight at whoever is closest, regardless of wether a wall, a tree or even another dinosaur is in the way, not to say it matters, since most dinosaurs clip through each other. If you play as a dinosaur, the game then gets even worse. you spawn somewhere close to the players, half of the time, without a map, arrow or anything else to guide you to the so called 'survivors' forcing you to search for them. It doesn't help that the maps are HUGE, and everyone is mashed into a claustrophobic mass of crudely animated violence. If you don't have a somewhat beefy computer, this game will run with less than 15 fps, even on the lowest graphics, so take note of that, especially with the motion blur, where you won't be able to see 5 feet in front of yourself.  pros: -has some weapon variety. -better optimized for pc than Toukiden Kiwami.  cons: -awful co-op. -does not run that well on slower computers. -although it does offer multiple gamemodes, they all feel the same. -Developers went as far as to change the name once, just to get it to the steam frontpage.    final words: if you really REALLY don't have any other games to play, and have a lot of free time at your hands, then go outside and get a life.  I certainly hope this review helped you save your money, if not, then come back and write a review like I did, to help others see what lies beyond the wall  This is what i would have said back at Orion: dino horde. these people completely turned the game around, and is now enjoyable, and fun to play. they fixed many of the bugs, most of the stiffness, and did a ton of tweaks to the performance.  true final words: Buy, but don't wait for a sale. these guys who made the game spent a LOT of time improving the game little by little, until it finally became good, plus they made co-op a lot better too. If you bought this game previously, I say give it a second chance.  That's all, praise the sun.
8381	1	a	A co-op shooter where you fight waves of Dinosaurs. Very similar to Killing Floor. Would murder waves of extinct animals again.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v44GiUhVAbw 
8383	1	a	I really love this game. here's why:  Pros: -ok to great graphics -wide selection of guns -wide selection of upgrades -LOTS of dinosaurs -pvp modes, which are really fun -meh to ok servers: in other words, there are lots of servers with people, lots without people -dinosaurs,dinosaurs...who doesn't like them?   Cons: -It is kind of buggy, sometimes you cant use your aibility,others you can't DO anything -dinos running away when you are down, and need to kill one to survive. It's just annoying -bug with infinite health dinos  and that's pretty much it.. so go buy this, it's totally worth $1. It should honestly cost about $100 though.. yes, it's that good.   EDIT: they fixed all the bugs, mnade the game look and play even better, and after the horrible mess it was in 2012, it improved to the greatest game of 2015. Think of your favorite FPS, and multiply it by a billiion. That's what ytou get from $0.99 Orion Prelude (or for you long term players such as me, orion: Dino horde). The game has improved so much it's unbelievable!
1966	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ old dino shooter. cheap but gets boring quick
8385	1	a	Awesome Co-Op game to be played, the [0.99 USD] is totally worth the price. Its 1 Dollar US but 2 Dollars in AUS. Same price as a Candy Bar.

1969	0	a	Was looking forward to this game, game crashed after I pressed button 'B' to buy weapons in a game. Man, I sure love this game.
1970	0	a	This game has a potentially fun concept, but confusing graphics, awkward maps, stuttering dinos, and a host of other issues leave much to be desired. Perhaps future updates will change this review, but as of now, I can think of way better ways to spend time shooting stuff.
8389	1	a	This game is fun, little old kind graphics but worth giving try, specially its just 1$ , for sure NOT waist of money !

8391	1	a	I cant believe my eyes, this game is so wrong, ITS JUST SO RIGHT!

1977	0	a	If you major in psychology than Spiral Game Studios is perfect subject for Dunning-Kruger effect study. So it might be worth your time - it's fun to watch, to read forums and to laugh at devs. Self-confidence boosted by vocal minority. Isn't that cute?  The game itself is not worth mentioning. It's your typical 'rip-off-everything' made by complete amateurs. Yeap, you may play it and even enjoy it... if you have absolutely no taste, your IQ is lower than 50, you are 6yo and it's the only game you have at the same time. And even in that case you'll be bored in a half an hour. So buy yourself some iOS game instead.

1979	0	a	The developer of this game stole assets from the CoD series!
1980	0	a	Fun for a laugh but considerably less polished than co-op shooters like Payday and L4D.
1981	0	a	Well, the system requirments are way off. I have a AMD Phenom 2 970 Quard @ 2.2GHZ 4 GB DDR3 and an ATI HD 4250 with 256 MB. When I checked the specs on this, my system should have been able to play this. All settings to low ... still lags very badley.
1982	0	a	Once upon a time I gave this game some praise and said it was janky but fun! Unfortunately, then all the content dried up, a microtransaction shop was added (along with the maps cut in the last pre-Horde patch), and the game effectively turned into a just-fixed-enough-to-be-dull game instead of a hilarious drinking game.  If you buy this, only buy this with friends who know what they're getting into, and who will certainly play with you. Also have fun waiting for a sale, because the devs have sat out the past two major Steam sales for... â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ knows why.
1983	0	a	The developer keeps re-releasing the same game under different names, and they steal assets from other games and then try to paint themselves as the victims. Plus, the developer goes around on Internet forums threatening to sue people for talking about those two facts. Complete scum.
8395	1	a	Best game ever. Graphics and Gameplay: A++++ Sound: A++++ I love this game and i put more hours with this game than CSGO. 10/10

2010	0	a	Don't bother. Much better titles have been done on the same premise.
2011	0	a	No so laggy, crashes a ton, and when a dino attacks from behind you can't even turn and shoot. Not worth it and please i want a refund!!!!
2012	0	a	The Metascore is misleading? This game got a user score of 3.9, yeah, misleading; sure;)
2013	0	a	This game is so much fun for a couple of hours. When you play it with friends. Then it loses it's luster. It's got a nice premise, but it is also repetitive. As I'm writing this, I suppose they're adding more content. That should do the game a world of good. The graphics are nice, but the controls need some work. I have an Xbox 360 controller that didn't seem to work with this game. It was still alot of fun, but I can't imagine playing this alone.
2014	0	a	After spending half an hour going through lobbies and never entering a single game, I uninstalled.
2015	0	a	This game is basically Call of Duty Ghosts: Extinction mode or Black Ops: Zombies mode - but no way near as good in terms of quality; and with Dinosaurs.  Only buy if cheap.
8401	1	a	Cool Idea 
2016	0	a	Running from giant dinosaur. Dinosaur gets stuck on a small rock step. Free kill easy wins gg no re topkeklol. 10/10 would not recommend.
2017	0	a	99 Cents huh? why not.... thats what i thought. ok this game might be good but my problem is that the game just doesnt work, i can have this on the lowest GFX and get 20 fps i can have this on the highset GFX and get 20 fps...do you know why? i dont. i can run games like bioshock and blackops 2 just fine bioshock at 60 on max gfx and blackops 2 at 40-50 fps med GFX. so why cant i run this game? i just want to know because this (to me) doesnt look better than blackops 2 or bioshock. and for that reason a solid NO will be in order. (its the steam summer sale go get a good game like system shock 2... i wish i had)
8403	1	a	ORION: Prelude is a game that I recommend because: - it is a method to banish boredom - it has a good price - it is indie - it has dinosaurs - it has adventure - it has co-op mode - it has trading cards  Enjoy!
8405	1	a	Orion: Dino Horde is a game. The game is alright and the content is pretty solid for what it is, decent weapons and class choices to be made, vehicles and game modes to keep the title fresh. With variations to difficulties and XP to farm for class progression this game has good reason for returns.  Edit: Game is called Prelude becasue dodgy COO types.  Has achievements and badge progress. I like this game, and like what it has to offer, the people behind it though....
8407	1	a	YUP! THIS IS A DINOSAURS GAME!
2022	0	a	trash. theif. don't play
2023	0	a	I'm quite annoyed that I keep getting this game re-gifted to me by my friends. First, it was Dino: Beatdown, which was totally ordinary and mod-like in presentation (and not a good one at that), second I was gifted Dino: Horde, and I wasn't even sure if it was a different game. Finally, I was gifted this version, and while better than the other two, I'd hardly call a new engine a few more features a new game. It feels like there is always a new attempt at getting this game finished, it gets some updates, and then promptly disappears under a new title.   Would like to see some sort of 'finality' (and I mean real finality, not just stop updating it or re-releasing it as something else). The concept is great, but the delivery is constantly flawed, which is a real shame.   
8409	1	a	this game is amazing and fun 10/10
2025	0	a	What a terrible game
2026	0	a	I want my dollar back! Enough said.
2027	0	a	Worst game ive played in a while what a waste of my life.
2028	0	a	i have played some crap games befor but this takes the cake, i wouldent even bother downloading it for free. i dont know were to begin it sucks that bad, maps are huge for a single dude walking the weird way you got to get money to actualy have more than a pistol, its like the point of the game is to bore you with tantalizing upgrades you could possobly get, that are not very good any way then the game ends or you all die and you got to start all over again. i would rather play warhammer spacemarine that crashes 50% of the time then play this game.
2029	0	a	...Wow, that was pretty bad.  This is what took place In the ten minutes I could handle playing.  I was placed in the tropics with no back story. After a couple of minutes to prepare, a horde of Luddite Velociraptors started â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing up the generator 100 meters from camp (I think it's a camp). Once you kill them, another swarm of dinos appear with the same vendetta. That's it...if that sounds like a good time, give it a try. It's free for a week.
2030	0	a	THIS GAME IS SO â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ IT DOESNT EVEN DESERVE TO BE BOUGHT FOR A DOLLAR  ARE YOU â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ME
2031	0	a	i have just four words to say DON'T BUY THIS GAME!
8411	1	a	Really,kind of good game
2037	0	a	this is literally the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥iest game ive ever played in my entire life. Its just plagued with so many issues and the developers must have had their heads up their â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥ to implement some of the gayest things ive ever seen in this game. All in all i give this game a -20/10 and sentance the developers to go suck a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and learn how to make an enjoyable game
8413	1	a	Ok, where to start from...1st Marto(Baba Qga) has told me to write this review.   This game has made to uninstall it at 2 hours gameplay. This game made me to be afraid of dinos. This game has made me to murder people with a spoon because i imagine them as dinos.  11/10  Strongly reccomend this game if u want to uninstall it at 2 hours gametime  Piece
2045	0	a	Good mechanics and graphics for a 1 dollar game, but too unpolished and unplayable.
2046	0	a	One of the worst games I've played.
2047	0	a	Less fun than drowning.
2048	0	a	Ewww...  While this Game may look like fun on first sight it has some serious flaws.  It runs on Unreal Engine 3 utilising Direct3D9 as it's API and is just on default not utilising Hardware Great which only gets strengthened by 3rdparty developers(T-REK 'Industries?') not having heard of Texture Porting and proper VRAM allocation , speaking of the game not even trying to really using those juicy amounts of Virtual Ram your Dedicated GPU has. yea those 4/8 GB lying idle while your frames Keep dipping is how a game is ment to be played.  Second Concern . As above already the game is already not doing too well regarding performance right out of the bat , want to hear a bigger joke. the choice of closed source PhysX as Physics Engine by a 3rdParty Company which already struggles with making peoples hardware work in their game.  Mediocre choice of Graphic options : Oh boy . yea as you launch it you'll find yourself in the Menu with . uhm pardon . A few Options to change. Such as Textures , 'FX Quality'.. the usual.  what it doesn't give you is anything you'd want .: Sound Quality? , cap your FPS at anything else than your monitors refresh rate , half of it or uncapped. set custom Qualitys for Anything included in any setting. Bloodsplatsize, WeatherFX threshold , decal quality , disable Weather FX , lightning , shadowmapsize and so on.   I think as far as this goes we're done with how well the game is ment to be played. pun intended.  Gameplaytime bois.  -Static weaponmodels. -Stiff Animations. -Imported Gametextures are lowresolution and high on performanceloss. -The Charactersounds seem to be recorded in a bathtub with the cheapest ebay mic and directly put into SV and rendered into 192kb/s. -Ai (to be fair even making a semi adequate one is really hard) is outright stupid , gets stuck in defaulted maps which i would ignore if not for the fact that they're made in a fixed loadout and not fully RNG and has weird hitboxes. -Maps are buggy , you can jump seemingly out of bounds , get stuck in random spots , reach spots where you're invisible to the ai , Flat Design , poor detail , and is one large map rendered on launch which explains the poor fps on some machines( Conquest). -Characters and lines are plain and boring , while fun at first you'll get bored of it after a few hours. and maybe annoyed by it after a while longer.  I do not recommend the purchase , it might be fun for an evening or two but it just fails to offer replayablity. in addition to that it runs like Crysis on a post Millenium PC. ( Having no PhysX hardware support that is.)

8417	1	a	fockin' bought this game for fockin' 15$ and now it's f2p  fockin' â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ i tell ya  FOCK Me fockin' british  
2060	0	a	I honestly really like this game, its fun, fast paced and easy to get into.  Its actually really fun but the reason why I made this review a bad one, is that the community of this game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing garbage. I have died in the past because I got crushed by my own CAR! So you know what this tard does, he doesn't revive me, he grabs my car and drives away and leaves me. Mind you, this is not the only time this had happened. There have been many times where I sometimes got crushed by my own vehicles. Now I understand if you are against a T-Rex at point blank range and you can't revive me, but sometimes, there are like 4 people attacking the same damn dinosaur and while I'm dying at the back, they will ignore you and leave you to die and lose all your gear. Another problem is the vehicles. Let's say for example I go do the objective, and once I finish it, I get a helicopter or a jeep as a reward, but then some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ charges in while I'm killing dinosaurs, preparing to get into my car and this guy just takes it and drives away and leaves me a with a T-Rex while I'm heavily wounded.  So here is my overview of the review. The gameplay is awesome and really fun and the graphics are pretty good for a one euro game but the community is absolutely terrible, they will leave you even when they are in no harm at all, people who done nothing for the team will charge and steal all your vehicles.  5/10
2061	0	a	A long time ago, my mother made me go outside all the time. I did not want to, as I believed that I could do something better with my life, such as play quality games. And, I had heard the odds of cancer forming within my poor little body if I obeyed her wishes. I did not want to get cancer. During the times I refused to go outside because of these two factors, I looked far and wide for quality gameplay. Low and behold, Steam was found. I downloaded Steam. An eager chap I was, wishing to play all the fun and popular games. I avoided cancer at all costs. I did not smoke, I did not partake in any nefarious activities, and most importantly, I did not go outside. It appears my efforts were wasted anyways, as this game gave me cancer.
2062	0	a	I haven't bought this game and I can write a review? That is pretty dumb.
2063	0	a	Rewrite time! Although this game is, most definately, fixed from its Dino Horde days, the game is quite poorly optimised. I bought the four pack, and gave one copy away so I could play it with a friend. He managed to play it. I was getting 15 FPS on the title screen, and I was worried about the gameplay, so I went and set the graphical settings as low as they get. Me and my friend create and join a game. 8-10 FPS. Although I am not playing on a gaming PC, this could run Farming Simulator 15 (Not in my library I have it on disc) at a stable 40 FPS on medium graphics, Arkham asylum at 50 FPS on medium, PS2 at 20 FPS on low, and PVZ Garden warfare (Yes, I use origin as well as steam, hate if you will) at 30 on medium.   EXPLAIN YOUR OPTIMISATION PROBLEMS PLEASE!  My friend, who does have a custom built gaming PC that can run PS2 on ultra high at 200 FPS, said that the game was easily broken (A ton of glitching dinosaurs) and the vehicles were too OP.   I'm sure it can be fun... but it does not work well. 2/10.
2064	0	a	This game is a terrible joke.
8419	1	a	This game is really cheap will be one of the greatest/funniest experiences for you if you have a friend with you on call, and just play for fun, the mechanics are ridiculously funny when you're in a good mood.  Play this game with a friend, preferably on call, that makes this the most fun.
8421	1	a	I no-scoped a T-Rex in the face.  10/10 Would 1v1 T-Rex again.
2068	0	a	Want my money back since now it's free and I paid like $4 for this game.
2069	0	a	Even free it's not worth it.
2070	0	a	Total waste of money, i could feed a whole african village with that 1$. The game runs like complete **** and looks like a bad version of halo and borderlands together.
2071	0	a	Complete and utter trash. The guns are unbalnced, exploits every where, hackers,and servers with exp boost.
8423	1	a	THis is one the worst FPS I have ever seen 
2075	0	a	this game is horrible ,dont buy it your wasting your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ money!

2103	0	a	not really dinosaurs

2119	0	a	Dino Horde pfft...... *whispers is not goood because i hvent played it* 
2120	0	a	i dont know how this has any good reviews save the change
2121	0	a	The fist few hours are cool but, when you get into it, it's boring.
2122	0	a	Im removing this from my account, check steam support to do that. No refund was possible, besides therea a reason its a dollar game. Don't buy this.  Also awful company, they steal other peoples work.
2123	0	a	Its Free WTF and i and have my money back :/ this steam  
8441	1	a	I had some nice survival rounds with a bunch of people over the course of multiple maps. Sort of Killing Floor with dinos. Roaming some canyons with a four- or five-man party - on foot, inside tanks, mechs or other vehicles - killing a big T-Rex and seeing his ragdoll-body fall down in slow-motion was a pretty epic and satisfying feeling. The general gameplay looks and feels a bit awkward at times, animations and gunplay aren't as 'tight' and polished as one may know from AAA shooters, but it's decent enough, the Unreal engine keeps it together and gives it an alright look.   People say there are day-1-bugs still left, only obvious bug I've seen so far was a teammate getting stuck in a tree by flying dino tossing him in there. You can surely get some fun hours out if it - for 1,00 EUR a steal, basically. I still need to try the other co-op and PvP modes. Open world with day/night cycle and loot sounds interesting, just as beating up humans with playable dinos. And it seems the game is still being actively developed/enhanced.   The very bad metacritic rating scared me a bit, but it is apparently related to a much earlier, now-gone phase of the game, in it's current state it probably deserves better. No idea how many players will be left after the current free period. I hope it won't die too soon, it looks interesting. And I hope the netcode is stable enough. My first attempts of joining other people's games were greeted either with timeouts or lags. Then I found a good lobby and sticked to it until the host closed it down. It seems to be working with peer-to-peer mechanics; unfortunately - dedicated servers would make it easier to avoid such issues. Peer-to-peer games often trouble me.

8451	1	a	Why is this game rated 36/100??? its like frigging halo meets jurassic park, with upgrades, special abilities, and giant â™¥â™¥â™¥ dinosaurs trying to eat you and your base! SWEET GAME! Multiplayer is the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥!

2157	0	a	this game sucks
2158	0	a	broken, and unfinished feeling, i really dont reccommend this game
2159	0	a	I can't even turn the res below 1000x32 and i have a bad pc.
8467	1	a	This is amazing....
8469	1	a	I just impulse bought two copies of this game: one for me and one for a friend. This game is....   INCREDIBLE!!!!!! I love this game, it's awesome! You can punch dinosaurs in the f**king face! I bought a bow, the jetpack augment, and I stood on a rock popping raptor heads like Macklemore pops tags. After that I got a walking turret and killed 10 raptors with one rocket. This game is so damn fun, I'd have paid $5 if I knew this game was so good (but I don't have that much so don't make me)  I just wish I could get a cape. I love capes. By the way, the only paid stuff (real money shizz) is vanity items from what I can tell. This game is definitely worth your moneys.
2164	0	a	Had to buy ths game and then they make it free to play what a rip off this game is loads of fun but the dev have a long history of changing this games name to avoid the fact that they steal assets from other games.... but is a fun game once you get past the scumbagry of the devs 10/10 would get ripped off again
8471	1	a	this game is good it came out on my birthday
2165	0	a	Game has great potential but it's spoiled by the mass amounts of lag and uncomfortable experience.
2166	0	a	stephan hawking runs better than this game.
2167	0	a	Its cool if you have so much lag and cant tell whats going on and just laught with your friends but when the lag is gone...
8473	1	a	UPDATE: SO the devs have been constantly updating the game , After years of release , There are virtually no BUGS , and content is added on a regular basis!   The game is very enjoyable fast paced and good for having a great time with friends or your girl friend .   DO NOT listen to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥uckers from call of duty negging this game , they are mindless idiots with less than 0.1 hours in this game and just 1 line reviews , it shows their worth and class and that they are clearly negging the game because their daddy company activision was involved with an issue with orion devs  Regarding that issue , Anyone who has half a brain would know working with online contractors often results in palgarism , its not the teams fault , upon notification they pulled out the content that was offensive to activision , Hell activision bullied them before even notifying them  So all in all what did i learn ? THIS IS A GREAT GAME , but most gamers are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s that like sucking â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ of big corporations that charge them 60$ each year instead of honest developers that provide free updates years after realease .   This is the reality , buy and judge for your self. ---------------- old review   SPAWNED WITH MY GF  DINO EATS MY GF   10/10 WOULD PLAY GET RID OF MY GF SIMULATOR AGAIN
2173	0	a	dimond in the ruff mabey in 2001
2174	0	a	Terrible game play. Terrible graphics. Terrible music that makes want to vomit. All for 1 dollor.... If you want a game that will last for about 2 hours, go ahead. But if you though that this will be anywhere near decent, I'd suggest just pass
8475	1	a	-buy game for $0.74 or something -why not seems cool -install game -try to play solo -i have no â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing clue what how  -get â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed -okay why not try to just find an open server -join game with 4 others -everyone has vehicles and obviously knows what they're doing -get kicked within 30 seconds -loading screen tip says  -'if you come across a new player, help them out' -ggwp  from what i've seen of it though, it looks cool with a nice concept. i'll try to play more of it so i don't get shamed again.  try again later/10
8477	1	a	ORION: Prelude is a $1.20 (that being NZD) thrill for a weekend. After a few years (and occasional name changes) this game is pretty good for a while. It's as the description tells clearly a Humans vs. Dinosaurs game and aimed at a multiplayer audience. ORION is best played multiplayer with friends but does have it's issues such as a fairly small community. With a variety of vehicles, weapons, dinosaurs and maps it does have a sense of replayability. However this is let down with technical flaws like a terrible framerate and poor optimization and the feeling of it just getting old fairly easily.   The game has it's flaws, however is still easily one of the best games you can buy (better than Bad Rats anyway) when you have a spare dollar in your wallet. It won't satisfy you for long and the multiplayer may be dead, but it's still worthy of being a 'blue moon' multiplayer game if you have friends that are willing to play it.   Pros  - Fun for a while. - Cheap - Has a good variety.  Cons  - Unoptimized - Small Multiplayer Community  Rating: 6.5/10  P.S BreakfastBae leave this Review alone.
8479	1	a	You can ride the backs of T-Rexes while stabbing them with a sci-fi knife. Pretty hard but you'll learn it.
2179	0	a	I tried it for 20 minutes and I want my 20 minutes back.  I wanted to give it a chance to see if it felt like a good shooter. It doesn't feel like a good anything. Even if it was a real piece of human excrement, it wouldn't feel like a good piece of human excrement. The weapons have ridiculous recoil, but sound more like stapleguns. I could forgive the late 90's graphics if the game had a good feel to it, but they couldn't even come close to the combat feel of something like Goldeneye.  On sale for 74 cents, eh? Free would be too expensive.
8481	1	a	Awesome as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, says this Massive Duck

2185	0	a	frame rate are too low..
8485	1	a	It looked quote promising but its extremely barebones with ZERO community.   Is this game pre-early access or something?

8489	1	a	Cory in the House is a television show, which aired on the Disney Channel from January 12, 2007 to September 12, 2008 and was a spin-off from the Disney show That's So Raven. The show focuses on Cory Baxter, who moves from San Francisco, California to Washington, D.C. with his father, after Victor Baxter gets a new job in the White House as the official head chef. The series marks a Disney Channel first, as it is the channel's first spin-off. This is also the only Disney Channel spin-off series to be broadcast in standard definition for the entire length of the show. Reruns of the series have not been produced on Disney Channel, or on Disney XD; however they continue to air on the Family channel in Canada. Raven-SymonÃ© guest-starred, reprising her role as Raven Baxter in one episode. In 2014 Disney Channel started airing a weekly block called Disney Replay on Wednesdays nights, during which episodes of Cory in the House air alongside That's So Raven and Kim Possible, among others.

8497	1	a	Hey everybody so I played this game and I'm impressed it's very good and haters gonna hate saddly I stoped playing because I'm on a laptop and my graphics card sux and It's laggy alot and I really mean ALOT but yea I recommend this game and it's under one dollar
2205	0	a	this game is not worth it
2206	0	a	This game is actual â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. but thats just my opinion. as soon as i started it up 1 my game lagged so bag on the title screen. 2 the game was fine in the actual game? idk why. 3 flying raptors? huh 4 dinos walking sideways. basicly flipped on there side walking on a invisible wall. 5 Lag 6 me and my friend where playing and there was a dino walking across the sky box... 7 sliding dinos with no walk animation. It might be worth it to some people but PLEASE do not waste your money.. because i can guarantee you will want a refunt in under a hour..
2207	0	a	This game is terrible. On release it felt like an Unreal Tournament 3 mod but a very incomplete one, and now it is full of content, still feels like an unpolished UT3 mod. I'd give it 3/10. Not worth it. It has potential but needs a lot more work.
2208	0	a	this game sucks

8501	1	a	Yeah, this game is weirdly fun. But it is quite broken at times.
2215	0	a	10/10 Do not buy this pile of cluster â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, stinking sand eating, frogsniffing, tryhard, anal breeding prolapse.  
8503	1	a	Dear Developers [clears throat]  Make this game free,Just for the banter.  
2216	0	a	Bought the 4-pack to play with my friends, but this game is nearly unplayable and isn't worth the $0.3725 per copy I paid. It's also funny that the devs are accused of stealing assests and right in the trailer for the game it shows quotes saying that it is a combination of other properties as a positive XD
2217	0	a	Ok, so ive had this game when it was first released as Orion: Dino Beatdown. The game then was not good. The game now is alright but still in no way good. It has been through multiple scandals and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t involving theft of other ips work and assests. Skins from Primal Carnage, taking the original despender from Natural Selection 2 and then â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing the devs of NS2 over etc. Theres just been a lot of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t with this company which renamed itself and this game. It isnt good, yes its a dollar but tbh its better off using that dollar to go buy a Mc Chicken from Mcdonalds or something.  The servers are laggy and the game isnt optimized great. Oh and there are microtransactions in the game as well so theres that and if i recall there is a helmet that is basically Boba Fett from starwars....Oh and the new activision DMCA which is legit on Activisions part. The game once upon a time had promise but now its just not even worth the Dollar. I think when i originally got the game it was more than a dollar as well so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to that.  TL:DR dont waste money on a bad game or a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ company even if its just a dollar.
2218	0	a	This is easily one of the worst games i have ever played. The game looks and plays like trash and the developers are disingenuous pigs. DO NOT GIVE THESE MEN MONEY.
8505	1	a	Its free weekend and I think im gonna buy it. Surely its not that much of a good game but its not bad either, especially for only 1â‚¬. For just 1â‚¬ im fine with what the game offers me and I really like the effects of the maps. However, im not that much of a multiplayer person so I stay with bots until friends (that I dont have) want to play it with me so I dont think I will enjoy this game much for long but anyway I am satisfied for 1â‚¬. Only think I dislike are the balance issues. Gunship costs 40k and is not as good as I expected it to be. I think I can take down Dinos faster with my sniper than with the gunship. Maybe more players have to enter it, I dont know but whenever I tried to swap the 'seat' it did not worked so I guess it only has 1 spot and is in comparison rather weak. I only found that one aircraft as well sadly...I would really like it if there would be more vehicles or aircrafts but what to expect, its 1â‚¬ and what the game currently offers is really fine for 1â‚¬. +
2219	0	a	no wonder this game is 1 dollar dont even bother with this game its really bad
8507	1	a	You get alot of content for $1... And if u get it half price, like me, it's INSANELY cheap.
8509	1	a	It's alright, probably not as bad as a lot of nerds are making it out to be
8511	1	a	Must  Keep  Playng
2220	0	a	fun cool game. but my computer wont run it so i have to give it a thumbs down
2221	0	a	just pure garbage. for little kids and not even. this is just stupid.  Dont bother commenting if youre butthurt. I will delete your comment and block you. This is my review my opinion deal with it.
2222	0	a	Ridiculously bad. I mean, I downloaded this thinking that it might at least be funny, but it's really very terrible. Not even in a so-bad-it's-good way, if you've ever played any other FPS at all, it'll take you one wave in survival to decide that this was a terrible decision.
8513	1	a	Don't listen to all these call of duty fan boy haters about the relaunching of this game and the art theft or whatever. These guys have been making a great, super cheap game for a long time now. Yeah there have been some ill advised copying of armor or gun art from other games, but â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ happens. The game is 99 cents, no one is getting rich over it.   That being said, this game is worth every penny. If you don't have a lot of fun blowing up dinos with your friends in this game, there is something wrong with you.
2223	0	a	It looks good but when you play it it's really not, graphics on guns and dinos are nice but everything else looks terrible. Honestly this game is not worth the $.99 it costs
8515	1	a	1) Load Jurrasic Park theme 2) Play with a bunch of friends 3) ??? 4) Profit  10/10 would medic gun a T-Rex â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ again
2224	0	a	It's still â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
2225	0	a	What a coinkydink, this game is similar to what comes outta my pie-hole when my diarrhea starts acting up! This game is absolute â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, and with what has been going on with their stolen models, I'd recommend my bowel movement products over this.
8517	1	a	better fps on desktop than laptop xD 
2228	0	a	Do it only as a joke to annoy whomever recieved it. Do not buy this for yourself as a great game to play.
2229	0	a	It worked extremely slowly on my old computer and no servers were up. Keep in mind, this was some time ago. I do not understand why I must re-buy this game to play it now.
2230	0	a	This is not worth the 50 cents i paid for it.
2231	0	a	the game sucks laggy crappy no story lame outdated graphics cant hear sound effects cheap weapons over powered dinsaurs dlc overprice you will die :)  i would not play this game with strangers or friends
2232	0	a	I paid 0.79 and i feel cheated.... After i bought this my parents are questioning my ability to make decisions. Just wait for steam sales maybe its will be worth it when its cheaper. 
2233	0	a	This is just my less-than-a-hour look at this and I must say it is no where ready for being released. It seems that this was rushed to be released without anywhere near a finished product. With no guidance or help, I started a game and became completely lost as to what I was to do next. After wondering around for a bit I stumbled on what seemed to be the right combo to get things going. Next thing I knew, after about 3 or 4 waves of creatures, I ended up in a LARGE wave with at least two T-Rex (boss) level creatures. And lots of other sized creatures. The game is confusing and slipshod... At least all of this is just my opinion after playing less than an hour. I think if they gave this more time then maybe it would be worth playing...
8519	1	a	i got it when it was .99 cents and it was worth it, but im not sure about it going f2p
8521	1	a	I think this is the cheapest best game around
8523	1	a	That Game seems really bad but when u playing once its really fun
8525	1	a	Its a fun and cheap game, bought it for my friends
2238	0	a	3/10
8527	1	a	Fun with friends, it's hilarious, stupid, amazing, fun, bullcrap, and definitely worth the price.
8529	1	a	It wont work I hate it
8531	1	a	right now as it stands the game is really good. It is a knock off of halo, however it is done really well.   Pros: Its just like halo, there are a ton of things to do. Endless replayabiliity, I have 124 hours into it and looking forward to another 124 easily. The dlc for this game is auto updated for you and always free. also for the price its unbeatable.  Cons: It used to be buggy but not anymore. you do sometimes get stuck in cliffs if youre jumping around on them, however that is fixed by just using the teleporter.  I 100% recommend this game to anyone, not just halo fans. Its a fun way to spend 100+ hours and not get bored with it.
8533	1	a	I 460 BLAZED A DINO FOR 74 CENTS TOTTALY WORTH IT
2241	0	a	To be honest this game offers nothing new. You're better off playing halo, or team fortress.
2242	0	a	A buggy mess of a halo ripoff that dosen't understand what it wants to be
8535	1	a	Best game I've ever played.
2243	0	a	This garbage is worse than garbage.
2244	0	a	This is my first review ever. It's unfortunate it has to be a negative one. I installed this game when it was still 15$... Played it.... enjoyed it... 1 year later or so i reinstall it (today) and it wont run. Very upsetting seeing as how it is 79 cents now.. Dont feel like i am getting my moneys worth.  
2245	0	a	It....really is just poorly made. But it is what it is: a humans vs dinosaurs game, and it honestly is nothing else. Don't buy this expecting a solid experience: it's buggy, clunky, audibly empty, and not very pleasing to look at. It's a pre-early-access title, meaning it had the same principle of early access before early access was a thing on Steam. Don't buy it unless it's on sale for like, 99 cents, which often times happens with this game.  Fun fact: this game had a different title when I first bought it years ago, which really says something about its development.
2246	0	a	I seriously think the people who like this game have never played another coop shooter or something because the 'coop' is the only thing that could ever be considered fun about this garbage and no I don't think it's fun... Sure, I'd like to shoot dinos but this game is a joke.  Dislike: 1. Crap framerate yet the dinos are fast as balls half the time so theres nothing fun about shooting a speeding incomplete animation.   2. Buggy... don't get stuck  3. Guns aren't even fun to shoot. The pistal doesn't even have a shooting animation it just stiffly sits there making gun sounds.   4. I get that it's a buck and that's 'soooo cheap' but I feel like I wasted my money. If I buy games like Killing Floor on Steam for 2 bucks that are immediately great games then a buck for this broken, ugly, laggy, crap is way too much.   5. It seriously just sucks  Likes:  1. Jet pack was actually fun.    If shooting dinos with friends sounds fun to you it also did to me and I think this game is crap. If you want a truely good coop FPS with giant things to kill get the Serious Sam games. This game doesn't deserve your money.     
8537	1	a	it is buggy (the movents) but if you have friends with who you can play it it should be fun, not as in i am looking to play something by my own then i advise not buying this.
8539	1	a	its a good games becaus it a rpg game so amzing i rate it 99999/99999 
8541	1	a	epic thats all i can use to describe it 
2248	0	a	I have a crappy computer but this is very very slow.
8543	1	a	Gameplay is awesome but the game makers have an issue in programming skills or something cause game is really laggy and flying dinos just appear in sky and i dont have time to kill them if everything laggs and i am on extreme difficulty. PLEASE FIX GUYS GAME IDEA IS GOOD BUT UPGRADE THE GAME BY ITSELF CHANGE GAME CODE TO LESS LAGGY AND GIVE US MORE WORLDS AND BETTER OBJECTIVES!!!!!
8545	1	a	Great game, the survival mode in single player is the best part. Dino's and Guns! How could that not be at least a little fun. Worth the price!
8547	1	a	I just imagine it as unreal tornament 2004 with dinos 11/10
8549	1	a	What can be better than shooting a t-rex in the face with bullets? Shooting a SPACE T-REX in the face with bullets. When's the last time you picked up a friend in a jeep and spent the after noon cruising the land scape, running over velociraptors, runnning from a triceritops, and dodging pteridactyls? Come visit the jurassic park of the future where you make the endangered extinct! Caution no small children or Jeff Goldblum allowed.
8551	1	a	hello friend this game is um pretty sweet you know what i'm sayin but it's like idk pretty lame so yeah
8553	1	a	Whilst its on offer YES GRAB IT for Â£1, totally worth it! For Â£10 or whatever its normal price... not so sure, but its definately fun blasting around with your mates shooting huge hordes of dinosaurs in the face.
8555	1	a	CoD Ghosts:  - Kids on multiplayer - Spamming on Voice Chat  - Very High Price - Unrealistic Gameplay while game takes place in this universe - Crappy graphics  This game: + Great multiplayer experience  + No voice chat for spamming + 0.79 cents + Fantasy FPS with an alternate universe + Still better graphics than CoD. 
8557	1	a	beta for battlefield 4's upcoming dinosaur dlc
8559	1	a	Have endless fun fighting dinosaurs in ORION: prelude. 3 main classes with lots of variations, woth the buy.
2258	0	a	Cancer
2259	0	a	You really get what you pay for with this game.  The idea of shooting dinosaurs with future guns is a cool idea, I mean, its just plain bad-â™¥â™¥â™¥! But this game really falls short of expectations,   Graphically, its very nice. And on top of that, it not too hard on the computer. The framerate is smooth. Textures are quite appealing to the eye.   Combat is overly repeditve. About 10 minutes of play, i got bored fairly bored.   Its hard to get into the game's lore. Like seriously, with a few minutes of play, you have no idea as to whats going on. Here are some of my un-answered questions; Where are we? Earth? Some other planet with Dinosaurs? Who are we? Are we human? Are we an alien race? Why are there dinosaurs here? If we have futuristic weapons, and we are fighting dinosaurs, what time are we in? Like seriously, there is nooooooo story what so ever. You have no idea whats going on.  Athsteically, it REALLY needs some work. The its seems that the sounds in the game are SUPER repetitive. For the HUGE amount of weapons there are in the game, they all sound the same! The cars in it literally sound like the have 1 or 2 gears. after you start driving for a good minute, the vehical sounds cut and loop. Its HORRIBLE. There are No sounds for the game what so ever. I mean, there are no birds chirping, no wind blowing, no waves, no NOTHING. You can only here the sound of your own foot steps. That mixed with the GIANT maps that are completly EMPTY, the game feels more empty than fallout 3!   The animations for the dinosaurs, are just terrible. They move sooooooooooooooo fast, but the look like they arent moving at ALL.   The econemy of the game is horribly broken. You either always have TOO much money, or have no money at all. This works horrbilly witht the difficulty. On easy, the cash flow is so mondain. Killing one thing gives you â™¥â™¥â™¥-loads of money, so it makes it even easier because you have great guns. Then on medium or even hard, you never have money at all because you get little money, too many enemys, and you can never afford guns.   So far, its not the best game ive played. Ive heard that it used to be much, MUCH WORSE. But seriously, this is BETTER?  I strongly reqimend NOT to buy this game
8561	1	a	Got a couple hours into it. ha the first halo feel to it, i think it has alot of potential but it needs to be heavily optimized in the sense of LAG. hope to see what it grows into and for .99 cents whats to lose. 
8563	1	a	top notch!!!
8565	1	a	Really cool game, loved the gameplay. It would help to have a tutorial system that explains the controls while using a controller
8567	1	a	good game, ive not played it a lot, but it cost 9.99 â‚¬ i think. i bought it for 0.99 â‚¬ and the default price is now 0.79 â‚¬? what the quack? but anyway its a good game with dinosaurs .  8/10
8569	1	a	great game, recommend
8571	1	a	Its awesome! But how do you buy stuff with your credits you earn?
2263	0	a	DONT BUY THIS GAME EVEN IF IT COSTS 0.99 $ BETTER BUY JETPACK JOYRIDE OR ANGRY BIRDS OR WHATEVER JUST DONT SUPPORT THE CRAPY WORK OF THE DEVELOPERS
8573	1	a	Great Game But The 1 Thing Thats wrong is that the dino are way to fast but its a fun game highly recomned
8575	1	a	Do you like dinosaurs? Want to shoot one? want to run tiny ones over with a car? this is the game for you. if you come in expecting nothing this is a great game. you kill dinos, you get money you get bigger gun to kill bigger dino's. good little shoot em up highly recomended.
2264	0	a	A good Idea with the Carnivores-meets-CoD concept (anybody old enough to rememeber WizardWorks' hunting games?); but it's just too buggy and unstable. It kept CTD'ing and the interface is also a little irritating. I deleted it litterally minutes after I DL'd it. Even though it is only US $.99 I'm glad I caught it on free weekend. Even 99 cents would feel like a sickening,terrible waste on such an unstable (and if you ask me, obsolescent looking) waste of 8 gb of storage.
8577	1	a	I only love cod zombies and the survival mode is a good alternative to zombies.
8579	1	a	Metascore is way low!! this games actually pretty fun.. PvP needs some improvement but honestly I would pay full price after having such a good first experience playing this game  Definitely reccommend!!
8581	1	a	Crazy, stupid, but FUN!
2265	0	a	AWFUL it's total crap, maybe in 1995 would had seemed interesting now is outdated awful crap.
2266	0	a	It's pretty bad, unfinished and full of microtransactions (not pay to win, only cosmetic). Overall....it's free and I still didn't my money's worth.
2267	0	a	Worest Game Ever
2268	0	a	Can I have my money back?
2269	0	a	I am ashamed to own this game.
8583	1	a	I would tell you to play this game but in the end it doesnt even matter..... 5/10
8585	1	a	so swag me and my bud quick scoped some dinos they dident see it comeing!
8587	1	a	This is one of the best games I have EVER played. It is a fast paced FPS sort of. Basically all you do is upgrade,upgrade, and kill kill. I haven't seen this kind of game in a while, so it is highly recommened. :D P.S: Anyone willing to gift this game to me? Add me on steam if you can.
8589	1	a	Honestly this game isn't that bad. it has a wonderful concept but if it had better graphics and less bugs it'd be godly in my books.
8591	1	a	Isn't tf2
8593	1	a	Better put some prelude on that, you dinoâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥

8599	1	a	Really nice and really fun! Game have great potential.
8601	1	a	  its awesome fun and so fun you dont even wanna stop. keep up the good work
2278	0	a	Fun for about 10 mins
2279	0	a	bad graphics, terrible audio and sounds wich give you a headache, badly optimized, massive frame drops, bad animations, bad models, etc, i dont recommend this game at all, the only good thing about this game is the ragdoll physics on the dinosaurs, nuff said
8603	1	a	After getting a buff PC I can say this game is completely worth the .99 cents.  I honestly love this game, I wish more people would play it, I mainly have to hop in 100+ pinged servers.
8605	1	a	Really fun game specially with friends. Not the most extreme epic graphics and textures but the game is still very much fun all around. A must have as part of a LAN party pack.
8607	1	a	*Steam Workshop *Achievements *Cards *CO-OP *Great Graphics *FUN I dare you to find a game as good as ORION: Prelude for $1.
8609	1	a	It is a funny game to lose time, for him price is ok. 3&gt;
8611	1	a	it was ok but i hope it can get some more updates an stuff
8613	1	a	Hainanese Chicken Rice Never Tasted This Good Before?! Good Price, Kappa Gamers.
8615	1	a	Do not let the bad reviews and the terrible Metascore fool you. This game is awesome, no joke.  The bad reviews were carried over from their previous game, ORION: Dino Beatdown, which was buggy and unfinished.  My only gripe is that the animations are a bit awkward at times, but the gameplay is incredibly solid and loads of fun, especially with friends.  Besides, the base price is only â‚¬1, with the price dropping as low as â‚¬0,50 at times. Sell a few trading cards, and get this game!
8617	1	a	  i dont remember this game all that well. it may have been during a free weekend or maybe i just got a refund.        idk.
8619	1	a	5/5
8621	1	a	Tank you so much for my refund

2287	0	a	i bought it 0.49$ so worth it for me LOL Uhhhh... this game need to devolope much things sort of AI and game play
2288	0	a	don't  just don't    Tip: IF YOU SEE A GAME WITH 'MIXED' THE CHANCES OF THAT GAME BEING â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ IS LIKE 87,25%
8623	1	a	for the 1$ i paid(and if you intend to play with friends, even the full price justifies it) i got many hours of fun.  a horde survival-shooter with a large sized map, classes and vehicles tossed in the mix and epic boss fights(well... t-rex counts as a boss, right?)  if you liked killing floor's style of survival, chances are good you'll like this. thats all i can say.
8625	1	a	This is what Jarissic Park should have been about.
2290	0	a	ohh god i tought that they said they made it better i see basicly everything same except for some funky new borderlands graphic style which dosnt fit the game at all if you dont want to get laid atleast once dont play this game, 0/10 bad very bad
2291	0	a	The idea sounded cool, so I tried it. I really can't get into it. The voices were annoying and I feel like the graphics on some things (rocks, grass, trees) are on an overkill level and I had to manually turn the graphics settings down. The is a solo mode but it's not a story mode, it's just a play with bots mode which I found disappointing because being new to the game I had no idea what I was doing. The gameplay is choppy at best. Sound quality is horrible for a FPS. My surround sound is pointless for this game because it doesn't seem to use it. Also, I kept getting dropped from servers. I would love to see this game redone (again) with the Unreal engine.
8627	1	a	I have to say this game is pretty good for $1
8629	1	a	Fun game, really. I love the Halo-like feel of it and the various classes are a nice touch. Some of the maps are repetative (and no I'm not just talking about the day/night maps), but are overall fun. I just really wish people played more of the other modes other than survival.   Them ost SEVERE problem with this game is the crashing and lagging.. the developers of this game really need to watch the 'Leroy Jenkins' video and find out what happens to a computer when you have too many enemies spawning at once! Hard to shoot dinos when they are lagging the Hell outta my computer! That and coupled with random disconnects makes this game almost more of a frustration than a game.   But Hell why am I complaining for $1?   This game is fun and if your computer won't take a dump while trying to play it, you're in for a serious thrill.
8631	1	a	Dino's everywhere.The next viral thing on the internat.
2293	0	a	Even though it was only 99 cents i still asked for a refund

8639	1	a	I remember when I bought for a $1 i now have crippling depression.
2304	0	a	My friend got the four pack of this, we played for a few minutes, quit, never played again
2305	0	a	Firstly, all respect to the developers.  This is a game that started out bad. Like, really bad. One of those bad games you remember, yeah, you know the ones.  It's only that this time around the developers said 'Hey, we made the game, let's like, fix it and stuff.' Then they did. Then they added billions of loads worth of content. So much so they renamed the game about 2 (or 3) times based on how much they updated.  There are tons of maps, modes, weapons, and just variety in general that should make this game a jurassic clusterâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ of nonsensical fun. Why 'should' ? Because beyond all of what they have added, all of what they have continued to put into the game, I canno't for the life of me enjoy it.  Why? Well it's probably gonna seem stupid, but I personally think it makes a big difference.  Every single weapon is simply not enjoyable to use and makes the game feel boring and bleak.  Everything feels like a pop gun with the volume put to 2. I swear to god that sometimes the guns make literally no noise at all. They designed these huge awesome looking assortments of weapons, but they all feel so static and weak it's a joke, and aside from that there is very little feeling of actual impact when shooting anything.  This is seriously a big problem that hinders the entire game unenjoyable, or at least for me. I mean come on, this is supposed to be a giant battle for survival against huge, glorious dinosaurs, but there is nothing-- NOTHING about doing anything in this game that's at all fun to do.  This should be so easy to fix, and I hope to christ they make an update to the game that completly reworks weapon animations, sounds, and effects, because as of now it's loads more satisfying to fling rubber bands at a picture of Jeff Goldblum.  Also the occasional heavy lag and frame drops don't exactly help out.   Is the game worth a doller? Well to you and some others it might be, but there is nothing here that can bring me back unless they just update the guns to make them feel like actual, powerful guns.
2306	0	a	ohh god i tought that they said they made it better i see basicly everything same except for some funky new borderlands graphic style which dosnt fit the game at all if you dont want to get laid atleast once dont play this game, 0/10 bad very bad
8641	1	a	make the dinos extinct again in a glitchy manner but sh:t it was (nearly) 99cents 10/10
2308	0	a	This game is not worth whatever it is put on sale for ever. Just not a fun shooter. If you want dinosaurs get primal carnage or dino d-day, anythingnother than this. SHAME, SHAME, SHAME, SHAME.
2309	0	a	It committed the cardinal sin of having flying enemies in an FPS.  0/10 no just no
8643	1	a	Best dollar I've spent on steam.
2316	0	a	great game, but nothing i hate more then that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing fight to survive 6/10
2317	0	a	Great optimization! 2/10! CS:GO runs on my laptop in 4k highest settings i 70-100fps, dis shet runs at same settings with a shetload of 14 fps! Eyes dont hurt! But thats not all, if i put it down to 720p on low settings i get a beloved 2fps more! Dunno if its my 860m gfx card thats the fault or something else on my pc, or is it just the game itself :/ Because of those problems, i didnt test the game fairly good :P Defineitly (or hau dafuq is it spelled) recommened dis game if u wanna get a pair of glasses, but ur eyes are perfect and ur mom says u dont need dem!
8645	1	a	good game, much yes. 12/10
2318	0	a	Things I didnt like about the game:  Played for the trading cards, which are dirt poor in value. No anime No anime â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ No anime butts No anime   -Gibus Sniper
2319	0	a	The graphics are nice (thanks to Unreal Engine) and it's fun for a while, but the game is very buggy, the maps are too big, you have to travel way too far to buy upgrades and weapons, and it get's very repetitive pretty quickly. The only way I'd actually recommend it is if it's cheap, especially since it has lots of in-app purchases and seems like it should be a free to play game. I don't regret buying it since I got it cheap but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless they're really into dinosaurs.
8647	1	a	Hi-tech guns, light sabers, jetpacks, invisibility cloak, and Dinosaurs. Killing Dinosaurs have never been this fun. Especially when youre with your friends or with a stranger.
8649	1	a	i bought this and now it's free to play!!!?? i just waste my $1 for this           but the gameplay is good
8651	1	a	Game seems alright, but whenever I shoot, there is no animation for the gun firing. One of 20 shots works. I'll update this later if it seems more smooth.   I bought 4 copies for $3 so I still recommend the game, if I can squeeze 45 minutes of gameplay out of my investment, this game owes me nothing.
2336	0	a	I can't run it in offline mode steam!!!!
2337	0	a	Not even worth the download on a free week. They somehow cloned Halo with dinosaurs but yet still managed to make it suck somehow.  It's almost not even possible to do and yet somehow Spiral managed to screw up the marriage of Halo and Dinosaurs even worse than the way 800 North screwed up Nazi's and Dinosaurs.(Dino-D-Day)  So now begs the question......will Dinosaurs ever kick â™¥â™¥â™¥ in video games ever again?
2338	0	a	I promoted this developer and their games for quite a while, including buying several copies for friends. In light of their years of employee abuse and stolen assets, coupled with their playing the victim card each time, I can no longer recommend this company or their games. Considering how much information is available, and not knowing what sources you personally trust, I recommend googling 'ORION stolen assets' or 'ORION employee abuse' and deciding for yourself which side you believe.
2339	0	a	The developer is a scumbag
2340	0	a	The Land Before Time Game is not that great without the original voice actors
2341	0	a	Do like Dinosaurs, Jet Packs, Mechs, Tanks, and all sorts of other cool accessories? You do? Well guess what? Orion has all of that! But Is it any fun? No, It's not fun at all. The idea of blasting down Dinosaurs with you're pals is a great idea, It really is. However, It's prestented poorly with this game.    GAMEPLAY
2342	0	a	it's cheap and it feels cheaper
8653	1	a	This is an interesting game from a certain point of view. I enjoyed playing it, does have a special graphic and game mechanics, the overall sound is okay. Keeps you entertained and wishing for more.
2343	0	a	usedto be great when it had a diff title now the ai is complete â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ the graphics are complete â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. and i paid 15 euros for this game while this is a 0,00$ version like i would be ashamed if i asked money for such a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game. gg dev team ope u hadfun with ur trolls please return this to the previous title STILL â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
2344	0	a	Today's Review: Orion: Prelude (Formally Orion: Dino Horde)  Let me tell you a story about a bunch of 'developers' that thought that would be a great idea to launch an indie game, poorly optimized (i'll say not even tried), multiplayer game with dinosaurs and guns (FPS) and how they fail at the point they had to drop permanently the price from 9.99 to 0.99 due the fact that no one will ever buy this crap or accept it for free, because they game sucks in every posible way, and i've played the slaughtering grounds, ride to hell retribution, RAMBO and other crappy games and this one it's the worst one, but hell, they reach steam without even passing trought greenlight so, there.  I'm not even gonna put a score to this crap, stay away from it!

2358	0	a	This may be the literal worst thing on steam. I think it's definitely a contender at the very least.
8657	1	a	Buy now whilst it's cheap!
2360	0	a	Ok, i know i haven't even played this game for 30 minutes, even 10 minutes. But here me out anyone looking at this review; the SECOND i got on, i thought this game was GREAT, but it turns out that the loading/menu screens were sexy looking.. When i got into a game and tried to connect; BAM, i lost connection. I tried 12 unsucessful times to get into a game and FINALLY got into one on my 13th try. The second i get into it, what does it say? 'Lost connection to host/failed to maintain connection' so i go back and i try again :P  When i DO finally manage to get into a game, the graphics were poor, the controls were CLEARLY meant for an Xbox 360 controller, NOT a console, and i could barely move around or anything due to that fact. And when i saw the Dinos i nearly â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ a brick -_-  They were awkward looking things, albeit their obvious attempted graphical enhancements.. so no, i won't recommend this game even though it was 1$  This game HAD good potential back when it came out awhile ago, now, however; it doesn't which is sad to say.  but HEY! who am i to tell people what to do/not to do? Go on and buy the game, try it out for yourself! But this is just my recommendation to NOT play the game. :) enjoy -_-
2361	0	a	I do like that this game is in the regard that it is updated often and it displays that the developers care for the game and want to promote the game as they update it. Though, I was still disappointed with the game even with the being updated so often. The game play is like many shooters but with sub par controls and broken game play. With the teamwork being the most important in the game but even with skilled human players, they dinosaurs have the advantage most of the time. Maybe in the future this game will be satisfying.
2362	0	a	Noooope.  Do not buy, horribly optimized, EXTREMELY bad gunplay that makes nerf guns feel like weapons of mass destruction. Animations are laughable and it's massively boring. I saw the reviews here and thought it might've changed - it hasn't. It's still as appalling as when I first saw it on a TotalHalibut/Biscuit video, and it feels exactly the same as it looked - and it was shoddy.  Even for 99p, which was how much it was on sale... no, don't get it. It's depressingly bland, boring and has such a bad feel to it, and it'll make you ashamed to see it on your steam library.  
2363	0	a	if you review this game saying '39 cents lmao' you definitely should consider suicide because nobody above the age of twelve finds the meme funny
2364	0	a	I killed a few mindless dinos while some Australian man yelled at me. Also, the gunshot sounds didn't sync with the animation. Would not play again.
8659	1	a	Definitley the best game on the marketplace for a buck. Halo/Borderlands/Carnivores packed into one. It runs on my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ty laptop, and it's simple but addicting. SO MANY CHIEVES. and it's got fuxxin dinosaurs my negros. BUY THIS, NOW. &lt;3 Gaabbe
2369	0	a	Now that it is free for a week you should definitely try it out. Afterwards, you can safely claim you have played the worst game ever created in the history of mankind. Jesus F**king Christ, this is absolutely garbage. Giving this game a 1/10 should be considered too much praise.
2370	0	a	I paid for the game and its now free. watta â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ move.
2371	0	a	This game just downright sucks. For someone who likes to play dinosaur games this one isn't even trying just another survive the wave game nothing special. Just buy primal carnage extincion you get more worth outta your moneys then this game. But why do i hate this game? It's not even something only just a game with ''skins'' ''classes'' and ''different'' dinosaurs same colours, Graphics aren't even being updated. This ''game'' just needs to be stopped.
2372	0	a	makes you buy 5 dollars in funds to get a dollar game wtf?

There are a lot of reviews saying it's a crap game, but honestly it's quite good for a dollar. Enjoyed fooling around with my friends.

2381	0	a	This game has some serious performance problems, to a laughable extent. Dinosaurs will float across the place and your gun can't really even move when you shoot it. Might be fun if you like buying games that are funny because they are bad.
8665	1	a	Lol this is a joke, the game in its current state is worth NOTHING, i have faith though

2384	0	a	This game is completely reprehensible filth. Even the low price tag cannot justify this 'game'. I bought two copies, one for me and my friend. We played for a while and had many technical difficulties. Let it be noted that we do not have poor computers or low specs. He was experiencing lag for a lack of a compatability pack that wasn't installed with the core download. It gave no notice that it would cause issues and no method of installing it after.   The gameplay was abhorent. I've played Sonic The Hedgehog 2006, and it was significantly more complete than this. I literally could not find an aspect of gameplay that was complete or satisfying. The dinosaurs AI is dumber than a stump, and their animations are just repeatedly walking into you while your screen has a violent red seizure. The graphical fidelity is not present. These visuals aren't bad necessarrily, there just isn't any style or charm. They're similar to the Call Of Duty graphics. Bland. There was no impact from the gunfire and shooting guns seemed to be problematic. A core element of the game was not even functional. The vehicles are awful. It's similar to driving a ghost from Halo without any physics. The sounds were generic, similar to stock sounds you can find online or on YouTube. The music wasn't even something I acknowledged was present. It's bland. The game modes are just sitting there and fighting bland generic raptors. There is no exploration, there is nothing interesting. You stand there, shoot raptors and then die. The servers are dead empty for a reason.   DO NOT BUY  This is the WORST game I have ever paid for on Steam. Thank god for refunds.

2402	0	a	ORION: Dino Prelude Beatdown Horde is quite possibly the worst game I've ever played. And anyone who willingly spends money in this virus of a games microtransaction store needs to be sent to a Mental Institute and evaluated. Even though its priced less than a dollar, don't buy it, its a trap, what seems like a dumb joke becomes an immediate regret. Run, while you still can, and avoid this game at ALL costs.

2423	0	a	My friend bought this for me. Thank God I didn't waste any money, because this is literally â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Constant lag, horrible graphics and gameplay, and more combined to make a literal pile of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that came from the developer's â™¥â™¥â™¥. Oh wait, there was more than ONE developer? Jesus Christ, they must've gone and got the most autistic people they could find on the street, because this game sure seems like it.
2424	0	a	I cannot think of a more horrifying experience. I'd rather have militant terrorists penetrate my eye sockets than play this again. My neighbors all moved out of my neighborhood and the value of my house is degrading because of how severely awful this game is. An â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is more exciting than this game. This game is probably used in small African societies to scare small children into walking 40 miles to get a bucket of well water. It is easier to untangle 10 miles of braided steel cable than it is to enjoy this game. I would easily never recommend this to anyone. I do not understand why this game ever was accepted through steam green light, but it seems to me that whoever accepted it has a major mental deficiency. This game is so terrible that I don't even know if it is legal to make something on this level of scum. If I wrote anymore on this review, then I would be giving the game unnecessary attention that it clearly does not deserve.

8695	1	a	Uh Not too sure what to write here so heres a recipe for Pancakes instead really i have mixed feelings on this games so eat some pancakes!  Ingredients: 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 3 tablespoons sugar 1 tablespoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg 2 large eggs, at room temperature 1 1/4 cups milk, at room temperature 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more as needed  Now to make it 1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg. 2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla. 3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat. 4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed 5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed. 6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.

The only thing bigger than those horrible blobs of bloody slobber burtsing on your face like perverse water balloons out of a killer clowns darkets fantasy, are those TEETH, those razor sharp 75MM talons lining that whole huge terrible mouth ! BUT YOUR IN COMPLETE CONTROL BUDDY... YES SIREE ! You have the power here, and the choice is all yours !!! You can stand still, and be SLAM SWALLOWED RIGHT DOWN THAT BLOODY THROAT into a waiting vat of a delightfully strong solution of sulfuric acid, amound the other assorted gastric juices of the day, or for the more or less resilient amound you out there, you can move left or right a little tiny bit, before the inevitable snapping shut of those guillotine like teeth and jaws, and win the DAILY DOUBLE !!! YES SIREE, for no extra cost you will be treated to a two part journey, just as GOD parted the seas for Moses, those jaws will divide your mortal coil into two (2) somewhat equal parts, each of which is gauranteed to experience the same fun filled journey to exactly the same destination, that everyone else in your squadron just opted into...
8703	1	a	Screw the Meta-critic this game is heaps fun!
8705	1	a	Good dumb fun, let your brain take a breather as you run around shooting dinosaurs in the face. I don't know why it's so fun, it just is. If you're thinking about buying it, just go for it. For the price you can't even play an arcade game for 10 minutes, and I got 7 hours out of this so far.

2470	0	a	I would not reccomend this game becasue the community is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. I say this from only needing to play 1 hour of the game. It is basically just a race to get the cheapest vehical and run over the enemy team with it before they do it to you. This game had a great idea however and was fun for the one time it that people didn't just run over the enemy team. If the games community was better I would reccomend this game however.

2498	0	a	Hello, today I am here to write a review for the game - Orion: Prelude. Let me start by saying this game is absolutely terd awful, and I don't think anyone should have ever even tried it let alone it get to over 1 million copies sold. I have played this game for some time with my friends and after being avid fans of killing floor this seemed like a complete rip off. But with aspects from other games like borderlands and it's second wind. I think this game is poop and everyone should know im only writing this review for a steam badge. Thank you.
2499	0	a	They steal assets and claim they never did it. Great.  Activision may be scums, they clearly got robbed anyway.
2500	0	a	I played Counter Strike Nexon:Zombies longer than this.                 And Counter Strike Nexon:Zombies won't even start up. best.
2501	0	a	This is a massively awful game. Don't even think about picking it up.
2502	0	a	This game is an awful piece of dinosaur poop, and doesn't deserve more than one sentence in a review about it.
2503	0	a	UPDATE ON MY YEARLY DO NOT BUY THIS GAME REVIEW   Shock in the gaming community as the developers of ORION once again caught Stealing assets from other games
2504	0	a	I've played this game, and it's alright, but nothing special. It's missing a lot of polish. I was hoping to play the newer one, but after learning that the company ripped off assets from other games and then LIED about it (seriously, just say your models were inspired by theirs. That's at least partially believable), I have no desire to support this company any longer, and I wouldn't recommend buying anything from them.
2505	0	a	I purchased this and was gifted ORION project and at first thought Activisions DMCA takedown was unfair, since then I understand that the asset theft is fairly clear and this is the shadiest â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ of a game developer I've seen, the game has been renamed multiple times to avoid negative reviews on steam (Previously ORION: Dino Beatdown and ORION: Dino Horde) as well as a complete rename of the developer and publisher in an attempt to avoid other DMCA takedowns, do not buy any ORION game, it really isn't worth supporting
2506	0	a	The game is as empty as my pockets
8721	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off
8723	1	a	If your reading this review it means you want to buy the game, if you want to buy this game it is because It is dirt cheap. If you are buying this game because it is cheap it means you are broke, if you are broke you have a garbage potato computer, if you have a garbage potato computer you can't run this game. 10/10 best game ever would buy if I was not broke.
2515	0	a	I don't even own this game lmao
2516	0	a	The game's a shoddy Halo clone with goofy dinosaurs. Didn't have fun with it when it was new, but your mileage may vary.  However, the developers of this game are shady hacks. They've done multiple re-releases of this game in the past, in order to bury the earlier iteration's extremely poor reviews. They dropped the price to a hilariously low 99 cents [or less during a sale] so they can take advantage of people thinking, 'This game's super cheap, I won't lose anything if I buy it'. They've stolen assets from other developers on several occasions, such as an armory model from the game Natural Selection 2.  As further proof of this second point, another identical halo/dino game by them simply titled 'Orion' was recently removed by Steam as of the writing of this. They ripped a *fictional* sci fi gun model [a very different scenario than if they stole a modern-day, real gun] out of one of Activision's newer CoD games and shamelessly used it as their own. I don't normally side with Activision, but I really wish more big companies could strong-arm these scumbags out of the industry.  Having paid the original price for this game when it originally released as Orion: Dino Beatdown, which was 20 bucks, and of course long before the days of steam refunds, my regret for buying this piece of garbage will never cease haunting me.  Don't buy this. Don't support these devs with this game or any other game they make. Let it all die.

Aside from running around like a brain dead moron killing little foot, There's really nothing to do in this game. 10/10 would not recommend to a paleontologist.

2531	0	a	  How to be the worst developer in 8 Steps! Step 1: Make a game. Step 2: Make it pricey Step 3: Make your community mad because you put it on 1$ Step 4: make it free so people will brag about not having refunds Step 5: make it 1$ again Step 6: Wait until the community is mad at you and then see a comment like this. Step 7: Self-contemplate Step 8: Do Step 3, 4, and 7 again.  Optional: Add some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ DLC.

2535	0	a	Clunky. My laptop can run DA:I, Mass Effect, and other much more demanding engines with ease. However, this game still runs like molasses.   The premise is enjoyable, however. For a game that proudly calls itself the worst game out there, a great success.

8733	1	a	Have you ever wanted to feel the sensation of stepping on a rusty nail with your bare foot? Then this is the game for you. I tell ya, Oreo Prelude was a great way to curb my hunger. Unfortuantely, it really spoiled my appetite as I played this at 5:30 PM and I normally want to eat dinner at 6:00 PM, because of this I was unable to enjoy my pizza ravioli platter. The milk mechanics in this game are almost real but in the end you just remember that it's all an illusion: like actual equality in America. Some people may be lured in by the low price of this game, but I'd say you're better off going to see Pixar's 'The Good Dinosaur' because the word 'good' is in the title and will never be used in conjunction with this game, also it's always great to lather your hand with butter and rub one out during a kids' movie. 6/10

2553	0	a	Bought this game back when it was 'Dino Beatdown' and still Early Access. It cost me 20$ at the time and it was so worth it. There were no microtransactions that I could remember, people actually played the game, and it ran better. I'm glad it's one dollar because if it cost any more, it wouldn't be worth it.  Full of microtansactions and bad graphics, it was better 4 years ago.

The Dinos movment is not realistic

2574	0	a	My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.' I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.

8745	1	a	'ORION: Dino Horde' is an indie Sci-Fi shooter (FPS/TPS) that seamlessly blends together incredible visuals and addictive combat. It puts you and your friends together into intense, cinematic battles using some of the most incredible weaponry and amazing vehicles in which you must work or compete against one another to accomplish mission objectives, explore giant worlds and survive the devastating Dinosaur Horde.   In addition to the return of the adventurous and survival-based cooperative gameplay, 'ORION: Dino Horde' features intense, retro-inspired and over-the-top PvP competitive action via 'The Arena' in which each mode focuses on a specific homage or battle-type.   Can you survive the Dinosaur Horde?

2583	0	a	I made the mistake of purchasing this game when it was first released and before I knew about the stolen assets. This game has been released multiple times in order to wipe out all of the massively negative reviews in the past.  This developer steals content from other games and then tries to play the victim when legal action is taken against them.  Don't support â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ business practices.   https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4q77rg/psa_the_developers_behind_the_orion_project_have/

2585	0	a	Devs blatantly stole models from Activision.  Activision isnt my favorite. Don't get me wrong. I don't like Call of Duty.  Content stealing is wrong.  Pretending to be the victim and misleading people when the person you stole from calls you out is even worse.  I'll never buy from this company again, they're only a small step above those plagiarism riddled mobile games.

2591	0	a	Why do people keep supporting this developer. This is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game. The developer is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ person. And they should not be able to sell a game ever again. Oh wait. But if anything negative happens towards them, they will just rename the game and/or their developing studio name and the casual audience will not even notice. This developer is so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing scummy it isn't even funny anymore. It never really was. And the game isn't even good. Like Fez is a good game but this game is absolute garbage. Just buy Killing Floor.
2592	0	a	This just does not work, is not complete, may be labelled a tech demo or concept draft. Certainly it's not a game. May be jolly in 2014.
2593	0	a	 https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4q6xo5/activisions_dmca_claim_on_orion_is_legit_orions/  TL;DR: The developers have been stealing copyrighted content to put in there games, however, this is not the sole reason I am giving this game a negative review, the developers have also been trying to victimize themselves by trying to make a big social media backlash for the DMCAs, and threatens to 'take legal action' against anyone that 'spreads false information' about their situation...
2594	0	a	I bought this game as 'Orion: DIno Horde'. Now, the dev has re-released it under yet a new name, and before I got it the game was Orion:Dino Beatdown. The good: A wave based survival game you can play with friends co-op. The bad: Most of the vehicles seem lifted from Halo, the dev keeps pulling and re-uploading the game to make negative reviews vanish, and now for their latest game they wholesale lifted assets from other developers and got caught, and are throwing a fit. Avoid this game to now reward them for their behavior, avoid the dev. I regre that I cannot refund it at this time due to getting too many hours into it.

8753	1	a	I think this game has a lot of potential. It could really use a campaign mode and just a few touch-ups. One thing that really buggs me was when raptors get up in your face, your screen is just a blob of pixels. The firt-person view on this game also seems unnaturally close to the ground.. like my character is a midget or something. I don't have a whole lot of time invested into this game, but based on first impressions, overall, I think the game is really fun and I don't regret buying it (although I bought it when it was on sale for .99c, If I paid $14 for this, I would be very dissapointed). I keep reading comments about how buggy it is, and I didn't experience any. Then again, like I said before, I don't have much tiem invested into this game. I'll definitely give it another go soon though.

2618	0	a	What can I say... I couldn't pass on a game for 99 cents with screen shots like that!!! But alas, it was only false and high hopes. Personally, I really preffer to try to avoid knocking someones hard work (as I assume someone did at one point put some sort of effort into this at some point) and I wish I could think of something positive about this game but I just can't. Really, it is that bad, and the only thing that this game has working for it is the price on sale. Oh... that's it!!! That something positive I was looking for!!! You should buy it for the price! Just because you have 99 cents laying around that should be in some starving developers pocket! Or you could wait til its regular price and help that starving developer with their alimony payments too!  But seriously, I feel like I've waisted too much of my time (and life) on this game as it is. Which is where I'm coming from when I say that you'll have to trust me on this and donate that 99 cents to help all the neglected and abused dinosaurs of the world. For just the price of a cup of coffee, you too can help save a helpless dinosaur.  Oh, I just though of another positive... Hats! Yes, the game has hats! And best of all you can wear them... Virtually! Yes! In the game! ... Okay yes, hats are not that exciting but it might be you like things on your head! So lets summerize this...  You should buy this game if you:  -Are a Philanthropist for:  -Dinosaurs  -Game Developers or  -Are balding or is bald   -Likes things on you're head  -Likes virtual things on your virtual head more  -Don't need 99 cents or   -Missed the sale and  -Don't need $14.99

2633	0	a	ORION: Prelude  This game is fun enough, fairly basic but fun to spend some time shooting up dinos and whatnot. But the reason I don't recommend this game is due to the company actions and the CEO David Prassel.  The Trek Industries and the CEO David Prassel have lied and mislead customers multiple times, two instances being them trying to 'rename' the game in order to get a new MetaCritic score and get people to essentially pay twice for the same game, and the most recent being Trek Industries initiating a slander campaign against Activision. Previously, David Pressal has also treated employees with disrespect, firing them once they completed their work and before they were paid.  DO NOT SUPPORT THIS KIND OF DEVELOPER

I was going through some rough times and the 30 minutes I spent on Beep changed my life. This is the best game ever it stopped me from drinking the full 10 ounces of bleach in order to kill myself. The complex and emotional story had me in awe. The bonk engine made this game look like it was real life. The vibrant colors and effects makes this game look on par with games like Battlefield One. If you do not already have this game buy it RIGHT NOW.
2637	0	a	Okayish game, horrible devs. Changing the name of their game, TWICE, to avoid bad metacritic scores. Stealing assets. Playing the victim after Activision calls them out on it and slaps them with a DMCA notice. Pretending to take the high ground by saying 'I won't retaliate against Activision' and then writing walls of text doing exactly that. Laying employees off after taking their work. Threatening to sue the 'kids' of reddit for all they're worth. Throwing a temper tantrum and saying 'OMG I WAS HACKED BY ANONYMOUS.' 'Flexible funding' on indiegogo and then funding the required $500 themselves. Deleting negative comments and anyone who disagrees with them the slightest. How anyone could continue to support him is beyond me. I'm returning these products immediately and I encourage everyone to do the same.
2638	0	a	I used to like this game, but with so much things going on with the company and CEO pretending to be victims of Activision's actions, while Activision have the truth, now I can not feel anything about this game but hate, this is disgusting. The game was fun, but now I can't just give my time to this disgusting Company.  Do not buy it, don't give your money to this **messed** up company.
2639	0	a	In light of the recent scandal.  The first rule of playing the victim is trying to make people sympathetic, being a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ doesn't help.
2640	0	a	Lol dev is trash hate this game
2641	0	a	As the game stands, it's not half bad for a $1 game, a lot better than most $1 games on the google play store. However this is not the google play store. In fact, i've seen better games on google play that are free. I honestly would recomend this is you're really bored and have $1 to blow on a semi-ok game. However the dev team, or whatever portion of them that wheren't fired so they wouldn't have to be paid for their work, have blatently stolen assets from other games. Honestly i hope the development team tries to drag out any possible future lawsuit between them and Activision so they go bankrupt from the legal fees and loose the hypotetical case

2661	0	a	Very bad game in my opinion and it shoud be free to play becouse its garbage
2662	0	a	'Polished turd' is the best description i can come up with for this game. after playing it for a while, and doing some research, i honestly can't think of anything else. considering how long this game has been in the works, it looks like about three people spent their free weekends on it. it's overall quality is on par with PS1, but with slightly better graphics. if this was a free game on a site like New Grounds, i'd be impressed. after four or five years of 'professional' development, it's just sad.   The 93% discount plus the extended free trial smacks of desperation. or perhaps something more insidious? as though they are hoping you will get hooked, and become one of the rationalizing legion of followers feebley attempting to defend their poor choice.    not to mention all the controversy. but you'll have to look into that yourself.  P.S. I got a one week forum ban for 'If you can't say something nice...'
2663	0	a	this game is garbage. the ai is bad and the teradactals are s op you usually die from them.Also the guns are garbage and the dinos are just focused on the genorator and if it goes offline you loose.  so dont waste the dollar this game is this game should be .0000000000000000001$

And I don't care what you have to say. Your opinion, unless it agrees with mine, is invalid based on the fact that you voted for a game to be 26 cents less. A game no one plays.

2725	0	a	Its really fun. Recommended
8779	1	a	great game for a cheap price.  a lot of map glitches and exploits.
2727	0	a	I payed $1 for this game then it became free
8781	1	a	this game is soo cool i want it!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
8783	1	a	This game is the best game ever made I r8 it 8/8
8785	1	a	Ever have that urge to punch a raptor in the face while you wear a high tech suit? I thought that would be stupid. Then I got a knife and broke the game. Dont try to make this game deep, it doesnt work. Just fly around with a minigun wrecking anything you touch.
8787	1	a	I picked up this game along time back and it was unplayable so after looking at it again what an inprovment great game good job team!
8789	1	a	It's a mindless shooter. Reminds me of nazi zombies from Call of Duty series. Waves of dinos to kill, points to score and spend on guns and upgrades. I wouldn't pay $60 for it - maybe 4 years ago I would've. Graphics are kinda dated... but $#!t it was 99 cents!
8791	1	a	Been a fun game to play from the start, should try it too it is only 0,99 cents..
8793	1	a	LETS KILL SOME FREAKIN DINOSAURS AND STOP PLAYING...........3 hours later. I USED MY TIME MACHINE TO KILL REAL DINOSAURS but then died
8795	1	a	This game consists of killing hoards and hoard of dinosaurs, its great, it has a solo or an online mode
2730	0	a	...
8797	1	a	Bought it for 0,49â‚¬, no regrets.  Have you ever felt the desire to fight unlimited waves of dinosaurs? Well, here you go!  Pretty basic horde gameplay that wears off pretty quickly but I mean, what are we to expect a lot from a game that was less than 1â‚¬?`  Great to play when you are extremely bored, downloading something or if you don't have access to the internet for a bit (kinda like a last resort)  11/10
2731	0	a	This game needs alot of work, feels clunky and unfinished. Would not recommend this to anyone.
8799	1	a	what did you expect when you paid a dollar for a game. that being said its a good way to kill time with freinds. 10/10
2732	0	a	Played it once, uninstalled, no regrets.
8801	1	a	It's like a killing floor, pretty much but with more tech and dinosaurs. Much more mobile than killing floor too. For 74 cents (During sales or even lower!) or 99 cents this game is hard to pass over. Think twice before you judge a game due to it's low pricing. Although killing floor has more of challenge to it. This is fun and somewhat challenging. I'd buy this instead of killing floor to be honest.
8803	1	a	I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO OTHERS. IT IS AWESOME.
8805	1	a	Worth every single penny, Great time waster, Awesome multiplayer fun, and the most amazing level and weapons system ive seen in a game so cheap!
8807	1	a	Dinosaurs. Lightsabers. Cheap. Fun. What more could you ask for?
8809	1	a	Fun game with lots of vehicles like mechs tanks hovercrafts and helicopters ,also lots of different weapons addjustable difficulty levels, a solid server system and summarized a little fun game defenetly worth 74cent.
8811	1	a	Halo with dinosaurs. They didn't even try to pretend it wasn't.
8813	1	a	Do you like flying around in a futuristic robot suit? Do you like sneaking behind dinosaurs and killing them off with a knife? Do you like playing as a T-Rex and eating your friends while you're at it?  Then this game is for you!  - Although repetitive, the game does not fail to bring surprises in every session (wait for that huge pumpkin man). - I like the big dinosaurs that spawn every now and then (TRex, Triceratops, Stegosaurus, etc). - The vehicles are a great way of traveling around the map especially when objectives are far from the base. - The AI is actually quite smart when you play solo. They know how to ride vehicles (given you're the one who's driving), and they know what to do and when to do it. - There are only three classes to choose from, and this might discourage some from purchasing the game. - The game is actually quite cheap for what it is. - There is no single-player campaign, but there are single-player game modes. - It's like Dino D-Day future style, but with lots of game modes.
2734	0	a	It feels like its missing a reason to play/continue playing other than to see how broken it feels.
8815	1	a	It's sort of like the dinosaur child of Borderlands and Killing Floor. That said, it feels like it was made by a small team. This is not a problem, since the price is so dang low.
8817	1	a	This game is great and it's only for $1.
8819	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Pterodactyls. 11/10
8821	1	a	I should by all means, not be enjoying myself.  The textures are quite subpar, GUI is of sketchy quality, animations when viewing another player is non existent, it still runs on DX9, and the list goes on and on and on.  But I can't bring myself to hate this game, it is just so much fun.   The idea of killing dinosaurs in a survival setting with teammates is absolutely great, and the gameplay is something I can't really describe with words other than fun incarnate. This is way more fun than it should be. Dare I say that this is more fun than most recent Call of Duty game, and when you consider that all of that is done at a very low price, this is a game that is worthy of being added to the Library.  Seriously, just buy it. It's cheap and it's a great game, what more do you want?
8823	1	a	For its price, it's absolutely a crime not to purcahse it
2735	0	a	this game suckss i want my money backk
2736	0	a	When the T-Rex roars your ears will bleed, no matter your sound settings.  12/10
8825	1	a	Grinding on a T-Rex back while shootaring other mighty dinos in da face with my epic 'kill-all-these-mighty-dinos-gun', awesome stuff!  would recommend, 2/1!
8827	1	a	This is a fun time killer! No plot, no mystery, and for shooter fans, no learning curve.  Loads fast and play is fun.  I call this a win.
8829	1	a	become invisible and stab dinosaurs in the back 10/10
8831	1	a	I rarely understand what is happening in this game.  But â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it: Dinosaurs.
8833	1	a	This game is one of the best fps I've ever played, I've seen games worth way, way less then this and they cost about $30.00 to $60.00 and this is only $1.00
8835	1	a	Honestly, at first I thought this game might be total crap since I played the alpha and that blew. As I've spent the last few nights playing this game I've come to love it. Survival mode is where its at.
8837	1	a	It's okay, but I got bored after a while :c One of those games where I wish I can give it a neutral recommendation.
8839	1	a	Fun with friends
8841	1	a	Great online fps game, highly recommend, fun as hell played it all night!
8843	1	a	ORION: Prelude is one of the best games I have ever played thats under 15 dollars. This game should be $10.00, definitly would recomend. Buy it.
2740	0	a	This game should not have the single player tag. Game is not intuitive. I see a lot of weapons sitting there, but there is no key to pick them up. I will investigate the forums if I ever decide to try this game again.  There was a response to a question about playing solo in the forums:  'The short answer is: Yes.  You'll not be able to level up and unlock equipment, you won't get achievements, the game is much more fun to play with other people and more difficult to play alone.'
8845	1	a	Actually enjoyable and the for the price you get alot.
8847	1	a	Honestly, this game is really good. The gameplay isn't too bad, albeit a bit buggy. However, one thing to keep in mind. Yes, this game is buggy, but so was Dead Island. The difference is, Dead Island is $20.00, and this is $0.99. It has decent multiplayer, and replayability. So, I have to say, for being under a dollar, this game is incredible.
8849	1	a	Find some friends, buy the four pack, you won't regret it!
8851	1	a	Very fast pace, comes with bots (THANK GOD), would be extremely fun to play with a group of people, and it's on sale right now. Get this if you have an extra dollar. It's well worth it.
8853	1	a	Basically Halo maps copied and pasted with a ton of dinosaurs added in. The fact that it's 59p makes that okay. 
8855	1	a	I played a game with bots, I had fun, killing dinosaurs is surprisingly satisfying. The bots are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ though. And the textures look like they were made in Paint. Then again, I payed 70 cents for this, I don't know what I expected.
8857	1	a	Awesome game.... its an incomplete game but a lot of fun with friends and good time pass for a $1 you can't more than that...Recommended if you are bored playing FPS games and want to try out some jurrasic park kinda game  8/10
8859	1	a	1-Make sure you buy weapons xD   2-Let others hit the flying birds. lel  3-fun to play.
8861	1	a	Picked up 4 copies for 2 bucks, got hours of fun with my friends.
8863	1	a	I don't understand why most people hate this game.  -Dinosaurs -Jetpacks -Guns, vehicles, perks -&lt;Â£1 -Oh and did I mention dinosaurs and jetpacks?  WHAT'S NOT TO LOVE
8865	1	a	This game got renamed a couple of times:  ORION: Protoype  ORION: Open Source  Orion: Dino Beatdown Orion: Dino Horde Orion: Prelude &lt;-- currently  But you know what they keep updating the game which is good to see from a developer. It doesnt feel like a complete game but then again what game does? It's almost like one of those games it's bad but it's so good. For one dollar its lots of fun. One these games that you have to try for a bit and play it once a week with friends. Its one of those coop games that you can just sit back relax and have fun. It's not a game where you can play hours and hours and scream at people for being bad. Not a competivie game. The game has aspects of Killing Floor and L4D with waves of dinosaurs. If you like those type games you will like this. People are friendly and its even better with friends.  Gave 4 copies to my friends so we can have a break from CSGO from now and then. And did I mention its only $1... like sheeeet.  Graphics: Its from the Unreal Engine 3. So it could be better.  Game Modes : Survial - Defend against wave of dinosaurs Conquest - Muliple Bases to Defend Vital - 5v5 PvP protect your base while destory the enemy base Capture the Flag - Capture the Flag Ramage - PvP Dinos Vs Carriers  Team Elimination - 5v5 PvP Team Duel - 5v5 Swords and Bows Free for All - Deathmatch King of the Hill - Machine Guns and Flamethrowers Gun Game Slaughter - Every 25 kills you are offered new weapon  1v1 Duel  FFA Duel Instagib
8867	1	a	very pretty, very flashy, very fun with freinds. it's as if halo classic was remade with dinosars. the animations are meh, and the previous versions were a mess, but i think this one is juuust right
8869	1	a	orion is the greatest game I've played this year
8871	1	a	Ridiculously low price, has a lot of potential.  seriously why wouldn't you play a game that costs only a dollar but is over 2gb of dinosaurs?!!?
8873	1	a	I remember buying this for like $3.00. Now it's not even a buck. I feel ripped off. 10/10
2742	0	a	fun, but could be alot better
8875	1	a	this game is great for the price.
8877	1	a	This game. It is just simply amazing.   I came into it with the most low hopes I've ever had. It was cheap as hell and everyone was making fun of the people who voted for it to be on the community sale. I decided to see what all the uproar was about and made the 5 dime plunge. Plugged in my 360 controller (supported) and to my delight, the game handled brilliantly. The controls are nice and tight. With sprinting, crouching, sliding, jumping, jetpacking... the works. It feels like many a AAA shooter I've played in the past.  Nothing is really explained. You have to dive in head first and just experience it. It plays like a mix of Dungeon Defenders + Sanctum + Turok = WHAT COULD YOU POSSIBLY COMPLAIN ABOUT.  Seriously though, buy the 4 pack and give the copies to some like minded buddies for a weekend (or much, much more) of zany bliss.
8879	1	a	TEAMATE DOWN AREHREWBHRBWEKRHNJF
8881	1	a	It's a good game for how cheap it is and if you have a bunch of friends playing it can be a laugh. However it would be nice if the devs implemented some gun sounds xD
8883	1	a	This game is bad. BUT it is also  fun . There are many horribly bad games that you can enjoy, especially with a friend. And this is one of those games. Just grab a friend or two and play without thinking about it and you will find yourself having a good time even though you know that you shouldn't enjoy it.
2745	0	a	Can't say I really enjoyed my time with it.
8885	1	a	Hey doode? Want to go on a dino safari? Then jump in my jeep and go!   Seriously - it's the best Road Kill adventure that you mayhave in any game.  I pretty frakking gurantee you will lauch you pants off.  Also for this price, everyone who hates this game - I will run you over personally and take your hands!
8887	1	a	Good for 50 cents.
8889	1	a	this game is not bad at all its got some lag to it but it is fun!!
8891	1	a	A little like Killing Floor from when I played before Prelude came out. It's pretty teamwork based with the dinos being creatively made and separately challenging. Smooth graphics and large marketplace for in-game upgrades and perks.
8893	1	a	Interesting Type Of Game
8895	1	a	WOW. Just wow! I bought it for a friend and myself when it was only 50 cents. Honestly I just had waaaaaay more fun than many expensive games could ever give me. I [absolutely] recommend this game. Its easy to learn, its hard to master. Its managing your money for skills, weapons or vehicles, and when you die, you lose your bought skills and weapons, but the weapons are still at the place where you died. It's absolutely 100% impossible if you try this game alone. Luckily, there are many servers and different game mode. It also is very easy to setup a server yourself, that friends can join. I have never...EVER given a game higher than an 7. 9/10 for general 10/10 in my experience
8897	1	a	9/10 Is not that fps friendly but is plenty of fun
8899	1	a	This game is like Killing Floor,but for autistic halo spartans with the aim control of a stormtrooper.   Its like bad,but not the good type of bad  Its like Halo,but not Halo  Its like Dota 2,but without the Dota and the 2  Its like Call of Duty,but more teamwork  Its like watching cartoons,but all of it is Hebrew dubbed  Imagine a world,where anything you do makes u go into The Matrix  Think of a really good cupcake,then later during the digestive process it gives u AIDS  Think of a newborn,cute baby girl,and it dies when it sees your face  Imagine if a Holocaust documentary,was funny as all hell  And last,think about moshing at a Wiggles Concert  Its that hardcore...... 9 chopped of Dino-â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ outa/10
8901	1	a	Best game ever, the Birdemic of video games
2747	0	a	While there is nothing actually wrong with this game, there is just no reason why I would want to play it over left 4 dead, killing floor, or TF2's MVM. It's OK but if you're in the mood for horde killing there are better games out there.
8903	1	a	+This game exceeded all expectations for 39p this game was well worth it's weight in gold and i would even go as far as to say this game is better than most full priced crap out there.   -Microtransactions.
8905	1	a	The game has a broken rocket launcher and super glitchy cars with rocket boosters, nothing more needs to be said.  10/10 would play again for hilariousness
8907	1	a	nice game for couple hours of gaming or when you bored and very cheap 8/10
8909	1	a	cant get my money back 10/666
8911	1	a	gotta pewpew those dinos
8913	1	a	I like the game, though don't expect a whole lot of depth. It's fun for $1, so I would recommend it for that price.
8915	1	a	Buy it! You can even byu it for friends! It seems weird at the beginning, but you will start to like it!
8917	1	a	if you have any comment to add / correct me, please post it   I played on 'normal' to start, and it was a bad idea. i died fast, even if i had money, but i had no idea what to do with them. i STRONGLY suggest you play the first ~ 4-8 levels on newb. that way you have a decent chance to learn and still get a feel of the game.  most of the waves are 'survive'. with 60 seconds pause in wich to check the store to see what you could buy. unfortunately, the 'store' is 2 stores, sometimes so far apart, you HAVE to choose wich one to visit, because you will have NO chance of visiting both. after those 60 seconds, the store literally teleports you out and closes the doors  there are dinos that don't belong to waves, so don't be surprised to see one, and don't waste your time.  once you buy a weapon, you discard the weapon you previously had. except if you buy the augment that allows you to have 2 of that weapon, in wich case you discard the oldest of the 2 weapons that you have  each game you start with a pistol (unless you get something better from lvl up), and you have to buy everything  i strongly suggest you buy the following (your choice in wich order): weapon store: -better pistol. the only gun with unlimitted ammo, so even if it's low rate of fire, don't underestimate it. with higher levels you will get a better starting pistol -main weapon. i saw only 2 tipes: auto and sniper. get one, has much higher rate of fire than a pistol -secondary weapon: shotguns. i am not a fan of up close and personal, so i have no suggestion here, if this is a usefull item -double damage, higher ROF, faster reload, double capacity clip. each costs 5k -adrenaline weapon. see bugs -the longbow adrenaline weapon has many types of tips that can be changed with the reload button: armor piercing (infinite ammo), explosive (sticks to the enemy if is direct hit) explodes after ~ 2 seconds, smoke (the enemy can't see through it), and EMP (weird enough, works backwards: REPAIRS machines and generator and stuns enemies). all arrows that are not AP have 2 max capacity but replenish ~ 1 each 5-10 seconds -turret. the bloody thing lasts 60 seconds, but it shoots most of the little dinos right away. has cooldown until you can set up the next of 120 seconds. so.... don't set one up at the end of a wave, because the pause is 60 seconds. costs 20k. see bugs note: you can have just one of the following: machinegun / flamethrower / rocket turret, cryo knife, repair gun (works on vehicles and generator), instant revival gun -extra life and ammo. used automaticly. cost 500 each. basicly you can't restock the ammo otherwise, so the ammo one might be a choice you have to make most waves  augmentation store: -volverine: HP regen. 'nuff said -double armor. i don't know if that is 'armor' (as the game states) or 'shield' (because it regenerates if you leave it a while) -25% more accuracy -more energy. VERY usefull for use of the special each class has -ability to have 2 pistols / secondary weapon / primary weapon / adrenaline weapon. i think each one costs 5k. see bugs -50% more ca$$$h drop. 'nuff said  there are other choices, it's up to you if you want to bother to get more  bugs (or as microsoft would call them, 'features'): -when you buy a weapon (by mistake, for example) the previous weapon is LOST. you have to pay AGAIN for it.  -when you buy an adrenaline weapon, you lose the primary weapon. i found that it does not happen if you already bought the augmentations to have 2 primary and 2 adrenaline. edit: it still happends, even if i buy all augments. no idea why. the weapons are not lost, just dropped INSIDE the weapon shop = useless edit 2: apparently i buy augmentation for a second primary weapon and a second adrenaline weapon and i can use just 1 primary and 3 adrenaline.  -when you set up the turret, for those 60 seconds the adrenaline weapons and the sniper rifle is no longer available with the scroll of the mouse. maybe it is available with the keyboard, did not have time to check. -don't touch the generator with a vehicle. instant loss of the vehicle :( -grenades and teleporter NOT available with the scroll of the mouse -some augmentations can be bought twice. or at least payed for twice. so look carefully what is bought and what is not. -visor does not freeze augmentation does NOT work. worst 7500 i ever spent  the 'hover' augmentation is... very limitted in use. buy it if you are bored to death and have money to throw away  when a player is 'dead' (1 HP) a team player can revive him or he can revive himself if he kills an enemy (so the smaller ones are very usefull because they die fast). unfortunately in that condition the player can move very slowly and use only the pistol (or heal gun, if the class is medic)
8919	1	a	Basically Jurassic Park. Those huge dinosaurs are super freaky.
8921	1	a	- Fun for a buck.   -The opposite of how it feels to buy a slice of gas station pizza in the middle of nowhere because you're hungry, and as you eat it, begin thinking clearer about what just happened; you went and paid 3.50 for a slice of pizza (which was the only slice left in the warming display) that you would normally not eat unless one of your buddies gave you 5 or 10 bucks on a dare, because the thing is so dried up and stiff you could more feasibly use it as a shield for being attacked by an aggressive cat with KHAJI'IT-sharp claws rather than consider it a source of nutrition.   Don't let my play time fool you, I really had fun after the whole Prelude update, I could see more life being breathed into the game. It seems the devs are very active, the community has a pulse, for my brief experience the rounds played at a fun pace. Likely, I'll play much more one day but I can only focus on a limited amount of games at any given time, and I'm more of a single-player, grind to get achievements, story mode gamer.   It's a freickieng dollar when it's full price. Just get it because, you can pay 10-20 times that amount for a game you will NOT EVER enjoy as much as this game!   Or, don't get it yet- It's going to be a dollar (or less), forever!   
8923	1	a	really fun would reccomend to others thrilling game modes and detail.
8925	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ seal, that's all.
8927	1	a	its a great game 
8929	1	a	It alright for a dollar i guess.
8931	1	a	game of the year every year
8933	1	a	the game is a fast fun shotting game where you run around and shoot dinosaurs its really fun if you got a group to play with ii was the best 1 dollar i ever spent on a game that was so good i have spent more money on games that are worse belive me i injoyed this one
8935	1	a	This could be a great game, just needs some more maps, and a little refinement.  Right now though, with some friends, you could have a blast in the co-op. reminds me a lot of Unreal Tourny but with big dinosaurs to take down..   And cant beat this price.. your 'Dollar to Enjoyment' ratio is definitely higher than most of the games in your library right now.  
8937	1	a	It has dinosaurs Otherwise, really laggy, no story, repetitive. 12/10-dinos
8939	1	a	If you've ever wanted a cheap, fun, multiplayer wave survival game to play with friends, this is it. It has some quirks to learn, and it's no AAA title, but my friends and I have gotten about 25 hours out of it so far, and we consider it well worth what we paid for it.
8941	1	a	The game is bland, and not too interesting, though it has nice graphics. Would I recommend it to people? Well, it's cheap! Especially if you get it on sale. At the time of this writing, it was only 49 cents. That's less that the cost of a candy bar...Yea, it's worth that! Regular price? I wouldn't bother with it.
8943	1	a	its not that great for a game. but it is what its being advertised. 5/5 stars
2750	0	a	I played this game on a free weekend and still thought it was a waste of time. The game was just terribly set out, I have to run for 15 minutes to get to some random checkpoint and I wasn't sure why, the guns all feel similar, the dinosaurs don't even feel particularily fun to fight. You can get the game for less than 50p right now, and I'd say it still isn't worth it.
8945	1	a	The game is fun and it pays itself with trading cards. 10/10 would sell cards again.
2751	0	a	More bugs than Goat Simulator
2752	0	a	I thought 'What the hell its 50 cents I can probably get an hour of fun out of it.' Boy was I wrong. I think that I'd get more enjoyment out of a 50 cent piece of bubble gum from the grocery store. It's that staggeringly bad. I decided to do a little research and found out that this game changes its name whenever reviews get bad.. Also, the only reason that it is as highly voted as it is is due to the fact that the developers spam the steam reviews with bots. Man this is just a pathetic excuse for a game. I don't even know where to start; so I won't... just trust me, you don't want this piece of sh*t anywhere near your computer. Go buy a piece of freaking bubble gum.
8947	1	a	I honestly thought it would be a bad game, but i have had a lot of fun so far in the few hours i have played this game. It is worth the 1$ and when you play with friends the experience is much much better.  Plus it is litterally ALL Zombie shooters like COD Zombies, Left 4 Dead, etc except with Futuristic weapons, vehicles and WITH FREAKING DINOSAURS!! Sometimes the game is a little glitchy, but it is nothing bad.  8.5/10
8949	1	a	This game is really fun. I've only played it a bit but its really addicting.
8951	1	a	This game is great. it like a cheaper call of duty, it was many of the same features and its easy to set up a server with friends
8953	1	a	Everything I wanted and more
8955	1	a	Dinosaurs, Halo, and Tribes
8957	1	a	Enjoyably Fun 11/10 would Exticnt again
8959	1	a	This game is by no means a sophisticated shooter. It is however a fun spray and play kind of game. Ideal for a LAN and to just shoot and drink a few.  Bang for buck, most definitely!
8961	1	a	this game is soo cheap that i recomended that you should buy it cuz so cod graphics u can even 360 no 4325432 no scope in the game if you added hacks to yea, cheap 99 cents mlg pro sniper gamex. recomended to be a mlg game. included dinos but u can no scope player also
8963	1	a	For what i payed i'm proud to have bought a 4 pack and getting my crew started in this game! This has been one of the most impressive alpha progression i've seen. Also there is a bigger project behind this and from what they offre us here i c'ant wait the see the rest! One of my best alpha investments. Thanks to the dev.crew for such dedicated work! 9/10 !!!!!!!!!
8965	1	a	the soundtrack i9n this game is so awesome!!! the prehistoric mode is awesome too i like to put the dinos health and damage to 25%:p
2754	0	a	Game is buggy, crashed and DCes during games. One crash caused me to lose my progress. Would not recomend.
8967	1	a	How did i manage to review this game? I don't own it.
8969	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game not even worth it graphics animations suck â™¥â™¥â™¥, the dinosaurs move if they were robotic slow peaces of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. totally wouldnt even recommend the dumb game waste of time blow this game up &lt;.
8971	1	a	For 50 cents, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it, not a bad game.
8973	1	a	I just sold some cards on the marketplace and bought this game with the profits, lol. So cheap. I have played this game when it was free for a weekend. Awesome fun and well worth the 49 cent price tag.
2758	0	a	The game is broken. 2 out of 3 times I tried opening this game it put me in a black screen, in which I could not alt+tab out of it. When I did get it to work it was impossible to join a friend's game lobby, since either it could not be found, or when I could find it and joined the lobby it put me in a blank screen. Not even worth $.50.
8975	1	a	I was killed by invisible man with egg in his hands... best game evah !!  15/11 -IGN
8977	1	a	Just gives me a black screen biggest waste of 40p 10/10
8979	1	a	11/10 the voice acting is god-like and the game is cheap as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ recommended
8981	1	a	got this for me AND my friend for $1.60. very fun, you buy weapons and fight dinosaurs
2759	0	a	If you have 50 cents, buy this game. If you don't give this game a good review the devs will re-release and change the name.
8983	1	a	It's $1 and a very well done, fun game.
8985	1	a	Erm. Dinosaurs, jetpacks, vehicles and a lightsaber? For less than Â£1? So damn sold!
2760	0	a	If you have a few hours to waste and $1 to spare, its ok. If it wasn't so cheap I'd say its a waste of time, sell some cards and buy this is you absolutely have to, otherwise don't bother.
8987	1	a	This game, with the right group of friends, provides an amazing return on enjoyment for the cost. It brings back memories of playing Halo 2 co-op on XBox with it's graphics and gameplay, but also the enjoyment and replayability of L4D2. I can play the same maps over and over with friends and always have a different game.  One day I'll get trampled by a Triceratops, but kill it with one hit point left with my pistol, ala Saving Private Ryan. The next day I'll take to the skies in a helicopter and save my medic-playing friend from the hoard of raptors she had missed while fixing the generator. The day after that, I'll track a nasty pteranodon carefully with my sniper rifle and line up an expert shot, only to be picked up by a completely different one, dropped in the middle of the fight, and quickly eaten by a Spinosaurus.  The game's difficulty is easy to control. If you're looking to relax, pop it on Easy and add some ambient dinos in a Conquest map, and spend two whole campaigns blasting T-Rex's with a tank. Or if you want a challange, throw it on Expert and dive into a King of the Hill map with equally skilled opponents. The maps are wide, beautiful, and varied, and there's plenty of details to catch every time you play. There's something to be said about mowing down rapters in the middle of an arctic wasteland only to have your visor freeze up with ice. There's something to be said about wondering where the hell you're taking damage from in a huge rain storm until you finally clue in and punch that nasty ankle-biter to death.  The game is glitchy at times. Some days it wouldn't let me join or host multiplayer maps, and that issue resolved itself without me figuring out why. Changing game settings while the game is active will crash it entirely. However, I've yet to have a single issue once I've actually gotten into a game and just kept playing. I would heavily recommend this game to any group of friends who are looking for a way to casually stay up until 4 in the morning, accidentally. That fun. That well made.
8989	1	a	Best FPS I have ever played. Easy to access servers, and sooooo addicting. The only downside, is you have to deal with graphics easily just as good as GTA III. Honestly, I dont care about graphics in a game, so it does'nt bother me, but if you are addicted to COD, then you'll most likly not enjoy this game, but you have to remember, it's only $0.99. Best game I have played in a LOOOOONNG time.
2762	0	a	It's fun for a bit but missing some content.
8991	1	a	This game is the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥! Buy it and derp with friends!
8993	1	a	There's no reason not to buy it when its not on sale. You shoot dinosaurs.
8995	1	a	79 pence, it's actually a good game!
8997	1	a	This version is just awesome, enough talking, I need to play more...
8999	1	a	I never in a million years thought I would be dino poop in space. 11/10.
9001	1	a	dino glitch twerking sim 20XX
9003	1	a	Orion: Prelude is an FPS dinosaur-based game. It feels like it takes place in the future.  The gameplay is designed well, and there is a large variety of maps to play on. The dinosaurs are spot-on, and the objectives make the game a lot more fun. There is a multiplayer function, but it sometimes won't work. This game has tons of potential. Especially for a game that costs $0.99. It is easily worth the one dollar.  Pros: Great gameplay Well designed guns, maps and enemies Helpful upgrades Challenging objectives Large variety  Cons: Multiplayer may get a bit shaky. For me, atleast.  Overall: 9.4/10
9005	1	a	This is not a good game, by any stretch of the imagination.  There's presentation and UI issues, the art assets are super bland, awful voice work etc.  But holy cow it has space marines shooting dinosaurs.  Get it when its on sale, buy copies for your friends. Load up a server, fly around on jetpacks shooting raptors and stegos with guns and mechs and tanks and VTOL aircraft.   Just have a good old time.
9007	1	a	i played this game some time ago and from what i remember this game is awsome i played for 3-4 hours at a time
9009	1	a	Brilliant. Dinos + unreal. One of the greatest PC games of all time, also the cheapest game I've ever bought (was even discounted for multi-buy). Amazing. 20/10
9011	1	a	might just be the best fun I ever had for 60p and workshop too .. also it plays great on a pad for chilling back on the couch . Never been a big fan of survival fps but this game alone is changing that :)
9013	1	a	dis, dis is a good game, buy it, it cheap,buy it ,it is like aneling youurself with a fineliner 
2763	0	a	worst game ever lol
9015	1	a	Fun and cheap.
9017	1	a	good game dino killing fun with head blasting hilarousnes trex and pterdactyle probobly the harder ones but thats whats good it adds variety and challenge thats whats good but its got its bads like a glitch where i hit a rock flying my jetpack i got downed and i fell into there and for about a minute i was coming back down and i already before i hit the grownd but thats me its really good try it
9019	1	a	Just Like My childhood dreams.....KILLING F****** DINOSAURS
9021	1	a	There simply aren't enough games with dinosaurs &amp; even fewer of these that are actually worth playing! For me, Orion: Prelude (O:P) is that rare exception. Although not much in way of a story in the game (no single player after all), there is quite a tale on how Orion came to be the game it is today...  The short version is, that O:P is an evolution of previous Orion titles, Dino Horde &amp; Dino Beatdown originally dating back to a successful 2011 Kickstarter campaign. Although recieving early criticism (that would normally kill a game ..dead.. disappearing into obscurity), the game continued to evolve with constant updates (big &amp; small) over the years from the developers. Spiral stuck with it! This dedication &amp; gradual refinement of the game has resulted in an excellent first-person co-op experience, with a well rounded collection of modes, weapons, enviromental effects, vehicles &amp; more to enjoy.   PvP isn't forgotten; it's also selectable. PvP feels more alike to a retro deathmatches, than a modern PvP (in a good way!), but I mainly enjoy the co-op modes. In co-op, you essentially have to defend your power core against waves of bloodthursty dinosaurs. Dinosaur kills will reward you credits, which you can use to buy perks &amp; weapon upgrades, in-turn helping you survive the later, harder waves. Some waves also have you securing objectives. Co-op doesn't feel ultra competitive, most of the time you don't watch your credits/kills, rather finding yourself just having fun surviving &amp; helping your teammates! I've found the community to generally be helpful &amp; friendly in-game too.  One of the real stand-out features in O:P has to be the enviromental effects randomly cycling on the alien world. From the day/night cycles to the extreme variety of climates &amp; types of weather. Adds so much to the atmosphere. Couple this with excellent lighting effects through what seems to be a thicker atmosphere and the results can sometimes be spectacular! Even overwhelming! You definitely get that feeling when your final wave gets a night cycle with heavy rain .. you know you are gonna see an epic close quarter battle!  Along with the awesome effects, there are 3 distinct classes to mix-up the gameplay. Each has unique strengths &amp; each you can progress/level-up in online play to unlock starting weapons, power-ups &amp; perks. Initial learning curve isn't steep, so once you get the hang of the basic flow it becomes very easy to sink multiple hours killing dinos! O:P rarely feels like a grind; even at lower levels (without a lot of perks) you competently kill dinos &amp; gain good XP. Plenty of dinos to go around too :)  If you can't find a friend to play with, there is also bot-support added in O:P to fill the ranks. This can be helpful to get playing quickly if server populations are low (which regrettably does happen).  The trilogy of classes are well balanced (no need for any other classes), as is the gameplay in general. Difficulty is super scalable. Weapons are mainly shared between classes so quickly become familiar, and vehicles are easy to use &amp; offer a good range of practical &amp; destructive uses. Repetitive? Sure, to a degree, it is the same thing over &amp; over and despite there being a lot of 'accessories' to the spice up the character classes &amp; tactics, modes etc, there are not a huge number of maps for each mode. I expect this will change soon with Steam Workshop support being added.  The A.I. generally employed by the dinosaurs is a fairly basic 'rush' tactic, which can feel pretty predictable (there are a few surprises though), but I find the larger dino numbers to counteract this limitation to a degree anyway. There are also the occasional technical glitches like querky physics (flying Stegosaurus anyone?) or clipping inside a dinosaur. Nothing game-breaking that I have experienced, but sure does make for some funny moments! Just like my many failed attempts at some of the more creative 'Ride a Dino for 10secs' &amp; 'Slap T-Rex 100 times' achievements :)  O:P reminds me a bit of those classic, simple shooters like a Serious Sam or Left 4 Dead, but with a bit of high-tech sci-fi flavor. This future-tech feel across the game contradicts the jurassic era dinosaurs &amp; remote wilderness landscapes nicely! O:P is not as complex mechanically or technically when compared to a top end AAA FPS, but its simplicity is also its underlying strength. It is great value ($1!), has strong replayability and the focused, balanced gameplay (some bonus ..ahem.. querks) offers a truely fun &amp; intense, dino killin' co-operative survival experience!    Too much to read?   Yeah ok then (fair call lol)..   I'll let Dave Chappelle quickly summarise what O:P is really all about:   *this game in a nutshell  Community Created Artwork for ORION: Prelude By: Grayscars (original artwork uploaded by Grayscars!)
9023	1	a	Good game to play with friends.
9025	1	a	I find this game for the price and for gameplay actually amusing and worth the buck. It's silly but fun at the same time and does bring a few good laughs when playing with friends. You're not meant to take this seriously and that is what makes it even better, graphics are not an issue and slaying millions of dinosaurs by punching them in the face or just blowing their brains out or piercing them with arrows is pretty damn entertaining. I'd say buy it fot you can't really go wrong with a buck you probably gained from selling steam cards anyways and if you just want something to pass the time and/or to relieve stress by killing prehistoric beasts then go right ahead.
9027	1	a	Survive waves of dinos. Different game modes with 3 different classes and a nice variety of enemies. Plenty of guns to choose from. A lil buggy but a solid game for a very cheap price. Such and underrated game.
9029	1	a	I like this game. Especially when i play it with my friends. Maybe they can add weapon attachment customization system.
9031	1	a	A T-Rex crushed me while I tried to punch it to death. 8/8 would lag again
2766	0	a	It's so glitchy and unoptimized. I wouldn't bother purchasing it.
9033	1	a	played one game, got picked up by a birdosaur 10/10
9035	1	a	this game was fun! i paid 50 cents for it and i love it!  its perfect for a simple shooter with your friends, theres several different game modes, differnt classes of waepons, bunch of maps. its perfect for getting into shooters its not to complicated and its not too bad looking either~  definatly worth a the dollar it costs~
9037	1	a	Perfect game for $.99, Lots of fun with friends.
2768	0	a	Whats the objective? what are the controls? lets find out *mashes all the buttons one by one*
9039	1	a	Best $1 I've ever spent! Good graphics, good co op, a lot of game modes and maps... and a fantastic price
9041	1	a	fun game to mess around in and its so cheep
9043	1	a	')
9045	1	a	10/10 would punch a T-Rex in the mouth again.
9047	1	a	A stegosaurus was coming right for me, but I was okay because I cloaked at the last second. 150000/10
2770	0	a	The game is on the verge of being likable which is what makes it worse.
9049	1	a	It is awesome you can play multi-player single player co-op. i have played it for 23 hours in total. that is good for 79p      
2771	0	a	Wow this game is bad..... 
9051	1	a	Not bad for its price, a good spread of weaponary and boosts. I decent escape from the average FPS.
9053	1	a	Think about this, this game is cheaper than a bar of chocolate. A bar of chocolate is satisfying but only for a short while as after you eat it, it's gone. Orion: Prelude on the other hand is a game meaning that it has a practically infinite amount of usage, and if shooting dinosaurs in the face is not satisfying to you then I don't know what is.
9055	1	a	I bought this game for my friends and I as a joke yet it turned into most of our favorites. Great graphics, controls, and gameplay made this an amazing buy for a dollar. It's sad that there aren't that many players because this game deservers a lot more players than it haves.
9057	1	a	It is really fun. I don't see why everybody is rating it badly, it never crashes and is really fun to play. totally buy it.
9059	1	a	You won't get a better game for this price. Its not a bad FPS, Now with the workshop it'll have an entire community of people working to create maps, textures, weapons, missions. for Â£2 or $3 for a four pack, you really should buy this and get your buddies in on the insanity. You won't regret it for this price. Its almost criminal not to buy it.
9061	1	a	Orion: prelude is very cheap game , but don't fool yourself saying if the game is cheap the gameplay is also cheap, no , it just doesn't happen to meet up in Orion: prelude, the game is very fun and I can see people are already addicted to it and it is just a great game.  For 1 dollar , you get minimum 140-160 hours of gameplay out of it , that's why I want to recommend this game , cheap price , long game. You won't find this aspect in most games in our days. I can ensure someone will play 200-300 hours... is it you ,reader? XD
9063	1	a	ORION: Prelude is a fun game, with friends or with the bots. Sure there are more problems with the game than I would wish, but for $0.99 there isn't anything to complain about.
9065	1	a	$1 to get rekt so hard by a dino you break the map 10/10
9067	1	a	Fun Shooters. I was hoping I could become the Dinosaurs lol. But anyway, fun games to be played with friends or family.
9069	1	a	This game is a beacon of peace and love. Here you see carnivores and herbivores working together, to kill you. Creatures that are natural enemies put their diferences aside to achieve a common goal, and it's beautiful.
9071	1	a	Cmon man what are you even looking at the reviews ? You can shoot waves of dino's !!! This game is simply a good game and it's .99 just buy this XD
9073	1	a	Dino's are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing cool!
9075	1	a	Excellent game would definetly recommend. Vehicles, Purchase system, Jetpack, Dinosaurs, Co-operative play, and a great price of Â£0.79.
2773	0	a	by far the worst halo simulator ive ever seen. i mean my god! it violated me. it lured me inside with the promise of eye candy, why, just why!  (only took a few minutes to realise it was just awful)
9077	1	a	It's a very good game. Fast paced action similiar to old school shooters, really fun to play.
2775	0	a	DONT BUY THIS GAME EVEN FOR 99 CENTS IT IS BAD IT WILL MAKE YOU HAVE FAT CHODE
9079	1	a	I would recomend this masterpiece :)
2776	0	a	A terrible shooter that not even dinosaurs could save.
2777	0	a	Only play this if you have a good computer. Please look at minumim requirements for your computer and if you can run it. It was so laggy for me.
9081	1	a	killed a tyranausaurus with a revolver 11/10
2778	0	a	Worst game ever. Like, NOTHING in this game works, except for the singleplayer. But that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ain't balanced AT ALL. 'Look at me! I've got a jetpack to fly places you can't hit me!' Assault-class all the way - eat â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Orion.
9083	1	a	Cheap, fun, tones of guns and you get to to kill Santa Claus 10/10
9085	1	a	I had so much fun with this game that I played 2 hours straight without knowing the f*cking objectives.  other than that the third person view is awkward as balls.  either way 8/10
9087	1	a	awwrrrsome LAN Party Game!    Check it out!
9089	1	a	My first play on orion prelude: &gt;enter the game &gt;take a weapon &gt;be taken by a pterodactyl &gt;dies 10/10 would fly with pterodactyl express again.
9091	1	a	A cool combination of star wars and dinasours. you can play survival mode, team deathmatch and lots of other modes, but i mostly recomend the survival mode. It is a fun game to play with friends. I thimk it can get pretty boring after a while, but for the ridiculous price, it's totaly worth it! The game runs pretty very well onmostly computers, and has good framerate. You don't need a very powerful computer to run the game in high quality. It has a few bugs with the motion of dinosours, but it is not so much that it makes the game worse. I rate this game 8/10
9093	1	a	This game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing terrible 11/10
9095	1	a	This game can be a bit hectic if you thrust into it right away but it's fun, very fun!
9097	1	a	This is the best cheapest halo clone i've ever played. They even ported in the warthog, tank, and magnum, along with mechwarrior mechs. I've gotten better value playing this rediculous game than many others in my library that cost 10-50x more.
9099	1	a	The game is a whole dollar! Buy it! But seriously, great cooperative survival/hordes game. If you like killing floor or team fortress, you're going to love this game; especially when you consider the paltry price tag. Think Halo, meets Turok, meets Killing Floor and voila you have Orion Prelude! Highly recommend purchasing it!
9101	1	a	it's a fun game with cool weapons and etc
2781	0	a	this game's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
9103	1	a	Well, I got to play this game for free on a weekend deal before the update... it was less than mediocre. But now after the patching and stuff i'd say it is fairly decent.     7/10
9105	1	a	This game is like an Arcade Machine game except that you don't have to put a coin in everytime you want to play it.  When i bought this game, i wasn't really expecting much seeing its price tag, don't expect it to have BioShock Infinite graphics or something but it's still a really good game for $0.99!  Don't be fooled by the ''Hours played'' on my profile, i played alot offline.  PROS:  * Good buy menu, diversity of equipment, items and weapons * Multiplayer, duh * Objectives and missions, not only waves like in CoD zombies   CONS:  * Driving of the vehicles, it's not that good and you have to steer with your mouse. I don't really see any other cons.  So yeah, you should definetely buy this. 
9107	1	a	A good game if you like Halo and dino games.
9109	1	a	I saw this game when it was brand new, Orion: Dino Beatdown. It was cheap and the videos and pictures I saw made the game look like one of those b-rate jewels that was so bad, it was good. By bad, I do not mean that it's a horrible game, broken and unplayable. Rather, 'bad' in a way that one would eat nutritionally void foods because they are 'good'. If you want arcade type fun and mindlessly wasting hoards of dinosaurs, then this is the game for you. It's best played with a group of friends on voice chat so you can losely communicate tactics as what to do and laugh your â™¥â™¥â™¥ off at how awesomely 'bad' this game is. Lots of connection issues, my ping is always through the roof (400+) Changing maps kicks you. Best to host a game yourself.  Breakdown: Graphics 7/10 Story 6/10 Gameplay 6/10 Reliability 5/10 Fun 9/10  Overview: Fun dinosaur shootem-up that is best played with friends and a couple drinks!
9111	1	a	Fan-fu**ing tastic game!
9113	1	a	Halo meets Dinosaurs, the warthogg and the scorpian tank are pretty good.
9115	1	a	During the 2014 Winter Sale, I bought a 4-pack for me and my friends, and we had some of the most fun and hilarious moments we've had in a while. It's not too high quality of a game, but worth $1.00 (let alone $1.50 for a 4-pack during the sale)? Hell yeah.
9117	1	a	  This game is not important for the gaming world ^^    The graphic is ok...   The fun that you have in the game is 65% :D   
9119	1	a	not recomender for low spec pc but for pc that can survive this sure realy recomended =D 
9121	1	a	Orion is a neat little game, that tries it hardest to be something that's it not. It's a strange mix of cyber and military machinery competing against prehistoric dinosaurs for control over large geological locations. Whether or not the dinosaurs or humans know they're fighting for it, you still are.  There are enough weapons and gadgets to keep you occupied for a while as you figure out which ones you like the most, but I wouldn't invest too much time into it. If you're not playing on hard difficulty, it doesn't really matter, and most strategies are taken on rambo style. Body modidications increase health, increase firing rates, jump heights and more. I've seen the deathmatch in the game, but the lack of players leaves it hard to fight for any top player space.  It's not really good, but not really bad either. I like it, but not that much. There are lots of qualities that come up and can be taken advantage of to make your game even more fun, but there's nothing entirely worth mentioning. For the price, you should get it for sure. If you played it for a day, you'd be getting your money's worth ten fold.. but again, not much more than a day.  Definetly buy it and add it to your collection of games. At the time of writing this, it's one dollar. Can't complain.
9123	1	a	But â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, it was ninety-nine cents! 0,99/0,99
9125	1	a	By far one of the best co-op shooting games ive played if not THE best. its just so riculously fun and the gameplay is fantastic. Also achievements. all kinds of achivements. u play as futuristic soldiers with jetpacks and guns slaying waves of dinosaurs. i shuldnt need to say anything more, 9/10
9127	1	a	Nice graphics good team playing game like tf2 but instead of player enemys its dinosaurs!!!
2790	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ITS A â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ YA â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ 3/3467890 POP A MOLLY UNLEASH SUPER-SAIYAN
9129	1	a	Probably one of the best games for that price, tonnes of fun and lots of achievements to be won
9131	1	a	Great game :) Don't expected an indie multiplayer/coop shooter to be that good :)
9133	1	a	I really like this one. Although the graphics aren't that great, I had lots of fun killing dinosaurs both alone and with my teammates. One of my favorite parts of the game is the wide variety of weapons you can use in-game between rounds. At first, it was a little frustrating trying to figure out some of the options the game gives us but after a while, you'll WANT to learn some of these extra features.  It's a great buy for just $1. It's definitely worth it!
2791	0	a	A nice concept, but fails on execution. So-so graphics, unbalanced gameplay, nothing to help you learn the game, empty servers and super repetitive music. Feels more like an alpha or beta rather than a finished game.
9135	1	a	you got my respect game
9137	1	a	Awesome Game. Just buy and enjoy it.
9139	1	a	Absolutely AMAZING!!!! So worth your money!! JUST GET IT IF YOU LIKE SCI-FI FPS/DINO GAMES!!!!!!! This is a great addition to your first-person shooter collection!
2793	0	a	Cheap game, so can't complain. It does feel like it was developed by some people who got bored midway and still decided to release it.
9141	1	a	It's definitely worth 99 cents. Not many people play this game. I think every game I joined we had at least 2 bots on a five man team. It's fun for 99 cents, but after playing for a bit, I can definitely see why it is 99 cents. I don't know, give it a chance I guess. You might like it and you would add to the player base because it is lacking. I guess I will recommend this because it's not terrible, and you can't beat it for 99 cents.
9143	1	a	your probaly asking is this game good? well if it was a regular 5$ or more game no its horrible but for 1 dolalr you get quite a lot you get decent graphics nice weather effects and the guns look pretty cool it has some vehicles and of course dinos which are good but sometimes are a pain to hit so if you have 1 dollar and looking to waste it look no further
9145	1	a	It seems that I can NOT buy the 4-pack for my friends, now that I have purchsed a copy for myself, just so I could check out the game before sending it on to them.   This may just be a Steam Store problem, which I think I have run into before this purchase attempt.    Merry Christmas or Happy Thanksgiving, depending on which is being advertised first in your locality.
9147	1	a	Its a fun game to play when you need them dino kills :D
9149	1	a	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pUa-Ot_jaI 
9151	1	a	awesome game for 1 dollar. Why is this game 1 dollar? not because its crap but because the devs are crazy. be warned though if your using a basic work PC this games not for you.  8.5/10
2798	0	a	Seems like if turok and halo had a baby (the first or second halo of course, because the graphics, i think that i could even run it on my celeron). The blood is bad as s**t, but... it was 0.99â‚¬ and is the type of game you'll give for your girlfriend play when she on her period, she'll love it!
9153	1	a	great raarrrr action some of graphcs dump than priminal carnage some of better.
9155	1	a	This game catches alot of flak, I'm not honestly sure why it has such a low metascore, because personally I find the game to be a really solid co-op survival game. There's nothing outstanding about the game, but the jetpacks, vehicles, guns and grenades all work fine.   Load up the game with a few friends and this is a pretty good choice for come mindless shooting fun.
9157	1	a	Its has dinosaurs and Nice VEHICLES what else can you ask for a game!!
2800	0	a	Also just 3 â‚¬ in the summer sale were too much for this game....
9159	1	a	Orion is personally a great game except it can get really easy.  Pros : Well it has Dinosaurs Lots of Weapons Cool Vehichles  Cons : Too easy Assault is OP       If you are assault you can fly on a rock and win without dieing once 
9161	1	a	More fun than a stripper with no inhibitions at a bachelor party!
9163	1	a	I liked it Great buy for 1$
9165	1	a	Killing Floor with dinos...DINOOOOOOOS :D It hink its cool, worth a try. Nothing extra just to spend time if you are bored :D
9167	1	a	Killed a huge â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing spinosaurus with a ghetto lightsaber. 11/10
9169	1	a	This game is awesome i wish more people played. Id like to see more upgrades and modes develope.
9171	1	a	i love this game and the tank is so awesome
9173	1	a	It's a fun game to play during some down time inbetween activities.
2803	0	a	I tried this when it was free to play. It is just an awful game.
9175	1	a	5 Gabens/10  This game still looks a little rusty but it wont avoid making you a freaking addict to it.  Chased a T-Rex got surrounded by a swarm and died, would chase again.
9177	1	a	i wish i hade this game but my mom wont buy me â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥  
9179	1	a	this game is one of the best games i have ever purchased on steam i compleatly love this game and any one who loves servival should get this, this game puts cod zombies servival in the same league no joke :D
9181	1	a	Wow this game is actually really fun. Who knew killing dinosuars is actually really fun xD
9183	1	a	It's being improved on, but as of now it's absolute fun with friends!
9185	1	a	This game is like a halo style shooter with a nazi zombie feel as you have waves of dino's both land and air attacking you. cool and very fun to play with friends, i also like the addition of the tanks, at-at things and the jeeps they make getting around the huge map a lot easier ( as its dino sized and you are tiny ) 7/10
9187	1	a	ORION: Dino Horde is a cheap and fun indie game. If you like horde mode games, then you'll love this one. Stand off with up to 4 team mates against ever increasing hordes of dinosaurs and boss dinosaurs. Upgrade your weapons/abilities as the rounds progress. It's a fun little time waster and great with friends!
9189	1	a	This game is very fun when playing with a friend or more than one. Not that graphics matter, but when I turned all my graphics to low, everything still looked magnifique. REALLY FUN GAME TO PLAYYYYYYYYYYYY~
9191	1	a	a very fun dino game to play with friends :D
9193	1	a	fun multiplayer and great with friends
2806	0	a	terrible, not even worth 1.99 or whatever it is
9195	1	a	its a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game that steals counter strike's guns, and halo's vehicles. but I had fun with it.
9197	1	a	Minecraft 2: Jurassic park edition is an absoulety faithful remake of the origianal Just Cause. This is one of my absoulute favourite game and it is defininately worth 10$
9199	1	a	pretty fun coop game, great value. could be better graphics (reminds me of Tribes) but the coop gameplay is fun. would not recommend playing offline solo.
9201	1	a	Watched my friend run around a mountain being chased by a t-rex while I was invisible. 8/10
2809	0	a	This game is pretty boring and has bad graphics, If it hadnt have been free to test, I wouldnt have played it... Im glad i didnt buy it.
9203	1	a	Another good PVE Co-Op shooter. Easier than the others I've played due to the implimentation of vehicles, but effectively this is Halo with dinosaurs.  Mech suits, lightsabers, and t-rexes. Lots of fun co-op.  The shooting is alright as well.
9205	1	a	This is really a pretty terrible game. But, if you grab the right friends and you can get it dirt cheap, it can be a ton of fun.
9207	1	a	Ok, so: Automatic weapons? Check. Jetpacks? Check. Dinosaurs? .....DOUBLE CHECK!  This game is WAY fun! I'm not sure how anyone is finding this boring. YOU FLY AROUND ON JETPACKS AND SHOOT DINOSAURS WITH SEMI-AUTOMATIC AND AUTOMATIC WEAPONRY.  'Nuff said. If you don't own this, you're wrong.
9209	1	a	Picked it up for $1.49, super great deal! The more I play the game, the more enjoyable it has gotten. There isn't a very large learning curve, and within the first hour or so you have a decent idea of what's going on. After that, exploring the levels some and seeing the different weapons and vehicles this game has to offer makes for an ejoyable experience. I would definitely recommend this game, there's a good chance it might suprise you!
2811	0	a	Let me just say there is a good reason that they only show off community reviews on the store page: every slightly educated video gamer knows this is a functionally bad game. The metacritic score is correct and should not be tampered, and no this isn't a different game than the Orion before it. While this game has many features, none of them work together in the slightest. It seems as though this is just a marketing scam for a garbage game that tries to attract every single 10-year-old shooter player. I played during a free weekend, and I can confidently say that I will never look at this title again. I wouldn't pay 5 cents for it.
9211	1	a	:)
9213	1	a	IDFC why it have just 36/100 but its fun as hell...
2812	0	a	Graphics are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. The gameplay is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. The sound makes me want to cry. The recoil on some of the weapons are trash. Even if it's only one dollar, I would rather have the 4 gumballs that could buy me.
9215	1	a	Beats playing Dino D-Day Worth getting :D DX11 Support, Unreal Engine, You can ride on a T-REX and destory humans together, you can drive bikes/cars etc, totally epic game well worth checking out.
9217	1	a	Excellent idea and design but balence is terrible. If you do not pick the support class you are bad as not only are you the tankiest character but you also have a healing gun. The other two charcters only get a jetpack or a really lame invisiblity power, and anything else that seperates them has a go around.
9219	1	a	Amazing Game! Is very replayable meaning you wont regret buying this game a week later. Plus you can kill a stegosaurus with a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ tank! In my opinion this game is right up there with killing floor, probably better. A must have!
2813	0	a	For some reason this game gets put on sale multiple times. If you're looking for a hilariously bad game to play with your friends, this is for you.
9221	1	a	It is what it says it is; You, Bullets, Robots, Dinos
2814	0	a	Only good part of this game is buying a vehicle and racing your friends. The dinosaurs are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
9223	1	a	bought for 99 cents, had fun with friends for a view hours. not enough content for more then 4 hours.
2816	0	a	I've only been able to play 2 games. Almost every time I try to join a game it crashes.
9225	1	a	+This game got dinosaurs like you won't believe  +â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ tha dinos in a mech suit  +â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ tha dinos in a tank +â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ tha dinos with a knife -deinosuchus will â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ur â™¥â™¥â™¥ up  +deinosuchus will â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ur â™¥â™¥â™¥ up
9227	1	a	Go this when it was on sale for $0.99 and I like it. Not aa game I'll spend a long time playing but it's fun for a quick fix.
2817	0	a	I saw this game on sale for a buck and thought 'Why not?' I had fun with it, but that fun gets outshone by several problems with the game which I am surprised are still there for a game that was released over 2 years ago.  First off, the game. It's a game where you are set against hordes of dinosaurs, ranging from quick raptors that try to hunt in in groups, to triceratops that will charge at you, to T-Rexs which will just gobble you up. You have a variety of weapons to choose from: pistols, rifles, shotguns, explosives, and even a bow and sword. You can also hop in vehicles, such as trucks, tanks, and VTOLs. With three classes (a flying type, a medic type, and a cloaking type) you have ample options to wreck those dinos. Of course, there is the PvP modes as well, where you can play as the dinosaurs as well.  Before I start getting into the problems I had with it, let me say this: I did have fun. You can have a lot of fun with the game when it is working. My favorite loadout is jetpack, grenade launcher, and shotgun, with a little extra armor for good measure. I can tear through hordes of dinos while flying around like a fairy. It is also entertaining to have a jeep plow through the enemy while your buddy is shooting from the turret on the back. So yes, I had fun with the game.  However, I really can't recommend this game because of some glaring issues with it. 1. Connection issues. Connecting to server is iffy at best. Some times it will connect you to a game, and then instantly disconnect you. This happens quite a bit. Other times, you'll be midmatch, then be disconnected even though there was no indication of a bad connection. Sometimes lag will be horrendous. Players teleporting around your screen, and bullets seeming to vanish a foot in front of you. About 30% of my time had no issues. The other 70%, I was having trouble connecting, or getting dropped from a server. I've had several really good runs ruined by a random disconnect. It is extremely frustrating.  2. No tutorial. None whatsoever. It took me over an hour before I realized I had grenades(press g to throw). Also, you would think space would control the jetpack, but it's set to ctrl for some reason. You can melee, but again, you don't know that unless you hit it on accident, ask someone, or run accross it in the keybindings. It was even longer before I figured out how the augments system works(just an fyi, you can have an infinite number of augments equipped. You buy them by double-clicking. You can also buy an augment more than once for some reason. It doesn't boost you though, it just takes your credits). Altogether, there may be some fun stuff I am missing, but I don't know what those are because it isn't made obvious.  3. The graphics are all over the place. The dinosaurs look really good. The enviroments look all right. The player models just look horrible. Even when playing on high settings, they look blocky, or the texture messes up really badly. As for the weapons, some of them look really cool, such as the burst-fire rifle(I don't remember what it's called). Other weapons look extremely uninspired. The shotgun I like to use looks like a tube with some lights and wires. Also, a number of icons look extremely low resolution. They should really be polished up. The vehicles are all over the place in terms of style. Most have s silvery shine and lights, some are dark and grey, and the hoverbike looks like it is from a different game entirely with its turqoise paint.  4. Balance. The balance is odd at times. For example, a knife is pretty powerful, but the sword is pretty weak. That's a really weird decision, especially since it costs more credits to get the sword than the knife. Also, the grenade launcher is probably too powerful. I love to use it, and I am saying it is too much. I just wreck dinos with it, until I'm overflowing with credits I can't use. At times, my teammates are running low on funds because they can't really compete with a GL. Another weird decision is the turrets. I have only seen someone use one once because they only last 60 seconds, even though you most likely will not be able to afford one until wave 8/10. I don't know why you would pay 20,000 credits for one (the same price as some of the most powerful weapons in came), and people I have played with can't justify buying them either. Another issue I had was with the augments, one case in particular. There are two augments that affect jumping, one which increases your jump height(by a lot) and one which gives you double jump(which is unaffected by the previous augment). The jump height upgrade is flatout better than the double jump. There is a very noticable difference in heights you can reach between the two.  5. The shooting. For the most part, the guns feel pretty weak. They don't do a whole lot of damage, they don't sound powerful, and they can be extremely innacurate. Especially when you buy some of the more expensive guns, they don't do much damage to justify their cost. Sometimes, guns are innacurate for the weirdest of reasons. For example, the turret on the back of the car. If you look to the left or right with it and fire, the bullets will hit several feet to the left or right of where you aimed. I felt something was off when driving around with it, then tested it while stationary. Even while sitting still, if you aren't looking straight forward or backwards, it won't hit where you aim. I really don't understand why that is.   6. Bugs. Some of the bugs I have run into: -not spawning in a match. You are supposed to spawn when a new wave starts, but I've had several times where this had not worked. -in the player customizations screen, my character would not be centered on the screen. About half the time, my character model would be off to the side under the menus where I coulndn't seem him. -as mentioned before, you can buy augments more than once. I accidently bought an augment twice while playing, losing valuable credits. -in the keybindings, you can set vehicle steering to be either controlled by A and D, or by mouse. This doesn't work, it will always be controlled by mouse. I never got it to work. -sometimes, when reviving a teammate, the meter will disappear. You are still reviving them, you just can't see it, so don't stop holding E.  7. Just weird little quirks: -the tank has a second, smaller turret on top, similar to what is in the car, but it is still controlled by the driver. They could really make the tank a two-seater and give control of the secondary turret to him. -dinosaur spawning. We lost several vehicles because dinosaurs spawned on top of us while driving by. That really ruined the mood. -the flying dinosaurs(called Rhams according to the wikia) can turn on a dime. They'll fly at a player from above to try and hit him, but will stop and turn really quick, making them difficult to dodge, as well as being difficult to predict and shoot. -there is an indicator on your HUD showing you how many magazines you have left. However, the games doesn't use a magazine system. Ammo is just taken from your ammo pool and dumped into your gun.  So while it is fun at times, a lot of stuff can and does go wrong. If you can get it on sale, great, you'll find some entertainment with it. I got it for a dollar. But I cannot recommend paying 15 dollars on it, as well as spending real money for cosmetic items in the in-game shop.
9229	1	a	great game to play with friends :D
2818	0	a	I was told by a friend that this game isn't that good and I didn't believe him. Till I played it on my own and it isn't that good at all. The gameplay just doesn't seem right, the first thing the enemies do is jusr charge at you no matter what. Even though they're dinosaurs. It doesn't seem to have a good plot to except to protect certain stuff and kill dinosaurs. The graphics are fine, but it doesn't make up for how I think of the game. I don't recommend this game. 5/10
9231	1	a	Very entertaining to play with friends a must buy for under 5$.
9233	1	a	Get to shoot dinos with futuristic weapons with ur friends. best few bucks i spent
2819	0	a	What a horrible and junk game
9235	1	a	Great fun. The concept of shooting dinosaurs is kinda ridiculous but the game is really fun. I like the different classes and the wide range of weapons and skills. The vehciles like the mech are awesome too :)
9237	1	a	The game is actually really fun despite its lackluster graphics and off physics. Theres a decent enough array of dinosaurs and the game does get challenging, the vehicles are fun to drive, theres a good assortment of them and overall its a fun experience. Its definetley worth the $15 price tag, and i was lucky nough to have gotten it for only $1.50.
9239	1	a	A better game than it may at first appear, with a group of friends it can be a lot of fun fighting off the dinosaur hordes. On your own the game can be a bore but with the right people it shines.
9241	1	a	I totally just beat a triceratops to death. I have wanted to do that ever since I was a kid. Also revamped my hate for pterodactyls.
9243	1	a	Jurassic Park: The Video Game (more or less)
9245	1	a	Got eaten by dinosaurs  10/10
9247	1	a	best game ever...meta score was a lie! Better then most 60$ games!
9249	1	a	A simple FPS with dinosaurs, what more could you want?
2823	0	a	Awful game. Just terrible...
9251	1	a	Honestly, this is great fun. Get a few friends, yell, shoot dinosaurs and probably get straight chomped by a T-Rex. Also, there are tanks and mechs and such. The game is pretty janky, granted, but it's fun as hell.
9253	1	a	For what this game lacks in graphics and dept, it makes up for it in fun and playability. It plays alot like Halo 2
9255	1	a	This game needs better video settings for low-end pcs aswell as better guns to start of with instead of pistols...
9257	1	a	Amazing game. Would recommend to anyone. Dinos and guns, the childhood dreams.
9259	1	a	this game is a great game and you should totally buy it
9261	1	a	It's a cute game. Who doesn't like to kill dinosaurs?
9263	1	a	This game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing amazing don't let the reviews deter you.
9265	1	a	this game is just starting out and has great potential. Being able to kill players and dinosaurs what more can you ask for.
2826	0	a	This game may look fun however it is not. My friends and I played it and it was very boring and the graphics were really bad. Please don't even spend one dollar on this game its not worth it.
9267	1	a	Stabbed a T-Rex in the face with a Lightsaber  10/10
9269	1	a	its exactly what it looks like
9271	1	a	Very addicting
9273	1	a	Punching Dinosaurs. That is all.
9275	1	a	Pretty fun for cheap
9277	1	a	Shoot â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ers in the face and they die, the filty â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s had it coming anyways. They aren't suppose to still be alive and they killed my mechwarrior.
2829	0	a	Garbage not worth the $1.49 I payed for it.
9279	1	a	Super fun game! The co-op gameplay is freaking awesome, i brought this game for $1.50 and it's worth more than that for sure. I also host an Aus server when i play so feel free to join me.   7/10 for gameplay 1/10 story (there is no story) 4/10 Animations(they are pretty bad on raptors) 8/10 FPS  Overall 6/10(For steam summer sale 10/10)   If you are thinking of buying this for steam summer sale you will not regret it
2830	0	a	this game is crap to play by yourself...maybe it would be fun with other people...
9281	1	a	This game is a fun FirstPerson shooter with a destructive force of dinosaurs. Will you join me in the endless waves of killer monsters?
2831	0	a	Not worth the $1.50 i paid for it. Although it presents a decent concept, it feels unfinished with LOW 2d graphics on small dinosaurs and a lack of both game mode variety and gun textures.
2832	0	a	Although it was a decent effort, this game's mechanic are not the best. The game feels rather clunky and has a large time gap in between survival rounds. In addition, there is a lack of game mode variety available in this game. Due to this, my attention deviated from this game in less than an hour. In conclusion, I would not reccomend buying this game even though I got it for $1.49.
2833	0	a	i played it a little bit didnt really like it. i think it needs some more work
9283	1	a	Don't let the Metascore fool you. This game is the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Have you ever played a zombies base-defense type game but wanted dinosaurs instead of zombies? Look no further. The graphics are good-looking and easy to run, and you get to shoot dinos. And play as them. Just get it already.
9285	1	a	When I saw the graphics in the game, it took me back to the year 2002. Ah yes the early days of the PS2. The summer of 2002 was a great summer. I was a young lad of 13 years old. I wore Hawaiian shirts every day and drank Sprite Ice as I rode my mountain bike my parents got me for my 12th birthday. I would visit my friends who skateboarded. I would try and jump the skateboard ramp on my mountainbike and crashed horribly. I ripped one of my Hawaiian shirts doing this. Boy, was my mom sore with me. Those were the last days of my innocence. After these precious moments, I grew up more and more each year. My mountain bike eventually passed down to my brother, as did my Hawaiian shirts. Summer became autumn. Autumn became winter. And so on. The ps2 got better graphically. Then the ps3 came out. Then the ps4. Most of my skateboarder friends are dead now. Sprite doesn't make Sprite Ice anymore. Thank you, ORION: Dino Horde. 10/10.
9287	1	a	Really dumb fun akin to Killing Floor with a dinosaur flavor. Actually a very rewarding experience with friends.
9289	1	a	This game is downright off the wall silly. you want a wave based survival game, you got it, you want a futuristic shooter, you got it, you want vehicles, you get 6 or 7 different types, you want multiplayer, bring 4 friends with you into survival. you want pvp, do it up. this game has it all, including shenanigans. honestly i really enjoyed it and will play more. 2.6 hours in the past 40 hours of owning it, and thats just cause ive had business to attend to off of steam
9291	1	a	The T-rex's roar is earsplitting.
2834	0	a	If you ever wondered how virtual garbage may look like.. Just buy this game and your desire for knowledge will be satisfied.
9293	1	a	Surprisingly fun, like Halo with dinosaurs
2835	0	a	I bought this game when it was $0.99 and I want every cent back. It's borderline unplayable. I don't understand why this game has any positive reviews. I'm pretty sure my review will be deleted shortly. If you can see this, don't buy this unholy mess of a game.
2836	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t.DO NOT BUY,WASTE OF MONEY,NEVER BUY THIS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ GAME,IT SUCKS,TETRIS IS BETTER THAN THIS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥T.
9295	1	a	Defenitly a good game, much like Killing Floor. Need a lot of teamwork to succed against late wave, or else its a bloodbath.
9297	1	a	Great game, love the multiplayer mode. You can enjoy it for hours at once.
9299	1	a	this game is halo and jurrassic park. there are perks to buy with credits just like in CoD zombies which can be used different ways to fit whatever play style you want. got a 36 on meta score but is way more fun than that rating...
9301	1	a	Great game to play with friends, survival game against dinosaurs? what more could you want
2837	0	a	Absolutely horrible, I first had to trek 1 kilometer JUST TO GET TO THE FIGHT, and then the generator you were supposed to defend was out in the middle of a field IN FRONT OF THE FORT, as opposed to in the fort, where any sensible architect would have put it, and then when the dinos finally did begin appearing out of nowhere, I simply ran into them until they died on a tiny gravcycle, even the 'boss' was killed by a few hits with the completely undamaged gravcycle.
2838	0	a	it looks like it could be a fun game but the dino controls are kinda really bad
9303	1	a	Actually a lot better than the reviews would say, it is great fun in local co-op!
2840	0	a	Microtransactions and a pricetag, it's fun, but not my cup of tea.
9305	1	a	This ga,e is alright. If it is still on sale for under 4 dollars than I would say it is worth it. Otherwise DO NOT TOUCH IT WITH A TEN FOOT POLE, IT IS NOT WORTH IT.
9307	1	a	Pay no attention to the 'metascore' as it does not reflect this game at all. At the moment I have just finished my first game and it was awesome. It reminds me of Halo mixed with Turok. I figured out most of the controls within five minutes and was soon blasting away dinos. If you want a fun game that can also present a challenge then I recommend this for you.
9309	1	a	Wow, I bought the game while it was free to play then when I go to play it it says it expired or something like that. So I go to this and I bought it for a friend I wasted 2 dollars but my friend can play the game I dont get it!
9311	1	a	I only recommend this game if you get it for less than $1. I'd be very unhappy if I paid full price for this game. Quite repetitive, you'll pretty much play through every map a few times in a few hours and get bored.
9313	1	a	Good for the first 3 hours, gets old though, repetitive gameplay. Just my opinion
9315	1	a	Just started playing it, but I can already tell it's going to be a favorite. Cross all the best aspects of dinosaur-hunting games with the multiplayer of Halo, add weapon upgrades based on XP you collect from each wave, and many awesome vehicles that are fun to operate and totally devastating. The bosses (large dinosaurs) are challenging, but it's the small ones you'll forget about that will end you. Planning on losing a lot of hours making dinosaurs bleed. Can play alone, but multiplayer is the most fun.
9317	1	a	A lot more fun than I was expecting. Being able to fight dinos in a mech suit is amazing.
9319	1	a	Decent cheap game for those on a serious budget.
9321	1	a	So bad that it is amazing
9323	1	a	Aside from the basic graphics, pretty bad characters, dialouge and design... I had fun. I love 'horde' type games, and slaughtering Dinosaurs is a rare treat... In the end, it's not a very good game, but it's fun, and usually $1 on sale. Pick it up on one of those 90% off, or cheaper, but other than that, paaaass.
2843	0	a	The Source Engine would have been a better choice, doesnt make sense, poor aiming ability, promised big dinosaurs and big guns, world design :(
9325	1	a	A fun game. The only thing I really dislike about it is the absurd recoil
2844	0	a	A bad Halo knockoff with dinosaurs. Would've been nice to play humans vs dinosaurs with more than four people. 4 suicide bomber pterodactyls /10
2845	0	a	I got this game for .99 cents.. Its worth that much to be honest. Don't buy this game unless its dirt cheap.
2846	0	a	crappy game, boring bad graphix
9327	1	a	I get so wrapped up when I play this game. I do wish there were more dinosaurs though, but I'm sure they will come along eventually. Also I wish there were more gun choices for primary. I love the SMG, it's my favorite. It's difficult even with a group of friends, lol. Those pesky little dinos &amp; the flying ones, ugh! But all in all, I REALLY like this game. Doesn't help that I got it for .99 cent ;)
9329	1	a	This is an awesome game. Need to fix some of the small glitches though from where dinosaurs can move to / can move from. But apart from that, its all good!
9331	1	a	Like Jeff Goldblum this game had me avoiding the toilet for many days after playing. Simple concept lots of fun.
9333	1	a	this game is good for the price buy it...dont listen to the meta score....i enjoyed it and i only bought it for 1 $...
2848	0	a	It's not so surprising that this game doesn't have a lot of players. At first, the prospect of fighting with friends against hordes of dinosaurs sounds very fun and exciting. Unfortunately, it gets old really fast. The first game you play will probably be the most fun you have with Orion: Dino Horde and then afterwards the novelty wears off.   The game has a variety of multiplayer modes but only 2 or 3 that are actively played. Every game rewards you with EXP to increase your level but you don't recieve anything when you increase in level. The content that you experience at level 0 will be the same at the level cap. The game mode that has the most potential for fun is Rampage. Rampage is a Human vs Dinosaur game mode in which players are allowed to play as the dinosaurs alongside AI controlled dinosaurs. It's just unfortunate that right from the get go, the dinosaur team can play as any dinosaur. Right from the beginning of the match, all dinosaur players can select the strongest dinosaurs available like the T-Rex. But all of that is moot because the human team has the overwhelming advantage. Humans can, with upgraded jumps and jetpacks, reach the highest mountain and rain down hell on the dinosaur players. Most of the playable dinosaurs are land based and don't have the ability to jump. The T-Rex has a ranged attack, but with limited distance and a small hitbox. There are a few flying dinosaurs, but they are all too weak to do any considerable damage.  The balance issues between human and dinosaur are a result of all the maps being open environments with high peaks. A close quarters indoor environment reminiscient of Jurassic Park would have made for exciting matches and would give more opportunities to using some of the smaller dinosaurs and still be effective.  On to the graphics. One word? Meh. The maps are nice enough. Though they suffer from plain textures and too much bloom. Most times you won't even notice the art because there's really nothing to draw your eye to it. Dinosaur models are okay. But player models are just terrible. The low poly and muddy textured player models look like they've been copied from the original Tribes game. The graphics are not a good show of what the Unreal 3 engine can do.  Considering I bought the game on a sale, I can't complain, but this is not a well made game. It runs on the gimmick of fighting dinosaurs but ends up being boring and just genuinely not fun. I wouldn't recommend it.
9335	1	a	Pretty good
9337	1	a	It's a little confusing at first i spawned and was immediately getting chased by a t-rex and about4 raptors and was eaten immediately but this game is still awesome nd makes for some epic moments.
9339	1	a	Difficult to begin, but fun once you get going. More fun with more people playing with you at the same time.
9341	1	a	by far the best $1.00 I've EVER spent... 8.5/10
9343	1	a	The best dino-killing-game ever. Its a fun shooting game, were you don't need to always shoot at player, but in stead have a great co-op. But hey! they got jet pack and medic gun, what can possibly go wrong :D
2850	0	a	Don't believe the hype! This game is still as crappy as ever. Even free, I regret that I even wasted the hard drive space on it. I normally don't write such scathing reviews, especially about indie titles because I loves me some indie development, but honestly, nothing good to say about this title.   Models = crap level design = uninspired crap skins = crap dinosaurs = unplayable crap Sound desgin = stock crap  This title is best relegated to the dustbin of Steamdom.
9345	1	a	Think Tribes with dinosaurs. I wouldn't particularly recommend it, but it has the potential to become one of those games that get popular for being bad, a sort of cult following. Other than that, the game was poorly executed, IMO, but a nice idea
9347	1	a	I keep getting picked up by flying dinosaurs and then dropped 1 mile down. 10/10 would be swept up by a Rhamphorynchus again.
9349	1	a	No point reviewing this game because it is the best game ever created
9351	1	a	As â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing silly as this game is I love it! The multiplayer action is fun and combo kills are rewarding and hilarious.   If you like L4D/L4D2 than pick this game up.   If you like killing tons of Dinosaurs from Tiny to Small get it!   If you don't want to disappoint Jeff Goldblum BUY â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING DINO HORDE!
9353	1	a	Pretty cool game, un polished in a lot of areas. But for the type of game it is, it handles pretty well.
9355	1	a	11/10 would crash again.
9357	1	a	Game is awesome. Highly recommend it especially since the price is so cheap.
9359	1	a	It's a pretty broken game but it's fun to play with with friends
9361	1	a	good game if you are interested in just having a bit of fun with friends
9363	1	a	First wave I played my head got chewed off by a T-Rex.  1O/10
9365	1	a	I more or less bought this game basically because the name has 'Dino Horde' in it. I expected it to be completely ridiculous. It is completely ridiculous, but it can be addicting. I mean, what really makes this game worth it is that there is a mode where you can play as the dinosaurs and kill other playable people. I like that. It is hard to get used to at first and they overwhelm you quickly (regular horde mode), but if you play with a group, it is enjoyable.
9367	1	a	I shot a T-rex in the face, and then t-bag it. Buy this game.
9369	1	a	Great game for the very low price (depending when you buy it) Dont trust the metacritic score
9371	1	a	It is so fun to kill all the dinos!
9373	1	a	I like this game in general good graphics and great gameplay are fun but the only problem is finding a match which is sometimes hard 
9375	1	a	Buy this game it has everything every man needs like guns .....and dinosaurs....and cars with mounted guns..and well everything just â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing buy it already...
2855	0	a	One of the worst games on steam. Unplayable. If I could remove it from my game library permanently I would.
9377	1	a	Pretty pointless, but fun nonetheless.
9379	1	a	just look at it... how does that not look fun?
9381	1	a	Worth the money when I bought it (1â‚¬)
9383	1	a	only words.....................awesome!
9385	1	a	Short and simply put, ORION is a game developed by people clearly concerned with their consumers having fun. If you can get the game on sale, convince some friends to pick it up, or snag a bundle. At a good price, the game is worth the one night of fun you would get at minimum. The weapons are interesting, the combat is hectic and the maps large. The only real complaint that I have is that it is too hard to earn credits to buy better guns, abilities, and in some maps and game types, vehicles.
9387	1	a	earrape dinos and halo 10/10
9389	1	a	really good gameplay the dinausors bug and fly in the sky from time to time but apart from that i really recomend it and its almost free
2857	0	a	This game can be, 'fun' but it really isnt that great. The graphics arent what they were portrayed to be and most everything else is just terrible quailty, do not reccomend.
9391	1	a	a game you can't stop playing hrs upon hrs of fun :D
9393	1	a	Its a fun game.
9395	1	a	Bought It a long LONG time ago, Its still looks amazing and trust me, It Is amazing!
2858	0	a	why the f does it not run right f***** douches i s[ent 15$ on it
9397	1	a	This is a great game, dinos, weapons, pve and pvp, loadouts, levels, unlockables, classes. If you like these things, get it! For only 99 cents right now, it can't hurt, right?
9399	1	a	This is a game that I recomend greatly due to its great gameplay. it may have some glitches here and there but its nice to get a game that anyone can get for just a dollar.
9401	1	a	Orion prelude is a scifi egoshooter, situated in a time, where dinosaurs exist.  there are 3 main roles, and each role feature unique abilitys. Dinosaurs attack wave after wave, and they get stronger each wave!  the animation of the landscape is one of the best, if not the best I have seen in games. The ammount of different weapons is not that big, but there is something for everyone's taste! ever wanted to drive with a verry fast vehicle under a huge dinosaur?? I was able to :) It is not a game like cs:go which you can play many hours a day, day after day, but it is definitively a realy good game to play while waiting for a teammember cooking his dinner.  I personaly like to play the character,that is able to get invisible, and shoot with the large machine gun.  The game would be worth 7 bucks, so it is way to cheap im my eyes. enjoy
9403	1	a	Great game, don't trust Metacritic's broken system
9405	1	a	Truely, with a dollar, you can't buy many things. A candy bar at most, but this game is truly worth a dollar if you got one, especially if you have some friends to play it with you.
9407	1	a	I killed a T-Rex with a knife. Never bring a T-Rex to a knifefight 9/10 would knife again.
2860	0	a	This game... is broken and laughable.. want a laugh? sprint and look down at your legs flailing around... it's only a buck so... if you've got money to spend... go ahead
9409	1	a	Ask yourself this, can you really go wrong with a 99 cent game?
9411	1	a	Game is a lot of fun, but the only problem I had seem to have was that there was lag when having a second player join. It wasn't impossible to play, but it was a mild annoyance.
9413	1	a	Fun game to play with friends :)
2861	0	a	Game play was glitchy at best
9415	1	a	A great gift for friend you want to torture  this game is like bad rats    not even worth 99C
9417	1	a	Purchased while on sale for $0.99, watching the game play videos I assumed this game would be a lag nightmare or somehow not live up to any decent expectations. It proved to be the best gaming purchase I have made in years. Even for 20x what I paid this game would be worth it, as the key to any good game it is very fun!
9419	1	a	why have u not brought this already?!  Trust me, it's amazingly, fantastically, utterly, brilliant, over the top, fps, giggles a second fun fun fun fun fun fun fun.  Oh and you can eat people as a dino &lt;burp&gt;
9421	1	a	There is no reason why you should not own this game. It's $0.99! Buy the 4 pack and gift it to your friends!
2863	0	a	I changed my mind about this game, the soldiers are perfect but the dinosaurs on the other hand get stuck on any bush it hits and it is impossible to kill any soldiers. I DO NOT RECOMMEND.
2864	0	a	I am just dissapointed with Overkill. This is game is just bad. I loved the days of Dino Horde, but prelude is virtual trash. You downgraded us! Orion: Dino Horde was worth $15! Prelude isn't even worth $1. Also, I had 2 copies of Orion: Dino Horde in my inventory, and when it updated us to Prelude, they dissapeared. A sad, sad dissapointment.
2865	0	a	THIS STUPID GAME DOSENT WORK I HAVE ALL OF THE REQUIREMENTS AND IT DOSENT WORK
2866	0	a	The graphics are out dated, most of the servers don't work. Lack of support for new players make the game unbalanced. Don't waste your money
9423	1	a	AW MAN. this game is HOT. It has everything but a story, so I just pretend we are settlers, clearing the way for more settlers! its Halo-esque and Borderlandsy feel aids in you feeling great about the sensless re- extinction of the ancient species. I love it.
9425	1	a	Wait? I thought I bought 'ORION: Dino Horde' - maybe I was dreaming ...
2867	0	a	This game is glitchy and buggy and the gameplay lacks any kind of fun You are only trying to find the small dinos in the grass (they are hard to find) to kill em and the you shoot the big uns  nah
9427	1	a	Though the old version of this game was not a well-liked game, this one is quite the oppposite. It's not fantastic, but it certainly is for paying $0.99! I'm not saying it isn't fun, because it certainly is, but it simply does not have as much content as more expensive games. But thta's why those games are more expensive. Overall, I like the GUI, except the buttons could be labeled for PC gamers as well (in the menu, it shows A and B button indicators for console), and the HUD could use more concise labeling. I had trouble telling which bar was which. It is a fun game, and I plan on playing it for a while.
2868	0	a	Very laggy, wasn't able to do anything. I had just the game open and it glitched and lagged so bad. I felt like I was on DSL again. The graphics are nice, but it isn't worth the lag. I give it a one out of 5 stars, graphics are nice. Only good thing about tha game to be honest.
9429	1	a	I cant believe this game is only for $1. If you are too stingy to pay $1 for quality, then go sit in the corner.  (personally i got one of the free copies)  First of all, you are paying for bare minimum quality you would expect from a $1 game. However, the quality you get is much better then that of most $20-30 games. Not to mention all the different game modes, equipment, enemies and customization.  Sound/picture quality: 7/10 (few graphical/camera issues that need to be addressed. Luckily they do not affect the core game)  Gameplay: 8/10 (its just generally all around fun. What more could you want from shooting dinosaurs)  Multiplayer: 10/10 (Had no issues with multiplayer. Its just one of those games thats 10x as fun with friends)  Highly recommend this game to anyone who is thinking about purchasing it. Its only gonna continue to get larger with steam workshop content flooding in. (PS: some game modes allow playing as dinosaurs)
9431	1	a	Yolo
9433	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ the reviews, this game is awesome
9435	1	a	Jetpack onto a rock and shoot dinos for the first 3 waves. Get a tank on wave 4. Win. 10/10 
9437	1	a	A surprisingly fun title with more than what you bargained for.
9439	1	a	Got torn up by some velociraptors 10/10
9441	1	a	Played as a dinosaur. Ate a guy. 10/10 would eat someone again.
9443	1	a	Great value for a great game, sure it has its problems but they are being fixed by the devs and the game only gets better as time goes on and for 79p you wonâ€™t find a game like it. Great graphics and a great selection of modes to play from Survival (Objective)  Slaughter (Duration), Rampage (Playable Dinosaurs), Prehistoric (Custom Variable).  As of this month the ORION: Prelude Developer SDK Beta is going to be released so the possibilities of what you can do is endless thanks to the steam workshop support.  Overall a good game and a great value, though don't let the low price put you of from buying this game as it is well worth it, there are plenty of reviews out about this game so I have kept my very brief but I give this game an 8.5 out of 10.
9445	1	a	Stupid fun. I mean that literally. A weekend dollar well spent. Get your friends, kill some dinos, use a jetpack, laugh.
9447	1	a	One of the few examples of Early Access done right I'm still confused as to how such a total piece of garbage became so great 
9449	1	a	This game might not be game of the year material, but it sure is a fun game. You get to shoot, stab and burn dinos, what more do you want? Play as dinos? Good thing you can. It is the game I never knew I wanted, and I love it.
9451	1	a	Shooting dinos with big guns - almost the best way to let off some steam. Second to having sexual intercourse.
9453	1	a	7/10 i'm no FPS player, but the coop vs dinosaur is pretty cool! Give it a try :P
9455	1	a	I don't own this game so I am giving it a thumbs up for letting me review it without having bought it.
9457	1	a	Great game and very fun to play with friends and for 99cents cant beat it!
2872	0	a	Game costs a dollar for a reason. Crashed as soon as I joined a server.
9459	1	a	THIS GAME IS TOTALLY AWESOME
9461	1	a	It's like skyrim with Dinosaurs
9463	1	a	You look at this game, and you think...Ehhhh, is it worth it? It looks kinda (dumb, simple, noobish, glitchy, whatever), so you seriously don't consider getting it. Get it. Its probably worth at least 5 dollars, and future updates can only make it better xD  Gun system very similar to CSGO, with weapons that are based on the same type (heavy deagle like pistol, AUG like gun), but that doesn't make it a knockoff. Its very unique, with a very fun, adventureous feel. The community is nothing but friendly, and learning to play is easy. Its a fun way to meet some new online friends, or play with some old ones. If it is its worth you're worried about, don't.   Now, it is not a top notch game. The mouse is super sensitive, so you have to adjust it every now and then. Sometimes settings dont stay saved, so you have to reset them. Servers are kinda glitchy, so sometimes it takes a minute to join. It is a .99 cent game, so bugs are there. If you want a top of the line, everything must be aboslutely perfect and run smoothly kinda game, this probably isn't up your alley. It takes a little patience, but only a little.   Overall? Get it, unless you're really, reaaaally picky. You'll love it. Kill some dinos for me!
9465	1	a	best game ever have you been a flying dinosour and pick someone up 
9467	1	a	Perfect game to play with friends. Shoot at Dinosours, grenade them. Play with the settings for crazy games. You get a lot of game and fun for the price.
9469	1	a	Most enjoyable game I've ever played! Killing dinos have never felt this epic :D
2874	0	a	If you got the 99c to spend on something you might play two or three times, go ahead and purchase. I wasn't really into it personally. There are very few servers to play on and they're very laggy. The fact that you have to pay 99c for a game that could easily go on the free to play list (considering there's an in game shop) just seems like a bad business tactic. Maybe I just joined the wrong servers, maybe my internet was bugging out, maybe it's just not my type of game but I wouldn't recommend this one when there's sales on much better games out there.
9471	1	a	This game is extreemely fun. At the time of its writing it is 99 cents which I have no idea why. It is worth way more than that. Just buy it.
9473	1	a	was 99cents very fun, very addicting, everyone should snatch this game up
9475	1	a	Really fun. IF you have friends to play it with.
9477	1	a	for 99 cents you really can't beat this game. Yes it might not have singleplayer or any sembelance of a storyline, but it does not detract from what the game is about. A 4 player shoot dinosaurs in the face simulator. Add that to the fact to multuiple game modes (one of wich you play the dinos on a quest to eat some supersoldiers) and you got a recipe for a very fun multiplayer experience. Updates are frequent and always seem to add to this game. A must buy in my book.
9479	1	a	A lot of fun for a $1 game. Basically feels like halo ce mixed with jurassic park.
9481	1	a	Great game to play when you love to fight dinos!
9483	1	a	This is the worst game on earth but it's still the most fun you can probably have in a multiplayer game. This is not a AAA title, you get what you pay for. A 99 cent game, what's not to like?
9485	1	a	I really love this game :) good game to play with your friends or people online :) little hard to do by yourself but still fun nontheless :) Can't wait to level up more on my Assault character!!
9487	1	a	Best game a dollar can buy. :) Would like to play again.
9489	1	a	this game is hard to get .-.
2876	0	a	For me it crashed when tried to start a match Lowered graphics still crashed, I have a Geforx 9800 + Games like the Witcher 2 &amp; Batman Arkham Asylum work for me - Witcher 2 on low Batman on max  So maybe it just dosen't work on older cards even if they are capable
9491	1	a	Hours of fun if you have awsome buddys to play with. i give it a 10/10 if there was a rating system!
9493	1	a	this game costs less than a candy bar. buy it and shoot a triceratops right in the face
9495	1	a	I bought this game when it was a dollar because I was poor. I would buy it again now even though I am still poor. I enjoy Rampage mode, because you can run around as a spinosaurus and chomp players and/or raptors. Plus in survival mode you can get the Cryoknife a weapon that alows you to slice your way through the hordes and hordes of dinos. I enjoy jumping onto the backs of large dinos and slicing the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out of them. I only see one con, alot of the mapps appear to be the same map, just decorated differently with elevation changes. Overall it is very fun!
9497	1	a	Well what can I say? For 0.79p this is the most fun I had for awhile. It works and it is fun. Go get it!!!
9499	1	a	This is it to much FUN. I haven't played a game like this for awhile, i mean a Fantastic Joy. Before I wasn't too interested in the beginning with the concept of Dinosours. But in the End I gave it a try and it is a great price. It does feel like that they say it is Halo, and other FPS. Im hooked with this game Simple yet satisfying.
9501	1	a	Fun and alot of bang for the buck, not saying that it is good compared to the price, but good in general!
9503	1	a	i really like this game but i have tons of lag as of right now.once when i get a new/better pc/laptop it will be one of my fav/top 10 games i would play all the time
9505	1	a	Cheep and a quick game to play. Fun with friends.
9507	1	a	its a nice game , but why is it so cheap :o i was expecting it to be 20$ or something its really good for a 0.99$ game
9509	1	a	99cent for killing Dinos? Totaly worth it even if it was 4.99 it would still be worth it
9511	1	a	Such a great game and yet so simple. Not to mention the low price of 99 cents. This game brought me a few hours of fun and I highly recommend this game to anyone. Playing with friends is great and so is playing by yourself. Buy this game and you will not regret it.
9513	1	a	The mechanics of this game are so broken, it's beautiful.
9515	1	a	They misspelled 'Died' 10/10
9517	1	a	Orion may have started off as a bad game, but through time and effort, it's finally become a fun game.
2879	0	a	Possibly worse than 'Infestation: Survivor Stories' 10/10 would play games worse than WarZ again
9519	1	a	oh this one is fun!! DIE DINO SKUM!!!!!
9521	1	a	This game is one of a kind. I loved the game play and how hard the bosses were(sorry for the bad spelling).
9523	1	a	Really solid game. For what its worth, it's absolutely awesome. Sure it isnt grade a, but what more would you want for a buck? High potential for fun, and just overall badassery.
9525	1	a	Quite good needs upgrades for all weapons not just all the weapons upgrade at the same time
9527	1	a	Don't let the mediocre graphics and dated Unreal Engine put you off of this game; with a few beers and some friends, this game is actually pretty fun! A cross between Turok and Halo, giggle your way through multiplayer survival mode as you lay waste to hordes of Raptors, Triceratops, T-Rexes and other baddies with an arsenal of machine gunes, pistols, flamethrowers, and tanks! Replayability may be lacking, so try and pick this one up for sub $2.00 prices.
2880	0	a	played this with a few friends for about 50 minutes, and we all got a lot of frame drops, easy to learn and understand if you have played things like killing floor with a few good extras. but over all its just annoying getting damaged costantly especially by the flying dinos and you either can't hit them because your frames have dropped so much you have to stop playing for a second or that they are already too far away to hit. Didn't enjoy
2881	0	a	lol trust its not even worth the 0.79p. basicly a complete rip off of killing floor but sooo bad.
9529	1	a	cant go wrong with this. cheap jurassic park, but even better than the movie: the game.
9531	1	a	An amazingly open combat game, reccomended to those into amazing dinosaurs like the Raptor, Tyrannosaurus Rex and Triceratops. I had a great time playing it, even though I died a lot. Also, is it just me, or do the soldier guys look like they're in Dead Space 3 armor?
9533	1	a	Definitely worth .99 cents, really fun and action packed, they are STILL working out the bugs, but that aside it is really fun online game. The dinosaurs vary in size and difficulty, along with bonus beasts to slay.
9535	1	a	....
9537	1	a	Im Happy I Got The Four Pack.
9539	1	a	Jetpack class runs out of fuel. I plummet to my death. 10/10 Would Die Again.
9541	1	a	Not the best game ever, but â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it was 99 cents.
9543	1	a	tremendously great game!I tip to buy all perks if possible,get loads of cash,then buy a trek79lmg,a trek ion blade,a longshot and the full-auto shotgun!they never betrayed me!(sorry for potentially bad english)!also try to get as soon as possible in a VTOL,if there are veichle shops.
9545	1	a	Such a timekiller. Love it :) 
2888	0	a	Frankly, I say don't waste your money. This game has dinosaurs and shooting thats it. It gets repetitive and boring fast. The only enjoyment you can get from this is laughing at how bad it is.
9547	1	a	Cover this BabaKiueria. Seriously though the voice acting alone is enough to get this.
9549	1	a	$1 game is worth it since I like killing dinosaurs... but I'm not paying real $$$ to upgrade my character... -_-
9551	1	a	Pretty damn cool if you have a bunch of pals to play it with.
9553	1	a	first 15 min i was like wooh i dont get it but asi started playing it was the most bestest coop game ever  feature i like  1.bow  2.mech  3. dinos  
9555	1	a	If you have ever wondered if $1 could buy anything good, that would give atleast a couple of hours of entertainment, you have come right. ORION: Prelude is awesome, It might not have the best graphics or best engine out right now, but what can you really expect from a $1 game? It contains Dinosaurs and Humans with guns.  Best game on Steam for $1.
2891	0	a	THIS GAME SUCKS THE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ CAVITY OF TUMOR BREAD
9557	1	a	I was honestly ready to jump the bandwagon and give this game as much crap as it seems to get regularly but honestly, now that I've given it a play, it's not that bad. There are a lot of games worse than Prelude out there, and for more money. I went in with my buddy and had fun for a few hours in the different gamemodes. The voice acting is decent, the visuals and atmosphere are actually really good for a few years ago.   I only really trash the animation sometimes, and encountered one bug in this playthrough (scooped up by a flying dino, dropped between a rock face and the invisible playfield border.)  8/10 for what it is, I had a great time. Would definitely replay.
9559	1	a	This game was well made and now there selling it for so cheap, what happend that this game has to be sold for such low price its fun its entertaining fun with friends I don't understand it well I suggest buying fun game alot of fun with friends only 3.30 to buy for four of your friends why not?
2893	0	a	I do not recamend this game because its more of a one play only game then its boring, graphics are a no, multiplayer is a no, not that fun for me, mostly because I have a very fast very open cp and its very slow.
2894	0	a	this is awful
9561	1	a	Buggy and boring, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ass gameplay and not worth a dollar  11/10 awesome game
9563	1	a	The game is awesome! 
9565	1	a	A really good laugh
9567	1	a	This game is 79p...79P! If you haven't bought it, just do it! IT's a great game.
9569	1	a	Cheaper and more fun than evolve!
9571	1	a	Fun, just fun. Fighting off waves of dines you loved as a child and feeling barney's cousins crushed beneath your tank. Well designed with a few bugs, but very good with friends, or if your really good you can do it yourself and hope you dont die. Overall 8.7/10. my only problem is that my friends are so hard to get together and one of them is too stupid to start a server. (And he is the one with the best internet)
2896	0	a	For a start micro transactions......In a paid game? Badly optomisted, poor quailty and just really crap over all.  10/10 would NOT play again
9573	1	a	Fun. Isn't that why we play video games? To have fun?  This game is fun. It is also very cheap.  For 99 cents what reason could you have for not checking it out?
9575	1	a	Tried to kill a dinosaur then it flung me into the air then I 360 noscoped it and entered a space ship. 10/10 IGN would play agian.
9577	1	a	This is a fun game, and I only play Singleplayer except one time. But there are a few problems. Pros: -Fun game Multiplayer or singleplayer Cons: -Laggy to record. I was getting below 10 FPS, while on games like Portal or Terraria I have at least 40 FPS.
2898	0	a	So after a lengthy debate with friends about this game, we came up with a fairly accurate description for it. Yes, with a few friends it can be fun for a limited time, but so can having syphilis. Then after a while you realize how bad it really is and wish you hadn't paid the money to get this horrible disease, and even with the help of friends its unbearably painful.
2899	0	a	The poor implementation of concepts has bugged this game ever since it was first called Orion: Dino Beatdown. What originally started out as a flawed game has now become a mish-mash of ideas, that is in my opinion unplayable. Whilst the ingame character, dinosaur, and vehicle models are terrible, graphics are not always everything. Well then, why is this game so poorly optimised that it lags on high-end computers? What's worse is that this game borrows concepts from other video games, and doesn't quite manage to properly implement them. The vehicle steering system is like Halo: CE, but 100 times worse, the second chance system is like Borderlands 2 but with no real challenge. Honestly, the best thing I did with this game was uninstalling it. I want my internet back, I want my wasted time back, but am I going to get them back? Answer: NO! Seriously, save your money and buy a game like Primal Carnage or Dino D-Day instead. Both are good examples of a humans vs dinosaur game done right.  My Score: 15/100.
9579	1	a	You get to kill dinosaurs with guns. Whats not fun about that?
2900	0	a	Dont buy this gameit is a waste of money and time
9581	1	a	Got rammed by 2 guys in a jeep with a machine gun into a giant T-Rex. Jeep blew up, they died and I got chomped to death  9/10 - would get rammed into a T-rex again.
9583	1	a	Much better than Bad Rats for a dollar. Plus the graphics actually look pretty nice. And the game is really fun!
2901	0	a	It used to be called Orion: Dino Horde, but they re released it as an update not a new game and also the game sucks. (although it may be better than CoD ghosts but that isnt difficult to be better than ghosts
9585	1	a	For only 1 euro, this game is very good. Addictive gameplay and cool weapons.  Can be a bit repetitive.  7/10
2903	0	a	If i could give this game away and out of my Game list i would. Dont bother. its terrible in every way
9587	1	a	more bugs than fallout. 11/10
9589	1	a	YOU GET TO PLAY IN A SYFY ORIGINAL FILM HOLY â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥  I GIVE IT 2 TANGERINES/APPLE
9591	1	a	99c/99c would buy again
9593	1	a	Made my day a few times, bought it on sale with friends, worth it!
9595	1	a	fun game, to toss around.
9597	1	a	Do you like shooters? Dinosaurs? How about cheap buggy games that you can play with your friends and laugh your asses off for a good 3 hours? If you answered yes to all of these questions just â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing buy the game, it's a dollar.  All jokes aside, I love this game, I get to rocket around with a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ flamethower whilst burning dinosaurs down in a blaze of glory, it was amazing.
9599	1	a	Surprisingly entertaining for just 1 euro. 5/5 would recommend!
2905	0	a	WHY THROW ALL THE GOOD STUFF OF DINO HORDE AWAY :(, now listen i know what your thinking, this game looks good but listen NO, there are graphical bugs like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ LOADS, hey its worth 1 dollar but i hope this stays permanately until they fix the bugs. Oh did i also mention the menu has xbox controller button prompts, that spice up the review a bit?
9601	1	a	Want to upgrade your steam account but you dont want to buy any expansive game? This a cheap steam upgrade pass you need!!  Good and fun to play. Its like CoD zombies but without the zombies or the CoD. A very good survival game for its price.
9603	1	a	This game is fun to play with friends, i hate those stupid tiny dinos tho xD
9605	1	a	its...ok  has some technical difficulties but ovl its decent, for sure worth the price just for few hours
9607	1	a	mostly unlrealistic weapons + 50% cartoonish gameplay + no blood = great for kids who want a shooter game  8/10  10/10
9609	1	a	Definitely a fun way to kill a few hours with friends, and it's cheap, which is great.
9611	1	a	I've never had so much fun, particularly for 99 cents. This game is absurdly fun with a friend, especially side by side LAN. I would probably pay as much as $5-$10 for this game, in fact - I know there are a ton of reviews about how laughably broken the game is, but I honestly did not spot too many bugs. I suspect an update or two has cured many of the old issues.  AWESOME GAME.
9613	1	a	360 no scoped a t-rex offof a cliff... 11/10
9615	1	a	'Good' multiplayer game. Great with friends!
2907	0	a	Just a big waste of time and money.
2908	0	a	I don't know about you guys, but for me, this is a weird experience, when i'm in the menu screen, for some reason my graphics card goes up to 60-70 celcius, which is kind of weird, keep in mind i can play Skyrim for hours with it being stable on 60 or maybe 70, but in this game, as soon as i start i can hear the fan speed increasing dramaticly... In case you're wondering what graphics card i use, it's GTX 670.
9617	1	a	This is probably the best game I have ever bought for a dollar! I mean its a dollar just give it a try! It has a few bugs but nothing game wrecking. Its like if you put Halo Spartans in Jurrassic Park and told them to blow everything up.
9619	1	a	I need a better PC to play this game but it's definately worth while!
9621	1	a	It's very fun game to be played with friends. But the aiming is not quite good. Need more improvements. 
9623	1	a	if i had the choice to buy this or call of duty i would defintley buy this even if they were the same price i mean you can buy four of these for a 1/9 of the cost of COD for you and your friends to enjoy and the bugs are usually enjoyable
9625	1	a	this game is just awesome.i kill all of my friends as a spino.
9627	1	a	This game is quite fun in spite of it's self. During it's development history it has had a lot of ups and downs but in it's current state (v 2.1 as of this writing) it's game play is well worth the sub-$10 price.  It has a lot of sharp corners consisting of bugs and poor design concepts, yet the appeal remains for me. Hopefully a few more bug patches will ship for this before it's completely abandoned en leue of indie dev's next project.
9629	1	a	Who wouldn't want to shoot a dino's head off for a dolla?
9631	1	a	Has sience gone to far?!?!??!?!?!?!?!?  1337/10
9633	1	a	Worth every penny! Because it's only 99 cents. Get it. It is a fun time-wasting game with interesting mechanics.
9635	1	a	tecnically is not a good game, but is really funny
9637	1	a	Fun,runs smooth and its only 99 cents.
9639	1	a	The dinos are there. That is all I have to say. When they get in your sight all you really want is to slay them all with no mercy. 11/10
9641	1	a	this game is extremely fun to play with a friend or two but never play alone.
2914	0	a	Boring game, got it as Steam gift back in the days, never liked it and surely don't like it now.
2915	0	a	The only thing that i truly interesting about this game is the mysterious uninstall button. I wonder what happens when i push it?
9643	1	a	No dinosaur boob physics....0/10 IGN Approved
9645	1	a	The only game on the market that combines the two best things in the world; Jetpacks and punching dinosaurs in the face!  10/10 - Get T-Rekt
2916	0	a	Primal Carnage is ALOT better than this pile of ****.
9647	1	a	Holy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ its bad
9649	1	a	Well, this game has the look and feel of 1998. There are dinosaurs and guns...try it? Idk...
9651	1	a	This game is the best cant wait to get started again 
9653	1	a	The raptors are too smart in this game. Before we knew it, they had learned to talk. They ridiculed our plan of rebooting the system. Then they started using guns! Our only chance was to get to the weapons closet for more gun but the Raptors found it first. They even emailed us to let us know they found it. Smug raptor jerks.   Overall this is a great game because it's nothing remotely like Jurassic Park. There aren't even raptors in it!!!  Happy Raptor Hunt! Chomp Chomp!
9655	1	a	The BEST game of 2012
9657	1	a	it was alright. i'll say they should change the hud a bit but it was nice
9659	1	a	I only bought this because it was 0,16$
2917	0	a	I can't really understand all the positive reviews. I got the game, it chose 1280x1024 by default when I have a 1920x1080 screen. The shooting feels slugish, and the game is just a repetetive horde-grind with little variation between hordes. The graphics are decent at best, great in the early 2000's. Music is mediocre and the character customization is poor.  The bullets must travel at 100 meters a second or something, because unless the dino is on top of you, you have to track the target to make up for bullet speed.  Oh, and it's nothing like Halo. Such a click-bait.
9661	1	a	I bought this game back when it was complete â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ but now it is amazing... Good job devs!
9663	1	a	I thought it was very good. It provided me with a fun experience and even though at the time it was early in development. Sorry it took me so long to write a review
9665	1	a	I wish I could pay more for this game. I've played this more than most of my $60 dollar games and have gotten far more hours of enjoyment. Bought this game for cheap figuring I'd give it a shot and it ended up being one of my favorite games. Orion should not be this cheap for the enjoyment it has brought.
9667	1	a	So, bought this game after reading an article about it (forget where). Picked up a 4-pack for my wife and a couple buddies, figured if nothing else it'd be worth the three whole bucks I paid for it.  So far, I've only got 5hrs on record this week, and I've been pleasantly surprised. The gameplay is pretty solid from what I've played so far (mostly survival and the one where you have multiple bases to defend). I look forward to doing some PvP stuff with my buddies to test that out.  From what I've seen so far - the graphics, sounds, etc are all pretty decently done. I've noticed only a few grahpical errors (such as when first bringing up a new gun that I purchased, it took a second for the model to fully load in), but otherwise I haven't really noticed any game breaking bugs.   If you're on the fence on this at all, I'd highly recommend picking it up - especially at $0.99. It's a solid little sci-fi dino-hunting that will give at least a few hours of play time, if not more.
2918	0	a	Steam says that I've got 2 hours on this crap. I can't refund it.
9669	1	a	Oh hell ya lots of fun.. I feel like i robbed you guys for the price I paid.
2919	0	a	DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!! BUGGY beyond beleief. Fun once you get it working, and in game, but until they fix a bunch of the problems, dont buy. 3/10
2920	0	a	THIS GAME SUCK BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD!!! DO NOT BUY IT!!! THANKS GOD IT'S ONLY ONE DOLLER
9671	1	a	This is an edit to the bash I did on steam on this not being a single player game after I read it was and couldn't find single player after downloading.   There is a single player mode but more importantly, once I tound it and tried the game again, it was a lot of fun. There are things to bash steam for but this isn't one of them.  Don't tell anyone but, I'd a paid for this game. :)
9673	1	a	Bought this game back when it was a piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Mad respect to the company for sticking with it, especially when most companies would've ditched it. Deserves your dollar just for that.
9675	1	a	ok this is a not a bad game, for what you buy it for worth the money.  all i can say is iv had more fun playing this with friends, we had some good momnets. (pos) good game, good grapics on max, wepons are ok,  (neg) i think that fact you just shoot things theres no story. the grapics only look nice when it rains. and the characters coustomise is to limated  so i rate this a 7/10 
9677	1	a	This is how i started this game Meh... dino survival game AND then later......ha raptor easy,dilo easy,pteredon easy,THEN.....round 30,2 TREX SPINOSAUR TRIKE STEGO CROCODILE.then dies: :( 12/10 BEST MOUNTAIN DEW EVER 
9679	1	a	worth a good laugh for 99 cents
9681	1	a	Its cheap, but for some reason its a ton of fun.
9683	1	a	this game has grown from what ever you would call the starting product , i am quite happy to have seen this game grow , its like a killingfloor type game , and for the price it is a yes from me
9685	1	a	Even tho this game isn't very popular, it's graphics are kinda basic, and the cosmetics are mostly paid, I must say this game is very nice, fun and interesting. It's transformation along the time was insane, and being rubish, turned into a pretty good game. Sincerely 8/10
9687	1	a	Good game on Unreal engine for only 0,79EU. Kill dino horde make money buy weapons, perks and upgrade your gear and kill again. I recomend buy 4-pack of game so you can gift it to your friends and howe more fun as team :)  PS Still have some network issues, but come on name one multiplayer game who does not have it :)
9689	1	a	This game is awesome for its price. Great to play with friends in PvP or survival and face with a lot of bosses. 10/10 because this game is so cheap and you will get amazing experience playing Orion:Prelude
9691	1	a	Game Play is GOOD
9693	1	a	Just one of the best games on Steam, that's all. 
9695	1	a	It's for cheap fun with friends.
9697	1	a	This is better than some $60 games I've played.  And it's only 99 cents.
9699	1	a	Really fun, decent quality, decent price and I like how you were making fun of your older game, sooooo....  keep up the good work!
9701	1	a	Great game everone likes it.For $0.99 it has as much value as a game that is for $60.00. Must have must play.Rating 8.9/10.
9703	1	a	i cant believe this game is only worth a dollar. only problem is theres definitly a couple of bugs some of them a little game impactful meaning they can take some of the fun away. For example if you get into the air vehicle and used the minigun towards the end of the 'mission' your camera in-game is permanently stuck zoomed in and is extreamly annoying. what i mean by permanent is that even when i restart my computer its still not fixed. BUT besides the bugs from what i played has a great PVE experience in round based dino shooter, and no the dinos are no pushover to your technology there is a challenge.  Edit: just found a way to fix this bug buts its a little inconvient. Deleat your local files from the games libray and reinstall the game, i did make a backup file for it just in case so i wouldnt lose anything so keep that in mind but it might fix it even without the backup file.
2924	0	a	Just...Don't.
9705	1	a	$1 on sale and a good game to mess around with friends for a few hours
9707	1	a	I was looking for it, it was actually fun. it is worth a try. I mean. its a freakin dollar! any meaninfull game you pay for, this one is worth more than the price
2925	0	a	The spec's need to be re-written. My computer is much more powerful than the Recommended System specs And I lag on the main menu, As well as in game. Fix this.
9709	1	a	Pretty fun and well worth the price. 
2926	0	a	its not that good at all
9711	1	a	A fun little game, suprisingly so for the graphics and price tag. Good with friends, but not too much map variety.
9713	1	a	Don't try and fight the dinosaurs. Instead, run up the cliff until you reach the limit and watch everyone suffer.
9715	1	a	Got eaten by t-rex 11/10
9717	1	a	If your looking for a game to jiggle your Dinosaur about... This is the perfect game for you. Dedicated to those with the finest caves.
9719	1	a	a really great game
9721	1	a	Really good game for the Price.  I reccomend if you want a few hours to spare with your friends, fun, cheap, and Dinosaurs
9723	1	a	very nice game
9725	1	a	aye they were probably drunk when they made this game but its still amazing
9727	1	a	this is the best game i have ever played. it is perfect.
9729	1	a	A pretty decent and fun game  8.5/10
9731	1	a	This game is overall some dirt cheap fun! A fun game to just waste time and mindlessly kill dinos. Well worth the measly 99 cent price.
9733	1	a	One of the best, if not the best co-op games I have played in my life. It is like Halo and Jurassic Park had a baby.
9735	1	a	Absolute T-Rex of a game, with dashings of pterodactyls
9737	1	a	Not what I thought it would be.....But â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it was only 99 cents.
9739	1	a	This game is very good.If you want to shoot dinos and play with friends.Here's a game for you. :3
9741	1	a	You can meet T-Rex
9743	1	a	Not bad, can do some more improvements on the graphics but the gameplay was EPIC
9745	1	a	Probably the bets game to play with your friends if your into FPS. Its crazy fun on a friday night with some pumping music!  Its so bad, its good!
9747	1	a	Pew pew pew, i killed a T rex! A must get for hours of fun. Plus its cheap too. 10/10
9749	1	a	This is a good game...Except it â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in crashes randomly.... OIherwise it is a good game
9751	1	a	Well I've had this game for a while now and this is my two cents on this title:  This is a fun game both solo and with others. There's quite a bit of content, more so given the maps fromt he workshop if that's your cup of tea. All in all I enjoy playing alone and with others from time to time. It's something different then your normal MMO type game, such as swtor, maplestory, etc. If I had to name what game this reminds me of, I'd have to say, torok, DinoiCriss, those kind of games. (forgive me if the spelling is a bit off, it's not one of my strongest subjects)  However there are a few down sides I've noticed. First there is the ability to join players even when they picked solo. That to me is kind of pointless, here's why. If someone clicks solo they did so to play alone not to play with others. I've done that a few times pre-prelude, meaning back when it was still dino horde. There wasn't a way to make it private or put a password on your game, at least not that i ever found. That is the frist con I have found with the game. However this has been fixed from what I've seen as now you can name a server you create and lock it with a password, make it private, and truely play alone. So that con has now been outdated with the release of prelude.   My next issue is more of something I've managed to do and I do not fault the game's play ability for it. I have just managed to get to lvl 55 on one of the classes. Now mind you I did this using an xp grind map from the workshop, but using the new prehistoric settings found in prelude sdkbeta. The issue was found after I hit lvl 50 and is still going on. My frame rate drops to the point that the game freezes. This could be the map, even though theres not much of anything on it, could be how fast I've been killing the dinos, could even be that it's a bug that happens else where in the game. I have done nothing to fully test this lag/frame rate drop. That is why it's more of a personal issue since I can't blame the game without knowing if it's happening to a lot of people. However there is a warning sign before it starts getting really bad, while in first person, you will see your body move around in front of your point of view. In 3rd person your body just rotates while your crosshair and bullet lines still seem to be aimmed where they were before the body starts to rotate. This maybe a small matter on my end or witht he map I was using, but it is troubling that it's only started doing this at lvl 50 when I'm using the prehistoric difficulty setting.   Other then all of that I give this game a 9 out of 10, the 9 is simply because I have yet to play all the maps that come with the game normally. Still one of the best games I've played involving dinos that is a 3d enviroment. Keep up the great work, and I'll keep recommending this to my friends. ^w^
9753	1	a	I'm recommending the game mainly because of its price point - $1.00  It's reasonably fun, albeit repetitive and the game still has some bugs that need to be worked out. But honestly, I've played games that I had less fun with that I paid $60 for - so give it a try.
9755	1	a	It can be a little buggy and the framerate can get really bad, even with really good gear. However, it's a really great game, compared to what it used to be anyway. I would wait a little while for the developers to work on some minor bugs and stuff, but its cheap and fun
9757	1	a	You get to punch a T-rex in the face. A T-REX. IN THE FACE. That's like all my childhood desires rolled into one ridiculously enjoyable, electronic â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
9759	1	a	11/10 would kill my team again driving off a cliff
2929	0	a	This game sucks so bad....
9761	1	a	In 2014 I downloaded one of the worst games of all time, however I found out 6 months after buying this that it was in fact a decent game.   Pros: Fantastic gameplay Good environments No bugs or issues found (so far) Dinosaurs vehicles to run raptors over in  Cons: Character models look like something from halo 2 (2004)   This game is fantastic to play with your m80s, the co-opertative gameplay is well refined.   
9763	1	a	This game is still rough around the edges... but for a dollar I am so impressed. I am surprised how much stuff there is in this game.
9765	1	a	Buy one copy......BUT 10 COPIES AND GIVE THEM TO PEOPLE!!!!  This the best game you can spend $0.99 on and honestly I'd spend $10+ on it if it came to it!!! It's worth every cent, it's a ton of fun, and I'd definitively recommend it to everyone!
9767	1	a	Super cool devs even though the game itself may not be the most fun thing in the world. Would recommend if you are at all interested in shooting dinosaurs in the face with halo guns.
9769	1	a	While the game started pretty badly, it has evolved into one of the msot dynamic, fun filled games for sometimes under $1.  This is a must have game for every account.
9771	1	a	I got more fun out of this than Call of duty black ops II and I put together, best dollar i ever spent!
9773	1	a	It's just good. Not epic or great but that's not a bad thing. Its like games similar to tetris in that regard. Because its just good it stays good everytime you play it. Its a pretty well polished and simple. Great way to kill time. Even better with firends. Solid 7/10 and worth at least 25 times what they charge for it. Its pretty much free so just buy it.
9775	1	a	Just â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing epic with your friends
2931	0	a	A new twist to the Zombie survival genre. With tons of farming tools you can slaughter zombies for days! To catch these dinosaurs you have to have things that are called 'PokÃ©balls'. After you have a full party of 10 members you can start platforming on some HARD levels. I have yet to meet a game that has flying bears that fall from space to mars. I recommend this game to anyone who likes Dance Dance Revolution.
9777	1	a	This Game is indeed fun to play if you play it with friends or one of the PvP modes. I doubt that there is a better game on steam for only 99 cents ;) Also it is remarkable how the developer is still updating this game! For fans of dinosaurs, FPS and randomness it is a must-have.
9779	1	a	Its 'Great' for a 1$ game,Pffffff there are skins in cs:go and wepons in tf2 that cost MUCH more than this game.
9781	1	a	good game for only 0.79
9783	1	a	Bloody amazing game for 99 cents or less. It is an indie dino-shooter which is lots of fun and is sure to last! By the way, melee is OP!
9785	1	a	Paid 59p got Genaro-ed by a T-Rex  All joking aside this is a whole lot of fun Serious Sam meets Halo plus Jurassic Park.  Its not cutting edge graphics wise but it still looks good.  Literally just jump in and play.
2932	0	a	15 minutes of crap this game is so bad everything is bad
9787	1	a	Great game, great coop, addicting, runs smoothly, = amazing game worth you money
9789	1	a	Better than Dayz
9791	1	a	ITS LIKE DK BUT NOT REALLY EVEN LIKE IT! 10 ISIS Soldiers Out of 10!
9793	1	a	Very cheap and its worth of its money. I truly recommend this game if you like FPS
9795	1	a	Nice Game Devs it Suprised me in so much Ways Cod Wouldnt Thanks for giveing me an FPS Title that i'll love
9797	1	a	An excellent game in concept and execution that has animal welfare groups up in arms.   Basically think of this game as a combination of Mass Effect 3's multiplayer (with dinos instead of Reapers) as well as the vehicles of Unreal Tournament and you now have a solid idea what Orion Prelude is.   What should be noted here is the legendary effort by the developer to fix what was at first many years ago a broken and absolutely tyranno game. Orion Prelude is now a worthy addition to any gamer's library as well as for those who are looking for a FPS game that does not take itself seriously.  For added product longevity as well as serving as the single player content, Orion Prelude features bots in two of its many game play modes, this allows for offline/casual game play as well as for people to enjoy Orion Prelude many years into the future.
9799	1	a	I payed a dollar for it a long time ago and it honestly wasn't worth it.  I gave it a try a few hours ago and it has come a long way, at the very least it's definitely worth the dollar.
2934	0	a	Major update. Developers claim to have done some work on it (which i don't say they haven't). Same ol' Dino: Horde... Still not polished. Lags with relatively low dino count. I have gone from stable 60fps to 20-15fps when about 100 dinos kick in (with minimum graphics and perfectly meeting min. system specs,  
2935	0	a	Nice to see that these â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s make it to where you cant even play the game, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ the steam community for putting this on here.
9801	1	a	Is this game perfect? No. It has its flaws and bugs but is a very fun little game to have in your library. For a regular price of 0.99$ and also goes (goes?) on sale occaisionally this is a fun game
9803	1	a	This game is amazing!!!!!! 9/10 stars epic game for an epic price!!! Only downside controller support not quite complete maybe if use special was use if you are around a vechile or generator so you don't have to press E every time you want to use an object when using a controller.
9805	1	a	Pretty damn great, but some things are way better than others... *ahem* rockets with all upgrades *ahem*. Buying this soon, its like a 50$ game
9807	1	a	It's really tough to explain the appeal of this game. It is unbalanced, kind of repetative, a little akward, but also gloriously fun. For about 4 hours. And for a dollar that is great deal.
9809	1	a	
9811	1	a	it is one of the best games ever
9813	1	a	7/10  This is not a AAA title, it's not a multimillion dollar project, it looks like a final project for a college game design class (not exactly a bad thing). What it is, despite the low budget and little issues, is fun. Super fun. Think Halo meets Turok with a dash of Tribes and a hint StarHawk. The game is fairly easy and straight forward so you don't often end up in matches with players that single handedly lose the match. It's cheap, it's fun, it's easy to learn. Give it a try. Just don't expect something mind shattering. I forgot to mention the superb weather and day/night effects. When you get into it, night time rain is really spooky. The frost effects on the arctic map are amazing too. The longer you're outside or using the jetpack, the more frosted your visor gets and the game gets nuts.
9815	1	a	This game is so amusing to play. It's fun to take a bow and shoot a T-Rex in the face. I recommend you play it while it's free, and if you don't, because it's too late by the time you read my review, buy it! It's only a dollar. I recommend buying the four pack. It's awesome if you can get a group of friends together and play it!
9817	1	a	So, I had no idea this game existed until my boyfriend mentioned it to me. It's like Unreal Tournament, Halo, and Jurassic Park/Turok had the best megababy!  It is absolutely ridiculous and fun. There's still some glitchy-ness here and there, but I'm going to chalk that up to my computer or something, just sometimes I lag when the kills start racking up - but it's not so bad I can't enjoy myself.  Best multiplayer experience I've had in a long time!
9819	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing addicting as hell and its only a dollar, BUY IT, it seems silly but that is part of the charm, you have a ton of weapons and the vehicles are badass and its just a fun romp shooting dinosaurs in the face  and the upgrades are useful and add another nice element to the game, even if you only play it a few hours youd hav spent more at an arcade on much worse games no?  do it just to shoot a TREX IN THE FACE!!!
9821	1	a	This game is only 74 cents and its free to play right now? Might as well give it a shot.....  HOLY CRAP I WANT THIS GAME!!!!  This game has dinosaurs, lots of weapons, driveable vehicles, and huge maps. I highly recommend this game and since its only 74 cents, its a steal.
9823	1	a	I reckon this should be on a humble indie bundle.   You really can't give a bad review of this game given its only a dollar and is still supported by the devs after 3 years!
9825	1	a	I Loved The Game And Now Knowing That People Really Liked It Means That I Will Not Be The Only One Playing It In Years To Come. And In One Word Thanks.
9827	1	a	One of the best games you can get on sale for less than a dollar. It's enjoyable, entertaining, and amazing for coop with friends.
9829	1	a	Not even one minute played 11/10
9831	1	a	I purchased this game a long, long time ago; along with copies for friends of mine. We always thought this was a pretty fun (and sometimes funny) game but always ended up rage quitting from the wave mode difficulty. The developers have supported this game for so long, even though it wasn't the greatest game for the longest time. I have seen this game in turd stage, polished turd stage, and now it seems to have been overhauled. I can't wait to tell my buddies about the latest update! Keep it up!
9833	1	a	This game is obviously a labor of love. Good game
9835	1	a	Played it for the free week or so they offered. Costs a buck, and its 25 off so its 75c at the moment. Just played an hour easy and had heaps of fun. Bought it as I closed it to have a break, no regret, no problem. Reminds me of Halo, a Survival Defense on most levels, great PVE fun. Vehicles and stuff are sweat, love the slomo team mate deaths and the general attitude. Needs more Aussie servers but hey EVERYONE can afford it for a buck and populate those servers :P  I understand they got a bad rep in the past when they released it but ive found no problems now with this and would recommend this over any of the cods that have come out lately. Same content but more fun!  7/10 9/10 for the value and effort put in by the devs WELL DONE!
9837	1	a	Very fun little game! I still feel like it still doesnt feel fully polished but for only a dollar how could you go wrong! This game is ridicilously cheap for what it is. Im so glad the developers kept on pushing it after all this years and in all honesty I would be totally fine with paying even a bit more for this game.
9839	1	a	So.... First impressions?  This game is trying so hard to be... Halo + Turok. I mean the feeling i get, jumping straight into this game, with absolutely NO campaign dialogue, 0 tutorial, and no story as to WHY these dinos are assaulting me is just the utter lack of 'Wheres the bloody plot?'  So Gameplay wise, the controls are very hectic, starting off with what feels like a cursor movement of 10/10 setting i feel like my first few seconds id snap the neck of my avatar if it were a real person. After getting used to the controls, it feels and reacts very naturally, like any common shooter would. Controls follow the typical Forward back, left right, crouch and shoot functions. I like the addition of the shortcut commands, and that helps in a pinch instead of typing out the messages individually and having the text pop up on the screen.  Graphics.... uhm... The dinosaurs are very blurry, the movements are very sketched together, and the overall texturing of the avatars is very blurry. The landscape however is beautiful! Especially tying in the natural sun glare with staring up at the sun, the rain and drops on your visor/hud are very wonderful effects. The fog and the steam also is a very well designed mechanic. Just overall landscape wise is beautiful.  Sounds. It seriously sounds like some of the audio is played by the Halo announcer himself. Enough said.  Overall, I played this game for about 20 minutes of my evening, and first reaction it has alot of potential. This is definately a game that could do something but in the Multiplayer state it is, it feels too narrow. There are already too many GREAT and AWESOME FPS games that incorperate a wonderful and seamless Campaign or backstory, that this game would easily fall into obscurity for sheer lack of the ability for it to overcome that knowledge. The Lack of the story and the utter confusion just being dropped into the bunker that first time is very unsettling to a gamer who is used to having at least a little bit of a 'this is the universe' kind of opener.
9841	1	a	This game is fun!!!
2943	0	a	I played this game when it first came out and it was really â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.... I just played the new version of this game and I don't know what the difference is. Still pretty bad... But whatever. Just not for me.
2944	0	a	I couldn't believe how bad this was. Worst game I've played all year. As much as I like getting to test games I wouldn't otherwise buy... This wouldn't even be worth downloading for free.
9843	1	a	vary fun and is a buck
9845	1	a	Great game but could you please fix the lag?
9847	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ was 0.99 cent
9849	1	a	Call of duty fans unite and kill dino's
9851	1	a	Who knew that the best game on steam would only cost a dollar.
9853	1	a	I paid around 30 cents to.... Shoot raptors. Get a free sky tour that ended with a free sky diving lesson. Bought guns, only to realize my knife was better. Knife'd a T-Rex in the butt. Became Queen of the Dinosaurs. Worth it.
9855	1	a	it doesnt want to work give me a solution 
9857	1	a	Okay.. within my first match I rammed both a T-Rex and a Stego with a 4-Wheeler while a teammate was shooting at them with a tank. After which I went back for supplies and found a mech so proceeded to shoot the crap out of raptors with it while firing homing charges.   What about that doesn't sound like a good time?
9859	1	a	I shot a T-Rex in the face with a tank and then had a little Compy blow up my tank with it's baby jaws.  10/10 Clever Gurl     I have to say other than server lag this game is very addictive. It is dated looking sure but plays awesome. Cool guns and weaponized transport 'inspired' by the likes of Halo this game can be hard to stop playing unless you lose connection to the server. And it's only a dollar, I bet you use more than a dollars worth of TP a day.
2946	0	a	Pve normal and PVP only dinos vs ppl . Bad game not worth
9861	1	a	Haven't played any other games that lets me repeatedly quickscope raptors
9863	1	a	Guns, dinosaurs, vehicles, a lightsaber and even some horrible game design! You can even play as the dinosaurs! Why has this sat in my steam folder for so long?!? Everything I have ever wanted in a co-op game and more 10/10.
2947	0	a	Waste of bandwidth.
9865	1	a	this game is...just fantastic. i'm trying to buy it, but it won't let me. i downloaded it for free off of steam, but i'd like to actually buy it and support you guys :P wat do
9867	1	a	Just sniped a Trex . 10/10 would do that again . Definitely worth it and it's just 1 dollar :D
9869	1	a	This is one of the best games i ever played 11/10
9871	1	a	the game is realy fun and i hate him. 10/10
9873	1	a	My friends and I jokingly installed this game and laughed at it for a good three hours. It's a lot of fun and definitely worth a purchase if you've taken advantage of trying it out for free. Servers can get pretty choppy at times. In my experience at least, the game does run a bit more smoothly after a little while.   
9875	1	a	This game is....actually damn good. All it needed was a good playerbase to go along with these updates and boom, really fun. I suffered from a couple frame drops but perhaps I need to adjust some more settings. Aside from that, really fun game with friends/strangers.  8/10
2953	0	a	Day 1: Im surviving Forever. Day 2: Seriously Im not going to let a dino eat m... *Din eats*
9877	1	a	I have no idea what I'm supposed to do, but I think shooting dinosaurs is part of it. And shooting dinosaurs shouldn't be this much fun for a dollar.  PS: don't attack a t-rex with a lightsaber
9879	1	a	Best 75 cents I've ever spent. I killed a pumpkin king!   p.s. it's way harder than it sounds.
9881	1	a	Eh, it's fine. Fun first or third person dinosaur shooting. There is also a deathmatch mode, the respawn times get a little frustrating though. It'll run on lower end systems too.   Just remember to heal your teammates instead of driving over them like a chode.
9883	1	a	Not a bad game if you like FPS, &amp; co-op PVE.
9885	1	a	Really fun game. Gameplay is a little repetetive after a while but there are lots of customisations available within the three classes, lots of weapons and upgrades within the game also.
9887	1	a	Surprisingly alot of fun for a dollar.
9889	1	a	Shoot at some damn dinosaurs for a little bit and some wierd f-in robots and Santa and idk some other stuff. This game is a mix of Borderlands/Killing Floor/ and Halo but not as great as any of those titles. With that being said, it's worth getting and fun to play for the price so just buy it you loser
9891	1	a	I got the game for $0.50. Why would I hate on it.
9893	1	a	This game is actually pretty â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ fun (stiff movement aside) cuz who doesn't like getting one shot by a hugeeeeee T-Rex while driving a tank \o/  10/10
9895	1	a	I watched my best friend get triple teamed by a triceratops, a t rex, and a stegosaurus. To be fair, they might have been provoked by the rockets he was firing from his mech suit. The best use to date of the unreal engine and 75 cents.    HOW HAVE YOU NOT BOUGHT THIS YET?!?!?!?!?!
9897	1	a	this game is so fun, only 20 minutes into it then i loved it so much
9899	1	a	i dont remember playing it sooo...must be good
9901	1	a	Honestly, when this game came out I thought the critics rated it a little harshly but I can't say they where wrong. Now after I have played it myself a few years later, I can say it is a good game. It's not a masterpiece in any sense of the word, but it is some mindless fun with your friends for a few hours every now and then. I've even had quite fun with playing by my lonesome with the bots.
9903	1	a	i bought 3 copies of this game for my friends to play, it was an epic idea but sucked when it was down to gameplay but not...oh but now i wanna hug the devs
9905	1	a	This game has everything; Dinosaurs, a store for buying needless objects in real money, characters modeled after women in their 40's, Guns and weapons loadouts, no storyline, online survival and team deathmatch, vehicles. yes, its got a tank! Better than halo's 2-5, not better than tribes.  I played this game twice today, had fun both times. Not sure how to feel about this one.  
9907	1	a	LOVE IT!!!!!!!!
9909	1	a	awesome game, my first playthrough was enjoyable and I will keep playing this game. definitely an awesome 'indie' type game that delivers.
9911	1	a	For what you pay, its a great multiplayer experience. The different species of dino is the basic wave monster fodder, and the classes and abiliites are also the usual suspects as well. However, the game offers a great amount of customizability, and allows you to adjust your loadout to meet your own personal preferences. The weapons handle well, and although I had my favorites, there weren't any I hated or couldn't stand. I played this game two years back when during its first free weekend, and it has come a long way since then. It sticks to what works, and the price is more than reasonable.  8.7/10 I don't know what I am doing, or how the dinosaurs got there, but I am more than happy to keep killing them.
9913	1	a	I really recommand this game cuz' he has: -Action :which is very good at a shooter game cuz u can't just stay in a place and wait for the enemies , thats boring... -Sci-fi : Dinosaurs... Awesome. Whats more awesome? To play as a dinosaur. And this game. allows u to do this. -Graphic : From this pont , i can't say the graphic is the best of what i ever seen but i can say that this game has a little bit of a shooter game's graphic... Isn't like Counter Strike 1.6. with pixels. Anyway , the graphic is good. -Costumize : It would be boring if u could just look like a default character. Cuz m aybe u don't like how it looks and then... what are u doin'? Costumize it ( if the game allows u to do it ). Anyway this game has the costumize option ( so thats a point : the developers thinked at the players. ( That count as : You metter ) -And in finally...special powers : U saw that , if u played , u can fly sometimes or make urself invisible for a while.or.... I think i forgot the last one xD... Anyway , 'ORION:Prelude' thinked at the best. They allow u to be a lil bit powerful ... maybe more then dinosaurs sometimes.   *Sorry for bad english if there are some mistakes* *Sorry if u don't like this long argument* *Sorry for taking ur time while u readed this*
9915	1	a	I LIKED THE VIOLENCE AND BLOOD WHEN YOU KILL DINOS
9917	1	a	best game for co-op, the classes are so much fun to learn. 10/10 best played with friends  can play solo but not as much fun then with friends fusion between planetside, jurassic park, and halo
9919	1	a	This game is so cool fun to play this game need to get it
9921	1	a	A couple gumballs that will last a couple minutes or a game that will last you a couple hours, your choice.
9923	1	a	This game is worth so much more than the ticket price. It offers a very acceptable cell-shaded graphics style that works well for it. The maps are large and varied. The dinosaurs look great. The game handles like you'd expect an arena FPS to handle. All in all, I have to give props to the developers for sticking with their original concept and turning it into a fun party arena survival game.  TLDR: Fun shooter.
9925	1	a	So I have had this game in my inventory since it's first Orion release. Back then, I played the game, uninstalled. It was buggy, servers didn't run and they got called all tons of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.  I was surprised it still even was on steam, but it was listed as a 'recently updated'. Figured I'd test it.   Oddly enough, ORION didn't pack their â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and bailed, they fixed everything. This game is worth way more than a dollar. Way to turn â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ into gold.   &lt;insert generic saw santa get eaten by a t-rex 10/10 comment here&gt;
9927	1	a	This is Halo vehicles, base defense, RPG elements per game (augments and upgrades), Counterstrike (buy weapons every round), battlefield (revive teammates), all in a fast Unreal Tournament engine. Essentially, take the best aspects of any FPS you've ever played, and you've got this.  I don't personally care about the dinosaurs, I'd be fine with some kind of imagined alien. However, the dino aspect fits the setting, which is well done, and it is moe than a little hilarious. I love it!
2956	0	a	I tried to like it        but I really, really dont.
9929	1	a	this is what i say from 2013 the game was frekain terrbal dinosuares were going nuts palnes went in circels insted of stright and guns shot down inste dof up and u spawned upside msot of the times and the t-rex all ways sticked its tounge out when we rammed it with a plane which was funny now in 2015 cause i dint play it in 2 yrs it op........... lag is still a issue thoue oh well time to start re-palying old damn games that we all knew it was complete faliure
9931	1	a	very good game i havnt had a challenge and felt like i could be over run in any second ever since i played natural selection 2 
2958	0	a	worst game ever so many glitches it never works dont get this game.
2959	0	a	Turok with better graphics... need I say more?
9933	1	a	such dino  much blood  so good
9935	1	a	for 1 $ perfect . if u want new special effects your not gonna find them here some levels have borderlands 2 graphics (reminds me of it) lvl up system different game modes 3 classes well i enjoyed the free weekend so far . 1$ for this funny game or 60$ for a new one :)  edit.: i forgot to say there is a Ingame Shop which seems to offer 'custom gear and colors' for real money they are not relevant to gameplay or balance but the hats and colors are only bought not earnd in a free way.
9937	1	a	Hey There Mr.dinosaur.. AHHH F*CK NOOO NOO NOOO NOOOOO DONT F*CKING EAT ME... â™¥â™¥â™¥...   If you pay for it, I feel sorry for your 99 cents... not really I got this game for free from owning The original ORION game, and from what Ive played of it its incredibly difficult to start out. When you encounter a dinosaur in FFA, YOU WILL DIE, unless its one of those smaller chompers. overall the game is good, when kiddies arent camping and Cross-mapping you to death. 7 1/2 out of 10.
9939	1	a	If you can run over raptors, you can guarentee it will be a perfect game. You can run over raptors in Orion: Prelude.
9941	1	a	Dinos and lightsabers what words can describe this?
9943	1	a	From zero to hero. This game is stable.
9945	1	a	Dispite what some people say this game is actually pretty fun! It is amazing how they managed to completely turn it around. I played it when it was in early access and it was terible but now it is great! It's fun with your friends and the combat feels strong imstd of being floppy and bouant. I'd give it a 8/10!
9947	1	a	This game has so much potential! Fun to play!
9949	1	a	HOW ON GALLIFREY'S NAME DID HUMEN'S TIME TRAVEL I WHENT 100 TRILLION YEARS TO THE FUTURE AND BACK AND THAY HAD NO TIME TRAVEL!!!! im going to meet them. TO THE TARDIS!!! #TIMEHUMENS
9951	1	a	10/10 so good. Me and my friends got cancer from it but soooo worth.
2962	0	a	I would rather eat â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ than play this game for 1 minute. (My playtime is idleing cards)
9953	1	a	It's inspiring to see what SPIRAL have done with this game. It would be nice to see other developers (especially the ones that have poorly made early access titles and false promises) take a hint from them.
9955	1	a	I picked this game up a while back during one of the free week events for only a few pounds. It was pretty decent but there were still a lot of very noticeable bugs, and I was aware of it's jagged history. I may not have played it much lately but I've been following each update, and I'm extremely impressed. That the developers spent so long supporting and working on a game they admit was a disaster and managing to turn it into something that could rival some of the more popular titles on Steam is nothing short of applause worthy. And the price drop, holy  hell . This is one of, if not the cheapest games on here. BUY THIS.
9957	1	a	It's one dollar......that is it.......
9959	1	a	Today I rode a T-rex to my death while shooting other dinosaurs in the face. 10/10
9961	1	a	In support of the recent success and new sale all I can say is.... buy it.  There's only 2 things I regret. That I didn't pay more to such awesome developers because I bought it during their first $1 sale. And that my play time isn't higher.   If you have a steam account and I know you do because your reading this.... you need to buy this for $1... twice.... maybe more  There's no excuse not to.... Seriously, what else are you waiting on?  &gt;=)
9963	1	a	Definitely worth the 99 cents for a fun multiplayer dinosaur-hunting game.
9965	1	a	Played for an hour, got boring. If u like firing guns at dinosaurs get the game but I'm not into them so this game isnt for me. Cool game tho.
9967	1	a	&gt;be pleb me &gt;playing Orion: DH &gt;this game sucks but i love it so &gt;stop playing, wait months l8r &gt;see news about prelude &gt;huh.jpg &gt;jump in-game &gt;curb-stomped a baby dino with my knife &gt;thefeelsareback.mpeg &gt;Score: Tangofoxtrot/OrphanTears+3 pears &gt;would play again
9969	1	a	Clearly it's great i can tell by the trailer the last time i played it was laggy and sucked now it seems like a complete awesome game.
9971	1	a	IT IS VERY COOL   
9973	1	a	Flew my car into a horde of dinosaurs....I died. 10000/10
9975	1	a	One of the best games on steam to play when you want to relax and kick back.
2963	0	a	Crashes on startup.
9977	1	a	One of the greatest games I've ever played for $1.  10/10
9979	1	a	I bought this game when it came out. For $6 is was good. For $1 its even better!
9981	1	a	I bought this game back when it was considered the worst game on steam, which it was. But i still personally enjoyed it, and i recommended it to anyone who just wanted to blast some dinos.  Now, several years later and after loads of updates, the developers have really redeemed themselves. The developers listened to the community, and got to work despite all the hate they recieved. (My hat off to you devs.)  Now i can highly recommend this game to anyone who wishes a cheap, but fun game to play! This game isn't for everyone, ofcourse. But with all the different gamemodes, the good community and the chance to get eaten by a T-rex you're bound to have fun with it!
9983	1	a	Keep stabbing ankle on that T-Rex!!!  8/10
9985	1	a	it's ok
2966	0	a	Animations suck. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ motion blur on the dinosoars. Bad quality sound Crappy UI yeah I think that's all.
9987	1	a	AWESOME GAME better than cod zombies the only reason to hate this game is beacuase you are fighting DINOSAURS, which some may percieve as stupid. but this game maintains to still be awesome and be WAAAAAAY under priced. Also it has good graphics fluency. It is REALLY HARD. but you can make it easy 9.5/10
9989	1	a	Probably the best videogame in existence. There are costumes, and Sandwich hats, and Dinosaur Killing.  So much Dinosaur Killing.  10/10.  Logical Conclusion to Gaming.
9991	1	a	Ummm... yes please B^U
2967	0	a	It's fun the first few minutes, it's not a fun game to play and of course the game is $0.99 so I wouldn't compare it to other dinosaur-fps games like Turak or w/e. But It was fun, the bad part about is that the mouse sensitivity doesn't match with the menu options and in-game. And what that means is if my mouse sensitivity is fast in game, it'll be super slow while I'm in the options/menu screen and buy menu screen. Also once the bots discover the vehicles, that's all they'll use; All 3 will stay in the car and just drive around, sometime they'll stay still but most of the time they're just crusin' around. Which wasn't that helpful, but once again, this game is only partially fun if you play with friends. If you don't have a 'super computer,' or at least a decent computer, I don't recommend buying this game, because even on the lowest graphic settings, it'll still run really horribly. Also there's some parts in the game you get stuck in. This is all I've summed up from playing it for like 5-10 minutes, I would've played longer, but I had to disconnect because I got stuck twice, and couldn't get out without disconnecting and rejoining.
2968	0	a	These idiots need to update something because i cant â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ play, it crashes too much
9993	1	a	Such an underated game. Just amazing!
2969	0	a	So you are thinking of buying a Dinosaur FPS... for $1. What does that mean? What can you expect?  This game is heavily based on Unreal Tournaments invasion gameplay mode, you and a group of other people spawn and try to 'protect your base' from swarms of varying types of dinosaurs. Some are simple to spray and smear, others require larger amounts of bullets, etc etc.  Does it even stand out from mods you can download for unreal?  Personally... I enjoyed the little bit of it I played. While half of the features I was expecting to see didn't exsist or work, the game itself worked like you'd expect. Aim gun, pull trigger, watch dinosaur get mad/die, rinse and repeat. Some of the dinos had some entertaining bugs, but overall nothing too special.  What makes this game a bit interesting is the melee system they added in for PVP. It almost feels like PVK (Pirates Knights and Vikings) with about as much hit detection issues. It's laughable, and in some cases terrible. But strangely I enjoyed the experience (probably because I realized I got the whole mess for less than the cost of a humble bundle minimum).  Would I recommend this game? Not really no, as honestly your money should mean a bit more to you than to waste on a game that already exsists in another franchise. But if you are bored, have a buck, and wanted to waste a bit of time trying to play a game that doesn't really have that much to offer, I guess you couldn't go too wrong.
9995	1	a	Holy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is this the greatest game ever for $.99. Hell, it's the greatest game ever in general. 10/10.
9997	1	a	This game is probably the best bang for the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game in all of steam. You are gave the ability to trickshot dinosaurs while knowing the fact you spent under Â£1 for it. Definitely one for the grannys out there with aids.
9999	1	a	good game, good game ... for $1 ... It's not broken as old videos show and it was fun to play it for 15 minutes, gna play it later
