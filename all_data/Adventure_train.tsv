1	1	a	THEY FINALLY FIXED IT... YEARS AFTER BUYING THIS.. NO MODERN OS SUPPPORT... THEY EVEN TOOK IT OFF THE STEAM STORE FOR A YEAR OR TWO (EVEN THOUGH I HAD ALREADY MADE MY PURCHASE) GOG galaxy or wahtever the ♥♥♥♥ has had a proper version of this available for quite some time now. i logged in randomly to my steam account and saw that after years of zero support or patches i randomly got an 'update' for it that was suddenly downloading... i quickly rushed to see if they fixed the support so it would open in a dos box. boom. it was fixed, thanks steam... oh and i checked the store page to see if it went back up... sure enough.. it's back up. Can't wait to relive these classics. This seriously made my day.
3	1	a	Awesome game series from when I grew up. Sadly you cannot play all of them unless you have an old computer.
5	1	a	King's Quest 1 was the first game that deeply impressed and made me realize how videogames are a medium and format with limitless potential. I understood how they could go infinitely beyond the simpler arcade titles of its time, in which you just played an eternal repetition trying to reach a good score. Not that I am against this kind of game, hell I still play a lot of those to this day, but we couldn't just stop there and KQ's contribution was paramount for this.  The feeling of adventure and fantasy that the series provides - especially 1, 3, 5 and 6, and yeah I played them all - is unparalleled, and Roberta Williams' huge sensibility to transpose the magic feel of fables and folk tales to the games is a delight to enjoy. Somehow makes you see things with children's eyes again, with that mixture of curiosity, excitement and awe.  I'm very happy that this collection is back on the Steam store for old and new fans alike. It has been recently updated with a fix that we previously had to manually apply all the time, so there's also that. Have fun with 7 amazing classics!
7	1	a	What can't I say about King's Quest? I was near about raised on adventure games, and this was a big one. I didn't really appreciate it as much as a kid as I have on my recent replayings of the series. The one thing I will mention in regards to this collection, though, is that there are bugs that occur because this game was not built for newer systems. You can find the patches for it at  http://www.sierrahelp.com/Patches-Updates/Patches-Updates-Games/KingsQuestUpdates.html . Alternatively, you can purchase the collection from  GOG.com . They have it split into three sections, 1-3, 4-6, and 7-8, and 8 isn't included in this collection. I have yet to determine if this is a good or bad thing.  I'll also mention that AGDI made a wonderful remake for the original King's Quest to give it icons like KQV and KQVI had, and they did a big storyline overhaul for KQII that even included the original voice actor for Graham. They also did an update to KQIII with a little bit more story to it, as well as the icons. You can find them at  http://www.agdinteractive.com/ .
9	1	a	I looove the King's Quest Collection. The only downside, of which I hope it will get fixed soon, is that I can't play the King's Quest 7. The rest works except that one which I like the most of all. Also very strange, because KQ7 is the newest of this entire collection, so you would think that part 7 would work and that the older versions wouldn't work instead. But anyway... King's Quest 7 is the reason that I've bought the entire Collection so I am a bit dissapointed. I am looking forward to a fix! (I have Windows 8.1)
11	1	a	King's Quest VI is where it's at, son.
13	1	a	Not sure why people complain; have tried this on Windows 7 (disabled DEP) and works fine. It uses DOSBox to run the original game files. So if you experience issues you could easily replace the DOSBox binary. A nice collection, comparable to the GOG version (which is offered as three different items).
15	1	a	As a young kid I played these games religiously. I used to write letters to Sierra asking for help and they'd respond via snail mail. That was before AOL 4.0. These games have aged as well as can be expected. Simply put, if someone created these types of games today and marketed them as 'retro', 'pixel graphics', 'point and click', 'text adventures' etc.- I doubt they would be as well made as the KQC games. The nostalgia is overwhelming, the quality of the content is priceless, and the feeling of solving a puzzle is unparalleled. If you are around 30, you probably paid $150 or more for the box set back at Media Play. The games are almost as fun today at a fraction of the price. kQV... 'Look out Graham, that's a poiiiiiiisonnnnnus snake!' And KQIV? Come on, completing the game 100 points over the maximum score? KQ3, finding the right ingredients in the spell book to advance their game. KQVI, making your way into the castle for the first time just waiting for your opportunity to return. VIi, those graphics - the epic ending where the win / lose was completely random based on your computers mood. So many memories. Where is Laura Bow and the dagger of amen ra? Or mixed up mother goose. All of the ascii text games, NORTH NORTH WEST NORTH, ahh a shack in the desert. Oh the memories.
17	1	a	This collection is a must-have childhood classic for most of us. Rubbish graphics, zero mouse support for a lot of the earliest games, and yet I will still be putting hours into this for years to come (bye-bye to single-playthrough AAA titles).
19	1	a	Games of my childhood always have a sweet spot with me, and this whole collection has been one of my favorites. My father introduced me to King's Quest when I was young and he bought the first 4. I remember the rather unique official cheat books which required a special marker to make the invisivle ink to appear.  But to talk of this collection, the first four were originally text driven games. meaning that you have to type in commands like 'Look at woman,' or 'rub lamp.' The first three were then later re-worked with updated graphics (but still rather dated compared to today's games). Starting with 5, gameplay shifted a little, instead of being text driven, they became what is now called 'point and click.'  This collection is the story of how King Graham's family came to be, basically a preface to the more recent version that has come out, in whcih Graham recalls the stories of his youth, before he became king of Daventry. The first game in this collection covers the story of how Graham became kind. The second is about Graham finding a wife. The third seems a little odd when started, but it is about the lost children of Graham and their return to Daventry. In the fourth game, Graham, getting old, falls ill and his daughter, Rosella, undertakes a quest to find a way to heal Graham. The fifth game ties back to the third, the son of Graham, Alexander, having escaped the clutched of an evil magician, has brought upon daventry, the wrath of the magicians brother. It it up to Graham to find his now missing castle and family. The sixth installment ties into the fifth. Smitten by the beauty of Cassima, the princess that Graham rescued while restoring his family and kingdom, causes Alexander to search for her. The final game finally touches upon the queen Valance and Rosella, their rocky relationship of overprotective mother and rebellious daughter, and their way back to Daventry after being magicked away from home.  The games seem to work well on my computer, running Windows 10. I do have issue with alt-tabbing out in order to check the manuals for clues as to what to do in a few of the games. Back in the day, Sierra made games that had DRM imbedded in the manuals. What appears to be flavor text is really actually important, least you die is quite awful ways. This is the only difficulty I have with the collection. Alt-tabbing on my machine, causes the program to scrunch over to the left of the screen and in rendered in shades of gray.  There is one game missing in this collection, but it's somewhat of the black-sheep of the franchise, The Mask of Eternity. It was only set in Daventry and was panned as an awful game because of bugs, glitches, and graphic rendering issues. Of the old games, thsi is the one I have yet to play and have a slight curiosity in it. I udnerstand GOG does have it for sale, but it's bundled with the last game.
21	1	a	'All right! I'm going to play through them all in a row!' *Starts Kings Quest 1* *Walks into woodcutter's house* *Dies by falling into hole in the floor* 'That was Awesomeeeee!'
23	1	a	I loved these games when I was a kid. Loved them. My father and I would play them for hours.  I have never seen anywhere near as convincing an example of how much patience we have lost as a society in the intervening twenty-odd years, because holy crap are these downright unplayable now. These are some of the most obnoxiously, unnecessarily obtusely-made deathtraps in gaming history.  I died because I stood in front of a knee-height rock. I died because the game didn't interpret me hitting the left arrow. I died because there is a screen in the early game where there is a 50% chance you will simply unavoidably die and there is nothing you can do about it.  I have no idea why I kept playing video games. I have no idea why this was fun. I have no idea how I sleep at night, or indeed how I have ever.
25	1	a	Fantastic! Oldschool :D
27	1	a	Know your roots. If you are a fan of adventure games, you owe the King's Quest series for perfecting and popularizing captivating storylines to compliment inventive gameplay. Its like Devo or David Bowie, you owe this series a play simply because of the impact its had on modern gaming.
29	1	a	Works like a dream on my Window's XP &lt;3  Window's 7 however it is completely useless.  But seeing as it works good on my main computer, I will have to say I am very satisfied with this :3
31	1	a	King's Quest VI ... Still as fun as it was 22 years ago. A must-have adventure game!!  10/10
33	1	a	I was very happy to find these games on steam as they were childhood favorites. was not disappointed in reliving these games again!
35	1	a	GET YE FLASKE. YOU CANNOT GET YE FLASKE. Oh no, I've been turned into a snail! And now I'm dead. Lament! 7 out of 10.
37	1	a	A jaunt back to an admittably frustrating period in my childhood, a return to the King's Quest franchise reminds me that modern adventure games, be they ever so complex, could not possibly be as mind-bogglingly frustrating as some of the games in this series. It's fun to look back, but I don't know that these games would be particularly palatable to a younger audience, and there's a LOT of 'mother may I' throughout the series.  Some sort of technical issue is preventing me from playing anything before 4, but I will give a callout to the series for having a strong, relatable female protagonist in 4.
39	1	a	I grew up playing these games.
41	1	a	That's an old piece of magical white snake.
43	1	a	I can not get game VII to load at all and i cant get steam support. I purchased 50.00 in games and no support.
45	1	a	This port is rushed, incomplete and a pathetic attempt to cash in on a brilliant franchise while doing nothing to preserve its legacy. The color palatte is horrible, audio glitches abound, and the FMV looks even worse than it did 15 years ago. Steam normally does not dissapoint but this is one of the laziest releases they have ever put out and in its current form absolutely not even worth the $10 price tag
47	1	a	I absolutely LOVED this game growing up. It's pretty nostalgic for me, and even though *I* can't quite get the oldest games in the series to work (it wants me to reconfigure some settings for graphics and then it looks weird), I'm sure somebody more tech-savvy than myself could.
49	1	a	Old Scool Games are the best kind of games
51	1	a	Love this collection, brings me back to the old days :D
53	1	a	Unfortunately Steam is just selling 7 games that won't run. Was stupid enough to save 3$ on Steam instead of buying the games from gog. Well of course I bought them from gog directly after, running smooth. I just hate when big companies sell products like this, and you have no chanse to get your money back! Don't buy theese game here!!!!! Im recommending this game, but hopefully some of you won't throw 10$ in the sea, shame on you Steam!
55	1	a	I absolutely LOVED this game growing up. It's pretty nostalgic for me, and even though *I* can't quite get the oldest games in the series to work (it wants me to reconfigure some settings for graphics and then it looks weird), I'm sure somebody more tech-savvy than myself could.
57	1	a	Works on Windows XP.  Nice memories. KQ2 crashes when I try saving the game.
59	1	a	This series is over thirty years old now. You know what you're getting into.
61	1	a	I absolutely love this series, and I would recommend it to any point-and-click adventure fan. As long as your ready to deal with dosbox problems (which I find stupid), but if you can't wrap your head around it, buy it at a discount price.
63	1	a	I have been waiting for steam to fix the issues with this collection and bring it back up for sale. It works like a charm!I have windows 7, so I am able to play KQVII, which was my biggest reason for purchase.  If you have never played the series before and you like the point &amp; click genre of games, I highly recommend these! They are puzzle-filled fun and have some hilarious voice-acting to go along with them (well, IV-VII does). NOTE: Be sure to read the requirements on the page as not all the games work with all new operating systems.  Overall it's still tons of fun to play. 10/10 would rescue Etheria again.
65	1	a	No matter how many times I go back to these games, they never get old. Classics through and through.
67	1	a	Greatest game series of all time. I grew up playing King's Quest 1 &amp; 2. I remember drawing my own map for both games and writing down the code for the strange character ala (Rumplestiltskin). That isn't his name as it is jumbled up. So many great memories of this game.
22	0	a	Great. Whoever put this together can't even make DOSBox work right through a simple launcher, making the game require manually going in and configuring things correctly to get it running. Goodbye convinience factor.  Also, what the hell with not including the original non-VGA SQ1?
69	1	a	Space Quest was the very first PC game I ever played. I was addicted the moment I got it for Christmas way back in the 80s. Since then I was a huge adventure game fanatic and the Space Quest series were awesome. They had humor, fun puzzles, and good eye candy for the time. I have a lot of great memories spending all day at the computer playing the Space Quest series.
23	0	a	Very buggy - All of these games freeze when you die and try to restore, rather than having to start over. Space quest 6 crashes during initial load-up. Loved this game as a kid, but this release of it is super disapointing, its barely playable.
24	0	a	I recommend SQ3&amp;4 but better to get the collection on GOG - you have the option to only buy half, it uses a better version of DOSBox (albeit still misconfigured just as here, but it runs best in SCUMMVM anyway). It's also not region locked on GOG as it is here.   Most importantly, the GOG version can be more easily accessed on alternative platforms.
25	0	a	Very sad to say that none of the games will work. I loved these games when I was a kid and was really excited to see the whole bundle on sale. Unfortunately they are not configured to work on any modern PC. It is possible to work around this and load them through a properly configured DOS Box, but this takes some effort. It just relfects pure laziness and negligence on the part of the dsitrbutor who could have done so with minimal effort but preferred to just take peoples' money instead.
71	1	a	Space Quest is an excellent adventure game series that is a recognized classic. While it's not consistent throughout the series (mostly SQ VI, which isn't bad, but isn't great, either), the highpoints are tremendous. My favorite is easily SQ IV, but SQ I-III are also fantastic with the same sort of humor (I haven't played SQ V enough to rule on it).  It's important to mention that this collection is missing the original version of Space Quest I, which is an EGA version with a parser instead of point &amp; click. I personally missed it since I have nostalgic memories of playing it. It's also important to note that this collection has compatibility issues. EDIT: I believe this has since been fixed. The non-Legacy edition worked on Windows 10 for me. I still prefer downloading ScummVM (a client program which allows you to run old Sierra &amp; Lucas Arts games) and manually adding the games that way. ScummVM has plenty of options if you're a stickler for various graphics &amp; sound options (it can emulate the Roland MT-32, a legendary sound device back in the day, however, you will need the ROM for it). You can also get the GOG version which has the original version of SQ I instead of the point &amp; click remake.
73	1	a	First there old programs and when ran in 64 bit dont work right, there is a patch you can download and after you have followed the patch and installed they work great on windows 10 and 7. there great games and i would reccomend i do wish it was done better but heck it dose not take alot of work to make them run right.   The games are fantastic and funny and worth playing even if you need to install a patch to get them to work, below is a link to serriahelp for there old games and 64 bit patches to make this game work. there is also more help on the install in the community hub.    http://sierrahelp.com/Patches-Updates/NewSierraInstallers.html 
75	1	a	I'm not normally one to post reviews, but the Space Quest Collection is something different and worth sharing.  First things first, this is actually a collection of games, all of which were published around 1987-1995, way before I was even born. How I got into these games is that one day my dad was talking about some of the games he played way back when: DOOM, Duke Nukem, Leisure Suit Larry, and Space Quest, among others. Now, this last game was his favourite and seemed the most interesting to me, so I did some searching around and found this collection. So, following its purchase, my dad and I would play an hour or so of one of these games each night. I may have 20 hours played on record, but that's just online. At least double that number and you'll get how many wonderful hours I spent with my dad.  GAMEPLAY They are all text-based/point-and-click adventure games. I don't want to give away too much about these games, but you walk around, solve puzzles, complete segments, earn points, and die in horrible ways. It can be amazingly trolly, but rarely in a rage-inducing way. For the age of the games, they can be amazingly detailed in their settings and animations.  PROS +For my dad, this was one great big nostalgia explosion, and for me, it was amazingly fun in its simplicity compared to modern games. +Genuinely hard puzzles that have you scratching your head for ages. +Subtle (and sometimes not-so-subtle) humour and references abound in these games. Example: There's a town called Ulence Flats. Also, in one of the later games, you have the option to uninstall Leisure Suit Larry from an in-game computer and you get points for it.  CONS -The very first, original Space Quest game is not included; however, the 1991 remake of it is included in its place. Personally, I prefer the remake, but some people would like the original. -This is my biggest gripe: Not all the games are playable as-is. As an example, I had huge issues with colours being weird and games not saving. If you do a bit of digging in the Steam forums or online, you'll find the solutions, just like I did. -Even though I absolutely loved the first five games included, when I got to number six, I just couldn't play it. Not because it was broken; it worked fine. But because it was plain awful to play. The interface was garbage, the action was unexciting, and it was just plain meh. At least the other five made up for this one bomb. -There is no replayability. Once you solve the puzzles, the game is over. The only real option is if you keep replaying the games to find all the secrets and get the highest possible score.  TIPS ~Make sure you look at the virtual manual upon launch! There are 'firewalls' in some of the games to combat those who got the game illegally back in the day; if you didn't buy the game legitimately, you wouldn't have the manual, so you wouldn't be able to play the game because you wouldn't know, for example, an encrypted in-game destination included in the manual. ~Open up each of the games in turn to see how well they function. Do they look fine? Do they save? If not, do some searching on forums and you'll find a solution which can be implemented in ~5-10 minutes. ~DO NOT LOOK UP PUZZLE SOLUTIONS! You lose the joy and sense of accomplishment of actually discovering where you went wrong. That being said, there is a point when you should look at a solution to save your sanity, and there are solutions available online.  TL;DR 1) Did you play any of these games when they came out? 2) Do you like vintage games or have a thing for pixel art? 3) Do you like trolly text-based adventures? 4) Do you like pounding your head against the wall for hours trying to figure out a puzzle? If you answered 'Yes' to one or more of these questions, get the game, especially if it's on sale.  Solid 8/10.
26	0	a	Apparently, there is a hardcopy decoder that shipped with the CD waaaaaaay back in the day when this game was new. No one bothered to tell Steam about it, or to provide it to the player. As a result, I can't get past the first few steps of the first game. MAJOR FAIL. That's just ridiculous.  Playing Space Quest I, I can't even get out of the ship before it blows up. I tried EVERYTHING. I even resorted to trying every combination of wierd symbols on the cartridge device. In the game, there is a guy that dies and his last words are supposedly tied to this cartride retreival system that has some buttons with symbols on it. Presumably, the player has to enter the symbols that correspond to the words (and there's several words that are cycled through as you restart. over and over and over again). HOW IN THE EFF AM I SUPPOSED TO TRANSLATE THE WORD INTO WHATEVER SYMBOLS?  I finally caved and Googled the walk-through. That's when I found out about this decoder that shipped with the CD as some 'copy protection' wierdness. Luckily someone out there saved it and I can decode the message.,,,, Just ridiculous. I haven't even bothered to continue the first quest outside the ship - this whole debacle leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Steam should have known about the bizzare feature of the game and provided a PDF or something.,,,
77	1	a	 11/10   'Roger Wilco... What else do I have to say!'  An  Epic  Adventure, an  Epic  Man, an  Epic  Game - &amp;hero of my childhood :D  + amazing point &amp; click sci-fi adventure + story + setting + atmosphere + graphics (then) + characters + puzzles + humor   Should be in every Adventure Collection. (At least if you were born in the '80s.) 
79	1	a	I only played SQ2 back in day, so I decided to pick up this collection on sale. Pretty enjoyable classic comedy adventure games, totally worth the price.  Being pretty old, I wanted to post these tips on how to play these games with optimal graphics and particularly sound/music. 1. If you plan to play the games in DOSBox,  SierraHelp.com  has a patch for the collection that sets up a newer copy of DOSBox than is included (highly recommended), adds configuration programs that are missing, tweaks configs for optimal graphics and sound, and adds shortcuts that launch the games in DOXBox. Highly recommend only for SQ6 BECAUSE... 2. Space Quests 1 - 5 are supported by ScummVM, and it's by far the easiest/best way to play them. Saving and loading games come with screenshots and unlimited slots. Speed bugs are fixed. Runs efficiently and natively on a number of platforms. Even adds mouse support to SQ2. ScummVM will warn you if you patch the games as mentioned above; I had to revert the patch to get through SQ5. 3. Graphics and sound effect settings are handled optimally by default with either of the above choices. 4. Music gets a bit trickier to do 'right'. General MIDI/SoundFont can be chosen to taste, but most games created at the time targetted two top-tier music modules: the Roland MT-32 and later the Roland SoundCanvas.  A) SQ2 is the oldest, and supports PCjr/Tandy 3-tone sound in addition to PC speaker. You can try both settings in ScummVM to hear the difference. Default is the better Tandy mode.  B) SQ1 remake, SQ3, and SQ4 were composed for the MT-32. ScummVM comes with MT-32 emulator that is nearly spot -on. You need to add a couple ROM files to your ScummVM to enable this, Google for details. You'll see a 'INSERT BUCKAZOID' message once you have it working. C) SQ5 and SQ6 were composed for SoundCanvas/General MIDI. You can use FluidSynth in ScummVM with a SC SoundFont or one of your choice. For DOSBox, you'll need to add a software MIDI driver to you system. Virtual MIDI Synth is recommended, and their website is a good place to get SoundFont recommendations.  A little bit of effort can give you the best experience playing these Sierra classics.
81	1	a	Yes, I remember having to upgrade the RAM in our Tandy PC in order to run SQ1. I owned several of the games over the years but re-purchased this set to get them all, and to avoid having to pull out the 5.25' floppies. Do the games stand the test of time? Not really. Although I am sure the early text-entry episodes would tax some gamers today. But are they still great? You bet. Give me some Roger Wilco humor, sit back, and enjoy the pixels!
83	1	a	I dunno if they have updated this or what but I have checked all of the games out and they run fine. Many were saying that DosBox was configured incorrectly when they tried playing. Anyway, if it works for you, it is a great collection of classic games. I don't have much time tracked here on Steam, but I have put many hours into the Space Quest games over the years. I don't care how you play them. Get it on GOG or wherever you can. This is awesome gaming goodness.
85	1	a	First time playing the game and it seems quite interesting, challenging and very funny.  Some of the posts complain about not being able to crack the codes =&gt; Read the manual.  Initially it wouldn't run on my Win8.1 PC after installation - it would seem a bad dosbox configuration or possibly an issue with the emulator? Anyways - if anyone else has the same issue, these steps might work for you as well.   1. Right click the game when in your Steam Games Library &gt; 'Properties' &gt; Click the tab, 'LOCAL FILES' &gt; Click 'BROWSE LOCAL FILES...'  2. Open '.\dosbox-0.63\dosbox.conf' for editing in notepad..  3. Find (CTRL+F) 'core=' and change the value from 'dynamic' to 'simple' and save your changes (CTRL+S)..  4. Launch the game.
87	1	a	If you love classic games, then this is perfect. I grew up with this game series and I must say its one of the best series I have ever had the honor to play.
30	0	a	Bought the game... feeling nostalgic... thinking.. at last.. gonna play all... I only finished 5 and 6. Ups.. game doesnt work.. try again... nope... again... nope... again...  again... again.... again... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO lost of forums later..  uninstall the game and ask for a refund!
89	1	a	One of the best adventure game series of all time. It's also worth noting that the games in this collection run pretty smooth on Win 7.
31	0	a	So nobody will read this as the game is around 20 years old or something.  However i'd like to write that it is a disturbing trend that 'old school' games are being rejuvinated and made available to the modern gamer and tagged with a rather hefty price too.  Was this game (or series of games) worth the value? Absolutely not. Why did I buy the game then? You may ask this rightly and the answer is entirely sentimental. I loved the genre of game in its hayday and played this series of games with a fondness that is nearing reverence. As such, reliving some of my lost childhood was probably justifying the price paid for the Space Quest collection.  Imagine my deep disappointment then when trying to start any one of the games in the collection only to be met with the void of game failure. That's right folks, the games don't work. I'll reiterate for clarity: they do not work!  As a result of this I have come to the very sorry conclusion that no longer will I ever provide Valve a penny to relive some of my lost childhood memories. The price is already ridiculous and the value to cost ratio is further pushed towards a level of disgusting by the fact that the games simply don't work.  Feel free to return my money steam - i'll give you the game back.  So. In summary:  - game collection is too expensive - game doesn't work - ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t
91	1	a	Not sure why people complain; have tried this on Windows 7 (disabled DEP) and works fine. It uses DOSBox to run the original game files. So if you experience issues you could easily replace the DOSBox binary. A nice collection, comparable to the GOG version (which is offered as two different items).
93	1	a	Space Quest originally came out in 1986 -1995, so computers today were much too fast to emulate the games properly assuming you still had copies. This neat little collection brings these classic EGA and VGA hits to Windows XP/7. The 6 games included follow the tales of Space Janitor, Roger Wilco, and his quest to (somehow) save the galaxy, single-handed! Presented in Graphical Text-based to Point-and-Click, these adventure games are sure to bring you some good fun (and some frustrating times figuring out puzzles.) Being a major fan of Sierra Adventure Games, I definitely recommend this. Also check out Kings Quest, Quest for Glory, Police Quest, and many more great hits from Sierra of old.
95	1	a	Bring back the nostalgia where a janitor can save the universe, time and time again. Take on the role of Rodger Wilco as he battles Sariens, saving his home planet from being annoyed to death by door to door robot insurance salesmen...to trying to get rid of those stubborn mildew stains. Or just play it for the comedy.  This is old school gaming right here folks. The pack includes Space Quest 1 to 6. I really wish they made a Space Quest 7..
32	0	a	Does not run on modern systems. Somehow they've buggered up the dosbox config. So you'll need to fiddle around with this. Or just get the GoG version...
97	1	a	Classics from my youth.
99	1	a	A good oldie game series that I wish they would continue on. Much nostolgia had!
101	1	a	I'm a huge Sierra fangirl, and I loved the Space Quest games growing up, but this review is for the collection as a whole. There is one major thing missing from the manual PDF: a book that was included with the original Space Quest 6 that is the only way you can solve the datacorder puzzle. So if you don't have that book anymore (or in my case, I never originally purchased Space Quest 5 or 6 so I never had the book to begin with), that puzzle will need to be solved by searching for walkthroughs on the Internet. It's unfortunately just not a good implementation all the way around.  That being said, I still recommend it for Sierra fans who loved the games like I did growing up. Even despite frustrating pixel hunting and many, many deaths and failstates, these games are great granddaddies of adventure games as we know them today. And for that, I love them.
103	1	a	It is so good to rejoin Roger Wilco and The Two Guys From Andromeda after so many years!  For those that are new to Space Quest... It is a series of stories about a young ane brave space janitor, Roger Wilco, as he struggles through the galaxy to fight aliens and save the universe.. again and again. The games are set in clasical adventure game concept from 80s - 90s from using your keys to move and typing command for action - to point'n'click interface. As for story, it is one of the best I know, and You can be sure You will have a looooot of fun with this game. Don't be discouraged by old interface or pixel graphics - the game is worth it, and even if some puzzles are difficult, You can always find the solutions on internet. But try solving them by using, talking, moving, combining, etc.. everything with everything :D  As for some problems with launching the game, as I read in some other reviews. I just installed the game on my ASUS X53S i5-2430M, Win10PRO 64, 8GB RAM with GeForce GT 540M. After lunching the game, You will see a menu which allows You to choose one of the 6 games to start. I tried lunching everyone of them and everything works perfectly. No problems with graphics, sound or interface. No problem with Win10.   I strongly recommend the whole Space Quest series for everyone!
105	1	a	For everyone who is saying they can't play these games, just get ScummVM and run them from there. Yeah, you can't launch it from Steam, but at least you can play them.
107	1	a	A must have for every classic adventure fan out there, Roger Wilco our beloved space sanitor as he campaigns through the galaxy for 'truth, justice and really clean floors'. :)
109	1	a	Next to Sam and Max, the funniest original point and clicks. Get it so that maybe Sierra makes more.
111	1	a	This is a classic bundle of Sierra point-and-click games- a serious piece of gaming history. (Sierra is also known for the King's Quest and Police Quest series, among others.) If you like point and click games and aren't deterred by the pixelly graphics (you shouldn't be!), this is a great collection to add to your library.  One warning- much like King's Quest, you can make a mistake, forget to pick up an item, or do something in the wrong order, and mess up your whole save. Save the game often, so that you can pick up where you made the mistake instead of having to start from the beginning!  Playing with a walkthrough is only recommended if you care more about beating the game than about the journey of completing it.
113	1	a	I have never played a Point-And-Click in my life, but I like it.
36	0	a	Do not waste your money, unless you enjoy the puzzle of configurations to get it to work.  This has not been designed to work on modern computers and requires significant manual effort.  I feel I have been ripped off.
37	0	a	Awful, total waste of money, hasnt run, wont run and support non-exsitent 
115	1	a	I grew up on these games, along with all of the other Sierra point and click adventrues. These still make me laugh and are fun to play.
117	1	a	Have you ever had that game(s) that you just really wanted to like but couldn't it? Well this was one of those for me. Before I forget... played on a Win 7 32-bit OS, all 6 games played, sound, (insert usual computer specs that make me sound like I have best gaming rig ever or it's only a step up from grandma's dinosaur computer you stole from the nether regions of her basement)... blah blah.. it plays just fine for me.   Collectively, these games' initial learning curve is significant if you haven't played the style-genre from this era. The manual is useless. Seriously, google the games on  gamefaq.com  or watch some gameplay videos at  youtube.com . If you do youtube approach, stop after you get a sense of how to interact with everything. The core mechanice / fun of these games is discovery.   The humor is also a bit odd. The more you are into 'Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy', 'Dr. Who' style of humor mixed with Star Trek / Star Wars; the likely you are to love these games. The premise of the games is awesome. The hero / protagonist of the game is a janitor. As opposed to, you are some orphaned child who grows up to be the guy that saves the world after finding out his parents are some god / king. Better yet, someone who has this tragic backstory to overcome… aka Mommy and Daddy died due to some terrible, natural disaster (planet blowing up); killed by some evil (shot by random person A outside of a movie theatre) or (insert your favorite character defining moment here).  While I love the new BBC Sherlock and the humor in it, I couldn't get into this game.  So in short... plays fine on Win 7 32-bit OS with GeForce GTX 960. If you like British style humor and are willing to invest to get past the initial learning curve... this probably a great game for you.   If not... buy the game, try and request a refund in less 2 hr gameplay if not for you. This way if you ever are confronted by some retro-enthusiast and they ask you... did you ever play 'Space Quest'... you can say 'yes' and they will leave you alone. If you don't answer 'yes', be prepared to endure while they express all the virtures of this game and why should play it otherwise you will die a terrible, horrible death because you never had this one game experience. Nevermind the myriad of required, retro game experiences that you absolutely must have besides this one in order to not experience before mentioned death.
119	1	a	'If the robot droid could laugh, which it is not programmed to do, it would do so. Your pulseray is only effective against living opponents!'
121	1	a	is rly good  No but really, This is an amazing collection of games that if you need to pick up if you haven't played them yet.They are my favorite games from this company and for 20 USD its a steal
123	1	a	Space Quest Owns The World!!!!
41	0	a	well, back when competition was null and void, this used to be fun. Now, though, this is utterly outdated and painfully crappy. There is no nostalgia here. You do not need to see this collection. Kappla! Engage the ♥♥♥♥ away from this. Do you think I talk too much? I don't think I talk too much. Instead, I just had a perfect bubble of nostalgia painfully punctured by this putrid piece of meh.
42	0	a	Absolute waste. I could not save my game. Requested a refund after 24 minutes.
43	0	a	This game was great!
125	1	a	One of Sierra Online's best game series collections. The Space Quest Collection takes you on a hilarious adventures in outer space. Your name is Roger Wilco, a bumbling space janitor from the planet Xeon, and a bit of a slacker. Your goal is to guide Roger through his various misadventures.
127	1	a	My first and favourite was Space Quest 3, still loving it today.
129	1	a	Nostagia kicked in, played this way back in the dark ages when Sierra On-Line was allmost the only graphical text adventures you could get. I must say, my sense of humor has changed since then. Games are .... ok. Sound is .... beeping and graphics are .... ok.  If you are as me .... nostalgic .... for old PC games, i urge you to buy them, play them and remember how the good old days was.
131	1	a	I receieved this collection in the Humble Sierra Bundle, but I've owned these games long before that since they first came out; from the mid-80s right through to today. I still have the boxes and floppies/CD-ROMs!  Simply put, this was my favourite game series ever growing up. I loved Sierra adventure games right from the parser EGA mouse-less days to the point&amp;click VGA days. Space Quest was always my favourite Sierra series with its beautiful graphics (especially the artwork of Mark Crowe), the hilarious dialogue (especially the writing of Scott Murphy), the puzzles, the deaths, the locations, the stories, and everything else! This is one sci-fi series that was golden all the way through. My favourite title in the series is Space Quest IV as it involves time travel and going back and forth between Spcae Quest sequels!  If you like to sit and enjoy a game for a while taking in its atmosphere and laughing a lot, I highly recommend Space Quest! 6 games plus a remake of the first game for a low price! It's totally worth it.
133	1	a	I got this to replay Space Quest 6 since I was unable to finish it as a kid, worth the nostalgia.
135	1	a	Once a janitor, always a janitor!
137	1	a	It looks like crap, has a hard time playing on most modern computers, but is a blast none the less esp if you grew up on these games.
139	1	a	Highly reccomend this for Space Quest 1 EGA alone. Seriously its full of so many great pop culture references and is just a great game all around.
141	1	a	These games are an integral part of my youth. They may not be the first choice of newer generations, but they still have a lot to offer anyone who plays them.
143	1	a	The original MEME!
145	1	a	how do i put the game in the remade version?
147	1	a	These games are ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. How was I supposed to know that I could open a locker at the start of the game, and the content would only be important halfway through?  0/10, ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ing game
149	1	a	You eat people and gain powers from them by tearing them to pieces.  So it's basically hard-core Kirby
151	1	a	Prototype is what happens when you combine the urbanized open worldness of GTA4 with the plot of Crysis 2 (except the virus is a Left 4 Dead / Resident Evil-esque virus instead of aliens) with a protagonist that is essentially a cross between a biological human T-1000 and DC comic's Parasite (he consumes people to gain abilities, knowledge, skills, etc). The superpowered gameplay is definitely my favorite part, there are many ways to win the major story battles and sidemissions with the various moves at your command. As Alex Mercer, you can either pick up guns and rocket launchers or become a weapon yourself by shape shifting your body into claws, blades, bludgeons, whips and even a cannon ball move that launches you toward your target with enough force to blow up armored vehicles later in the game. Speaking of armored vehicles, you can hijack tanks and skyjack helicopter gunships (and this even looks exactly like that scene in T2 where the T-1000 gets on that chopper and tells the guy to get out LOL). When on foot and exploring Manhatten you use your augmented abilities to parkour the landscape, at full upgrades you can leap over 5 story buildings easily and glide / airdash through the air very similiarly to how mario from Super Mario World glides with the super cape. There is an element of Metal Gear Solid in this game too since you can shape shift into other people that you consume, ie soldiers or pedestrians in the street in order to blend in since the military is constantly looking for you. The story mode is pretty unique: your character wakes up having exactly the same knowledge the player does as to what is going on, and through a mechanic known as the web of intrigue you eventually come to understand the game's story and background on everything that is going on around you. As you explore Manhatten you will find people with the Web of Intrigue icon over their head indicating that they can be consumed by you to learn what they know in connection to everything that happened. This game features sidemissions that show up on the game's minimap that will showcase your skills with the various abilities you acquire and see how fast you can be parkouring from place to place and get bronze/silver/gold/platinum medals depending on your 1337ness.  I started playing this and finished it in about a week, making sure to get every sidemission completed on platinum. Because the plot is advanced through Web of Intrigue it is possible to finish the game without getting every bit of story out of it so I did a new game+ to find the remaining consume targets to get the whole story. For the most part the main story missions are easy with some tricky boss fights that really make you use all of your abilities to some degree, the most challenging aspect of this game is definitely getting platinum in every sidemission (think classic NES game level challenging). Overall I give this game a solid recommendation for its fluid gameplay (I love the parkour!) :)   
153	1	a	Make Prototype 3 and bring Alex Mercer back as protagonist
155	1	a	Yet another gem in my Steam Library.   In case you should have a god complex, this game is made for you -  If you don't.. it still is!   Basically you slip into the role of the more or less anti-hero Alex Mercer in the city of Manhattan that was infected by some kind of Virus and is now being controlled by Elite Soldiers called 'Blackwatch'.   Once you hit the button 'Start new campaign' you get thrown right into the Open World with just a few background infos concerning the upcoming story. All you know is that you are Alex Mercer, who has been shot down and fatally wounded and later on got infected by a virus that somehow revived you and gave you shapeshifting abilities and superpowers.   Now he is trying everything he can to find out how all this happened, where it will be going, and how he could possibly end all this by 'interrogate' the ones responsible.  Making your way through the story you get sucked in by a good load of interesting twists, challenging bossfights and tons of upgrades for Alex that make him the toughest enemy 'Blackwatch' will have to face during the whole infection.   There are plenty of Sidequests to be done - some of them nice and some of them just to keep you busy finishing the game 100%. But if you focus on the Story Quests alone its possible to finish it within ~12 hours on a medium difficulty.  It can be frustrating at times (not just because of the AI) but because of overpowered attacs or wrong set 'Mission Failure' parts, but once you've beaten the game it feels really satisfying even without Steam Achievments or cool costume unlocks for Alex Mercer. The gameplay itself is (to me) almost flawless and the possibilities endless due to Alex' powers and the maybe best looking armor in 2009's video games.   With this being said I'd like to leave you the decision if you should get this game on a sale for 5 bucks or just let it be, all I can do is just highly recommend it to everyone who loves a good classic and a game by 'Activision' that is not 'Fast and the Furious' nor 'Call of Duty' but actually a GOOD game. A point some people might find interesting- the graphics are not horribly bad but neither outstanding for 2009...something in between should describe it precisely. If graphics don't bother you its a perfect game for a casual afternoon when you are off work and just want to relax..in case you do love good graphics take a look at Prototype 2 ..it has all the features 1 has to offer and even more - will write a review to part 2 aswell once I finished it on Steam.  *Note* I wasn't experiencing any performance problems on my nvidia card but I know that there are massive problems with all AMD cards... and they wont ever fix it I believe so in case you don't have a Nvidia graphics card you might want to play this one on a console.   As always I hope that my review was helpful and written understandable and made it easier for you to decide to buy a game from 6 years ago that is still more foward than todays releases...
157	1	a	If you get a boner while dismembering innocent people, this game suits your needs.
159	1	a	Honestly a brilliant game that I well and truly loved and getting it on offer 4 quid to boot. Bring on the next sale, I need Prototype 2!
161	1	a	Prototype is a very underrated game that nobody knows about, but despite that, it is a hidden gem that provides for hours of fun rampaging through the streets of NYC.  The graphics don't look all that great even though it was released in 2009, however the gameplay more than makes up for this even though some of the missions can be very unforgiving without the right approach.  Oh and did I mention super powers from a mutated super virus and eating lots of people?
163	1	a	The missions are super repetitive, but the progression/combat/eating people is fun. Buy on sale but don't feel pressured to beat the story, because the story is yawnworthy and the real fun is in running around, hijacking helicopters, and throwing cars at pedestrians.   6/10
165	1	a	Still a great game, but it is basically unplayable on modern systems Here's how to fix that:  1) Deactivate all HID devices in the device manager to get stable FPS.  This is a common problem with many old games. At first i was reluctant to trying out this fix in fear of screwing up external or internal devices. Now I've had them deactivated for months and haven't noticed any difference.  2) Unlock the game's graphics setings  Prototype can only address graphics cards up to 2 GB properly. If you have more than that, your graphics settings will be automatically limited. To fix that, follow this link:   http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showpost.php?p=23539057&amp;postcount=6   As for the game itself: It may not be as long-term motivating as GTA, but while there is still something to do / explore / destroy, you're gonna have a lot of fun. Another plus is that the game's internal Vsync actually locks it to 60 fps instead of the usual 30, which makes for a smooth gameplay experience. If you like causing mayhem and don't mind the little bit clunky mouse / keyboard controls (you can use a controller though), then you should try this one out.
167	1	a	Prototype is what I always dreamed of as a small child. My small, sociopathic mind always dreamed of running around, shapeshifting, and casually dismembering people with my badass claws or sword arm or whipfist. It's the offspring of gore, action, openworld gameplay, and glitchy stealth that was greatly improved in the second game. I enjoy it. I don't know if everyone would, but I like it better than a lot of other games.  10/10
169	1	a	pretty good for a prototype, i hope it comes out of Early Access someday
171	1	a	Story's great, but the cutscenes are short and explicitly to the point. Also, the game can be very unforgiving at times, and the first playthrough can be a hassle even on the easiest difficulty. Overall graphics are okay, but it takes somewhat of a penalty because you could probably count the amount of different generic NPC models on two hands. However, what makes this game worth the 20 bucks is the sandboxing. Plug in some headphones and just parkour around Manhattan, consume an army man and help take down an infected hive, hunt for collectibles, go on a zombie killing spree, play fetch with living people, troll the military, invade a base stealthily or guns blazing, go postal with a rifle in a civilian zone, hijack a helicopter and shoot at tanks, hijack a tank and shoot at helicopters, whip out your claws and slice people in half, eat living things until your hunger is satisfied, or do various 'events' around the city (races, gliding to a specific target, war events, and just flat out murder events). There's no shortage of fun to be had. This game is amazing for killing time AND blowing off steam. You can play it for 15 minutes at a time, or 5 hours at a time. It's the kind of game you can't really ever get tired of. My only real qualm with the game is that there's too many tanks and helicopters that spawn in. You have to be extremely careful about screwing around on foot, especially after you've beaten the story, because tanks will spawn wherever you are and even if they're far away on the minimap, they'll converge towards you and wipe out what little fun you thought you could have. And don't even think about taking on the tanks, because that'll just make more of them spawn, and a strike team is almost guaranteed to be called in as well (and another one, and another one, if your wanted level persists). Then if you want to hijack a tank, you'll get to enjoy it for maybe a minute before enough hostile tanks have chipped away your health. Likewise with a helicopter among other helicopters. Basically, vehicles take away the fun from the game and I wish there was some way to disable them, but unfortunately there isn't.
173	1	a	Really good game. Not as unknown as it was when I bought it because of its sequel, but still quite underrated. It has a decent story, despite it's about a failed experiment/mutated people/zombies. I really liked that, unlike the other games about that topic, you are an infected one, and not a survivor, but even the infected ones tryto kill you. Basically, you're a solitary overpowered mutant that everyone wants dead and doesn't remember who he is and has to consume targets that have memories about that to remember it. It has a quite good graphics ( considering it's a 2009 game) and a good gameplay. The only thing, it gets quite repetitive when all you have to do is to infiltrate in military bases, destroy zombie hives and machines that emit poisonous fog, but at the start and at the end the missions are more interesting. On easy it's reaaally easy, as you are an overpowered mutant capable of regenerating consumating people or infected ones, taking other people's appearence, running on walls , making your limbs become weapons, stealing tanks, ecc... After you have completed the main quest if you want you can play another time without having to unlock everything you unlocked during the first time.
175	1	a	This game taught us to love our sister :v
177	1	a	I jumped 50 feet in the air and elbow dropped a tank. 10/10
179	1	a	Pros: - Story and gameplay is intresting. - Graphics are decent. - Works very good with Xbox one controller.  Cons: - Performance issues. Very bad port from consoles to PC.  - I would have had wanted to clean the city after story is over but its not possible.
181	1	a	Plays a little like you're a bossfight from MGS. Don't bother watching the cutscenes, the story is nothing to write home about, but otherwise Prototype is a load of fun. Pick up a pedestrian, any pedestrian. Run to the top of a building. Throw your pedestrian as far as you can, see if you can land exactly where they do, before they do. Fans of the Hulk games on PS2 and XBOX will note that in terms of mechanics at least, this is a colossal rip-off. People who have an aversion to being giant and green will probably prefer Alex Mercer's agreeably-generic appearance. And if they don't, they can pick up an old lady and turn into her, then punch helicopters out of the sky.  Slight caveat - last time I played this game from Steam, all the sounds were playing in comical fast-motion. So if you can get it to work, it's fun. Otherwise it's unintentional hilarity.
183	1	a	I like to play it once in a while. Never gets old :P
185	1	a	If u have anger issues buy this game!
187	1	a	I elbow dropped a tank in the tutorial. Best $5 I ever spent.
189	1	a	Although the storyline is pretty lame and repetitive, there is a huge amount of fun to be had in throwing cars at helicopters, slicing pedestrians in half and stealing helicopters.  Decent graphics, great gameplay, meh storyline.  6.5/10
191	1	a	Prototype is a good game. Most missions have the same objective, like highjack a vehicle or consume someone. Other than the repetetive gameplay, the game is full of fun challenges and trials to keep you playing after you're done with the main story. It has gore, good combat, and all the freedom you can get in the world. From my experience, I give it a 7 out of 10.
193	1	a	A GLOBAL HEALTH EMERGENCY American with Ebola: 'I am growing stronger'
195	1	a	I probably would say this is one of my fav games. So glad I bought this. If you're able to wait till it's on sale (Like it is now). Then I would do so. But I probably would spend the $20 on the game even if it's not on sale. The story is amazing and fun. I got nothen else to say but just to play xd 10/10
197	1	a	There's just something special about a game where you can pick up a car and run down the sidewalk, tossing people around like bowling pins.
199	1	a	i really love this game. the graphics didnt age well i have to say but this game was the first in the series so i dont think they gave it the full priority but the gameplay and story deffinetly make up for it. i had to play through it several times to really understand what was going on. and the little side stories really got my attention.   and the gameplay makes it even better. i wasted much more time exploring the city and destroying things that doing exctual missions. the missions are also a lot of fun they give you a nice tutorial on everything. but all the powers dont really have a part in the missions. only the core things get a good view. and the powers.. well there are a lot of powers or attacks or movements. and you kinda stick to one and forget about the rest while it all could be a lot easier if you use the right attacks.  overall it is a great game and i would higly recomend it if you want to feel like superman that has gone over to the dark side.
201	1	a	A game like no other. Parkour, not just parkour, but like, how about running up a building and elbow dropping a tank? How about a really ♥♥♥♥ing challenging game? How about a well-done graphic setting table? How about a sad and cliff hanger story? How about a huge open world that almost seems like a roguelike? No loading times at all thru areas, it's all there. How about 500 different melee weapons you can assemble. How about gazillion different ways to kill enemies? How about replay value?
203	1	a	A great free-roam game, Able to jump buildings and completely obliterate the military. Having evolution points to spend on power upgrades and trying to combine them to a combo is what makes this game interesting. There are also checkpoints where you can go and do some mini-games. The game does get repetitive or rather boring when you keep doing the same thing which is getting chased by the military on the same town (If you provoke them). The story on the other hand is really something, we get to see Mercer being known as the victim through all this when in the end that is not entirely true. Won't go to details but i really got somewhat hooked to the story.  Heard alot about the port on this game, and i have to say they are not unfixable. So i recommend to not take curator 'PC Port Info's' review lightly. Although there are things wrong, it works great with my AMD Radeon 7970, The Audio can be fixed also by changing the Sample rate of your speakers to 48000 or 44100. Only thing is that you can't put it in windows mode.  
205	1	a	  So... if this is the Prototype... when's the game comming out?  11/10 - would make unfunny joke again
207	1	a	story is meh, gameplay is hours and hours of fun when you unlock all abilities
209	1	a	Best. Super Powers. Ever. I want to wear that jacket. I want my flesh to writhe in power, indistinguishable between muscle and bone.  Why yes, I am for human advancement through drugs, machinery, genetic manipulations, and other wonderful things, why do you ask?
44	0	a	Rather than adopting the typical structured format for my review, I'll instead just explain why I can't recommend this game. First off, this game has consolitis. Hard. Maximum resolution is 1280x800, it can't be run in a window without 'unexpected results,' and it ended up crashing my computer while attempting to play it. Twice. I think I will end up getting it on console, but I just can't recommend it for Steam. Apparently Prototype 2 is a worse port, which completely blows my mind. Anyways, this port just isn't worth it. It's buggy, locked down to hell, and is actually more expensive than just getting it for the 360 or PS3 off of eBay.
211	1	a	transformed into an old lady and ran around the city throwing cars at everyone 11/10
213	1	a	There's really only one thing this game has going for it so im gonna make a short review here:  + This game is FUN AS F**k, its just so addicting running around in the city . . .??M per second and kicking the living crap out of everything. - The Story in this game . . .oh boy, dont bother trying to understand it, its not nessesarly a bad story but the way the game tells you the story is just very confusing.  8.5/10, The Story may be confusing but the game itself is very fun, definently worth the money whereither you buy it when its on sale or not.
215	1	a	Pros:  Transformation and being able to play the game stealth or full on badass.  Combat makes you feel like a god and shape the city around you in destruction.  City slowly decays as you get deeper in the story as you watch infected areas start growing out into a giant mess. Beautifully chaotic.   Lots of upgrades for your character and ability to choose any build path you want.  Unique specific weapon transformations for different situations and enemies.  FPS was good for me and had no problem running it on an above average gaming laptop.  Cons:  Game isn't very challenging and throughout the game you feel like you can't die. (At least on Normal mode. This isn't a bad thing, just different experience if you want a game that's fun and just want to kill stuff).  PC port mouse movement controls feel wacky. I honestly like the movement of using a keyboard to move and the simplicity of using your left and right mouse buttons to do combos; however, the camera movement with mouse for this port is just noticeably bad. After a while you get a little used to the jerkiness of the camera movement, but it feels like it should have been done a lot better.  Another thing to go along with this is the mouse movement for switching powers with the cycle select. I really don't like how this was done in the port. You basically have you push your mouse as if moving it across the entire screen just to switch powers using the cycle select and it still feels hard to aim fast accurately, affecting the gameplay for fast reaction gamers.  Game can get a bit repetitive quite fast for some people.   General Game Rating: 9/10  PC Port: 7/10  I would recommend getting this on console if you have one. I'm normally a PC gamer, but once I played this PC Port after playing it on console you really notice how bad the mouse movement with the camera controls and even general menu selection was done. Still an amazing game if you can get past those notes though and just want a fun super badass button masher to play.
217	1	a	I freaking love this game.  There's no such thing as too much caos and destruction :3  Also, big giant worm.
219	1	a	The whole story and feel is edgelord and a bit tryhard, especially the protag, but if you don't mind that it's pretty fun. Even if you don't know what the hell is happening, you can hijack a tank and blow ♥♥♥♥ up for kicks. Lots of fun mechanics to mess with. 6/10  Originally played this on PS3. Most of the characters are an undefined mess, which you could chalk up to Mercer's unique existence/mind or them mostly being cannon fodder and written to be distant/vague/unrelatable, but I think it may just be lazy writing. The focus of the story is the virus, how it came about, what it does, and is now doing. This mostly involves collecting memories conspiracy-theorist-style and smashing a ♥♥♥♥load of helicopters. The web of intrigue surrounding it is pretty interesting and sounds plausible (even if the biology is not), which is saying something given this is a game about a guy with crazy superpowers fighting viral creatures. Mercer himself is either eyeroll-worthy or hilarious depending on how you look at him, but you will see hints that the whole 'powers' thing has made him a better person. If you get that far, you can reflect on why this is funny.  The OST suffers from LAIR Syndrome, being kinda bland/samey and nothing stands out, which is a shame since it sounds like they had an orchestra helping them. The visuals are nothing to write home about and the game hasn't aged too well; if you're walking down the street and not focusing on taking something out, you may find the repetitive NPCs and questionable AI to be immersion-breaking. The color palettes start to blend after a while as does everything else. The real joy comes from actually playing the thing and using the powers you unlock. Sneaky sort? Got you covered. Like to be a tank? That's there, too. Ranged? Yeah, kinda. Wanna just slice ♥♥♥♥ up with a giant blade arm? There's a military complex, go nuts. Timed challenges? They're kinda crap, but they're also there. There's so many ways to just screw around and make things go smash and boom that even though it's kinda lacklustre, I still keep coming back. People like to compare [Prototype] to inFamous due to release dates and themes. This one is darker and more bland, but the powers are way more fun.  The game opens with you in a scenario where you can wipe out city blocks of military personnel with ease and elbow-drop tanks, so if that sounds good to you, try it out.
221	1	a	Totally, hands down, recommend this game.   You're a killing mention, unstoppable, that's what the city of New York sees you as, but that isn't all.  The character you play as, 'Alex Mercer' has some secrets, those secrets were within his memory until he's been exposed to a virus, known as the Blacklight virus.  Play through the game to discover what has happened to you; 'Alex Mercer'.  The virus you've been exposed to has taken over your brain and body and is now 'you'.  You can kill and 'consume' any person you see, after killing and consuming you can shapeshift to the person you've last consumed. That includes civilians, military, and important military officers.  When you shapeshift into them, you can ultimatly sneak through areas you 'Alex Mercer' cannot.  When you kill and consume the person of your choice, not only do you shapeshift into them, but you also get their memories, and skills. For example, if you kill and consume a helicopter poliot, you will gain the knowledge to operate a helicopter.   Ultimatly this can be played as a sandbox game, this game never forces you to do objectives, you can always roam free in the city of New York.   Quick thing to add, I have a 1920x1080 16:9 monitor, and this game doesn't seem to have that high of a resolution, so you'll have to search up a quick fix for that. 
223	1	a	Fairly Enjoyable, I'd say it gets old a bit before you are done with it though, and very difficult in parts.
225	1	a	Became an old lady lifting a car and sprinting up walls  69.69/10
227	1	a	buy this game and play it with a controller  perhaps the most fun i ever had playing a game in my 40 years of life (along with the sequel)  you are completely overpowered, but still the game can be challenging, but being so overpowered is so much fun in an open world  story, acting, and characters are very well done. the way this and the sequel trickle aspects of the story based on 'collectibles' is also a great plot device that makes you want to complete all the collectibles (moreso in the sequel)  seriously, if somehow you found this game and are reading reviews, just buy it. so much fun to play. strongest recommendation to play (again, use a controller)
229	1	a	Imagine playing GTA or Saints' Row, except you're an infected, murderous shape-changer. This game puts you into a simulated city, controlling a character with strange abilities, and proceeds to turn you loose. You, Alex Mercer, are a science experience gone wrong, worthy of the Umbrella Corporation, and you will have to bust some heads to get to the bottom of it. The game is slightly dated, but provides a really unique and enjoyable experience, thanks to the active controls of your shape-changing powers, and a new perspective on the 'mutant infection' story.
231	1	a	This is an open-world singleplayer game. The storyline isn't too interesting, but this game shines in combat. The combat is fluid and the traveling dynamic is fun. This game does get frustrated with its ridiculous time trials side quests, however.
233	1	a	A solid proof that even viral outbreaks can be incredibly fun, if done right.  Eat . Sleep . Consume . Repeat .  Oh, and you are kind of OP !  10/10, will consume again.
235	1	a	This game is statisfying to play.  I'm a major fan of the inFAMOUS series, but you could never unleash that absolute, unbridled destruction that everyone always wanted.  In Prototype, you can.  As Alex Mercer, you have the abilities of a god: fly, scale buildings, jump accross city blocks, disguise yourself or turn into a human tank.  Or you could walk around as a civillian, doing minimal damage. Whatever you feel like.    Prototype's strong points are:  Gameplay, good controls, challenging combat.   Prototype's weak points are:  Convoluted story
237	1	a	Very entertaining action/adventure game. Absolutely worth of playing!
239	1	a	Generic story and characters that you can’t connect with or give a sh*t about and a boring and ugly open world. But the fun gameplay saves the game from being bad. Gameplay is nothing great either because of some tedious and just uninteresting missions and objectives but there is fun to be had in this game. Running around the city really fast and unlocking some cool abilities is the highlight of the game. I like the final boss in the game it’s the only thing I remembered about the game when I first played it on release. 6/10 (Decent)
45	0	a	I want to like the game, but with the sound issues, and all the work arounds, and there never been a patch, I just can't honestly recomend the game on Steam.  Is fun, no doubt, and the story is pretty interesting. The mechanics are awesome, the skills are really cool to use, etc etc etc, but the sound, and only being able to play for about an hour at a time without having issues happen, or going in and deleting files to remove sound issues, whatever. Is just ... not really worth it.
241	1	a	I remember first playing this game on the 360 when it came out but only for an hour or two. I loved the mobility and variations of transformations Mercer can achieve. Being able to play as a villian was quite satisfying and I honestly felt like I had some super powers. Now that I was able to play through it on the PC, I have to say that I really enjoyed the game for the gameplay, the story was somewhat mediocre but, the sheer power Mercer had shadowed that.
243	1	a	7/10
245	1	a	This is a lost gem. I don't know why nobody speak well about this game. It's a way more destruction and power than mostly new games...
247	1	a	This is just straight up a dark, tall can of kickass awesomeness. I wish I wasn't played out of it, but there's only so many times you can replay a game. Actually excellent story, well above average for todays market, its very enjoyable. The gameplay is also very fun, I played it originally with mouse and keyboard and its very very solid despite being a port I believe. If you enjoy good gameplay and a good story to go with it, this isn't a bad place to be at all.
249	1	a	I first played prototype at my step cousins house when I was little I was amazed by the game so years later I find it on steam and pick it up first off I dont get bad performance so I dont get why everyone is saying that its a bad port the game is fun but it can get repetetive but if its on sale you should pick it up 8/10 pretty good
251	1	a	I used to love playing the inFAMOUS games on PS3 and would play them over and over, mixing and matching decisions and powers, and just running all over the world. The Prototype series is a lot like inFAMOUS, except there aren't any decisions you make that make your gameplay experience any different. Still has awesome powers, vehicle jacking, and open-world hack n' slash feel. If you like open world superpower games, Prototype is perfect for you.
253	1	a	A fun open world hack and slash game.  Pros: +Amazing movement and freerunning +Fun open world to explore +Plenty of stuff to destroy +Huge variety of fun moves ways to kill people +Lots of cool upgrades and powers +Killing people feels REALLY good  Cons: -Story is mediocre -Combat is sometimes clunky -Escort missions -Unnecessary use of driving vehicles and shooting firearms -A lot of escort missions -Repetitive side missions -DIFFICULT VEHICLE ESCORT MISSIONS  Total score 7/10. Buy it if it's on sale and enjoy slashing people to bits, but be wary of escort missions.
255	1	a	Destroyed a helicopter by throwing an old lady into it Loving it so far.
257	1	a	Edgy McEdge kills everyone he sees. If you think Infamous was cool, play this.
259	1	a	much killing, such game, so good, wow
261	1	a	Fastpaced hack and slash. Graphics are good and the story is too. Not sure if i would pay full price = 19.99euro But deffinatly worth the buy at a sale. Play it with a steam or other controller for best game experience.   And also.... You can hug people to death in this game!!!!
263	1	a	This game was not made recently, but still one of my favorite games. The story line excels in every way. the optimization it self is great since i can still play it on my Lenovo laptop which its CPU is an Intel Pentium and 4GB DDR3 Ram and Intel HD 4400 internal graphich card.
265	1	a	Great game! Interesting story and awesome gameplay if you like to smash everything :)
267	1	a	I recomend this game. First, the combat; true the combat could be better, it would be nice if there was a more stratiegic way to dive into the combat, but it makes up for the lack of difficulty with a lot of heart-pounding, edge of the seat action. The combat animation in this game is beautifuly gory, and well animated, and brutal and it makes you feel like a walking weapon. However, an open world is only as good as the way you travel through it, and when you move through this game you feel like a SUPER HERO. A mix of parkour and power-based traversal it is so, so satisfying. As is the open world, a sandbox is only as good as the contents of the world. The map is filled with these little side missions that are a good distraction for about a minute, but going on a masacre and slaughtering the militery makes up for that. As far as the story goes, it's...okay. Now I'm only about two hours into the game, and there are some aspects of the story that I love, however the game makes me hate those. I want to unravle the mystery surrounding the main character's past, but there's this infection spreading through out the city, I'm just gonna go deal with this and...oh wait, no I'm not. That aside I do LOVE this game and I can definety reccomend it for $20.00. I'd say it gets an 8/10 - a great game.
269	1	a	run around do sexy everywhere while comparing the game to infamous
271	1	a	This is an early impressio of the game, I've unfinished my first playthrough. -This is now a review based on a finished playthrough on Normal. For other notes, I'll list my system specs below.  Pros: -The game runs great! (on my system) -For seven years old, this game has aged great -Keyboard/mouse and controller functions smooth -Straightforward upgrade system -Fast paced gameplay -Promotes diversity of powers, can be a real challenge -Murderfest  Cons: -In spite of smooth controls, there are times when movement can feel a little clunky -Resolution issues with vanilla game -Difficulty curve hops around early on -The AI spawn system can get almost to frantic at times, creating almost unreasonably challening missions -Story is pretty bland and exposition is mediocre at best -Resolution for modern monitors is pretty limited unless the game is modified or files are edited   On the whole, Prototype is a solid game with plenty of great and fairly well executed ideas. Though at times it's age stands out a bit in terms of some clunky combat; but is more than made up for in some fairly memorable experiences. The games bosses do what a game boss should do, test what you've learned so far in the game and forces you to explore available powers. Battles are intense and the overall sinking feeling of insanity as Manhatten island slowly turns into an outright murderfest.  Oh and the game runs great on my system which is running the Windows 10 os.  I've give it a solid 7/10.  System specs:  MS-7850 Intel Core i5-4670k @ 3.4GHz (4 CPUs) overclocked @ 4.3GHz 12288 MB RAM (12 GB RAM) EVGA Nvidia GeForce 960 4GB RAM ftw edition Modded game to run at native resolution of 1600x900
273	1	a	What may seem like your average game is in fact a New York City simulator from 2009. As any New Yorker would, you can: - Chase taxis - Elbow black people - Dismemeber minorities - Get shot at by law enforcement - Fall out of tall buildings - Get run over by tanks - Get minimum wage slave labour in clearing bright red boils off of buildings for the military - Get shot at as thanks for saving lives - Run across a shrunken central park - Flee from flying things - Vandalise water towers - Beat back mindless, diseased hordes in times square - Sniff out tourists to devour - Catch leprosy - Forget that Queens, Brooklyn and the Bronx exist And this only scrapes the surface! This game finally fills the gap in the need for a good game that simulates daily life in New York City. I'm glad the American goverment shows the world how it deals with Swine Flu
275	1	a	I love this game. I had it on PS3 when it launched, and just bought it because I wanted to play through it again. My favorite open world game, ever. I wish you could play it in 1080p, but oh well, it's an older game, I guess. I wish the sequel had lived upto the original.
277	1	a	We have to eliminate the infecteds. Military also have to eliminate the infecteds.  Can we join forces? No? ♥♥♥♥ you then *pounds away*
279	1	a	 'like GTA but with tentacle powers'
281	1	a	This is a game that'll make you want superpowers more than anything else in your life.
283	1	a	great game. good cliche story. definitly reccomend it.
285	1	a	Alex Mercer must return in prototype 3 11 out of 99% Game of the year
287	1	a	Prototype WAS a game like no other, and is still the original game it was in 2009.
289	1	a	im very like this game -awesome super power -cool jacket -and fu*****ing hunter  please make prototype 3 activision,dont publish COD Infinite warefare to the steam
291	1	a	fun game a little buggy with the sound but really fun
293	1	a	Like a more brutal version of assassin's creed.
295	1	a	Yet another underrated game. I’m starting to wonder how the major reviewers make their reviews: it seems that most games to receive good reviews are sequels to existing AAA titles, specifically shooters or RTS games. Anyway – back to the recommendation. Prototype is basically what you would get by mixing GTA3 and Spiderman, with a lot more superpowers, with an original but forgettable government-zombie-virus plot. The gameplay is fluid-smooth and the camera is /usually/ pretty good (especially using an XBox 360 controller). Both gameplay and story have a very good pace, and the difficulty is spot-on, where it ramps up but is rarely too easy and uncommonly frustrating. The only issue I had with the game was the repetition in side-missions and a /few/ usless powers; otherwise this is one of my favorite games this year.
297	1	a	Kill everything, throw everything, never ending enemy stuff and you are a jackass who does virtually anything you want, even glide through the air and HIJACK HELICOPTERS IN MID AIR!!! Love it.
299	1	a	This game... cures angry thoughts... by releasing them. :3  First time I played this game, I completed half of the main story stabbing, slashing and smashing sh*t in one night.  You play as Alex Mercer, a powerful shapeshifter who was infected with a virus that grant him the use of INSANE powers and abilities in order to fight off those who are not and those who are like him. He gains new abilities thoughout the game and upgrades to enhance survivability and damage in order to survive the post-apocolyptic New York City. While running around, you also have the opportunity to complete events to earn extra EP to spend on powers and upgrades. Also, comsuming specific people will unlock memories that sums up on what the hell is going on to the world around you.  -The story has its twist and turn moments that'll leave you at the edge of your seat.  -In order to love this game, you HAVE to love the protagonist!  -Controls are alright, as you are forced to mash every button to use an ability successfully. &gt;.&gt; -Characters have their intense moments as some are worth betrayal and some worth supporting Alex Mercer. -Gameplay and environment brings out the intense destruction of the situation you're witnessing.   Anyone who favors open-world, hack-n-slash, sadistic destruction, anti-hero with a badass jacket: this is your game! 10/10 ABSOLUTELY recommended!
301	1	a	Realy fun game, if you like open world combined with beat em up, this is the game for you. It isnt GTA-Like though, all you cant buy stuff or anything.... if id have to compare it to games, i would say Infamous on PS3 is very similar... Story isnt realy big unless you do all the assimilation thing. Yeah so i feel its worth giving it a try, on my side, i liked it a lot but PC controls arent so good (read under)   'Cons' - Mouse and Keyboard controls are ♥♥♥♥, they lag for some reason (and im using good material, W8, I7 core, 12GB ram, 1To Disc Space, Good graphic card. Gaming mouse and Gaming Keyboard + Headset.), they wont stop you from playing but will hinder your experiance a bit. I then decided to use a Gamepad, it worked realy well and felt like the console version. You can either use an Xbox 360 controler, or use Motioninjoy's DS3 Tool (which i was using) to emulate a 360 controler with your PS3 controler, you probably could use a logitec controler or something like that but im not sure.
303	1	a	it's a super villian sand box game (shut up, he's totaly a bad guy)  your options are, generally, kill every body, or kill every body then eat them, and the plot is &gt;.&gt; well it's pretty ♥♥♥♥ed, so much so theres a whole sub quest devoted to eating the people that know what the hell is going on.  but shoving the mess of a plot aside, its pure genocidal fun. there are LOADS of fun ways to kill people from just grabbing them to verious shap objects to tanks and helicoptors, even the stealth missions, which are mostly side quests, are fun (and involve killing a AT LEAST one person) case you haven't noticed, killing people is pretty much the whole point, and if you need a game for that this would be it, if you want a plot you can understand and a touch more in objectives then 'kill everybody' well not for you then.   also, the last boss can ♥♥♥♥ him self for being boring as hell
305	1	a	I really enjoyed this game, the chaos, transfermations and storyline were great aspects of this game. If I had to rate it; pretending that I was writing this when it first came out I would easily give it an 8.5/10. The reasons it didn't deserve a 9 or 10 is simply because of the bad pc ports of which I was getting 55fps with a gtx 760 and an i7 4790 another reason is because of it's outdated graphics even for 2009, this doesn't bother me that much but for some it might and finally it begins to become repetitive after playing for over an hour. Over all I really enjoyed this game and it had a lot to offer and I strongly recommend it.
307	1	a	Pure Godlike Violence. Enjoy being an indestructible zombie killing machine with really fun powers. Run up the sides of buildings, eat people, blow stuff up - good times to be had all around...  9/10 - Purely Gameplay
309	1	a	If you are into shapeshifting and killing everything that walks in style, this game is for you my friend! The storyline in this game is thrilling right from the start to the very end, 10/10 in my humble opinion.
311	1	a	I just finished Prototype and I really loved it! 10/10
313	1	a	One of the best games i've ever played, i really recommend it! You're a guy with biological powers and there's a lot of things to do like atack a military base, destroy a hive, do events, just kill people... I really liked the storyline, the main objetive is find out who you are and what happened to you because you lost your memory, you just don't get tired of playing this game 10/10
315	1	a	fantastic action game, story is hard to follow tho
317	1	a	EXPLOSIONS MORE EXPLOSIONS AND EVEN MORE EXPLOSIONS  would play again 10/10 
319	1	a	A great action game developed by the same company who made the Incredible Hulk Ultimate Destruction video game, this would be considered the more brutal, gorry successor to that game. Plenty of mechanics, powers and consuming fun to be had here.
321	1	a	The way Alex Mercer curbstomped civilians and ate them alive really endeared him to me as a character. Y'know, that and when he suplexed a helicopter into a tank.
323	1	a	nice singleplayer game
325	1	a	THIS GAME IS SO COOL!! Such a neat concept. Great storyline. You can jump off buildings from suicide height and go-splat-on-the-ground height and do a super hero landing without taking damage. And you can slice mutant monster things with awesome wolverine-type claws and make spikes come out of the ground. How can anyone NOT love that?!
327	1	a	This game rocks. A little bit of the ol' ultra-violence and all that.
329	1	a	really awesome game! heaps of side quests and activites to do, you can upgrade your abilites and ♥♥♥♥ so thats pretty rad.
331	1	a	10/10.
333	1	a	Cool and really fun game. But it doesn't have 1080p and it won't really run on my good gaming computer but runs well on my ♥♥♥♥♥ier laptop. Game has highest resolution of 720
335	1	a	My mom got me this game in 2009 for the PS3. She witnessed me cutting through hoards of civilians with bigass scissor hands, a massive smile on my face as blood drenched the streets.   Ever since then, she became skeptical about my trench coat collection.
337	1	a	The game goes out of its way to give a bad first impression -- if your graphics card is half decent/recent, the game will get confused and think you can only do ridiculously low resolutions. So you fix that by installing some stuff. Next, the sound is ridiculously quiet. So you fix that by installing some stuff. Then, the game drops you into a scene with no background or context, which is bad in itself, and the visuals are really pathetic at that point (I think it's because there are many yellow cabs in that scene, and cars are the single most ♥♥♥♥♥-looking things in the game) -- which is misleading, as all in all, the graphics aren't great, but serviceable and quite acceptable for a game of that vintage. Oh yeah, and you can't pick your character, so you're stuck with one who looks like a dork (all of the time) and acts like an ♥♥♥ (half of the time).  So, the first big challenge then is to make it past the first 30 minutes. After that, it's good fun for a good while. An open world and Awesome Powers(TM) go a long way, and the game is good fun for a good while. Eventually though, the missions get a bit repetitive, and starting about 2/3 into the game, it's usually not the missions that are the problem -- getting to the mission is (travel basically implied the choice of not using powers, in which case you'd get swarmed by zombies, ragdolled by soldiers using rockets and artillery on the zombies, and it would generally take forever, or you'd use your movement powers to speed things up, in which case you'd probably get detected, and take just as long trying to shake off those pesky strike teams. It sounds like a good, 'realistic' idea in theory, but in practice, it was nothing more than a nuisance).  That said, it's not a bad game if you can get it really cheap, but one that overstayed its welcome a bit and would have benefitted from having 1/4 - 1/3 of its playtime cut. (Or, as the more expensive option, have that additional playtime be made more varied and interesting -- something that largely succeeded in Prototype 2.)  Pet peeve: The protogonist doesn't have that many voiced lines; he (as well as his sister) has a unisex name, depending on whom you consume you may run around as a woman anyway, and pretty much everybody else calls him 'it' anyway (on the grounds that he's an evil infected commie mutant), so their dialogue wouldn't even change. At that point, they might as well have vastly improved the game by giving you a choice of character, at the cost of adding character creation, and a few dozen voiced lines for the protogonist (much more easily so than in P2, for a start, which has more story, and more dialogue -- even so, Saints Row IV, which rips off Prototype mightily, runs circles around both installments in that regard, just like SR3 ran circles around GTA).  SO, DO I NEED TO PLAY THIS FIRST IF I WANT TO PLAY [PROTOTYPE2]?  You know, I can't say with certainty. While P1 is summarized at the beginning of P2 (incompletely, and colored by the agenda of those doing the summary), you'll need P1 for the full story -- while P2 has a new protoganist, it continues the same story in the same setting, and certain key characters of P1 return. As P1 feels like it has a simpler, slightly less engaging story than P2, with less 'story per hour', it's hard to say whether it'll be worth it when you really just want to play P2 and are only playing P1 for the additional background. That said, if the P1/P2 package deal is cheap once again (making P1 £2 or so) and you actually have the time for both, give it a shot -- if you really hate P1 two hours in, you can still fast forward to P2.  THEREFORE,  Qualified recommendation for the B- list P1 (decide whether you can stomach the somewhat retro look), recommendation for the A list P2 (whose only faults are that you have no choice of protagonist, and that it plays a somewhat cliched evil-corporations-and-uncaring-government plot straight, if rather better than P1 did).
339	1	a	A very good game in my opinion. Fun open world sandbox game. It's maybe a bit easy, but so much fun when you get the hang of it.
341	1	a	Play this game !!!!!!!
343	1	a	I bought this game on the Halloween sale, not really knowing what to think about it. But as I launched the game I had no idea of the fun I was about to have. The characters are crap, the story is boring, but that doesn't matter. You know why? Because this game is fun!!! I can't think of any other game where you can surf a person,
345	1	a	It's like saints row 4/ Hulk ultimate destruction but edgy.
347	1	a	In this game, you play as a complete monster who spends his days killing countless people and/or stealing their memories by eating them. Yes you read that right. You are a psycho in this game and you have a big open world to play around in. So the story is a bit meh, filled with government conspiracy cliche mixed with evil science experiments, but it's not bad enough to ruin the game. And it is made up for by a stellar combat system and plenty to do in the game. Besides... sometimes it's fun to just cut loose and play a bad guy with unnatural powers.  WARNING: This game is also buggy. A particularly nasty bug I ran into was that everytime I started the game, then tried to load a save, the game crashed. My workaround was the start the game, start an all new game, and THEN to load my save file. Figured I should put that here in case someone buys this game based off this posting only to run into this particular bug.  But if you don't have such troubles or can get around them, have fun!   (Nom nom)
349	1	a	reminds me of a john k. peta doujin
351	1	a	An open-world superhero game in a urban apocalyptic setting. Pretty satisfying to jump and glide over huge blocks of the city, overpowering everything in your path, from giant mutants to army tanks and helicopters. Don't do the sidequests though, or it gets very repetitive.
353	1	a	I love this game. I've played through it more than once, and you could spend endless hours on it it without actually making in progress into the game.
355	1	a	A fun and challenging game, if you can look past some mildly annoying to very irritating deficits.  First, there's the story. It isn't terribly innovative, and it greatly depends on whether the subject matter is your thing. The narrative pretty much consists of the elements 'military blackops dealings', 'bio-weapon research' and 'ugly mutants by way of doomsday virus'. I happen to LOVE these tropes. Aside from this, the narrative suffers from a fractured nature and sacrifices character development for spectacle. The latter is to be expected, but Prototype takes it to extremes. Don't expect anything more than cutout labels like 'sister', 'ex-girlfriend' or 'ruthless military leader'. Regarding the 'fractured' characteristic, there seems to be a strange divide between story cutscenes and gameplay missions, which I can't really explain except for diagnosing a distinct lack of flow. Now, this all may sound pretty negative, but what Prototype does, it does well. The scenario of New York going to pots and turning into a warzone is beautifully realized. The story is also more grounded in reality than, say, Resident Evil, which deals with similar themes. There is also a nice optional gameplay aspect called 'Web Of Intrigue', which is for everyone who wants to delve deeper into the world of Prototype. By assimilating certain individuals, you unlock small story snippets connected by a network representing the individuals and their relationships. While this is really cool, there is also potential for future improvement. Why not, for instance, sort these cutscenes by theme and, once you have collected all scenes for a theme, unlock an option to watch a small movie combining the footage into one coherent story?  Gameplay-wise, the game is a very fun power fantasy and, at times, exhibits a great flow. Parkouring through New York is exhiliarating, and once you experienced escaping from your exploding helicopter just to hijack the attacking chopper in mid-air, you'll know how great the gamplay can be. HOWEVER, there are two things that made it difficult for me to throroughly enjoy Prototype. The first one are the so-called 'Events', which are nothing more than challenges spread over the city. I don't like challenges (or challenge maps, for that matter), as I think they are lazy design choices disconnected from any immersion and only present to shoehorn more content into a game. You like them? Well, great, you can scratch this caveat! Unfortunately, my second gripe transcends individual preferences.  This big fun-killer is the atrocious lock-on system (INFO: I played this game with a XBox 360 for Windows Gamepad). There simply doesn't seem to be any logic or prioritizing behind it. It does not really work. Actually, it has no right to do so, as you frequently deal with dozens of enemies simultaneously. But the problem is that the gameplay depends on it. Most of the time, it's just mildly annoying as you have enough time and leisure to rectify any mis-selection. However, during the final act of the game, missions require you to constantly be on your toes and perform difficult tasks under time pressure. You are chasing over the rooftops of Manhattan in desperate pursuit of a chopper you have to stop before it leaves the area? Well, the lock-on doesn't care and prefers to select a tank roaming the streets twenty meters below you. You really, REALLY need to keep track of a powerful boss rampaging through the area so it cannot charge at you like a Chihuahua on meth? The lock-on decides that a common soldier strolling around somewhere requires your immediate attention much more. I can't remember when the controls of a game have infuriated me so much. It renders you and makes you feel helpless.  Yet, I recommend Prototype. It features a competently realized and atmospheric scenario, and the gameplay makes even menial work fun. Menial work such as the Events, which can even be circumvented by grinding. However, you should be prepared to get frustrated in the later sections of the game.
357	1	a	Great game!!  Lots of variety in how you fight, what you upgrade...   My only problem is the PC controls. It's like they couldn't be bothered when it came to the PC, as it seems just about everything is linked to the E button (when there are so many other keys...). I'm trying to do my stun attack when instead, my character is trying to get into a tank (this happened 2-3 times in a row before I just decided to change attacks). Also, I'll often run up walls when I'm trying not to, pick up the wrong objects in the middle of a fight, target the wrong enemy... feels like it's a console game lazily ported to PC.   Still, good game and worth purchasing on a discount
359	1	a	Fun Single Player if you like fast-paced, meaningless massacres at your own hands.. or blades!
361	1	a	still best game, but i cannot understand why here are only 31 missions.. i mean prototype is best game ever i've played. i have all gold medals and like in assassins creed 100% sync.. is sad to see a good game very small in gameplay
363	1	a	-takes old lady- -climbs tall building- -aims at helicopter- -throws old lady at helicopter- -it explodes in a giant ball of gas and blood- -jumps off building- -elbow drops a cop car- -wins-
365	1	a	insanely fun urban horror/sci-fi. you get to climb walls at breakneck speed, jump 20 feet in the air and elbow drop some zombified New Yorkers, and glide over rooftops like a majestic, horribly mutated eagle. combat is button-mashing glee; Alex's powers are hilariously over the top; both the main missions and the side objectives are pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fun. like... you can go on joyrides in armored tanks &amp; helicopters firing heat-seeking missiles at pedestrians, or decimate as many zombies in 60 seconds as you possibly can.  on the flip side, Alex is a Typical Brooding Protagonist in a disjointed plot. the boss battles are pretty gosh darn repetitive. the parkour also suffers from the same 'stickiness' as Assassin's Creed (oh, you meant to sprint along the sidwalk and dropkick that monster? well, that's too bad, because now you're running straight up the front of this building instead). there are a lot (really, a lot) of powers, and many of them are redundant or only useful like once or twice in the entire game. also, the controls on PC are garbage so use a controller.  overall, an incredibly enjoyable game with some minor flaws.
367	1	a	Prototype's major boss fights will make you scratch your balls furiously with frustation for their tedious strategies and length.  Now that I got that out of the way, I really enjoyed Prototype, I must say I'm surprised at how fluid and ridiculous the combat was. I mean, your character, Alex Mercer, can transform his arm into a giant blade, a giant hammerfist, huge muscles, a sort of sling whiplash and much more. On top of the sweet combat, the exploration is awesome. Running up skyscrapers, airdashing, and gliding across Manhattan sounds awesome on paper, and plays awesome in the game. The gameplay is clearly where the developers spent the most time, as other areas were lacking.  I know the game was released in 2009, but if I compared it to other games released from 2009, or even 2008, the textures and models are put to shame, even the special effects, i.e; explosions, smoke, water, are kind of bad. There is little reaction in the water when you fall in it, when things blow up, the explosions are weak and not very volumetric, and the smoke within the explosions are unnatural. I'll take back that last one, considering how unnatural the game is, involving a virus that genetically changes people into super monsters.  The story wasn't bad, but it really wasn't that much to talk about. A lot of military conspiracy, which has been done several times, but at least there were twists in the plot and Alex Mercer, as a protagonist, is awesome and kicks ♥♥♥.  Play this game for the fun combat and gameplay, maybe for the story, but the graphics are certainly the weakest part.  8.3/10
369	1	a	Excellent people murdering simulator, got me to where I am today
371	1	a	Fun game to play if you like to have a lot of powers. I personally skipped the story, as it didn't really interest me and was too confusing.
373	1	a	Awesome game :)  Thanks for creating it Radical Entertainment.
375	1	a	If you liked Infamous 2 but hated the good/evil moral points system nonsense they put into it, then you will like this.  To be completely honest the powers in this game are better than Infamous 2 although they are melee, there is a lot more variation than the lighting bolt attacks from Infamous.  It also has the added bonus of being able to pickup weapons and helicopters and tanks.   The only big sigh for me is that Activision let the development team behind the franchise go so there probably won't be a prototype 3.
377	1	a	Not sure if it's worth 19€, but it sure has nice destructive gameplay for that time game developing.
379	1	a	Exciting, fun, hilarious, gory. Highly recommended.
381	1	a	Incredibely fun. There is nothing quite like this game, the only one coming close being Prototype 2. Nothing makes you feel more like destrcution incarnate.  The only real dislike that could hold up is how annoying some missions were, but that is a very arguable point.  Anyone that's looking into playing this game, I highly reccomend you do so.
383	1	a	Fantastic game. Deffinately one of my favourites.
385	1	a	Prototype is very addicting, as it uses a upgrading menu to keep you playing. This game is identical to Saints Row IV, only this was realised before hand. If you want a game where you can't stop playing, I recommend checking out Prototype. The story is ok, but the gameplay is very fun as it involves the use of abilities such as disguises and a wide variety of weapons for your character.
387	1	a	Aside from it's graphics, Prototype is much more in-depth with it's gameplay and overall being a badass than in it's sequel. Anyways, it brings up a slightly interesting plot. But nonetheless, everyone buys this game for it's AWESOME gameplay. The game is challenging, it may not be rewarding, but it gives you upgrades and extras for doing such challenges and overcoming them. As a personal owner of the game, it doesn't have a ton of replay value, play it one, two, or maybe even three times and it becomes stale. That's when the game's challenges and events (oh god the events) come into play.  This game is worthy of a 6.5/10 rating, i really couldn't decide between it being a 7/10 or 6/10.
389	1	a	Throwing the burning skeleton of a destroyed helicopter into its companion helicopter certainly is fun
391	1	a	This is a pretty good game. Another zombie apocalypse, except this time you aren't human or truely zombie but something else. But whatever that something else is shapeshifts into a ton of amusing and deadly forms for all your killing needs. And lets be honest, the shapeshifting is awesome but so is shooting a helicopter from the sky, picking it up and throwing it hulk style to bring down the next.  This game is mainly combat, and has many places for wanton destruction, and some where you better know what you're doing if you want to survive. It also has some 'stealth' if it even rates that name, but this component is amusing none the less. Also if you enjoy dashing around cities at high speed, running up walls, jumping increadible distances and gliding around this is definately for you.  The story is completely linear, but the world is open and contains a number of fun challenges all around the city which unlock as you progress through the story. The narative is fairly good, and I personally enjoyed tracking down the backstory components, but that is not essential.  Overall it's a pretty great game and you should probably get it; though it won't provide the hundreds of hours that you would get from say Skyrim.
393	1	a	Play as Alex Mercer on this amazing open-world game !
395	1	a	Thats the most incredible Game ever!!! I dont know how to explain but look at some Gameplays and you will see!
397	1	a	Fantastic game. Deffinately one of my favourites.
399	1	a	Prototype is very addicting, as it uses a upgrading menu to keep you playing. This game is identical to Saints Row IV, only this was realised before hand.

401	1	a	Best zombie-apocalyptic game ever  10/10
403	1	a	i've had this on my wish list for alot of time and i wasn't sure i was gonna get it... but holy crap i'm glad i did. it has a interesting story and freeroam, which makes for fun to run from building to building. i'm not to far in but i all ready know when i finish it. i'm buying the 2nd one.
405	1	a	This is an extended review about Prototype, so before starting, let me sai it short. This is a very cool game, but full of bugs and glitches in the Steam version. I bought it on sale, and I suggest doing the same thing. Now, let's start with the extended review.  STORY/GAMEPLAY: This is a sanbox game. very unique in its kind. In spite of being the typical delinquent who wants to rule the mafia, the main character is a human infected by a special virus that allows him to absorb other living beings, and mutate part of his body. There are a great deal of 'natural weapons' to use, and also the environment is pretty much destroyable, with the exception of building. The story in my opinion is the shining point of this game, and the funny thing is that it's not explained at all in the beginning, but it's revealet little by little through special events (that last far over the 'main story', if you want to collect all pieces of it). The free roaming is quite good. It's cool being this spiderman-like character, and desn't get boring over time.  GRAPHICS: Graphics are average. The main character and the cinematics are quite pretty, but the rest sucks pretty much. There are 10 to 15 'characters' in the game, so the world feels pretty monotonous and dull. The building are quite monotonous too, put together with a little variety. Despite this you can feel some slowdown when there are many enemies on the screen, even if you have a last generation video card.  BUGS: If I understand correctly, this is an xbox/ps porting, so it's full of bugs and glithces. Looking on the internet you can manage to fix pretty much everything, but still sucks having to 'open new game &gt; return to main meny &gt; load saved game', or else the game crashes.  AI: Artificial intelligence just sucks. After just a couple of hours of game you can perfectly predict what will happen, even what moves your enemies will do. I think that you can pretty much expect it from a sandbox game, but the overall scarce variety of character is quite dull.  I think that's all. To sum up, this is a short list of pros and cons.  PROs: - very good story - feels incredibly cool - complete it 100% is quite challenging CONs: - bugs - AI - graphics (i put in the cons because of the overall effect, and the slowdowns)  That's all. Hope this review is helpful.
407	1	a	I think this game was somewhat ruined by a long development cycle, during which other games (such as Assassin's Creed) were released, and some ideas ideas from those games were borrowed and smashed on top of the original concept, instead of polishing the gameplay balance. Although the game is fun, it gets boring after a while. I never got myself to finish it, but I'd still recommend it - when it's on a sale with a considerable discount - it's got a few hours of uncomplicated entertainment in it. Running and jumping across buildings is kind of cool.
409	1	a	One of Activision's (if you want to get technical, Radical's, but since their out of buisness, we'll be calling this Activision's game) best game in ages, it's from 2009, and it still hold's up today.  The story is solid, it will leave you wanting more and more answers as you progress, and it throws a real curve ball at you when you learn the truth. There's also a ton of extra bits and pieces you can find by seeking out and consuming (more on that later) certain people, called 'Web of Intrigue' targets, and my hat goes off to the people who made those cutscenes, because they looked pretty painful to make. But there are a few sections in the story where you'll be left confused, and with no answers, none. So for the story, 8/10.  The graphics are a bit dated, but can look pretty good in some parts, especially on the PC. And you'll encounter little to no frame rate issues, or crashes. And the animation is quite nice as well. But there are a few audio glitches, especially in the cutscenes. 7/10  The gameplay is amazing, it's hack and slash for some parts, and beat them to a bloody pulp for others, and there are so many combos in the game, an astounding ammount. You're also going to want to use a controller if one is handy, I felt the game didn't work well for a keyboard, and was glad I had my controller with me. But consuming is really quite interesting, you can grab a target and more or less 'eat' them, but you gain their form, memories, etc. etc. etc. But the boss battles felt painfully OP, and I was playing on normal for my first time through. I had the most trouble with the last boss, as he was a damage sponge, there were other people attacking me, and if that's not enough, there's a timer. His attacks also did an insane ammount of damage. Gameplay earns a solid 9/10  So, the story is great, one of the best one's I've experienced in a while, close to the level that the original inFAMOUS gave you in terms of depth. Still, it has verry odd bits and pieces missing from it that could of easily been included. Graphics could of been better (i.e. inFAMOUS was released around the same time, and look at how it looked) and the gameplay is awesome. So my final score for [PROTOTYPE] is an 8/10, pick this game up, it is a must have.
411	1	a	♥♥♥♥ the story, be like everyone else and become a ♥♥♥♥ in free roaming
413	1	a	Okay Game play wise, its okay. Nothing to freak out about. I mean you got your destroy everything, but since thats basiclly all of todays games in general there's nothing special about it.  As far as story goes. Ive seen games like this all the time, your some guy who gains powers of incredible poportions and you go to seek revenge against the bad guy yada yada yada. If you dont belive me look at the games such as, Infamous (the whole inteir series), Dishonerd, Bioshock infinite, and so on. So as far as story wise, its pretty basic. This game is nothing to aw at, but that does not mean you shouldn't get it (well at least while its on sale) My Gaming Score 5 Hungry Alexses/10
415	1	a	An excellent suggestion for anybody.
417	1	a	It's like Infamous.

421	1	a	Prototype reminds me bit of The Hulk : Video game, same concept except, can not destroy buildings. Gameplay is decent (what do you want more besides smacking or consuming people and blowing up armored vehicles) even tho game itself counts as open world it does not have any side missions just challenges and searching for collectables. Story wise, not bad could excite new players. Find what happened.... What actually happened to Alex Mercer.  Game does work on W7 64bit.
423	1	a	Great game, highly recommended!
425	1	a	Yo mum would love this guy , he can make his hands into tentacles. 20/10.
427	1	a	The only flaws I have with this game are the controls at some points, and the graphics, other than that you should totally get this one. Plus it runs well on crappy computers. The storyline isn't that good either though, I just found myself having a good time creating chaos through each mission.
429	1	a	Campaign is enjoyable but you'll spend a lot more time just running around wreaking havoc. Zero replay value.
431	1	a	PC port is surprisingly decent. Worth the buy
433	1	a	one of the best
435	1	a	All Time Best Sense of Freedom.I Love It
46	0	a	I'm mildly upset; I've owned a copy of this wonderful game on a console before, and it was just fine. Great, even, I've had a fantastic experience. It has pretty good gameplay, not much in the way of story, but enough fun to leave a nice impression on you.   The reason I'm leaving a negative review is because the PC port is horribly broken right off the bat. It's the sound. The god-awful sound. it feels like it's been revved up to x64 speed. Do yourself a favor and don't buy the port.
437	1	a	yeah i am a shapeshifter
439	1	a	the best. enough said.buy it
441	1	a	Fantastic. I refuse to play the second again, considering I much perfer this one. Alex for life!
443	1	a	Besides graphics still a pretty rad game. There needs to be a third game this series has soo much untapped potential
445	1	a	So this was fun...
447	1	a	Freeroaming, chaos inspiring &amp; able to do what ever you like, you can mess around and not do the story if you like with this game.
449	1	a	Prototype is a quite amazing game with the unique gameplay. You can jump, sprint, kill, consume and become. Here's the pros and cons:    PROS
451	1	a	This game is kinda like spiderman but not for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.
49	0	a	That's not compatible with windows 10 please don't buy it
453	1	a	+ Story was absolutely ridiculous, but enjoyable + The game is already 5 years old, but has aged well + Open-world Manhattan is a blast to stomp around in free-roam + Your mutations/powers are well-varied and the game is absolutely bursting with upgrades and unlocks + Being able to imitate other NPCs can be fun, especially when consuming base commanders and taking over military strongholds + You can hijack military vehicles, which can help break up the monotany of your typical mindless killing sprees + Voice-acting was surprisingly well-done, especially that of the main antagonist  - Visuals and character models were lacking, even taking into account that the game came out in 2009 - Stolen weapons (ie. rifles) had horrible mechanics and felt forced; the game may as well not have introduced it - Your character moves like an idiot when holding a weapon (of which there are only two types, ugh)
455	1	a	What a spectacular game.
457	1	a	Great    This was one of the best games I've ever played. I reccomend this to anyone that likes open world games. A lot of gore but that is the powers. Very good. I liked the powers. They were very creative. Prototype 2 is out and you should definitley play it.
459	1	a	Reminds me of Parasyte.
461	1	a	Good Game! 'Nuff said. I guess...
53	0	a	Take on the role of Alex Mercer, a man who has no recollection of what’s happened to him or why, or how he came to acquire the shape-shifting powers he now possesses. Find the people who’ve done that to you and make them pay. The game -action, adventure, open worldish- sounded fun and looked fun, and I was very hyped to play it. I was also very disappointed when I finally did. Controls, though a bit wonky, are not difficult. You can change your body “at will to attack enemies and destroy things, and when I say “at will I mean you only have so many things you can change into. I think the most fun aspect of the game is the fact that you can ‘consume’ random people and then turn into them, and run/jump your way around pretty freely.   I’d say the graphics are dated, but it’s an oldish game, so it gets a slight pass for that. What it doesn’t get a pass for, however, is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ performance. For a 2009 game that should run like a charm on my computer, it sure worked like crap even at the lowest settings, lagging worse than Assassin’s Creed III - and at least that one had a reason to lag (no “low video settings, hey). I’m also not particularly fond of the reddish/orangeish filter they use on later cinematics and gameplay time, I find it bothersome to look at.   Your character is overpowered, which is not bad in itself if you like an easy game, but it does make things boring after a while as it’s all the same; to tell the truth, it reminded me a little of God Hand for some reason, only that one was actually fun to keep playing. With Prototype, I did the first few missions and was bored out of my mind - that along with the slightly eye-hurting graphics and slight, random spikes of lag made the game truly disappointing.  The gameplay is pretty repetitive otherwise. Fight a bunch of bad guys, have them call in tanks and an airstrike, be chased, shake them off, rinse and repeat with a moderate variety of enemies and mutants to fight against.   It’s not a completely unplayable game, mind you. If you’re extremely bored and want to play something that doesn’t pose a huge challenge, it’s not a bad game and could even be considered entertaining. I liked the city, the chance to explore it some, the general idea of the game was good (though the story was a bit hit and miss with me), but the execution left a lot to be desired.  Perhaps if the game had lagged a bit less I would have enjoyed it a bit better.  I wouldn’t recommend this game, but I would certainly not tell you to steer clear from it either, as I feel it could be a lot more fun if you can actually play it sans the lag.
54	0	a	Crash on load. The game is a literal non starter.  Win 7 - 64 i7 - 3960X 32GB GTX 780 Ti SLI(2)  
463	1	a	best game play ever, story line and all
465	1	a	awsome game! one of my favourites :P
56	0	a	It's buggy and hardware intensive...even if you buy a new video card to appease it's high standards, you get through 80% of the game just to get a black screen and no way to progress.
467	1	a	An ok game, but nothing more.
469	1	a	If you have friends, this is a great game to play with them. If you don't have any friends, this is a great game to play alone. If you don't have the game to play, get the money for it. If you don't have the money for it, get a job. If you don't have a job, rob the bank. If you get arrested robbing the bank, at least you tried.
471	1	a	you can eat people karate kick helis and pick up giant mutant creatures and slam there head into the ground and also amazing story
473	1	a	Prototype 2 soon..Ejaculate
475	1	a	If there is such a game that can represent me, then that has to be Prototype. The reason is kind of simple. During the winter time back in highschool, I always wore a black jacket and a white hoodie inside, and blue jeans (In fact, I still wear them today), making myself look like Alex Mercer in a way. Did I wear like that so that I can look like Alex Mercer? No. I wore those even before the game Prototype was announced, so basically I felt that I had to give this game a try, as it looked as though the main character himself was myself.   And basically I beat this game on 360 a long time ago, and I remember myself having a real great time with it. And recently I bought myself the Steam version and have to say, the game is still a good ol' Prototype. Basically you are Alex Mercer, who is almost like a superman. The helicopters, tanks and tons of military men try to kill you all at once, but no worries, you are Alex Mercer, you have the ability to heal yourself by devouring zombies or people and no one can match your running speed and power. It is also possible to upgrade your powers and purchase new skills so that you can unleash extremely powerful move against your foes as well. But because of the fact that Alex Mercer is so overpowered, you better be moving fast otherwise, you may die quickly. I remember the game being pretty challenging back in the days, and even though I already beat it once, I still kind of feel some parts are still somewhat challenging.   Overall, great action game. 10 out of 10.
477	1	a	this game is awesome!
479	1	a	unleash the inner edgy ♥♥♥♥♥♥ inside you when nobody liked your sub-par tumblr share  10/10 fun for the WHOLE FAMILIO
481	1	a	buy it cuz its good 
58	0	a	I wold like to start off by saying I love this studio, I love this game ploline, I love games like this in general. but I dont honestly know how you let these controls get past testing. like was it your goal to release a game that pisses people off because you tell your character to go one direction and he takes a running leap 2 dashes and glides in the opposite direction. this sincerely does not deserve to be available for purchase. please correct your issues with your equations for locking onto a wall and directional aiming when jumping. a fix for something like this wouldnt take more than a week for one lone programmer please take the time ou of your oh so very busy schedule and fix the first game in your series.
483	1	a	The control is something strange but I could get used to it. The story is good. And I liked the mini challenges.  Good things:   -The story is enough long.   -Playable challenges.   Bad things:   -The control must get used to it.   -If you not play any of challenges the game become too short.
59	0	a	couldnt get it to load kept crashing a shame it looked fun
60	0	a	Prototype looks like a really fun game, but the PC port is god awful.  You need to disable HID devices for the game to even run and even then it might not even work  The game crashes, freezes and pretty much anyone who owns the PC port seems to have problems.    Seriously, If your interested in this game, go for the console version
485	1	a	Great game, great plot and a lot of fun.
487	1	a	They should literally just rename this game to 'Badass Simulator' Because that's what I feel like when playing this game.
489	1	a	A very awesome game to buy. This game lets you do something that every gamer has ever wanted... Free roaming... And it's also a stress reliever.  Seriously though, get this game. When I first heard about this game, I felt like it was just GTA all over again. Well, I was wrong. This game lets you consume anyone at anytime and disguise as them. You also consume whatever is a part of them, like their memories. But this game isn't all about cannibalism, it's about fighting for what you want... To legally eat people and infected monsters...  When the whole military is against you, what are the odds that you'll survive? The truth is... You won't. Not unless you're Alex Mercer, who can shapeshift into various weapons, has super strength and super speed, and parkour on buildings. Practically, he's a walking war machine.   I promise this to anyone that they will enjoy Prototype since the story also helps contribute to the game.
491	1	a	i recomend prototype cause it is FLIPING AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!! And at times challenging
493	1	a	2 hours into the game and i've killed more innocent people than HItler  Would recommend.
495	1	a	This game is a peice of ♥♥♥♥ and impossible gameplay 10/10
497	1	a	*Can crack open reinforced tank with elbow in single blow* *Can't just break down the door to the stupid military base*  9/10 for military realism
499	1	a	I think I killed the entire population of Manhatten, but then it respawned.
501	1	a	Slash people in half as an old grandma
503	1	a	The movies are sooo choppy though!! Fun so far but idk what's going on in the story line because the audio cuts in and out during the movies. Anyone know how to fix this? Let me know please.
505	1	a	Great game, you can complete it within a couple of days, but there is a free roam which gives you a bunch of other missions
507	1	a	10/10 My favorite game of all time. PS: Badass Anti-Hero.
509	1	a	This game is tough yet really fun with crazy storys for you to complete , when completed gives you a big achievement . after all the rage , its still fun .
511	1	a	Overall the story is okay, it is expanded upon in the sequel. However the gameplay in this one is far more enjoyable than the second. The sequel takes away gameplay for story whilst this gives gameplay at the the story's sake.
513	1	a	This is a great game good story line, fun gameplay and awesome abilities. I only have a few complaints one that the soliders are stupid it was humorus and that the dialouge is EXTREMeLY QUIET even at full volume but other than that it's a great game and im suprised for all that the makers made in the game at the time. Now Prototype 2 may fix my complaints but playing the first game will most likely let you know    the villain in Prototype 2   better and feel more remorse for him. Anyways in all if you find interest in the game or idea im only saying it's a damn good game.
515	1	a	Please note that some some people are having issues with this game, but I am not. It is worth it to dig into their problems to ensure that you will not have them as well.  That having been said, graphically, this game is nothing special (though to its credit, it is half a decade old at this point), and the controls can be a bit difficult at times. But overall, I do recommend this game. it is a fun game to just unleash h*ll on random civies (as there are no penalties for it). The powers are very fun, and when you get used to the controls, zipping around the city is pretty fantastic. The story is nothing too special, but still fun to go through. And some of the missions can be a bit annoying on higher difficulties.  Basically, this game is a fantastic ammoral d*ck simulator, and well worth the low cost imho. You can just run around streets with a car over your head, smashing everyone like bowling pins. You can go nuts with machine guns or helicopters. Quite frankly, this is a great sandbox game to play, even if it does seem to lack depth in most departments (although they do have a cool feature where you can affect the map through your actions, even if it is temporary)  8.5/10
517	1	a	Once you download the wide-screen user-made patch (  http://www.wsgf.org/dr/prototype  ), download this ENB (  http://www.gta4-mods.com/misc/prototype-mixed-enb-f21907  ) and work out any stuttering issues ( remove all HID devices in your control panel before playing - after every reboot ) the gameplay is a blast! It's pure carnage on a whole new misanthropic level.   Having just completed the campaign the whole White People Are Evil™ theme they used kind of pisses me off... So whitey, with the governments approval, tried to make a virus to kill non-whites and this is all their fault? Couldn't the writer come up with something a little less...blatantly racist?
519	1	a	suprisinlgy good...
521	1	a	lmfao idk why i have this game
523	1	a	Great game for just running around and doing whatever while listening to music.
525	1	a	Decent game on its own but feels like a mediocre Infamous knock-off. Some really wierd UI decisions -'Are you sure you want to load this save file' !!!  Combat gets repetetive despite lots of possible combos. No story buildup or attachment to the charectars.  Probably not worth the $20 but a good pick up on sale.
527	1	a	Pretty cool so far.
529	1	a	If you like...  - Cutting people into little chunks of meat - if you hate the government - if you like being a god - if you hate being talked down to  this is the game for you  10/10 -ign
531	1	a	Used to play spiderman 3 by activision on PS2. This ♥♥♥♥ is the same but better!
533	1	a	Plagued with problems, especially hen it comes to controls (this is an obvious console port job gone wrong) but brutally fun at times. The problems balance with the good stuff fairly well, so I'd recommend if you can get it cheaply and/or really need your fix of Going-On-A-Murder-Spree-In-New-York-City games.
535	1	a	YOU ELBOW DROP TANKS. also there might be a story or something but I wasn't paying attention because YOU CAN ELBOW DROP TANKS.
537	1	a	you should play this!
539	1	a	ok so this is a great game but the blackwatch are everywhere! The longest time I spent not being notorious was 3 minutes, this was due to the sheere amount of blackwatch troops everywhere!! Other than that i'm having alot of fun playing this game!
541	1	a	I liked how to the story progress as alex got stronger definatly will play agin
543	1	a	Brutal, gory, and tons of fun, oh yeah and something about a plot I think. Oh yeah and there's an emo kid    11/10 would cleve peopel in two again
63	0	a	First thing first, I had absolutely lots of fun with this game. Just the sheer amount of destruction you are capable of doing is incredible. The hero has so grossly overpowered he literally rips to shreds everything he encounters, from regular people, through tanks and helicopter to disgusting and huge mutants. Action is satisfying and story, B-rated as it is, has a nice twist at the end. The reason I must say no, is that the game has some technical difficulties and it took me a few hours browsing through internet discussion and trying a lot of things to get it run normally on more than 3 FPS.
64	0	a	Rubbish Game engine  need tune my sound card quality to 24bit 48khz! WTF
65	0	a	i must admit while i do like this game get it on sale for atleast 70 off it gets really annoying note this is not a bad game just not worth what else you could get like saints row or this war of mine 
66	0	a	this game is overall fun but the turtorials i had to search on google many times to understand what the hell they meant and they still didnt work. You lose your powers at some point and that gets really boring to play so i stopped when the quest for getting your powers back never ended.
67	0	a	Worst optimization I have ever seen.
68	0	a	Prototype is actually a really fun game, but its an example of one of the negatives of PC gaming that I've dealt with over the decades I've been nerding out... some games just stop working on modern hardware. This can be for a variety of reasons, and some people can fix the problems with a weird trick like disabling some obscure setting in your OS that you've never heard of... but for some people, myself included, the reasons are completely mysterious.  Prototype barely worked for me, and I eventually just sort of gave up on it. The common fixes posted online don't seem to work for me, so I'm kind of left in the dust.  If the game runs for you, you'll have a blast, but I can't recommend it based on how it performs. The developers also seem uninterested in fixing the issues as of April 2016.
69	0	a	Wont start from first save. Modern Machine. 
545	1	a	i like the game but you cant not even understand what there saying that one of the big down fall of this game
70	0	a	if I press the mouse the whole game just closes
547	1	a	Overall good game but... sometimes you can try to fight hunters and think that there too much overpowered even in EASY mode and I mean it
104	0	a	Wont start from first save. Modern Machine. 
105	0	a	An interesting freeroam game, with a good idea and interesting story. Those who like free roam games will like it. Overall it's good. But the story is full of clichés, the combat system is too console like, and resembles the Force Unleashed (I just beat before this game). The same targeting, health gain system and even you have unlockables, and upgrades (not really combos). The NPC characters start to look the same after a while. I was somwhere in the middle of the story or at the first third, when I totally lost my interest. Nor the story, neither the game style couldn't get me back to the game.
106	0	a	Mouse inputs didn't work. Kind of hard to like a game I can't play.
107	0	a	Initially this was a good game... no really- it was. I Mean who doesn't enjoy dropkicking helicopters to death in a 'free roam' environment. between a massive slew of unlockable powers and movement mechanics, some really stylish animation, and overall addictive gameplay- this game has a lot going for it. However, between a thin story (It could've been a lot better if there was just more character depth) and some maddeningly bad boss fights *cough* elizabeth green *cough* and the abysmel slew of bugs that invariably result in stunlocks and instant death- the latter parts of the game will probably leave you feeling like you should go play contra to unwind. for a game released in 2009 to have so many weird bugs is. well... not so great. Especially from a publishler like activision. Still the bugs arn't so bad as to completely ruin the game. All in all i'd give it a 6 out of 10. The animators did great, the graphics, for the time, are OK. (Would be better if not clearly aimed at consoles) the story and gameplay itself could be a little more solid. Still worth buying if you catch it on sale, but be prepared to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at a couple poorly designed boss fights, the ocassional unavoidable stunlock, enemies running around at mach 12, and the autotargetting system leaving you spinning in circles at 90mph.
108	0	a	Well, the gameplay itself is like a newer Hulk: Ultimate Destruction. That's great and all, but I ran into a terrible bug with the sound. All the sound effects and music are sped up when you're in the levels, and it's horrible, squeaky, and it's impossible to tolerate. If there's ever a patch, I'll re-install this game in a heartbeat.
109	0	a	So, i tried playing this game on my Windows 7 PC. It is pretty much as good as those with Windows 7 go, but the game is stuck on constant 5 fps, making it barely playable. Apparently it is connected to HID, which would be fine. IF this was the year 2009. Seven years later, this gamebreaking error is not fixed, and has to be manually looked up and dealt with by players who want to play this. To people who want to play a singleplayer game for once because their internet is too ♥♥♥♥ to play online, this is just infuriating. So basically, i bet i would like this game, if i could play it. But due to this error, i wont be able to, and seeing as this is left unfixed for seven years now, there is no hope for me to play this game in the future either.
110	0	a	Really good for the first two thirds, except for a couple of difficulty spikes, but the last third of the game is awful. These developers had no idea how to do difficulty right.
111	0	a	Mouse inputs didn't work. Kind of hard to like a game I can't play.
112	0	a	Initially this was a good game... no really- it was.

549	1	a	I orginally played Prototype on the 360 back in the day and enjoyed it, although i remembered there being really stupid parts that I didn't enjoy. Either way, I decided to beat the main story once again, but in a single sitting because I didn't expect it to take too terribly long. (about 8 hours).  Everything went as I expected it would, It's a fun game to play when you want to goof off and free roam. You can endlessly kill pretty much anything and you have a lot of ways to do so. That's the good aspect of the game.  The bad comes in during the boss fights, the most effective way I found to kill the bosses was using the muscle enhancing power to increase the effectiveness of objects you throw and to continuously run around finding anything laying around to chuck at the boss. This becomes a very long, drawn out, and boring process, being repeated about four times during the course of the main story.  All in all, I DO recommend Prototype if you'd like to have a game where you are all powerful and just want to run around and break stuff.
551	1	a	Clearly say's i don't have many hours on this game or none at all when i wrote this recommendation (And steams 5 minute gameplay before posting review) however i had quite a bit from when i played this on the PS3 which i don't have anymore so i am happy to have found it on Steam   If distruction and choas and some funny achivements (Which i noticed after writing this review that it does not have achivements for the PC version it seems) is your thing than i highly recommend this game   What other game let's you drive tanks in new york running over cars and flatining them like pancakes or drive a bonus tank that shoots shells that act like a mini nucular bomb while watching cars and people go flying as a resualt or flying attack helicopters and being able to highjack them while they are in the air.  Being able to jump redicuoles distances and throwing cars like your a mini version of the hulk  Also turning yourself into a human tank (Though i wouldn't classifie Alex Mercer as human) and plowing through anything in your path (minus buildings) running up the side of sky scrapers and much more   The story line i found was actually good not really any games i play just for the story line however i found this one to be an exception  My personal preferance for games are open world racing games and simulaters or games like GTA series Though this game doesn't let you drive civilian vehicles i'm alright with the fact they let you drive tanks and fly helicopters  But to each there own. The graphics are good at least to me they are. It's open world which i like though i wish you could explore all of New York like outside the quorinteen zone  controls are easy though going from the PS3 to PC could be interesting Least it gives a tutorial on the controls at the begining of the game   Well guess if you find my recommending usefull then you can find your own impression of the game  Have fun.
120	0	a	This game is possibly the biggest influence for Saints Row 4, however, I'd say it's not anywhere near as good. The story is hard to follow (might be because the voice acting is terrible, could also be because the story is kinda really very boring).  For a 2009 game, the visuals are really horrible. Lighting and shadows seemed a little closer to 2006 levels (I was playing with everything maxed out)  The controls were alright, though it wasn't anywhere near refined enough so the game felt cluggy from time to time.  The game most likely requires some work to get running well. With Nvidia cards, it's less of an issue, but almost everyone seems to suffer frame rate issues of some sort. If you are running with the an Nvidia card, I'd suggest leaving Vsync off in game and use the control panel (This should really be standard practise).
121	0	a	It works for the first few minutes but it crashes afterwards. It was a good game. It's a shame that it does that. I wouldn't recommend buying this game at all. It'll be a waste of your time and money.
553	1	a	in a part of the game it crachd!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! plaz fix it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
122	0	a	A giant heap of terrible console port. With a i7 6700k and a gtx 1070 I manage 20 fps. Sound has awful clipping and desync. Got the franchise pack on sale and I would write a review for the second but it doesn't even launch. 0/10 wish I could get my 7 dollars back.
555	1	a	Like Infamous except it looks worse, plays worse, has a worse story, awful cutscenes, and an unlikable protaginist.  Yet, it's oddly better.
557	1	a	My review . . . .  . . . . . . .  . . . . . .  Click  Add to Cart 
126	0	a	I booted up the game and watched the 'intro' that you get after idling for a brief bit at the start-up screen, and to my dismay, the sound was completely insanely broken. 'Maybe it's better in the game', I guessed to myself, and proceeded to fiddle with the options, as one ALWAYS does after buying a new game.  But lo and behold, I then noticed that the highest resolution option available is a measly 1280x800. I wasn't aware of the fact that this game was made in göddämn 2002. 'Fine', I thought, and went with it. I fixed the controls (the ones necessary, anyway, since I'm using a 360 controller for it), and exited the options.  I tried starting a new game (oops, spoiled it there, didn't I?) with the key word in that sentence being TRIED. Yeah. I can't even start the game proper without it crashing. Three failed tries and a cursory google search later, I've come to the conclusion that this is not a game that was designed for even REMOTELY modern computers.  TL;DR: THIS GAME IS NON-FUNCTIONING. AVOID IT AT ALL COSTS. 0/10
127	0	a	I tried playing again recently and I realized within the first 2 hours why I never bothered to complete this game. Considering that the game is no longer supported and also doesn't work well on Windows 10 with newer graphics cards, I can only recommend that people give this game a pass.
128	0	a	good game. i first played this game on my xbox 360. when i first bought it i was disapionted with the game. but i figured i would give it another try. no thumbs up or down... it would cool if there was a way to play it in full hd. but no only 720 for this one guys... save your money
559	1	a	. . .
561	1	a	Viral infection in a sandbox world 10/10
563	1	a	childhood game :')
131	0	a	The console version is better, an obvious port, I do not recommend.
132	0	a	This is a good game on ps3 so I figured id buy it again for pc... this game sucks on pc its buggy the resolution makes everything widescreen the keys are laggy and sometimes unresponsive (usually during important times or right after a pause) story wise its a good game &amp; theres more cutscenes in the pc version but overall I can't recommend it.
565	1	a	Became an old lady take a machinegun and shoot everyone   11/10
148	0	a	Game is fun, but it's very poorly optimized.
149	0	a	I didn't run into any of the porting bugs (resoluion, sound, graphic, et al) but the story and game plan on this are hard to suggest to anyone that values their time.
567	1	a	Incredible game. You should pay up to $100 for this game.
154	0	a	I don't know what the big fuss is about; I do not like this game. I realized very quickly that this game is just a rehash of that old open-world Spiderman game. They just replaced Spiderman with Alex. Not to mention that I feel extremely overpowered and I am not that good at video games for the most part (50+ hours spend only on the first level of Demon Souls before I switched to PC). There's also the fact that the cut scene audio clips and cuts out constantly even when I turn down the settings. I bought Prototype and Prototype 2 and now I am out $20 because I am most likely not going to ever play them again.
155	0	a	crashes at startup no solution in site prototype 1&amp;2 Don't buy
569	1	a	iz gud gaem... but prototiep 2 is betar. i'd rather go for 2 tho
161	0	a	Super-villian simulator, horribly optimized graphics. story most likely written by a teenage comic writer wannabe, but the movement and fighting were not that bad. Worth the bargin-bin price of a sale only.
162	0	a	Could be an ok game if not for the controls that make your character feel like your driving a bus.  Helicoptors also have a tendency of dissappearing and appearing where ever they please. doesn't matter if you were going to attack them or not or if they are a few feet in front of you. Very unrewarding gameplay makes you just want to uninstall  -0/10 don't bother  also for some reason the recent news for Prototype is   This Prototype Legend of Zelda Cartridge Can Be Yours for a Mere $150,000
571	1	a	'Like Skyrim with fapping hand' -IGN  69/420
177	0	a	Doesn't Work. Want my money back. 2 gtx 670s and intel i7 3930k cpu and 32gigs of ram. Can run almost any game on the face of the planet yet activison and steam is telling me it's my rig. Well I'll suggest save your money and do not buy prototype. Interesting enough second one works. maybe a different studio i don't know. Prototype 2 isn't as good as the first imo.
178	0	a	Not as good as it seems. Despite its an open world game it's sorta buggy, And sometimes your computer will lag if your surrounded by many enemies. Sometimes you will be attacked from many places and you'll get hurt without knowing where the enemy is shooting from. But, hey if you like the game good for you.
179	0	a	The game itself is pretty great actually. BUT DO NOT BUY IT if you had a hex core processor. You need to turn off some cores manually in order to launch the game.
180	0	a	The visual engines of both Prototype games behave in a strange manner:  1. They need to run at 60 frames per second on 60 Hertz to have smooth motion, were it not for the insane amounts of stuttering. This stuttering looks very much like an extremely severe case of microstutter, yet I only run a single GPU setup (1 x GTX 780 TI).  2. Running the games beyond 60 fps (either through disabling the vsync or running at higher Hz) make them look like a 30 fps game. It looks like the engine repeats every frame even though any framerate counter will state that the games run smoothly at any Hz rate the monitor is set. (eg. 100 fps on a 100 Hz display, but it looks exactly like running a constant 50 fps on 100 Hz.)  Both engine faults give me a headache when I try to play the games.  I've tried every 'fix' I could find on the internet (including disabling all HID devices, running at the lowest in-game graphics settings, adding command line parameters, setting processor affinity, using the resolution fix .dll, etc.) and none worked for me.  So I know this isn't much of a review of the game itself. It might be good, but I never got to experience it myself because of these technical issues which I admit being sensitive to. Therefore, I can hardly recommend the game, now can I? I did, after all, not have a fun time playing this game.  As such I feel I need to not recommend it. You might not have issues with it however, so keep that in mind. Yet, I still wanted to write these words of warning to those few people who might have issues with this game if smooth motion is kind of a must for them, or to those who loathe bad PC ports in general.
181	0	a	Bad controls, bad animations, bad dialog, bad ballence. This is a bad game. It's not ♥♥♥♥, it's not like i'm mad they got my money, it's just bad enough I wish I didn't own it because I'm not going to play it.
182	0	a	bad game for PC users. The game will crash all the time. Not werth the money. 
573	1	a	I think its a good game. But I think you get overpowerd sometimes. And the AI is not that good. I hope they fixed that in prototype 2. And when you have claws you can chop the to two I like that. Other then the AI pretty good game.
224	0	a	Janky Controls.  Decent Animation  
225	0	a	Awesome game overall, the superpowers, destruction and the city just feels great. The negative things about the game is that the pc port is bad. First of is the max resoltion is 720p. The shadows and graphics are outdated even if you compare it to other games made 2009. There is next to no no graphics options  Framerate problems Awful keyboard and mouse controls  Its a game worth playing, its just no advantage to play it on PC.
226	0	a	This game was a mess. The controls were really touchy and the lockon system was completely counter-intuitive and made it almost impossible to lockon the the target you really wantedmaking it feel like you pushed the buttons first then crossed your fingers and hoped your character moved the right way. The main character's powers were mediocre when used in battle, it was better to just steal enemy weapons and vehicles to fight with giving the feeling that his powers were more why he was hunted than what made him cool. The characters were unrelatable and the story , while it had a good premise, felt poorly executed. Add on that a half-dozen of the side quests were broken in an amazingly frustrating fashion and I have to say I'm suprised I finished the game at all.
227	0	a	After more than two hours of attempting, this would not run on my PC (Win 7, 64 bit, can run basically every game on Steam).  Activision no longer supports the game.   Buyer beware.
228	0	a	Non starter with my 4930K, SLI GTX970s and Win10 x64. not sure if I should refund my $2.... Oh well.....
229	0	a	This game sucks.
230	0	a	To the man who designed the final boss battle:  I would like to bang your head against a table untill you become paralized, then force you to watch as i surgically remove your organs, and feed it to your children in lazania.   I beat your ♥♥♥♥, now i hope that this scaring game will never be seen or played again.
231	0	a	Crashes upon starting a new game or loading a save
232	0	a	I must say that one of the final combat before the final boss did make me totally rage because it is incredibly hard. I never did it, so I never finished the game.  To do quick. The pros : The gameplay is seriously amazing, even if surreal. The open world is really nice. The possibility to absorb everybody is kinda cool too. The cons : The storyline is boring. The militaries are such noobs it's amazing they are still in the army. The final boss is not reachable (see my first paragraph). You cannot possibly love the main character (you do however can like the other characters, it's not a problem). The dialogues are soooo basic.  What is not a pro nor a con : You can kill everybody if you like. The violence really graphic and clear in the game. Not really safe for work.
233	0	a	Cool idea with great potential that's completely wasted.  Perhaps I've been spoiled by inFAMOUS, but I could not find this game enjoyable.
234	0	a	Terrible console port avoid getting it for the PC if you can.
575	1	a	Cutscenes are broken on Windows 7, frames are dropping very often but at least story and gameplay is good enough to make you play it. Play it first before Prototype 2 cos of huge spoilers. Better buy on 75% off sale.
240	0	a	dont buy if you're on windows 8 as there is no windowed mode and you will lag like hell. and no it is not coz i have a bad laptop as im able to play games like mirrors edge, borderlands saints row and other game witch are newer.
241	0	a	I have a tag in my steam library for 'Will Never Play Again'.  This game is the sole resident.  This game made me create this category.  If you must, play Prototype 2. It's better in every single respect.
242	0	a	Bored. If I could give it away I would.
243	0	a	Clearly prototyping was not involved in the development of this game or else it never would have been made.
577	1	a	7/10 GTA IV and Assassin's Creed got a baby. A cool baby that is. It's getting pretty dull too soon, because it's almost always the same, though...
249	0	a	No matter how much I struggled, fought, and screamed, this game would NOT run on my pc, which can play almost every game on Steam on max, or high settings at LEAST. The game would boot up at the wrong resolution, being a tiny box in the corner of my screen, with no way to make it fit despite my fiddling with the resolutions. So many things wrong with this game, I can't possibly type it all unless you want a page-long review. it runs SLOWWWWWW and just basically unplayable. Terrible purchase choice. Do NOT buy!!!!

250	0	a	I managed to get half-way through PROTOTYPE and ended up writing over my save file in an act of confusion, all because the developers made one of the worst PC ports I've ever played. There's no chance I'll be playing through all of this again anytime soon.  Here's the main issues I had with what would be an otherwise fun and enjoyable game:  • Shadows are completely nonexistent for those who have AMD graphic cards.  • It's impossible to continue without having the game crash. In order to fix this you need to start a new game with a new save, quit back to the main menu after the first cutscene, and then load your original save file. This is where I got confused, after not playing for so long, and managed to save over my old file.  • The volume in this game is extremely low. I play with headphones, for almost every game I'll usually set the volume to around 40% through the little controller on my headset. I find it hard to hear at 100% with PROTOTYPE, there's no other way to increase the volume.  There are no fixes for these issues, there's no FOV slider which would help with how claustrophobic the screen is. The developer went bankrupt and no one gives a ♥♥♥♥ about the people who bought this in such a broken state, so I insist you not waste your time and money or you'll only end up as frustrated as I am right now.
251	0	a	The story is uninspired and the main character is as bland as stale toast. The camera and the targetting are on the same stick so you will constantly find yourself in situations where you have to choose between panning the camera or getting a lock on something - only to have that target switch to yet another unlabeled target whether you have line of sight or not. You'll be ragdolled out of maneuvers constantly. This includes 'consuming' people to restore your health. This means you'll grab someone, start to eat them and have the animation interrupted by one of the dozen (at least) incoming attacks. Maybe it's a bulky melee hunter, maybe it's splash damage from the thirty-five missles and tank rounds, doesn't matter. Trying to restore health anywhere near an active battle (and the battle will follow you around corners, onto rooftops, and also see through your disguise instantly once the Super Soldiers enter the fight) is literally setting yourself up to be mauled. I'm lead to believe the studio that created this piece of ♥♥♥♥ went out of business. With the design decisions they made here I have to say everyone who plays videogames is better off.
252	0	a	Let me start off by saying that the concept of this game is amazing. Who doesn't dream of having super powers? Being able to run, jump, and glide across city blocks in the blink of an eye is quite the rush. On top of that, being able to shapeshift at will (as a disguise or to transform your body into devestating weaponry).  The problem for me is after about 10 hours of playtime, why am I struggling to find the will to continue playing?  There's a story, but it feels like a narrative that I'm unlocking rather than experiencing. It's completly mission-based. The game quickly turns into a free-roam-the-city-to-start-x-event. To become more powerful I destroy and kill everything. To complete missions I destroy and kill. To learn more about the story... destroy and kill. Let me put it another way... you get reports on how many kills you get and how much money you cost the military, and the higher these numbers are the better your score is.  I could really only reccomend this game to people who: a. Like GTA style games (maybe only those who really enjoy stealing tanks and trying to evade the police) or b. Are into the revenge genre
253	0	a	Horrible game. I cant compleat it because of glitches and controls
254	0	a	Broken ♥♥♥ sound problems if you are using an onboard sound card. Fixes found online just break other parts of game. Either way completely unplayble unless you like playing games completly muted.
255	0	a	Not the game, but the port is poor. I booted it up to have major sound issues where everyone talked so fast they sounded like a record skipping. This was atop poor resolution issues, and I coudln't get far enough to say if the controls were wonky or not. Don't buy unless you're willing to play tech support hero to make the game run.
256	0	a	Prototype has its ups and downs, but more downs that ups. The main character has some super fun super powers that allow you to do some really crazy things as you fly, jump, or run (horizontally and vertically) through the city.The game also looks pretty good. The story seems really fascinating as well, but that's about where the good ends.   First off, the city gets pretty boring pretty quickly as there is nothing really unique about the city that makes any part of the city look any different from another part. I found myself just following the quest markers on the mini map and not trying to learn the city at all. I never knew where I was unless I pulled up the main map. There are lots of cool powers, but when the fights get going you are so busy running around trying to stay alive and kill that you never really get any time to really bask in the fun of watching a cool ability when it is triggered.   The main negative is that it appears that the controls for the PC port didn't translate properly. The keyboard presses are super sensitive. I've been using this keyboard for a few years and dozens of games, so I am comfortable with it, but I never had such problems with the keyboard in any other game than I did with Prototype. To top it off there was no sweetspot for mouse sensitivity either. Either it took HUGE hand sweeps to turn left and right, with the mouse, or my camera would go sitr crazy at the slightest twitch when trying to adjust the sensitivity. Also y-axis sensitivity was way more sensitive than the x-axis.    As a result, I could barely control my character as I bounced off walls, hitting things, or attacking things except the actual mob I had selected as my target. My character looked cool going bat crap crazy all over the fight zone, but if this game had been real life, the people I was fighting would have thought I was an idiot as they easily gunned me down, which is what happened during game play very often. I eventually got so ultra ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at the lack of character control that I finally quit and removed the game from my system. Experiencing the story wasn't enough of a draw to make me spend many frustrating hours getting killed constantly and wander through a boring city. I'll read the story on Wikipedia or something.
257	0	a	I really want to like this game, but can't. The idea is great and your 'super powers' are awesome and so fun to use. But the difficulty level is all over the place, some missions are extremely simple while others are extremely hard. And the combat... Everytime you take a hit you get stunned for a while, so you often find yourself taking a chain of hits which you can't do anything about. It makes some missions extremely frustrating.  Try Saints Row 4 instead. It has taken the super powers from Prototype but removed the frustrating parts of the gameplay.
258	0	a	Unplayable one of the worst ports I have ever played. Solid 13 fps no matter what the settings even on the menu's, audio was skipping in cut scene's and some resolution bug ment I had to play it in 720p. Screw looking for fixes just going to get a refund for this and Protoype 2 which wouldn't even start just kept getting prototype2.exe has stopped working. Maybe its because I have ATI/AMD graphics but even if you have Nvidia don't support this game.
259	0	a	The Prototype 1 Better game but  i wait for prototype 2 but now it took me feel bad for that game   
260	0	a	having never gotten around to playing this game i was really looking forward to playing it, always looked interesting and im sure it would have been fun to play!  had i been able to get in the damn game, whenever i tried to get into it it crashed.  oh sure i could get into the title screen and settings, but what good does that do me?  save yourself the money and buy a game you CAN play.  and yes my pc should be able to run it, i checked the specs, if it can run things like fallout and games like it at maz graphics and such, this should run fine, it just doesnt
261	0	a	Get Saints Row 4 instead. Or Just Cause 2 even.
262	0	a	PC version is complete trash if you have a higher memory video card.
263	0	a	The most I've ever disliked a sandbox game. Boring, tedious and stupid.
264	0	a	Great game, tons of fun when I played it a long time ago on a rig with Windows Vista. But if you have Windows 7 or later, forget about this game because it will be nothing but god awful trouble getting it to run, which is why I voted to not recommend it. If you do, have a xbox 360 controller to play this because if you use a mouse and keyboard it stutters horribly. If you have Win7 or higher, go for Prototype 2. And use a wired xbox 360 controller for that too because using keyboard and mouse also causes stuttering in that game as well.
265	0	a	Buy Prototype 2 instead. The original is a terrible game - as the game progresses, they use more and more cheap methods to prevent you from getting your attacks off - interrupt upon interrupt upon interrupt. Your targeting seems to target the WORST possible targets, no matter what weapon you use. Again, this happens more and more as the game progresses. This game sucks. Prototype 2 on the other hand, is a fantastic game.  Don't buy this stinker. Save your money, and use it to buy Prototype 2.
266	0	a	Don't buy this.   Lots of consolitis in this one. A camera that wants to do its own thing and frequent slow character animations that take you out of the gameplay. Third-person platforming. Enemy AI is terrible, and enemies just spawn around you rather than following a sensible path through the city. There is no persistence to the game world, making the missions to clean up the city completely pointless. The missions themselves are repetitive. Ends in a frustrating final boss fight,
267	0	a	DO. NOT. BUY.  Barely runs on many computers because it's poorly optimized. I can run Crysis 3 on HIGH but not this on low.
268	0	a	Would be a decent game if the bosses weren't ridiculously overpowered, the game has many bugs one being that it crashes A LOT. Meaning you have to restart A LOT of missions because you can't save during them.  I appreciate it's an old game but come on, it can't be this bloody awful.
269	0	a	Runs like ♥♥♥♥ and the work around to get it to a point that's playable is stupid. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.
270	0	a	this ♥♥♥♥ too old for 2016 ♥♥♥♥♥ ayy lmao xDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
271	0	a	been stuck on the loading screen for 127 minutes now, hopefully it comes around
272	0	a	&gt; Repetitive Gameplay  &gt; Boring Story  &gt; Good Level Design  &gt; Compatent Optimization  &gt; Gross Textures  Not even worth it for free.
273	0	a	A total waste of Time and Money... But hey, I have a lot of fun throwing cars at innocent people yes. 'Had'
274	0	a	Bored... :( ... Timepass Game
579	1	a	Welcome to Manhattan Island, New York. Your name, Alex Mercer, protagonist. Roaming the city with a fractured memory, he finds himself not quite what he used to be. Infected with an unknown virus and hunted by the Marines &amp; an insidious Lab called Gentek Alex must survive in order to learn what happened to him. As he progresses throughout the infected city, he learns that the pathogen quickly assimilates every living cell in the human body, even the clothes he wears which makes him virtually the perfect shape shifter. He tracks down his sister &amp;s an old girlfriend who helps him along the way only to find out he does not like what he remembers. In this game you’ll be able to disguise yourself and infiltrate Top Secret Military bases, gain control of Massively Armored Thermobaric Tanks &amp; Fully Weaponized Air Gunships like the AH-64D Apache. Customize Melee/Combo attacks, Upgrade weapons and body armor, this game a lot to offer.
279	0	a	This is pretty much the worst copycat game I have ever played. And there are some pretty crappy copycat games out there. I'm sure for those of you who haven't played InFamous, it was great, but please, for the love of tater chips, play InFamous. The series so much better. And no, I'm not saying this because the graphics are terrible. I've been in love with InFamous since the first one.
280	0	a	I don't really like the controls or narative style of games like this, what i call openworld sandbox games(red faction, infamous, GTA, etc) I only played the intro and turned it off. Feels and looks super dated now.
281	0	a	Don't buy it unless your PC has only 1 CORE WITHOUT MULTITHREADING Or if you want to spend all day on the BIOS configuring stuff for this game to work :/
282	0	a	Prototype is an action-adventure open world game. You are Alex Mercer, a man without memory armed with amazing superhuman powers and the option to go most anywhere you like and do most anything you want once you get there. A virus outbreak has claimed Manhattan, forcing the island into a military quarantine. The infected citizens turning the population into mutants. The main story path is entirely linear. The missions are a sloppy mix of poorly paced ideas. Long missions involve simply going from one end of Manhattan to the other, while some of the short missions are climactic sieges and battles. Missions can be brutally challenging, often because of the uncooperative auto-lock system. Boss battles are much longer than they need to be and more often test your endurance rather than your skill. As you work your way through the game, you will earn experience points that can be used to unlock new and ever more exotic powers. Experience points are also the only thing you get by finding collectibles. The graphics are not the best, buildings and environments are ugly, so the world is not a place you want to explore.  All in all, the awful boring and repeating missions and linear gameplay ruins the overall experience.  Sounds 5/10 Graphics 5/10 Gameplay 6/10 Atmosphere 5/10  If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:  http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides   http://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curation 
283	0	a	Edgy McEdgeface runs up buildings, 'assassinates' dudes (by brutally beating the to a pulp in front of his enemies) while zombies, hulking behemoths and attack helicopters chase him down.  That's not even a mission - just a normal day in New York. Sounds like fun, was fun when I was edgy enough to enjoy it and unlock most of the powers but soon enough it just becomes a slightly worse version of GTA.  Between the graphics and samey gameplay, I cannot recommend this game while it's more than £4
284	0	a	I had hear about this game and I saw the offer 75%, so I brough it to try out...It very boring.  Waste of time.
285	0	a	Bad pc port  Just like gta iv  screw this män
286	0	a	i want refound
287	0	a	Does not work on pirated versions of windows, would not reccomend

583	1	a	This game is hard when you are almost at the end of the game.   This is a game that you ALWAYS grab stuffs &amp; throw at the boss. If you want to melee on the boss he always hit you HARD than you hit him.... you mostly die if you melee boss. good luck  If you want good challenge this is your game.  
585	1	a	It's an open world game where you run faster than the cars. I've been wanting this since Vice City.  I really like the action in this game. There's a good variety of weapons, some of them (the ones growing out of Mercer) have very wide move sets, which expand as the game goes on. The combat overall feels tightly paced, what with all the recovery animations and slow-mo, but I never really felt it was overdone. There's a nice bit of escallation, too, with both the mutants and the army getting a bit sillier with every chapter, and you getting new powers to deal with them.
587	1	a	Awesome Gameplay, First Prototype and Even Prototype 2 Stays the Same I LOVE IT, Great Menus and Transitions.
589	1	a	Finshed the game and wanting more.   9/10 for great gameplay, I really liked the powers Alex Mercer has especially that whip power. The whip power gets me to helicopters, and gets me to attack far away enemies. The parkour also looked great, but I've seen better.   6/10 for the story, I wasn't that clinged to the story. I didn't even watch the scenes. I just waited for the objective and do it, no questions asked.  It's really an old game but it's really entertaining because of the open world and killing lots of civilians for no good reason. I recommend you t buy this game when it's on sale. I think I bought mine with the Prototype 2 which I'm gonna play some time after this. To sum up, 7/10 for the game, buy it on sale along with Prototype 2, so you can continue the story or like me just play another open world game and kill lots of people. Again, 7/10, and buy it on sale. :D
591	1	a	Sound glitch is common  havent played much but is fun so far
593	1	a	Very odd controls for keyboards and mouses, it gets pretty horrific at times with how awkward switching infected modes can be. Overall though, a solid game. Main character wears a tough jacket and has a surly name. He goes around and eats people to sustain his big Elizabeth Greene butt-kicking muscles. What's not to like?
595	1	a	Choose your weapon!!!
597	1	a	Better than any GTA title.
599	1	a	I played on console, and I liked just buy it for that. Pretty interesting game.
296	0	a	The game is a glitchy hunk of junk. Frankly you will be lucky if you can get it to work.
601	1	a	reminds me of ultimate spiderman, where you play as Venom, but better! if you like blowing things up and mass distruction.... this game is for you.
603	1	a	One of the best games I've ever played. Intense plotline, crazy combat, and freeroam. Different superpowers to choose from, guns, tanks, no driving cars but you can throw them...Company went out of business but I still recommend supporting the game.
605	1	a	Turned into a woman and through a guy off a building. 10/10 would be a feminazi again.
607	1	a	pretty good
609	1	a	this is a amazing game try to get it
611	1	a	Runs great on my system (Windows 7 x 64, 8Gig HD 6670). Frame rate is great during game play. At first it would have the sound and graphic hiccups everyone else is talking about but for me all those problems went away as soon as I turned off vsync so I would suggest that be the first thing you try if you have the sound/graphics problems.
613	1	a	This game is EPIC. I love how you can porh your limbs into weapons and hijack vehicles(except for civilian ones). The story is great. I highly reccomend this game for anyone. The only thing I don't like about this game is the graphics, but that's just becaue this is an older game. But it's fun all the same. There is an enormous twist at the end...heh, heh heh, play it and you'll find out.  Useful tips: When it gets too difficult, hijack tanks and light up your target. Never use choppers against bosses, they'll just throw one thing at you, and the heli will come crashing down.
615	1	a	Easy to play, hard to master sandbox action game. You have a lot of superpower and freedom to eat everyone in the city. However, it can be dull at times especially because there are too many movements to master (and they are not that easy!) and the movement can be chaotic. During the battle, it's even worse, you will be attacked by nonstop armies and hunters.   Prototype is a good and enjoyable game, however its execution is flawed. I still like it though because there are not too many games that give you freedom to jump high (and hover) on skyscrapers.
617	1	a	Great fun game to play. You get to be ausome and do heaps of cool fighting moves. Best to play with an xbox controller. A good port to teh PC and easy to get teh hang off.  Good storyline and graphics arent bad considering this game is a few years old. If you can get it on special its woth the money. Also quite long so you will get heaps out of it.
619	1	a	Good Game Of Fighting And Stuff It Can Be Cheaty But Im Not Here To Complain So Over All I Have A Mixed Review But Recomend It 8.5 Stars Outa 10 It Just Has Moments But Its Still fun And Worth It
621	1	a	I've come to call this 'Assassin's Creed: Imma Eviscerate and Eat You edition.' Drags a bit in the middle, but overall a fun sandbox murderfest.
623	1	a	who wouldn't want to drop kick a tank?
625	1	a	Great game for anyone who like action and hack and slash types, alot like devil may cry but much more brutal ';.;'
627	1	a	Game has a highly considerable chance of not working at all, be cautious.
629	1	a	Nothing quite so liberating a mowing down slow walking normals while trying to save NYC from itself.
631	1	a	Crap port, good game. Certainly one of the more entertaining mass-murder simulators I've played. How many games have you played where you can kill and old lady, eat her, take on her form, run up the tallest building in the city and perform a dive bomb that turns half a city block into jam?
633	1	a	Overall a fun game.    The story is basically resident evil.. virus outbreak although unlike it you are insanely overpowered even on hard diff..    I like the fact that you fight both the military and the infected however the AI on the military is just sad you can literally do the most insane ♥♥♥♥ right in front of them and they won't react never mind the fact that you are obviously not human or that you are supposed to be a 'priority target' even if you do get in trouble you can kill all of them or evade them without much of a struggle.    The infected are even less of a threat then the military. Once you learn the move set of the enemy they become closer to tedious then to a challenge including what is supposed to be bosses which just take more time to kill and are still easy to evade sins you are extremely fast.    Apart from the protagonist characters somehow don't feel complete.    The gameplay is pretty cool. Basically you are very fast and agile. Most of the time you will be jumping from one rooftop to another. Has a good variety of weapons and powers and you can even steal tanks and helicopters from the military and use them to your advantage. The stealth system is just about the only thing i dislike in the gameplay sins all the NPC's are blind, deaf and suffer from a rare disorder in which their mind goes blank and forget everything every 5 seconds or they might as well be in a coma.    I'd go ether way with the recommendation depends on what you want to play.  Even with all the issues it has it is still fun to go fight endless waves of enemies and see how long you are going to last. That is until you learn how to heal up fast and that the waves are not actually endless...
635	1	a	This is a game that really shows it's age. AI is pretty poor. Storytelling method is pretty cool but the story itself is kind of a mess, with random event after event making a shaky framework to tie the missions together. No real character development ever, which just makes it so funny when they reveal Mercer's sins and try to paint him as a tragic victim after he brutally murders and eats thousands of people. The dialogue is almost laughably cliche sometimes. Controls can be pretty finnicky resulting in some frusterating moments.   Dispite that, it's quite fun to play. You get an aresenal of powers, and you get to be a sort of antihero as you run around town killing people and fighting abominations. I think the central game mechanics are pretty solid and well executed, and that was enough for me to play it through and reccomend it.
637	1	a	I enjoyed the freeroam platforming nature of the game. Like GTA with superpowers but I had some issues with the cutscenes not downloading properly.
639	1	a	Fun game, must play esp with $10 price. Looking forward for Prototype 2!
641	1	a	I would recommend this to anyone who loves free-roam games, blood, strong violence and just all out mayhem!  An amazing tutorial which pretty much puts you in god mode at the beginning of the game so you can learn the controls which are extremely easy to use! Rich and telling storyline which keeps you gripped all the way to the very end.  Alex Mercer is probably the best Antogonist/Protagonist ever!! 9/10 (Grenade launcher spam at the later stages is quite annoying)
643	1	a	This is by far one of the most amazing games I've played. I really like it!
645	1	a	A great game, really. Your'e able to distort your body to form weapons (claws, armor, wrecking balls for hands, etc), and then tear people up God Of War style. Free roaming, similar to Grand Theft Auto. Run around killing people for hours for the hell of it, or advance the plot. Really fun game, maybe a little short. You can get through the main plot line in about 13-15 hours, depending on how much trouble you have with bosses near the end.
647	1	a	Open world with a nice plot, great mixture of pure badassness and stealth and generally fun.
649	1	a	Very hard game. But really enjoyed it.
651	1	a	This is what I think when I play this game: HOLY ♥♥♥♥ THIS GAME IS BEAUTIFUL! 10/10 IGN
653	1	a	A really good game with not bad graphics Pros: Awesome gameplay and performance A nice idea for parkour A very interesting story Intence gameplay Fell free to do ANYTHING JUST PLAY IT AND SEE  cons: just one: the story is not big but thereare many events to complete   Anyway,never played a game like this before Overall 10/10 for sure
655	1	a	best open world game for: action and stress relieving.
657	1	a	Destruction, havoc, carnage, massacre, murder, bloodbath are the best words to describe this game.  If you enjoy gratuitously murdering ficticial people in multiple exaggerated ways or hate military forces you'll love this masterpiece.
659	1	a	Apart from all the audio glitches during cutscenes, this game was alright.
661	1	a	Very Good Game, Addicting, Lots to do and Open-World which a lot of people like and awesome powers and abilities.
663	1	a	AMD GRAPHICS CARD/ PROCESSOR USERS ATTENTION!!!!!!!!!  Yes this game is awesome. max 40 frames for us.   AMD radeon 290x   AMD FX 8320 8 core 3.5 mhz
298	0	a	Nothing but gratuitous killing. Where's my refund?
665	1	a	I guess I am late to the game but WOW...
667	1	a	For 2000s game, It is perfect.
669	1	a	awesome game play it guys
671	1	a	Prototype is probably one of the best games I have ever come across! The powers are amazing,the abilities are awesome,and the story....oh the story! You also kinda get feels when you play as Mercer for a while......*sniff*.....anyways,get this game! Throw cars! Eat people! Whip Helicopters! Kill everyone!  Hunt.  Kill.  Consume.   Become..... 
673	1	a	Who doesn't want to be a one-man army of mass destruction completely capable of spreading across the city like some kind of plague or disease?
675	1	a	One of the best game I ever played. I totally recommend this game :)
677	1	a	6.8/10 would throw a car on a chopper again,,,
679	1	a	So damn fun!!!!!!!!! And runs SO smooth. Great definately recommend it to all.
681	1	a	Man aids gets real bad in the future. It gives you god damn super powers.
683	1	a	This game is friggin awesome. If you like mass killing, fun, destruction, apocalypse games, this is the game for you. The game may be a little old, but it'll sure entertain you.
685	1	a	Play this on anything but easy and ur in for a challange but overall epic game plus fun on herd gameplay
687	1	a	The graphics are dated, but if you are looking for a parkour smashemup game this is gobs of fun! Think of this as Assassins Creed meets Venom.
689	1	a	Dismemberment, impalement and slaughter of innocents. Also, karate kicks to helicopters as Penny Arcade so aptly put it.
691	1	a	Want to be wonder woman, batman, superman, x man, the flash and hellboy at the same time? Than prototype is just for u
693	1	a	A long time ago....  It was the great action game.  May the force be with you.
695	1	a	Take all the powers of the various zombies from L4D/L4D2.  Shove them into one cranky little hoodrat.  Give said hoodrat amnesia and a serious hate-on for public property and the military.  Proceed to Parkour destructively around an infected NYC.  ????  [PROTOTYPE.]
697	1	a	It's basically a Steam port of Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction
699	1	a	BEFORE I REVIEW! If you are having FPS problems. Try this. 1.) Open Device manager. 2.) Start DISABLING, and not DELETING your HIDs. (Aka the ones that look like 'HID-compliant ~etc) 3) Re-enable them after you stop playing.  This fixed my issue. Hopefully it fixes yours, should you have it. &lt;3  Review: Pros: + Combat is absolutely brillaint.  + Gameplay feels smooth. + Things despawn at a very slow rate. For example: You can set a helicopter down at one end of the map. Run to another end and back and find it right where you left it. + You have character appropriate abilities. + Violent, and gory. Very, very graphic. (If you enjoy gory games.) + There's an option to replay the campaign with previous campaigns unlocks. &lt;3  Cons: - Graphics are a little dated. Max resolution is 1280/800. - Story is short, and a little lacking. - Entire game is essentially a copy of Radical's: 'The Incredible Hulk. Ultimate Destruction.' - Very gory, and violent. (If you dislike, or are disturbed by gore.) - Voice acting was bad. (Though better than the second game, I will mention.) - End game feels repetitive. You run around killing the same hunters, soldiers. Destroying the same bases, and hives. After you're fully upgraded. End game Prototype feels a lot like endgame GTA. You just run around and kill things.  If you played the Hulk Game I mentioned in the Cons. Then realizing the fact that it was essentially copy pasted from that game will ruin most the experience for you. Though if it is on sale. I would pick it up.
701	1	a	Ever wanted to run around New York like spider man but kill random ppl like GTA here's your game.
703	1	a	Game play is very well. And overpower.♥♥
705	1	a	This game is so great. So fun. So much action, chaos, powers, jumping, destruction. I love it. Period.
707	1	a	There is nothing like having the power to manipulate your body to become an ultimate weapon. During gameplay, as you progress, you get to purchase new abilities as well as enhance already purchased abilities. You can use a shield, whips, blade arms, muscle enhancement, full body armor, disguise yourself as your last victim, the possibilities are endless. Run really fast down streets or up buildings, glide for short distances through the air, smash down to the ground and deliver max damage. Yes this is the game for you if you want total destruction. As you progress the game gets more difficult to match your current abilities...come on you can handle it....you are Alex Mercer!!
709	1	a	One of my all time favourite games. Sequel is also very good. Extremely enjoyable gameplay, doesn't shy away from making you overpowered. But keeps it interesting. Great concept behind it. Kind of like some kind of venom/carnage character. My vote for 'Needs another sequel' award in the steam nominations. A sequel nearly ten years on would be unbelievable.
711	1	a	so much blood :D
713	1	a	Karate kicked a helicopter. Elbow dropped a tank. Killed a policeman by throwing his car at him. Killed another helicopter by throwing an old woman at it. Ate 354,729 zombies. I regret nothing.
715	1	a	Good game with an intresting story and intresting plot-twists. I wouldn't call it a masterpiece but definetly a worthwhile game to kill time.
717	1	a	Despite the Resoultion and the crappy story that doesn't seem to make sense the game is just so fun to play and screw around with thanks to the crazy abilites. Besides what other game allows you to pick up a random person on the street and power stomp them for health
719	1	a	I love Prototype. So much fun. 9/10
721	1	a	This game is ridiculously awesome :D
723	1	a	The game is really, really, very unique and interesting.... I love it!
725	1	a	This game has you as a person who can morph his arms into claws, hammers and ♥♥♥♥. What else do you want?
727	1	a	Great graphics, engine, gameplay, sound. It really brings in the darkside, you know? Can't wait til I get the 2nd game :)
729	1	a	one of the best open world games i have ver played aside from just cause 2.Your a god with the powers every human has ever wished in a massive open world new york city,Well at least thast what the box says,in reality your alex mercer a normal person abducted by genko as one of there test subjects and you gain powers that in my opinion are great but you do have to unlock evolution points to get most of the weapons/powers that you have.As you progress through the game Alex becomes more powerfull and does awesome moves,which isnt a bad thing but by that point your as they said on the box:a God so that is the only issue i have with this magnificent game overall,8/10.I would reccomend this to all gamers.
731	1	a	This game....is one of the few AAA titles that rolled out in its time that was not only difficult (to a degree), but wasn't awful. Sometimes I still install and play me a little bit of Prototype. Unfortunately, the IP has been cancelled for all further sequels; Prototype 2 was barely able to release, as this decision occurred before Prototype 2 went for sale.   Prototype 2 is a nice conclusion and I suggest picking up both games. This one, however, has you as Alex Mercer, and as you go through the plot, you find you can 'play the villain' recklessly and enjoyably to kick off your after work stress.
733	1	a	surrealistic dealy dangerous and vilent, stealth and a good storyline, you are the infection. evolve and conquer
735	1	a	Ever had such a crappy day that you wanted to blow up Manhattan? You can do that here.
737	1	a	Gameplay works, it's fun as hell and the powers are inventive. Your effectly 'The Thing' you able to perfectly replicate any person and your body can be shaped and twised into devestating weapons on the fly. Along with that, Movement is smooth and responsive, besides a few hiccups, it was after all one of the games that defined the super hero sandbox. The story, though bland gets the job done, but it's what had me stop playing. Don't get me wrong, it's a good game and worth the 20 bucks if you buy it not on sale, it's just I could not buy the protangoists 'anti-hero' angle the story was trying the sell me...which causes the rest to fall apart as they attempted to make the enemies you fight 'Blackwatch' so sterotypcially evil might as well give them snidely whiplash mustaches and kick puppies. To be fair I am only 13 hours into the game so I don't know how far I got into the story, but still..I am recomending it as game to buy..just that little problem I had with the story stacked up enough to where I didn't want to play anymore. Eh maybe someday I can come back and complete it.
739	1	a	Awesome game, it reminds me of the Spiderman games, more so Web of Shadows than the other games. It's fluid in controls and really fun to play. There's multiple aspects to the game and it lets you create your own playstyle. Like sensing your opponents and then bashing their heads in? It has that. Like blindly slicing your way through crowds for fun? It has that. Do you like shooting people? It has that too. There's a variety of different ways to play and it lets you choose your own style which I like a lot. The different power-ups and upgrades alone are what should keep you playing, with each added power it gives you more freedom to do things the way you want to.
741	1	a	Best Action EVER ...
743	1	a	To start, the port of the game is acceptable. The game's highest resolution setting is 720p, and the graphics certainly aren't very impressive for a 2009 PC game. InFAMOUS looks better on PS3 really, and it came out at the exact same time. I played this game with a controller, so I can not tell you if the mouse and keyboard controls work well. The controls with a controller are alright. They aren't as precise as I'd like, but their good enough to keep the gameplay enjoyable. I experienced a couple crashes, but the game was fairly stable overall.  The gameplay is better than the port and is a nice bit of mindless fun. You can slice, throw, crush, and consume people by the dozen. The homicidal maniac within the player will have a blast butchering helpless soldiers for quite a while. However, eventually your inner homicidal maniac will realize there's nothing else to do but kill kill kill, and he or she will begin to grow tired of the indiscriminate mass murder. You'll probably reach this point before you finish the game, especially after half the enemies become super soldiers, large mutants, tanks, and various other enemies that will knock you about stunning you constantly and throwing you around like a baseball among a group of American children. Getting around the city is quite enjoyable. There's just something satisfying about jumping 50 feet into the air and gliding around New York, but this also begins getting old with time.   The story is forgetable, but if you're buying a game where you play as a superpowered mass murderer for story, then you're clearly looking in the wrong place.  This game fills a good few hours with hack and slash joy, but outstays its welcome. I'd recommend you get it on sale.
745	1	a	Running up walls is fun. 6/10
747	1	a	This game is game beyond gods, it's is action packed with a bit of difficulty. The story is amazing and gameplay is better. The abilities, weapons, creatures, everything! This game is just amazing! The only downside I think is that there are some very difficult parts, but I guess I'm just bad. :P 10/10 I recommend this game!
749	1	a	Orchestrated destruction and elbow dropping on helicopters.
751	1	a	Prototype is a game where you play as Alex Mercer, a scientist turned mutant who has god like powers, this game very much reminds me of Assassin's Creed and it feels like it to. I have thoroughly enjoyed playing this game and the random violence can prove a good substitute for some of the animation bugs; a good game in general.
753	1	a	its ♥♥♥♥ing awesome
755	1	a	It is cooll running on the streets breaking everything... Hehehehe
757	1	a	Batman meets Resident Evil... in a good way
759	1	a	pure visceral fun for the sheer sake of fun. Amazingly addictive sandbox mayhem.
761	1	a	The game plays in New York where a virus broke out. You play as Alex Mercer who lost his mind. He's also infected and he has some special abilites or rather mutations. You can move free around New York and must complete missions. You can also upgrade yourself with exp which you are gaining through fights. I like the movment you can jump high and upgrade your abilites so that you can even fly a short time and it's just awesome to move from one skyscraper to another :D  This is a really cool game and even after you finished this game you can still move around the city and play just for fun. :)
763	1	a	This is only a first impression, but from what I have played, this game is what you get if you take the concept of Kirby and suck every last ounce of innocence out of it. Not to mention adding a whole lot of bloody mess rather then clean 'inhaling' as it were.   Its -kinda- typical third persion actiony title, but the fact that you're a Parkour People Eater (My offical term for Alex Mercer) gives it that different edge that keeps it interesting. The fact you can be jumping from rooftop to rooftop one moment, to sneaking past security by eating someone with the right clearence the next, and then hacking your way through horrible monstrosities with your giant claw arms after that keeps the game interesting and enjoyable.
765	1	a	ONE WORD: unbelieveably VIOLENT and FUN....was my favorite game until i discovered elder scrolls V: skyrim....the thing skyrim has over this is more plot and detail and the ability to mod, which i dont think prototype is a good choice for modding anyway, considering how EPICLY OP your character already is :D
767	1	a	Pros: - Great freedom like in GTA or Carmageddon. - You can go or fly wherever you want.  Cons: - Boring storyline. - After 3 or 4 hours repetitive gameplay.  If you want to fly above the city and have absolute power, this game will give you that. I encourage you to buy this only on 75% discount.  PS: I finished the game in 6.2 hours.
769	1	a	this is insanely a great game. It will challenge you quiet a lot come later in the game, especially when you have to fight some of the harder bosses in the late game - even with almost every upgrade possible unlocked I still died multiple damn times on the last few bosses cause of their power and being targeted by over hundreds of things at once (&gt;.&lt;). I would 100% recommend people to get this game, especially since it's on sale!! Makes it even 200x's better that it's on sale :D
771	1	a	Enjoy a great sense of freedom as you run through the plague infested streets with an arm turned into a sword. Violent action, conspiracy and apocalypse awaits you in this awesome game with an equally awesome sequel(Prototype 2) awaiting you after you've completed it .
773	1	a	22 hours to beat.  if u have a 360 controller and a good gaming rig then :   Holy wow... just WOW!
775	1	a	I love this game more than I probably should. Normally, I'm really not into games with massive violence potential, but I've fallen in love with Prototype's characters. The moral dilemmas and irony are golden, enough to spur me into writing a ton of fanfiction for the game. Haha, yes, I'm a fangirl. Cower in fear before my rabies.  Anyway, Alex Mercer is a badass, and there is something wrong with you if you don't enjoy jumping over Manhattan like everything's a giant trampoline, via what parkour wants to be when it grows up. So if you're not too squeamish, check Prototype out.
777	1	a	This game's alright, can be abit boring at times but if you're looking for action and adventure, this is the game for you.
779	1	a	Awesome! I allway's wanted this game, but now i know it's on Steam! I really recomend this game, and thanks Activision for making it
781	1	a	AMAZING GAME, 'nuff said. It has full controller support. I mean, other than the loading bug, everything's pretty epic! Run up and across walls, glide through the air, alter your body to take on enemies and Military Vehicles, it's totally insane! I highly recommend this to any sandbox/action lovers, especially those of you that played SR4. Pretty interesting story, bits and pieces are unlocked as you consume targets. Disguise yourself and sneak into a military base today! (Or when it's on sale, which would be far preferable.)
783	1	a	Fun if you can get past some of the more infuriating points of the gameplay. I don't think I've ever raged at a game as hard as I have this one. It's worth it though. Go on a rampage and destroy everything. See how far across the city you can throw random civilians. Eat those same civilians for health.  Scream obsecnities when you get caught in that stupid obnoxious melee combo that Hunters use. Hate the game because animation canceling doesn't work unless you're an NPC.  Don't forget to abuse the blade arm on tanks, super soldiers, and hunters. Works best from the air.  7/10
785	1	a	Prototype is an action packed, fun, open world, experience. The game mixes awesome free running, with superpowers! Although, there are many issues with the PC version of the game, the game is still quite enjoyable.
787	1	a	If you enjoy destruction, this is the game for you. Prototype is a very versatile game that also gives you the ability to build your characters atributes the way you want. The end game is hilarious due to the fact that you are untouchable.
789	1	a	Hey, very good game for this price (5 €) ! The first hours of discover are so pleasurable. It's a little bit repetitive once you understand the mechanics, yet graphics/sounds/musics are very good and the scenario is exciting. You have full liberty in the way you advance in the story. There's a lot of side missions available beside main ones. The whole city of New-York is modeled and you can find missions everywhere in there. You can spend a lot of time before getting bored, but ... some could get bored before finishing the main scenario. A little bit repetitive I told you ;)  Whatever, for the actual price, it's a must have. I may not have been recommanding this at 60€/$80, but at 5 €, there's absolutely no reason not to jump on it very fast.
791	1	a	i will recomende this game to any one its fun and a very griping storyline
793	1	a	love this game
795	1	a	Pure action
797	1	a	Want to become a super-villain terrorizing a city full of civilians, military personnel and infected? Want to hijack choppers mid-air and blow up some hives and military bases? Want to park near Central Park with a tank/apc and kill everything in sight? Want to pose as a military officer and just shoot infected while civilians run like scared little children?  If you answered yes to any one of the above questions, you should get this. If you didn't, you are not fun at all and you should read Fun Manual 101!
799	1	a	this game is a lot of fun, but the missions and combat can get pretty repetitive after awhile. if i have a complaint its that instead of the challenges getting progressively harder, essentially they just throw more bad guys in the frame. i bought this heavily discounted, so i dont feel ripped off at all. i will probably buy the sequel when the price drop kicks in on it as well.   its extemely fun, but i havent felt the need to replay since i finished it. all in all, a better than average experience.
801	1	a	A bit short, but good. Damn, it's fun to be the monster! :D Also annoying gameplay, but the story is worth the pain :)
803	1	a	Loving this one.
805	1	a	The game is pretty average. Graphics are not the highest quality and it has poor characterization and i never felt connected to characters throughout the game. However the weapon variety was fun and kept me playing. The open-world is also fun, running around destroying everything in sight is always fun. The storyline is pretty boring, but is a good length. Gameplay however is extremely fun and one of the reasons it was a good game.   7/10- great gameplay, ♥♥♥♥ storyline
807	1	a	A game to play when you feel like being a nearly unstoppable killing machine that consumes people for health, breaks tanks like they were made out of plywood, and terrorise a city. Or, if you're fed up with games with moral choice systems and don't want to have to put up with that random NPC that just insulted you, and would rather punch them from one side of the street to the other. Or if you want the freedom that comes from traversing a city in minutes on foot.  Oh man, I'm hungry...
809	1	a	Yeah, ♥♥♥♥♥! Como molarl
811	1	a	the only things i have to say about this game is SICK SICK SICK SICK SICK SICK SICK
813	1	a	Good stuff. Some of the boss battles were pretty tough, especially the last one. I like the protagonist of the first game much more than the second one, but the government conspiracy story about viruses is good in both of these. I'd say Umbrella has something to learn from Gentek if you know what I mean.
815	1	a	Absolutely badass fun.
817	1	a	Genetic engineering gone out of control provoked New York to enter a state of quarentine. You find yourself in the role of Alex Mercer, a man without memory, and the Prototype. You can change your form and perform vicious combos against whoever want to opose you on your search for the truth.  Excellent controls, excellent art and a perfect open world setting in the city every man has grown to love. An excellent third-person sci-fi experience.
819	1	a	The story is kind of cliché, but the gameplay is absolutely fantastic, very rewarding and fun.  I played this game with a 360 controller and my index fingers were seriously hurting near the end of the game hahaha
821	1	a	Sort of ridiculous, sort of ridiculously fun. Lots of criticisms comparing it to Infamous and other games. Really, it's a good sandbox super powered game with villains, conspiracies, biowarfare, and an amoral inhuman protagonist.   I've had a ridiculous amount of fun with it anyway.  The only caveat is the end-boss is ridiculously unenjoyable.
823	1	a	I still don't get if Im the bad guy or the good guy o.O killed infected and the military :3 lolwut.
825	1	a	A great sandbox game with a ton of amazing powers. It's really great to just log in and kill people.
827	1	a	This game is an epic kill-everything-you-see sandbox game, with one problem - if you have a GTX 680 then the game won't properly detect it and you'll be limited to 1200x800. I've emailed nVidia about this as it's a driver thing probably but we'll see.
829	1	a	controls unintuitive and hard to get used to, despite the controls game play is excellent. Story is disjointed so far due to how the game is set up.   worth a play but not a full price  overall - 4/5
831	1	a	Play it for the story or just to go on a homicidal rampage. You can grab people and run up the sides of buildings, hold them over the edge and watch them struggle before you either A consume them with your tendrils or B chuck them hundreds of feet, leap over the edge and freefall to the sidewalk, then just tear up the city just cause if you did that in real life while awesome, most people frown upon it. Run through traffic vaulting over cars and flip throw one at an elderly person. Why? Cause you can
833	1	a	Run around a city and explode people. Pretty fun.
835	1	a	Large open city and your a one man army.  Let the carnage begin.
837	1	a	Seems like i bought this game ages ago and finally got around to playing it. Pretty fun game when you are running around just blowing stuff up; but once you get down to doing some of the missions (aka the actual game) things go down hill quickly. It is fun to just run around the city roaming around killing people but the missions really restrict things which is pretty unnecessary. You are supposed to be some badass yet even a single enemy can pretty much kill you because the way the combat is designed you have to dodge everything with no option to block so basically if you get hit you are going to keep getting hit, and then you get hit into a corner, then you get beaten to death by giant mutant things. Is the game worth buying though? Sure if you get it for like 5 bucks, but just know it is going to be pretty damn hard. Not because the game is difficult, but because the occasional horribly designed missions and boss fights are going to make it that way.
839	1	a	The best Sandbox game made to date if you havnt picked this beast up your nuts!!!!
841	1	a	Assassin's Creed meets science fiction, this game dumps you in the role of a guy with no memory, infected with a virus that gives him incredible agility and many other abilities, hunted by a shadowy government organisation. Wide open sandbox world, plenty of challenges to take on, and an intriguing storyline to uncover make this quite a solid gameplay experience.
843	1	a	Uses the Spiderman Engine but still is fun.
845	1	a	Wish I never bought it.
847	1	a	The Best Slasher on PC for me!!! Looking forward to play Prototype2!!!
849	1	a	Prototype is like inFAMOUS but without the terrible attempt at a moral choice system. Decent storytelling with fun sandboxy superpower gameplay. I concur with Penny Arcade's review. You can karate kick a helicopter. What more do you want?
851	1	a	This is a spectacular game of the franchise. For those who like open world games. This is the one for you.
853	1	a	You have been transformed into a biological Prototype weapon, and your only thought is revenge... and the destruction that preceeds it. There are plenty of upgrades and attack forms to make your killing prowess undeniable. Challenge events and hidden items cover Manhattan for plenty of bloat content. Traversing the map is much like Spider-Man and combat feels a bit like Infamous. Dangerously fun to tear apart civilians, monsters, and soldiers alike. The Web of Intrigue is a great way to reveal the background story piece by piece. Most certainly worth the fun if spending a few dollars!  The only character depth comes shallow with just Alex, while the rest just come through as plot twists or leave empty. New York is relived in yet another open world game. Monster design is torn right out of concept art from Resident Evil. The music was not impacting or memorable in any way.
855	1	a	Pros: Great (anti) superhero-like game. Gameplay is fun, combat is good, and storyline is so-so.   Cons: Fun game but one play-through is probably enough, so get on sale. Storyline is blan, but the gameplay makes up for it. Characters seem blan as well, but definately worth a playthrough.  6/10 (Kinda reminds me of the Hulk video game on PS2)
857	1	a	Spiderman's rampage, oh and he's not a spider.
859	1	a	The chief theme here will be broad strokes, which is what Prototype has. It's got the framework of a bunch of cool stuff, and it works to an extent, but there's ample room for improvement in everything. Take for example, the movement. You can climb and jump around most anything, and going in a single direction feels awesome most of the time, you can glide and dash and leap to your heart's content. But, if you're trying to get a tricky collectable from atop an antenna or building, Alex will often tweak out and flip over and around everything in sight, and it's quite a job to wrestle him into precise movements. Want to turn left or right? Hope you've got a few seconds cause unstoppable forces don't turn on a dime. Another example: Do you hate collateral damage? Don't even, cause there is nothing you have that won't wipe out a 90 degree arc about 10 feet in front of you at least. You're going to be smashing civvies and other innocents all the time, and the game gives you a nice running total of how many families you've ruined after each fight, so good luck sleeping I guess.  The actual in-game storyline is, nyeh? It's okay, it gives me an excuse to destroy all this junk, and it joins up all these events just fine. There were a couple of standout moments, but ultimately it was pretty by the numbers. It does tend to wrench control out of your hands to show you things during missions, or straight up transport you across the map afterwards, which can be annoying. The Web Of Intrigue though? That's some good stuff right there, loads of dropped hints and filling in the gaps, much speculation and other really cool junk. I spent ages just cruising the city looking for targets cause they were so interesting. Word of advice though, never skip a target movie, cause good luck remembering the name and then finding it in the hundred-something strong web.  Combat: Losing relies chiefly on some very dubious things: Unavoidable chip damage, homing attacks, and super-damaging stunlocks. It's not that it's not challenging, cause you will die if you're not paying attention, but it's really going through the motions of action/reaction to the above three. Some cooped-in boss battles can make the game feel hard, and especially early in the game when you're not very powerful. Oftentimes you'll find yourself cheesing fights by staying on the move and chipping at stronger foes from range, because moving in for actual damage provides them with too many opportunities to stun/grab/hit you and it's not worth the risk. It makes fights more of a chore than fun sometimes, and that's not so great. Health is relatively easy to come by, by grabbing and eating mooks, but it makes every mistake another chore, since everything big hurts you so much you'll have to find and consume 2-3 of the little guys safely before you can re-engage. It skews the pacing and atmosphere of fights quite a bit, and it's often more advantageous to just bug out. Unless, of course, you're doing a scripted story mission or event that requires you to clear an area, in which case hunker down for the long haul. The AI isn't very smart, not at all, but they are numerous and widespread. It's not about outsmarting them, it's about outsmarting the group and learning to play the way they work to your advantage. Stealth isn't, really, but it does what it needs to and works within the larger framework. Many of the stronger enemies are niusances rather than challenges, but again you gain the powers to gib them or to lose them fairly early on, so it's not really too big of a deal.  Speaking of powers, those are pretty cool. You get a bunch of different arms, some defensive stuff, some supports, and they all have a use. You'll probably find yourself favouring one or two though, since there's quite a bit of redundancy between them. I'd have liked to see some more differentiation, but only a small fraction are mandatory so I guess not having everything must be allowed for. There's lots of stuff to spend your money on, special moves for each power as well as ones for plain old fisticuffs, movement and health upgrades, super moves, the store really does overflow with stuff. The movement too, once you figure out how to do it right, it's a joy to traverse the city and the challenges become simple matters of route rather than speed. You can fly and dash and grab walls and leap and dive, there really are a lot of things you can do and that's great. Also, when you enter the power radial selection everything slows down for a second to let you pick, and that's awesome.  While it's not perfect, Prototype has one excellent quality: Not many other games make you feel this powerful, this badass, all of the time. You have a couple of dozen ways to destroy the dude that's ineffectually pinging at you with his rifle, and you have so much health that you can afford to decide. If he brings ten friends, it still doesn't really matter cause you can just nab one and chuck him at the others and then elbow drop the rest before zipping up a building and being five blocks away before backup even thinks of arriving. If some tougher guys decide to chase you, you're stronger and faster than them so just hit them with a ventilation unit and disappear, because you can. It broaches on God Game territory sometimes, but you're running around on the ground being all-powerful, and that feels really good.  + Fun as all hell Oodles of powers and upgrades Feels godlike, man Options, options, options  - Poor PC controls Combat can be cheap at times Showing it's age graphically  In the end, Prototype was worth the time I put into it, and despite the above tirade, the good outweighs the bad. Much of it is just frustration about what could have been great but ended up being just good. But, that still leaves you with a good, fun game, with tons of things to do and stuff to see, and a lot of extra storyline junk for those interested.
301	0	a	Not happy with this along with Prototype 2, i have played these games on the Xbox 360 platform and i do enjoy these games, i have migrated most of my game play to the PC as i CBA to buy multiple platforms to play the games i like the most, on purchase and download of these games via steam ( Taking into account my Pc Specs i shall disclose below this comment ), i found myself disappointed.  I Cannot run Prototype 1 without serious lag and on the games lowest settings and its tedious that prototype 2 just does not load ( Crashed during basic startup ) i have reinstalled these twice and ensured my rig has its SLI correctly setup for the game.  I ran system requirments lab and well it says i have the minimum for prototype 1 ( il post the link also as its still confussing as it will not disclose the Recommended )  I have both minimum and Recommended for Prototype 2 ( again i can post the link )  My system is pretty high spec and high performance and i can play without a doubt Most games...there has not been a game ive played that i have had issues with and my hardware is quite recent.   i have also tried to go to activation for support but their support for this game on these games for this platform do not come avaliable on their website.....which is frustrating as there is a need for it i believe.  anyway here are the specs of my pc ( Below ) and all in all i would not recommend anyone buying th pc versions of this if they are below the spec i am about to post.

861	1	a	this game is pretty much my guilty pleasure 10/10
863	1	a	Now then, where to begin: TL;DR: get the console versions, the PC port is not good at all, but the game is good.  The PC port is not optimised, so the frame-rate will chug when smoke &amp;/or particle effects are going on, there is no option to play it in windowed mode and the timers in the PC version seem to be lowered for no apparent reason. Many cheap deaths as well from enemies you couldn’t see doing huge attacks. Also the lock-on system is garbage since it only shows priority targets one should remove first rather then what the player wants to target. All that said the game is good. The different attack styles one can use to kill enemies are really visceral. But what I will praise to the end is the movement system. If you play this game you will feel absolute joy just running amok on Manhattan Isle, mainly just running around like a mad Sonic the hedgehog killing NPCs as you please. I will say now I haven’t finished the final boss battle. The last segment of the battle is timed and because the timers are lowered on the PC version you won’t have enough time to actually finish it. So get the console versions: either the Xbox 360 or the PS3 version. The PC I don’t recommend either way. But it’s worth experiencing the pleasure of the movement system alone for the game.
865	1	a	This game has more freedom than the US Constitution! The parkour system in this game is amazing. I loved running around, jumping, flying. Sometimes I wouldn't even bother with missions or people and I would just parkour around the world, feeling like a badass. The parkour challenges were also something I enjoyed greatly.  The violence was pretty fun too, body slamming, stealing tanks and choppers, blowing up buildings, hunting for targets to consume, smashing people, slicing people, shooting people, sneaking into military bases.  And it has New Game+! Great for replayability.
867	1	a	even though ths game came out in 2009 im playing it in 2014 and its still impresive. the combat is joius and it is amaxingley gory and brutal some compare it to hlks ltimate destruction and i mst agrey it is the more mature cousain who doesnt mind showng you what you can be if yo complete the game. there is a new game plus+ so that yo can feel like a god when yo replay it whch some games shold do. im looking at you dishonored. this is one of the best games i have ever played and say that it is a 9/10 its not perect because the main persone you are fightng s easyer than the first fight.
869	1	a	greatgame! singleplayer only
871	1	a	Very fun game, great storyline, and good if you like chopping people up for no reason!
873	1	a	Uh, I thought I liked this a lot. But it turns out I think it's a bit meh. Not ♥♥♥♥ enough to not recommend though.
875	1	a	This is a fun open world/sandbox sort of game, if you like GTA, SR, and the like, grab it on sale.
305	0	a	Let me start off by saying, this game has over 250 collectables. 50 of those...are tips on how to play the game. Yes that's right, you'll be searching for tips on how to play the game, that you've mastered to the point that you're concerned about getting collectables....Yep.  Apart from that, the art direction is cool, the pre-rendered cutscenes are awesome, but the story and in game cutscenes leave much to be desired. The gameplay is fun, but has way too many poorly planned challenges and mission requirements which will make you pull your hair out.  Buy Saints Row 4 if you want to run around having fun with super powers. Buy Resident Evil if you want an outbreak storyline about mutant monsters. Don't buy this game (unless there's a steam sale, then why not right?)
877	1	a	Interesting for the first 2-3hrs, but starts to lose captivity as the story progresses. If you buy it, don't toodly around. Play the story before you get bored.
306	0	a	DO NOT GET THIS GAME.. ITS A GIANT TURD THAT WONT FLUSH.  It doesnt work and there is 0 support for it. You wont even get an answer from the company that makes it.
879	1	a	I ♥ this game
881	1	a	One of the best Super Hero Sandbox game.
883	1	a	Super hero simulator 1.
885	1	a	A great action game. Fast, fun and a really interesting plot
887	1	a	If you are an Infamous fan, this is a really good pickup. There are many similarities between Infamous and Prototype that made me feel like I was back in Empire City (at times). The overall feel of the game is a lot like Infamous. While the storyline is a little less intriguing, the free play in a lot more enjoyable, something you and a friend can do for fun for a long time.
889	1	a	Got juggled by rockets. Violated soldiers with tentacles. Ate an old lady. Body-surfed a zombie as an old lady. Violated soldiers with spikes. Ate a Mexican. Became  Mega-Mexican . Caused zombie 9/11. Became a killer. Became a monster. Became a terrorist. 10/10; was all of these things.
891	1	a	Open World,Adventure,Sci-fi,Action these are words to define this game it is amazing.You can run around,fight,upgrade power-ups,kill army men,and hijack tanks.THIS GAME IS AMAZING!!!!!!
893	1	a	What Mirror's Edge's parkour should have been + Spiderman 2 + Slurping Random Innocents = Good game 10/10
895	1	a	Fun Hack and Slay game, and definitely worth it if you get in on sale :)
897	1	a	Totally worth buying. While it is not the most sublime experience, this game is perfect for venting out frustration, and the story is actually quite good, with some fun mechanics involved. Also throwing people at helicopters and helicopters at people never gets old.
899	1	a	In the first 5 mins you can jump off of a car and body slam on a tank.... and it ♥♥♥♥ing explodes! 10/10 best game thats ever existed
901	1	a	did you know you can somehow kill in one hit
309	0	a	I tried really hard to like Prototype. It has an interesting enough story, tons of power to murder many, many people with, but simply put, it runs terrible. It averages maybe 20 FPS, dropping into low single digits if more than just the main character are on the screen (often). The menu is clunky, and the controls and uninutitve and unresponsive.
903	1	a	Where the hell is prototype 2?
905	1	a	I'd highly recommend using an Xbox One controller for this epic action game. Easily my favorite hack and slash game. Very intense and fast paced. Interesting plot. Also the game gets very very hard in the end, your first playthrough of the game should be on Easy. Movement mechanics are very interesting and allow for fast-paced traversing across NYC. Movement includes dive bombing, parkouring, gliding, dashing through the air, sprinting, sprint climbing up on buildings, massive charged jumps, and much more.
907	1	a	Go for it, purely causing chaos is as much fun as playing the missions :D
909	1	a	Prototype is an action open world game where you try and find out why and who did 'it' for you. The game is pretty hard, it really reminds me assassins creed gameplay and crysis dfficulty. the game has good graphics and a great gameplay. a good gameplay and overall a good game. buy it. play it. 9/10
911	1	a	Pretty good game!
913	1	a	Tons of fun and crazy, crazy action. Can you say 'Drop kick a helicopter?' I knew you could.
915	1	a	Great gameplay, for the first 10 hours. Then it's nothing but repetition
917	1	a	Its recently started crashing when I try to start a game. it's too bad cus I liked this game
919	1	a	Don't get me wrong, i played more than steam said.  When this game came out, it came out during the golden ages of assassin creed. And like the idiot i was, i pretended alex mercer was a modern day assassin. And i pretended my parkour was enhanhnced templar ablitlies (Facepalm)  Throughout the whole game, instead of smashing ♥♥♥♥. I painfully enlonged the game by Stealthing this game, running away from weak ♥♥♥ enemies. Disguise kill everyone and bases  10/10, Wrong game simulator
921	1	a	Imagine a GTA with super powers, so basically that is the gameplay of Prototype. The story is good, has no great time but captive, controls respond well (at least q u wanted to make a narrow jump, get ready to anger) and overall is a divertio game.  The Prototype problem is the great repetition, there are basically 2 types of monsters we face (the whole game) the other tanks are soldiers and helicopters (can steer all vehicles), the missions are repeated and as the enemies is also easy to get sick. Q One thing irritated me very much is that when we are not controlling the character (standing alone, out of the water and the like) suffer damage, so it's normal to be knocked down by a missile 5x without even move power control.  I know it is difficult to decide whether or not recommend, but overall I think the fun is still worthwhile. Recommend with 75% off  pros. fun, power and playing the terror in the city, long gameplay + -12 hours  neg. camera, repetitive enemies and missions, control for simple jumps, side quest boring as hell (but of quiet to finish without making)   Imagina um GTA com super poderes, isso basicamente que é o gameplay do Prototype. A historia é boa, não tem nenhum grande momento mas cativa, os controles respondem bem (ao menos q vc queria fazer um pulo estreito, se prepare para se irritar) e no geral é um game divertio.  O problema de Prototype é a grande repetição, existem basicamente 2 tipos de monstros que enfrentamos (o jogo todo) os demais são soldados tanks e helicopteros (podemos pilotar todos veiculos), as missões se repetem e como os inimigos também fica facil enjoar. Uma coisa q me irritou muito bastante é que quando não estamos controlando os personagem (levantando sozinho, saindo da água e afins) sofremos dano, então é normal ficar sendo derrubado por missel umas 5x sem ao menos poder mexer o controle.  Eu sei fica dificil decidir se recomendo ou não, mas no geral creio que a diversão ainda vale a pena. Recomendo com 75% off  prós . diversão, poderes e a tocar o terror na cidade, gameplay longo +-12 horas  neg. camera, repetição de inimigos e missões, controle para pulos simples, side quest chatas pra ♥♥♥♥♥♥ (mas da para terminar tranquilo sem fazer)
923	1	a	Alot of people gripe about how this was a infamous wannabe, but its a good game in its own right. Get this game especially now with how cheap it is
925	1	a	I hate to say it, but I really liked this game. It's like a more fast-paced and violent inFamous. The story is absolute trash and the final boss is complete garbage. Everything in between is like a gore-porn fantasy. Make of that what you will.
927	1	a	Do you like being nigh-invulnerable? Do you like rampaging unchecked through New York? Do you like being able to karate kick helicopters? If you answered 'yes,' Prototype is the game for you!
929	1	a	Holy ♥♥♥♥ it is awesome !!!XD  
931	1	a	I was so chuffed as i had not realised this game was released for pc. I remember being quite jealous of those being able to play it on console and it does not disappoint. The graphs are great , burning my laptop into the table. Some very innovative ideas for gameplay,. Multiple layers of progress and of corse and most importantly, lots and lots of gore, gibblets and oozing splays of body mattter all over the place. I love the idea of being able to smash a tank with my malformed chunder fists. Reap my disease infested body, armpits and all.
933	1	a	It's fun and surprisingly balanced when you take into consideration the fact that you're basically a demigod. There is one cheap boss, though it's only one.
935	1	a	pretty good game
937	1	a	One of the most underrated 'superhero' games out there. Its the first of the series so don't expect anything too groundbreaking in terms of gameplay mechanics (The second game is even better). Good chaotic combat, gory carnage, lengthy exploration, albeit with a weak overall narrative despite an interesting lore supplemented by the comics. Prototype is a 7.5/10.
939	1	a	Quite a interesting and different game compared to alot that I own on steam. If anyone has ever played any of the Infamous games and enjoyed them, you will like this, has a similar feel to while not being the same.    The Story is quite interesting where it starts out towards the end, and alot of the game is basically you playing flash backs (although most if not all game is during those 'flashbacks') leading up to the 'beginning', and the end of the story.    Even when not playing missions, there are side activities to do that will help you obtain upgrade and have fun. Outside of those, there is still sandbox style fun to have throughout the city. In some ways, progressing through the story makes the game more fun (upgrades, new/more enemies), but at the same time some makes it a little less fun (Hunters all over, military uses more heavy hardware, less neutral zones.). The only thing that I did not like about the game, was the difficulty of the final boss. Overall a good game though.
941	1	a	Prototype is a fantastic game, anyone who hasn't bought it I highly recommend you do.
310	0	a	Fun for a few hours...not much past that.
943	1	a	Zombie Mutants? Aw hell yeah
945	1	a	one of the best games ive ever played
947	1	a	This game belong on ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.
949	1	a	Just perfect and,guys ,don't say :the game have lots of lag.my computer is a work computer and runs at 30/40 fps
951	1	a	I would recomend this game to someone who has never played it before just because it is a unique game. But I used to play this game all the time as a young'n I bought it thinking that it would be fun to play again but this is a game that has very little replay value and it is best to leave it as a memory.
953	1	a	For me, this game is really awesome!! Here are the pros and cons. PROS: - Amazing storyline - Awesome powers - Awesome graphics - Challenging game CONS: - Nothing (except if you dislike blood and gore)   Basically this is a super awesome game. This is not all the PROS and CONS but this is what I can come up for now.
955	1	a	First off, I would like to say that I love this game, for me, It seems that games like this make me think overwhelmingly positive, because of all the destruction and all the crisis, but this game could not suite you, so you should just try to find a game that works well for you.  I recommend this game to anyone who is looking for complete chaos.
957	1	a	Great game! This game is a classic and non the less still is great to play.
959	1	a	Even though the story is generic and the graphics are not that great this game is freaking amazing, great gameplay, one of the best open world that you can have fun just by running and gliding and the powers are amazing. The only problem that I have with the gameplay is that there are 2 o 3 moments where the difficulty spike is brutal but you can easily recover because Alex is practically immortal.
961	1	a	Badass game if you like to kill soldiers like a crazy and kill infecteds like a Badass Also a good game if you like parkours!
963	1	a	It's kinda stress-relieving if tearing people apart is your natural high.
965	1	a	You will poop your pants with excitement!
967	1	a	Prototype is an awesome game. What you do in it is run around and shape shift everywhere. You can unlock new abilities and stuff. Its a lot like Saints Row 4 and you should play it if you love superhero games.
969	1	a	A very intense, often disturbing, man versus city, death and destruction action game with an intriguing sci-fi conspiracy plot. In terms of action intensity, this easily owns GTA.   There are plenty of special abilities to be unlocked.  Most memorable and entertaining element of the game is the ability to jump from helicopter to helicopter high above the city, pulling out pilots and throwing them away, then flying the chopper yourself!
971	1	a	Highly recommended by me. Reminds me of Just Cause 2 when it comes to game play BUT so much more darKer and brutal &gt;:D  ~ Love It!
973	1	a	Alex's ability is very popular in Korea I love this game
975	1	a	This game is one of the coolest I have ever played. The story is Cool Powers are awesome Controls are different but easy to learn Played for 20 hours Graphics are ok Over all this game is awesome!
977	1	a	Definitely one of the funnest games I've ever played. Its fun, exciting and really makes you feel powerful and great. I think Prototype is GREATLY underrated as it is very original and good. I highly recommend this game, it has so much content and fun sandbox features and if you're a fan of games like Saints Row, InFAMOUS or Just Cause were there is lots to do in the open world and just create havoc, destruction and just have fun in a large world of freedom, definitely buy this.
311	0	a	more like phototype because of the bad frame rate
979	1	a	Great game. The graphics aged about as well as 2009 graphics can age, and the story is alright. The gameplay is amazing though, and I had plenty of fun as Alex Mercer, our stone-cold proto-tagonist (I'll stop now.) and using his awesome power to destroy things. You feel like an all-powerful god, but the game still has challenge to it that keeps it from being totally boring. A throughly enjoyable experience all around, and something you want in your library if you liked Rock Star's Infamous and Infamous 2.
981	1	a	Great story, loved the combat, and the bosses were a fun time. One of my most favorite games that I've ever played.  11/10
983	1	a	Totally underated.
985	1	a	i love this game :D
987	1	a	♥♥♥♥ story, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics, but ign worth gameplay.
989	1	a	This game is so good.        Ken
991	1	a	Where Protoype shines is the open-world traversal around the city as you gain more powers. The combat is fun enough and the carnage you can cause is defintely fun. However, the story is all over the place and tires way too hard to be edgy, leading to a very, very unsatifyng final boss. I'd recommend this game to those who, like me, can enjoy a good brawler with open-world elements. Worth picking up on a sale.
993	1	a	I have real fond memories of this game. The story is kinda dumb but just interesting enough to keep you engaged, and the powers you get are fun as hell. It's a bit dated by today's standards but give it a shot.   Plus, you get to karate kick helicopters out of the air. Who doesn't wanna do that?
995	1	a	Prototype is an amazing way to pass the time if you like being hulk that eats people and has a sword for an arm. I've had plenty of fun with it and i reccomend it to anyone who likes to blow things up. HAPPY BIRTHDAY PROTOTYPE
997	1	a	The One and Original PROTOTYPE
999	1	a	Not even at half off would this game be an ideal one. You'd need to wait for it to be five dollars to consider it worthy of purchase.  It sounds good in theory: badass guy, shapeshifting, conspiracy, etc. But the problem is, as far as the main missions go, it's very linear -- you have to do EXACTLY what the developers wanted you to, or you will fail., Gameplay is numbingly repetitive. You're out for revenge, and for this tough guy you're playing, there are still some enemies that can whup you (like humans, or infected humans) which make you seem weaker than you're supposed to be.  So, if in reality you want ridiculously annoying missions that feel rigged sometimes, and to chuck cars at people and buildings, leap up into helicopters and kill the driver and subsequently drive it yourself, fine and dandy. This, however, doesn't bring anything new to the table. Huge letdown.  Also, there's a weird thing with the sound. Seems quieter than it should be.
1001	1	a	sick game
1003	1	a	Worth every coin for this game!
1005	1	a	Prototype: Not Even Once
1007	1	a	Have you every wished that you could run up walls, shape-shift into military soldiers, or morph your arm into a weapon of mass destruction? With this game you can do all of that and more!
1009	1	a	It's a great game, but be warned:  -This game will likely run very slow (10 FPS) unless you know how to fix it. From what I've seen, different people have to use different fixes based on their system. I had to disable some HIDs and unplug my keyboard.  -This game is much more fun if you have a controller. Keyboard and mouse feels too clunky for this game.
1011	1	a	Open world game where you kill everything with super powers.
1013	1	a	Alex Mercer. 'nuff said.
1015	1	a	If you really want to play something without a hard story, because your life too stressing and you only want to destroy things with amazing powers an movements out of this world, this game is for you. Sprint or fly into in a free world map (of NY), make parkour or destroy everything at your way; it doesn´t matter at all, but you can also make a buch of secondary missions or follow the main story of a prototype of a superhuman who accidentally drop a super toxic virus and that´s why the whole US goverment is trying to chase him.
1017	1	a	WARNING: THIS GAME IS NOT FOR THE FAINT-HEARTED This game is pretty cool, it had a noice setting, and tis a great game overall. If you ever wanted to run up walls, fly, or be bulletproof, this game is for you. If you have a crappy pc like mine, then the game will adjust to the best setting automatically, and it can run it well, probably with some lag. Overall, I r8 with no h8 8/8.
1019	1	a	 R.J. Macready Award.   Ever wanted to be John Carpenter's The Thing? Now you Can!
1021	1	a	I enjoyed battling in this game. If only the story could be longer.
1023	1	a	Really fun game, bit jumpy during cutscenes and had the game freeze a couple times, really hate some of the controls and the integration with steam is horrible and interferes sometimes with the gameplay but overall the game was enjoyable
1025	1	a	'I am something less than human, but also something more''............. I told one of friends to refer me some different type games, then he referred me Prototype. Then I google it and read the storyline of this game. After reading all articles I searched the game in steam store, watched the trailer and other videos. I decided to purchase this game. I played all the levels and events in the game and fully satisfied with this game. I also recommend this game.
1027	1	a	If I could give a neutral recommendation I would, because this is just an okay port of a decent game.  Every good point about Prototype seems to have a countervailing drawback. Maneuvering Alex around Manhattan has a thrilling feeling of hurtling along the streets in a blur of barely-controlled speed, but this makes it very easy to fling yourself in the wrong direction (off a building, into a military base, etc...) and the controls become infuriating any time you have to move with speed and precision. Naturally, I didn't bother with most of the 'movement' optional events (even playing with an Xbox controller). Furthermore, Manhattan is just large enough that criss-crossing the island as you go from one event to the next takes just barely long enough to become tiresome.  The side event system itself includes some real winners - I personally got a kick out of the War, Kill, and Glide events - but also some stinkers, such as Movement and Consume. The subset of 'Military Consume' events where you have to grab X targets in Y minutes are utter garbage that highlight the worst aspects of the game. On the other hand, the 'Military Consume' base infiltration and base destruction missions are a lot of fun, so it's a mixed bag.  Finding and eating targets to fill out the Web of Intrigue starts off as... intriguing (ba-dum psh)... but eventually becomes an onerous chore, and you don't get anything for completing it. I finished the Web on YouTube and walked away feeling relieved I didn't bother finishing it in game.  Generally, the combat is engaging and fluid, much the way the Batman Arkham series aspires to be. With Alex, as compared to Batman, there's a much greater sense of personal power as you lay waste to your enemies. You almost have to feel pity for them; most of these puny mortals are your playthings - grabbing a guy with the whipfist and flinging him at his friends is a real rush and is as easy as a few well-timed button presses.   However, the boss encounters are feats of poor design; I ended up having to beat each boss by spamming the whipfist in circle-strafe. The boss that pops out of the street (about 2/3 of the way through the game) was so infuriating that I nearly ragequit.  Technically speaking, the audio in the cinematics is borked. I carried out the recommended fix (unpacking the audio archives into the game directory; Google it for details) and it didn't do diddly for me. It really kind of sucks, but it doesn't affect gameplay or in-engine audio, so it's a pain in the behind rather than a game-breaker.  Overall, I had enough fun with Prototype, in spite of its flaws, that I'm willing to give it a half-hearted thumbs up. Pay no more than $5 for it and you'll get your money's worth.
1029	1	a	Have fun playing this game. I like Alex has various powers to use.  But sometimes its hard to control the movement and make Alex to move around. (Although it seems to improved in 2) The Target function is quite horrblie, not only hard to target an enemy, but also even you target an enemy, Alex goes to hit other target lol. Still, I enjoy playing this game.
1031	1	a	Amazing game. Well done tutorials. Excellent roaming. A plethora of optionals. Tight main quest. Solid story. A number of different playstyles are accepted, and hell of a lot of fun!  I love this game.
1033	1	a	Take one part Faerie Solitaire and two parts Puzzle Quest and mix in a little Poker or Yahtzee for good measure and you will get something like Runespell: Overture.   You're a changeling of some sort and you fight monsters and take quests in exchange for coin and buffs (which come in the form of power-up cards). There's a story but it's not the strongest element in the game. Like the Puzzle Quest games, your battles are determined by playing a mini-game. Instead of match-3 though, the game is a card game similar to poker in which making certain combinations of cards (pairs, 5 of a kind, full house, flush, straight) will do a certain amount of damage to your opponent, who is trying to do the same to you. The ability to steal some cards from your opponent, plus the limited number of moves you get per turn to move cards or play power-ups adds just enough strategy to the game to keep it interesting.  Admittedly, the game can get a bit repetitive after a while and I found the dialogue options to be a bit tedious but fortunately the game allows you to skip them if you want. It's an easy game to learn, and it's an entertaining casual game to play. It seems to be pretty short and the achievements don't seem too difficult to collect if that's your thing.    Finding little gems like this is the reason I buy bundles.
1035	1	a	Runespell: Overture melds together classic RPG components with Windows Live's player-vs-player solitaire with poker. I obtained Runespell for free in a pile of coal during the Steam Holiday Sale 2011 event. Receiving the game for free, I simply assumed that Runespell was merely a terrible, no-name title that was not worth playing. It was not until the Summer 2013 that I truly realized what I had come across.  Runespell sports a great soundtrack with honestly a decent storyline. Often times, card games that try to incorporate RPG elements (or just a storyline) end up drowning out the added components with the basic mechanics the card game - Runespell does not do this. If you are a cards-only enthusiast, this may stray a little too far from those roots; if you are an RPG-only enthusaist, this may feel more like a card game. However, if you are willing try a game that can have both, Runespell: Overture is for you.  Verdict: While Runespell: Overture is far from a lump of coal turned into a diamond, but it is definitely a gem. Simply put, Runespell is a fun, player-vs-computer, RPG, solitaire, poker game - and it is done very well. The game is so enjoyable that I honestly look forward to a remake or sequel that would incorporated online cooperative and competitive gameplay features. While it is definitely not worth $10, the current sale of $2 at the time of this review is definitely worth looking into. Here you will find a game that successfully feels like an RPG, while feeling like a card game.
1037	1	a	Runespell Overture (Card/Poker/RPG/Strategy Hybrid)  For options we have Graphics Quality (Fastest, Fast, Simple, Good, Beautiful, and Fantastic), Windowed or Fullscreen, Drag and Drop or Click and Click (when moving cards around), and Sounds (Music and SFX). You can also choose a screen resolution anywhere from 640x480 to 1920x1080.  The tutorial is very well-done, teaching you the ropes without being annoying.  So what kind of game is this? It looks like an RPG that you play with cards, but that's not it at all. The primary thrust is actually a solitaire game... It's battle-solitaire-poker with RPG elements! *evil grin* Whee~!  How does that work? Looking at the screenshots will help a bit. As you can see, we and our opponent are each dealt a set of cards, solitaire-style. Ours is on top, theirs is on the bottom. We need to create poker hands by grouping cards in sets of five. If you don't know the poker hands, no worries -- the game will show you what groupings are 'legal' to play. Each 'hand' will deliver a certain amount of damage, depending on the cards you've chosen. For instance, a pair of cards (the other three cards in the group would be non-related) will deliver less damage than a flush.   In each round, you have three moves, and then your opponent gets three moves.   But wait, there's more!   You can steal your opponent's cards, and vice versa! If you grab a card from his area (or the other way around,) the card underneath does NOT flip over until it becomes his turn, but whenever you clear a pile on your side, you can immediately have access to whatever card is next in the pile (assuming that it's still your turn.) You CAN'T grab more than a single card from each others' piles -- if something is stacked on the other side (grouped,) it's off-limits to you. You can of course move multiple, grouped cards around on your own side.  Here's an example of how it might work:   You already have three Kings grouped, and take a fourth King to add to the pile, then grab a King from your enemy's cards to make five-of-a-kind (yes, unlike real poker, you can have five of the same card.) You use your third turn to select the five kings and deal damage.  This is where the strategy comes in. Now that it's too late and you've used all of your turns, you see your adversary grab that Jack of Hearts from your cards to complete a Royal Flush! EEEK~!!  Here's what you could have done to prevent it and still get your five Kings:   Forget about your three Kings for right now, grab his king, and place it on your single King, making a pair. Grab the Jack of Hearts and put it on top of another card -- ANY other card! It's better if you can do something with it, of course, but the point is to keep that card AWAY from your opponent. Now you can do one of two things: Do something beneficial (like moving a card to help yourself and/or hurt his progress) or you can move the pair of Kings on top of the three-of-a-kind, and make your attack in an upcoming round.  But wait, there's more!   Along the way we earn (via battles) and find special-use cards that can do anything from give you extra moves before your turn is over to poisoning to shielding yourself, to adding to your hit points, and more! You can only have a certain number of cards with you at the time of each battle, and (most of) the cards have finite-uses. When they run out uses, you can use the money you earn to recharge the cards.  Be sure to SAVE before each battle! You can abandon your progress if you wish -- it's an option to exit or go back to the main menu without saving.  There a bit more to it than that, including a storyline, but I'll let you discover that for yourself. ;)  This game was a huge surprise to me -- I never expected it to be so fun and addictive! A definite thumbs-up from me!
1039	1	a	If you like casual games and you like an RPG style twist, then this little game was executed very well. The concept of using a standard card game as a fighting system works very well actually. Solid little game, I like it quite well!
313	0	a	As a fan of poker and Rpgs i thought this would be a pretty interersting and fun game....i was half right  It seems well enough when you begin. You try to get a combintaion of 5 cards, the attack power being determined on how well it corrosponds to to the poker hierarchy and try to wittle down you're opponents hp. simple enough.  You are introduced to spells shortly after, assuming this is where the tactics come in.....well not really.  The main problem with this game is that it is barely like poker at all and barely an RPG. The attack points could be determined by...pretty much anything else..infact it might benifit from this as what happens 90% is you and even the A.I end up making as many pairs and then full house's as you can with usually lower damage if you try anything else in addition to being harder to achieve. There almost no point in making a higher hand than you're opponent as all it does is take off slightly more hp...i mean ♥♥♥♥ i some what assumed that it might nullify one of his hands....or something..you know kinda like POKER.  The spells offer SOME varity and tactics but not much, the cost vs reward of most spells make them mostly interchangeable.....its kinda amazing actually how there could be so much varity and yet so little.  Overall the only people i can recommend this game to is to someone who wants a simple card game that has some odd and fairly unique mechanics..........but mostly it is a dissapointment and wasted potiental.
1041	1	a	If you enjoy 'poker mechanics' you'll love it ! Would be 10/10 if multiplayer mode was available, sadly you can just face CPU Overall a good &amp; balanced card game
1043	1	a	Fun card dueling game. Uses traditional poker cards / hands, along with special abilities. There's not a whole lot to it, but the gameplay is mildly entertaining. The story isn't very good, but I'll still recommend it if you can find it on sale.
1045	1	a	Good: - Core concept - Like puzzle quest, but the gameplay is simple, not overcomplicated (there is no sword and other magic artifacts) - Fun gameplay  Bad: - Not to deep game mechanics - Not to long campaign
1047	1	a	Runespell is a combination of RPG, Solitaire and Poker, similar in nature to Puzzle Quest. You stack cards like in solitaire to form 5 card poker combos to attack your foes and cast spells. It's fairly simple to play an so is the presentation. The story is based on Norse Mythology and while it's somewhat thin it does has its twists and turns. I found the gameplay enjoyable for the most part and the game doesn't overstay its welcome. Unfortunately, as the Overture in the title says it feels like a first part of something bigger, a second game that may never come out. That didn't upset me but can frustrate some people who got more invested in the story.
1049	1	a	Its a card game first, and a fighting game second. Each fight is structured by the cards played. And by 'cards', I mean a 52 card deck.  Your attacks come in the form of stacks of five such cards. Following Yahtzee Croshaw and Poker rules, getting say, a 5-of-a-kind will increase the damage that can be dealt.  The end all goal, of course, is to slay whoever you're fighting. Artwise its beautiful, but the lore of the game is handed to you via text, and wayyyyy too much of it.  8/10
317	0	a	This game is not bad. It does not anger me, disappoint me, or rub me the wrong way. It's just kinda there. The game plays like a cross between poker and solitaire. You see your stacks of cards (top card only per stack, like in solitaire), and you see the same for your opponent. You move cards around like in solitaire, stacking them on other cards, except you're trying to make combinations of five cards, which can be poker combos like flushes, straights, etc. You then use those to attack your enemy, and vice versa. You have bonus card thingies on the side of your screen that you can use to attack when you build up enough rage.  It's an okay premise, but it doesn't really seem to change and the story is just okay. It's one of the least compelling games I've played. I have nothing against this game, which is really saying something. I typically love or hate a game, but this one is just kinda meh. I wouldn't recomment paying more than a Steam sale price, by any means, but I'd recommend you play the demo if you're interested. The gameplay you experience in 20-30 minutes of that is pretty much the entirety of the gameplay from what I've seen thus far. It's not very exciting or interesting, and nothing draws me in to make me want to keep playing. It's an okay game, but that's it.
1051	1	a	Love this card game, use poker hands to defeat your enemys, with plenty of spell cards and allies to aid you when things get difficult. Most enemies are easy to start off and you think its a walk in the park but it soon cranks up the difficulty later on and you have to really think ahead and put good hands together to win. If you like card games then this is worth a shot.
1053	1	a	This was a fun and reasonably easy game to master. The mythic poker system is more of a cross between solitaire and poker. The layout is solitaire, but the building of hands is very much poker. Royal Flush has the most value at 50 attack points. I like the way your runespells charge by both dealing damage and receiving it from enemy attacks. The story was reasonably engaging for what it was, and they left room for DLC or a sequel. All in all, a good way to kill 8 or 10 hours. On a scale of 1-10, I would give it a 7 for fun, but an 8 or 9 as far as games you can play to kill time whne you are bored. Online play would be a natural evolution for this game. I hope they are considering the development of PvP matches.
318	0	a	Promising start, with really polished UI and tutorial, but game crashes upon leaving the first village, and there's no known solution nor support available. Until I figure it out, or find a computer on which it doesn't crash, I cannot give a better review. But watch out for this if you want to buy the game.
1055	1	a	Fun little card game. Nothing special, but try playing this instead of reaching for your solitaire game.
321	0	a	Though i was addicted to it and played maybe 2,5 times to collect all the achievements, can't really recommend it, unless for a big discount. Gameplay is repetitive and becomes stale quickly (collect pocker hands to create attacks). Additional magic spell add a bit flavor. Also the story was interesting. Oh, and the epic music playing all the time becomes annoying after a few minutes :)
1057	1	a	I honestly think this is the first computer based card game I have ever played. I have always passed them up thinking I would never enjoy them. Boy was I wrong. This truly is a well developed adventure. You essentially create poker hands against opponents to cause damage. The battle animation sequences keep it interesting to watch plus there are a decent number of card options, including offensive, defensive, and special abilities. As long as you understand how poker hands are ranked, this game is masterfully intuitive. If not, they even have that covered as well with an easy to follow tutorial. It also has a decent story although it's all text based so there is a bit of reading involved (you can skip conversations if you prefer). Do yourself a favor and give this game a shot.
322	0	a	A good game in the beginning but later it gets boring and eventually even frustrating.
323	0	a	Does not work in Mac OS 10.9 or 10.10. No support available from the company.
1059	1	a	I've always liked Poker, but this game I like especially well.  The things it adds to the 'combat' like spells and combo chains is really interesting. The RPG elements, quests, and story added on make it pretty interesting as well.  I got it for $3 and it's definitely worth that, and certainly worth at least $10 as well but I'd still say you should get it on sale.  Great game overall, I recommend it.
1061	1	a	+Interesting gameplay (same combos as Poker, played more like Solitaire but where you can steal cards from opponent) +Nice music (though gets repetitive by end of campaign) +Easy to learn rules, quick but adequate tutorial +Great interface -Mainly good for one playthrough (approx 10 hours depending on skill) -First Turn Advantage factor is significant -Role-playing/Story is secondary to the card gameplay. (all conversations can be skipped safely)  ?Game will supposedly get free update putting multiplayer in the game (hotseat first). No paid DLC.
1063	1	a	its good cuz therse cards an teyy fight guys
326	0	a	6/10  Its a game worth a try but only worth a try.Campaign is not that boring and can be attractive to some players.Also have a unique concept. There are 2 deadly flaws in this title in my opinion: 1.Too many useless battles,so you usually get bored after 2hours 2.The limited times to use skills,for more times?you need to buy at a high price in store.I really dont know why design like this,so the game gets more and more boring because you dont want to try different skills but only want to end every battle fast,its a big failure.But enemies dont,they always have 10+times to use and they only mean to get you stucked one time,so more and more hard battles but looked the same.
1065	1	a	 https://youtu.be/v-L9C1_TE8U   In a dark medieval world where danger lurks around every corner, the only way to survive is to play Poker! FOR YOUR LIFE!  Long story short, if you liked Puzzle Quest, but wanted to play it by building poker hands instead this game is for you.
330	0	a	Hard to tell the difference between clubs and spades especially. Sometimes I make the wrong diamonds and hearts also. Fix this, please.
331	0	a	A pretty unique concept but another of the worst games I've ever played. First boss of the tutorial is too overpowered and I can't beat him no matter what I do. There's better things out there to play. I'm done with this frustrating and stupefying game.
1067	1	a	Nice twist on poker. I liked it
333	0	a	I've tried on three separate occasions to gain momentum with this game, with no success. It is flat-out boring, in my opinion. Unless you already enjoy card games, you will probably not enjoy Runespell: Overture. The design of the game is actually fairly nice, but gameplay is extremely repetitive.

1069	1	a	Although not as good as PuzzleQuest (12500) it's still a fun little game. It's a mix between RPG and Poker, however weird that sounds it works. You earn special cards along the way, spells and followers and follow a storyline as you fight monsters through poker combinations. It could definently be better, more RPG elements and some new functions would liven it up. It it's cheap, it's worth it, or if your a poker and rpg fan!
1071	1	a	I do not understand card games. But I won't make a negative review about this game only because it's not my kind of the game. It seems okay... It just does not make my diк hard enough to play it.
1073	1	a	i cant even play i lod it up and it crashed ugh pls fix thx
1075	1	a	Puzzle Quest fans need look no further for their next addiction.
1077	1	a	The most bad ♥♥♥ poker game around. With great music/graphics and gameplay...this game will make you pumped to play poker. Simply awesome.
1079	1	a	7/10  A sort of RPG card playing game. A great time-killer and lazy repetitive game. It's one of those games that require one hand and is fun to come back to every once in awhile.
1081	1	a	The map is a bit cumbersome, but overall this is a very good game. If you like the original Puzzle Quest, you'll probably like this.
337	0	a	Poker solitaire is simply boring
1083	1	a	This game is fairly terrible, but I can't stop playing.
338	0	a	
1085	1	a	recommending this random game from my games library. if you dont like it, dont blame me: I havent played it, dont even know what's it about. To be more frank with you guys, I even think this game sucks. Happy playing.
340	0	a	This is one of those games where you play it for a bit and then you get stuck. On the plus side, the main menu music is awesome.
1087	1	a	the ♥♥♥♥ is this shet
1089	1	a	Runespell is a decent puzzle, nice poker mechanics and visuals. Obviously influenced by Puzzle Quest, but not that deep. It's not very short, you can easily get 15-20 hours out of it, also there are achievements and New Game+. Music is great. all 3 tracks, so it gets quite repetitive. Multiplayer and dlc would be great additions, but apparently this game is abandoned by the developers.
1091	1	a	Nice little game, too bad it's way too short and way too easy.
1093	1	a	WOW! I mean, this is just an awesome game! It offers the wonderful stragetic aspects of poker, with the bejeweled like rush of just creating attacks and chaining them. Sure, the poker aspect can be offputting for some people, but the liberal moving of the cards makes this game a lot more fun!
1095	1	a	Surprisingly interesting game of cards. Though, everything else in it sucks )))
1097	1	a	Good game, although about poker, none poker skill require. Kinda half strategic gameplay (make your hands stronger, while prevent opponent from getting stronger hands and using powercards) and half luck (all cards come out ramdonly). Still, the only thing I really hate in this game is some enemies' powercards are cheating.
1099	1	a	Surprisingly interesting game of cards. Though, everything else in it sucks )))
1101	1	a	One of the things I like about indie games is that they try out unique concepts that more mainstream developers would either never think of or be too scared to try. Runespell: Overture is a Norse themed RPG but is set apart from other RPGs by its unique battle system. You and your oppenent are given a deck of playing cards laid out solitaire-style and the idea is to build poker hands using the face up cards of you and your opponent. The better the hand, the harder it hits! Attacking and taking hits also builds up your rage meter which is used for activating spell cards similar those found in collectible card games to further give you an edge. Over the course of the game you will meet new allies, complete new quests, find new cards and further the story. If the idea of an RPG with poker-style battling and CCG elements appeals to you, get this game! You won't regret it.
1103	1	a	Awesome game, much like Puzzle Quest, and really engrossing take on the standard RPG. The card combat may take some getting used to, but it is well worth it. The art, the mechanics, and the feel of this game are highly recommended.
1105	1	a	nice little solitare/poker card game. The humor is alright. No bugs. the only complaint i have is there is no autosave but you can save manually so if you computer turns off etc and you for got to save your poop out of luck. (I'm clearly talking from experience.)
1107	1	a	A bit of poker mixed with a turn-based RPG feel. Overall, very addictive!
1109	1	a	Short game, but interesting gameplay.
342	0	a	Play Solitaire instead.
1111	1	a	This game surprised me. It is a fun combination of genres.
1113	1	a	Let me ask you one thing! *points at you*   Do you like playing poker?   Do you like playing magic the gathering?   Have you ever wondered what would occur if poker ever got drunk at a party and had sticky awkward unprotected sex with magic (the gathering)?  Then you are in luck you sick ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, this is the game for you! *points at you again*
1115	1	a	Really fun and nice twist to the games of solitare and poker with the incorporation of a fantasy storyline.
344	0	a	I've played deeper mobile games. It plays like one of those touch screen dive bar games.  I'm a big fan of the weird RPG-Poker niche subgenre of games so I was pretty excited about this, but it lets down in every way possible.  This game is basically just a battle system, there is very little connecting fight to fight. Simplistic map and boringly presented text and portrait story. That would be fine if the battle system had anything going on... but it doesn't.  The battle system has an interesting idea buried in it, but nothing is done with it. All the magic in the game is just *DO X-Y Damage* *Block X points of Nature Damage* There is no cards for board or number or hand manipulation. This makes collecting cards seem pointless because none of them actually change your play style. The way you play your first battle is how you play your last. There is also zero consequences for death so battles have no tension.  As for the RPG mechanics... well there aren't really any. Your HP and MP go up at set story points and I guess you can choose to cast a spell that does X points fire damage or X points nature damage, but there is so little reason to bother I can't see why you would.   Story is okay, I guess, soundtrack is decent, but I can't imagine that being enough to get you through this mindless slog. If you ever thought 'I wish I had to click through a bunch of text between Freecell games' then this might be for you.
1117	1	a	See the hours I've played? Yup, finished, done, a few achievements if I really cared, but I don't. So was it worth the price of entry? Yeah I guess. At it's heart it's a pretty simple game with an interesting and simple battle mechanic. The developers do a good job of dressing it up and making it feel like there's more to it, but there's only so much that can be done to make what's really more of a browser or mobile game seem more substantial. The games saving grace and why I give it a tentative recommendation is the battle system. Over all it's not bad, not bad at all. But once you figure out the optimal strategies it becomes a matter of making sure you've grinded enough to charge your 'spell' cards and your pretty much golden. With a multi-player option this would be a total recommendation, as it is buy if the battle mechanic interests you, if not give it a pass.
1119	1	a	This game was a pleasant surprise. Imagine if poker, puzzle quest, and clash of heroes were thrown into a big pot and mixed up. This would be one of the results you could get from that mixture.
1121	1	a	The gameplay is very unquie and is great for people who love card games/deck building games. 1 part solitaire, 1 part poker and adds abilties on top of that.  Downside- Game is not really difficult and the achievement Runespell XL: Play all battles once, has to be done during a single campaign. Which is diffcult as certain enemies only appear at certain times.
1123	1	a	It's a solid game, very innovative combination of poker and fantasy TCG game style. Unfortunatelly, it lacks multiplayer game mode which would be fun to play. However, the single player storyline is interesting and the whole game atmosphere is very nice. I especially liked the in-game music, I must say I really enjoy listening to it.
1125	1	a	Good game, but much too short.  The game has a good premise, good storyline, great mechanics and is fun and at times challenging to play. The only downside is that the main storyline of the game is much too short. I finished the game in two nights and was really left wanting more.  Having said that, if you can find the game on sale it still is a good value. 
1127	1	a	I highly recommend this game. Its challenging, and casual. I love it and im not even a poker player.
1129	1	a	Cool game. If you like poker, buy this.
1131	1	a	Card game rpg? Why not... fun for a little while unless you’re into cards, then you'll have a blast methinks. There should be an 'iffy' button for 'Do you recommend this game?'. More positive than negative so I'll say Yes.
345	0	a	I wouldn't recommend this one. Just play couple of battles and you've pretty much seen it all. The game is tedious even if you manage to play it through in a couple of hours. The story is pretty indefferent: something about fantasy creatures roaming in Dark age Europe and mythic religious references. Sure if you're a fan of new card games, then go ahead and invest. Something new which get old pretty fast.
1133	1	a	This game has a simple card playing mechanic where you play poker against an enemy to win. Powerups and collectible cards also help with gameplay and has an RPG style story that's interesting. A casual game that's easy to pick up and get addicted to. Great little game overall.  
346	0	a	it's like solitaire with someone punching you in the face every few minutes and then slapping your cards off the table
1135	1	a	Solitaire with magic. Pretty fun. No online though.
1137	1	a	Puzzle Quest gets into debt and tries to win a few games of poker.  But seriously though, good game and creating poker hands is a wonderful idea.
1139	1	a	Wow! What a great game. Neat take on turn-based strategy. Good story and characters as well. And a great price to boot!
1141	1	a	surprisingly fun - something you can play while you have your lunch
347	0	a	Ho hum. Incomplete - a prologue to a vaporware game. The card graphics are simply ordinary playing cards, the story is slight to the point of invisibility and totally linear. The gameplay is mildly amusing, maybe a fraction above playing MS Solitaire, but not complex enough to reward paying it much attention. Worth a dollar or two purely as a solitaire game, but certainly not worth paying even close to full price for.
348	0	a	Neat Concept, but in the end too short and too easy
1143	1	a	If you like poker and you like CCG's, do yourself a favor and get this game. Quick battles, just enough strategy to keep from getting boring and an interesting enough storyline to keep you wanting to progress and see what happens next.
1145	1	a	If you are even moderatly good at poker, you can beat this game. Still quite a fun game though!
1147	1	a	It's like Puzzle Quest, but instead of matching 3 pairs to knock your enemies health down, you play poker! The bigger your hand, the more damage you deal. If you like cards, it's kind of fun, just don't expect a great story or anything like that....
1149	1	a	It's like solitaire, except... Oh. Wait. No. Yeah. It's like solitaire. Wait forever for the cards you need to appear to finish one of multiple straight flushes you set up to win the game.
1151	1	a	If you like poker and you like CCG's, do yourself a favor and get this game. Quick battles, just enough strategy to keep from getting boring and an interesting enough storyline to keep you wanting to progress and see what happens next.
1153	1	a	Fun game. It's not as deep as Puzzle Quest, but it's pretty fun approach to poker.
1155	1	a	Imagine Puzzle Quest, except with Poker instead of Match 3. It's a quirky card game with RPG elements. Story is sufficient and doesn't get in the way. Gameplay seems to be balanced so it's not too hard, but not too easy either. The game does seem to go just a bit longer than needed. But it was an enjoyable game considering how different it was.
1157	1	a	Although Runespell has a bit of grinding to level up and earn money, the game is really well done. You'll understand the game immediately if you know poker.
1159	1	a	If you like Alternative RPGs, this is a greeeeaaat one, as good as puzzle quest 1, different though. cool game,.
1161	1	a	Runespell is a decent puzzle, nice poker mechanics and visuals. Obviously influenced by Puzzle Quest, but not that deep. It's not very short, you can easily get 15-20 hours out of it, also there are achievements and New Game+. Music is great. all 3 tracks, so it gets quite repetitive. Multiplayer and dlc would be great additions, but apparently this game is abandoned by the developers.
1163	1	a	Nice little game, too bad it's way too short and way too easy.
1165	1	a	Solitaire mixed with Poker. Instead of building suits, you're building poker hands and using these hands to beat enemy AI to death. A better hand does more damage, and the more damage you deal (or take), the more spells you can cast with your building rage. This system has some nice subtleties, but the rest of the game lets it down. The AI refuses to use any high power hands at all, and instead resorts to using easily buildable hands and spamming abilities to win. This results in a final boss which has a use 5 rage -&gt; do 30 or so dmg loop which it is not bright enough to use. As for the story dragging you through the adventure, it is lacklustre at best, and is not helped by being left on a cliffhanger at the end to allow for sequels and the 'Overture' in the title. The art style is quite good though. In all, a good idea that becomes tedious because of uninteresting AI, and eventually leads to power-gaming to find no end at the end.
1167	1	a	A great game. It is a fantasy combat/ sorta RPG game. Combat is through Poker hands. Kind of like the Puzzlequest games. Same genre as Fairy Solitaire.
1169	1	a	Interesting twist on Poker with RPG elements
1171	1	a	Runespell Overture is essentially and turn-based RPG with a poker-hand-based combat system. You create combinations with cards that you draw to deal damage or heal. The graphics are good for an independant title, but the game has a lackluster plot and is extremely short (only 3 or 4 hours of gameplay). If you enjoy playing poker, have a love for turn-based combat or have small children who like card games, then you may find this title entertaining for a few hours. Wait for a deep price discount, otherwise you may feel you overpaid for this title.
1173	1	a	I highly recommend this game. Its challenging, and casual. I love it and im not even a poker player.
350	0	a	Weird gin rummy game.
1175	1	a	Cool game. If you like poker, buy this.
351	0	a	It's a poker game, mixed with an rpg element. Pretty shallow. Difficulty scaling is pretty messed up?
1177	1	a	The Game is awesome. A Mix of Magic &amp; Poker with a touch of Fantasy.
1179	1	a	Good game and fun to play some poker-like-game. Had fun playing it, but wouldn't pay full price, wait till it's on sale :)
354	0	a	Cannot change volume
1181	1	a	Just played it through and left wanting for more. It's a simple game to learn, if you know poker hands. Poker hands are used to do battle against foes. Among poker hands, you get to use spells, allies that have different powers and pet abilities. I love the tactic and mathematic side of winning the battles. Not having much time to play and having to get off the chair before my computer a lot, I'm happy that it's turn based and that you can save between every battle. Hope there's going to be more soon. :)
1183	1	a	It's like Puzzlequest with poker! Or if you haven't played that, it's like versus poker!
1185	1	a	Poker styled card attacking game...  If that hasn't sold you then i don't know what will.  Definatly a 9/10!
1187	1	a	
1189	1	a	Really liked this game. I'm a big sucker for card games and have wasted X amout of time on Windows Solitaire so this was a given. If you don't like poker or fantasy you shouldn't bother though.
356	0	a	Appallingly awful - spent ages setting things up, then ended abruptly in a ridiculous way that bore no relation to anything that had happened up to that point. Voice acting ranged from average (main character) to laughably bad (hotel manager).
1191	1	a	There are a few negative moments with this game like, some of the voice acting. But If you do like puzzle solving and classic point a click games, than give this one a try. These classic type of games are few and between. I feel that some people weren't giving this one a better chance. Story line is pretty simply, you are a detective solving a possible murder. Characters in game are some what interesting, but will get boring after awhile talking to them. And the setting in game could have been worked on more. Breakdown - Graphics: 2/5, sound 3/5, fun factor 3/5, difficulty 3/5, controls 4/5.
360	0	a	'A call button... purple maybe....'  OPTION A: *PRESS IT?* OPTION B: *DON'T PRESS IT?*  *SELECTED: OPTION A*  '...PRESS it...!' *Presses button.  And then... well... yes.  CONS:   1) Bad voice acting: Atrocious. 2) Gordon Ramsay didn't give his permission to be the main character, or in costume. 3) The ending.  PROS:   1) It's so stupid it's amusing at times. 2) A dog is a scholar, apparently.  Do I recommend? Oh gawd, no.   Was it gifted to you? Good luck with that!  ..then again, it's so bad it's amusing... watch a 'Let's Play' or something instead :)
1193	1	a	This was a very dull game. There was no humor that I could tell. The dialog was dull and boring and very mono toned. It was as basic as you can get with a clicking game that did not have alot to explore. The overall game was really hard to understand what was going on and what the main objective was. There are 4 different endings to this game so that is the one thing i found enjoyable. It was really hard to understand were to go and what to do in the game while playing since the dialogue didn't give much hint to it. The graphics were decent for how old this game looked and played. The music came in at the worst times. The only mini game that was enjoyable with this game was billiards, but that had its downfall due to the computer having mad skills when it needed them. It was a complicated point and click game that wasn't satisfying at all. I kind of wished I didn't buy this one but am glad I finished the game to tell you guys not to buy it, even if you are a fan of this genre.
361	0	a	The voice acting has got to be some of the worst of any game. The navigation is incredibuly slow and the puzzle are little more than pixel hunt fetch quests. The few actual puzzles that can be called that are just, well, bad...
1195	1	a	ANTI-RECOMMEND Sweet Jesus this hurt. I will drink heavily, replay it and tell you how I REALLY FEEL. Posting this now so you won't commit the same irreversible mistake I made and shell out money for this game.  
1197	1	a	The game isn't all that bad, the story is quite interesting, if your into solving crime and finding clues, this might just interest you.  But if your one to just want all the action and great voice acting, then this ain't recommended for you.  I personally think this game is a good game and I fairly enjoyed it, even though the english is kinda bad in way.  Recommended for people who like puzzle and crime solving games.
380	0	a	First off it should be mentioned that 'Dead moutaineer's hotel' is an old russian movie, which would be fine if the store page would mention it, so you could research the movie at least a bit in advance.  Both Knox and VanDine would turn in their graves when seeing this misleading summary, that actually makes you think this is a fair and square detective mystery, while it actually isn't. And even if you are tolerant enough to call it a detective mystery you will soon find out that it isn't fair at all, since:     The number of clues telling you that everyone here is an alien robot,built to observe humanity is exactly zero.  Rather late in the game you get a clue that aliens might be somehow involved, by finding a strange device which would as well be a very sophisticated bomb.  But no matter how you look at it, its not enough of a hint to make you even remotely aware that EVERYONE (the detective included) is just an alien robot. The only remote clues in that regard you ever get is hearing that one of the cast apparently carried out some superhuman task (Think it was carrying a safe on her shoulders), as well as aforementioned strange device. - Notably very close to the end of the story.  But even if you consider this a detective mystery with sci-fi elements this clue, as well as the device simply come to late for you to be able to make 'xyz and txz are in fact alien robots.   And yet again, even if you would consider this a valid clue, there is no clue at all that you, the detective himself and the entire rest of the cast, is one of these robots too.     As a movie adaption - passable  As the detective story it pretends to be however it fails hard.
381	0	a	Worst. Game. Ever...  I continued to wait for the game to begin all the way until the credits rolled.   There is so much wrong with this game, i continued to play thinking surely it must get better, but honestly, trust every other review when they say this is the worst game ever.   • The voice acting is terrible, i've heard more heart felt believable conversations with my pet cat. Voice acting isnt a make or break for a game but still its a major minus.   • There is no story!!! Im on a holiday break, the hotel is named after a dead mountaineer, it has a museum room which was once his. Ok. Some one's been smoking in the room and there are some shoes which dont belong there. Hardly a case for Scooby Doo. Then thats kind of it, you spend the entire game following idle tasks with no story, no reason other than to advance the game. then when the end does come you simply dont care.  • It's really slow! You walk everywhere, there is no option to run, even in a hurry 'Quick, we have to get guy on the roof here because his friend is badly injured, slowely walks to roof.' there are some scenes where you can double click and fast travel through the room without having to actually walk the entire room, but yea this plays really slow and clunky.   • You will not care about anyone. I didnt even bother to learn their names, i really wanted this to be a good game, i thought from looking at it a steam sale that it could be good, but no, coupled with the bad voice acting you find yourself unable to connect with any of the characters.   There is a plot twist at the end. at least if there was a plot, there would be the twist but for me and my experiance, it was the beginning of the story, which then ended some 2 paragraphs later. And while im on it, as a plot twist its utterly wank.   Buy this game only if you have played every other game on steam... and only if it comes on sale for £1... and only if you get that £1 from someone else.
382	0	a	Someone made this game completely at home. Voice-overs: Nails on chalkboard. Total $hit.
383	0	a	still have,no mouse the only patch i can find is not in english so i cant play the game ,can anyone help please .
384	0	a	This was pretty confusing, I wound up having to track down a walkthrough pretty quickly. Voices are okay but direction is not - you coud tell they were just reading what they were given with no context. Some more $$ thrown into localization would've helped. Maybe other languages are better.   Apparently this is based off of a novel. Maybe reading that first would've helped make the game more sense, but playing this first makes me completely uninterested in trying to find the novel.
1199	1	a	hey guys i payd for this rubiss game dont do that i forgot to save after a day game than it crashed for no reason than i did exactly what i should to get going forward but the game just frozen like i did not do something so i cannot get thru the part and be where i was in story. i had to download divx content cos i could not start the game otherwise. i feel like iam beeing not carried for my money running after links and links to get download what i need for the game to play it is funny for my money .
391	0	a	Uhhhhh...yeah...  Great price but I could only play it for 5min. The voiceovers of the characters is pretty dry and non-interesting. Didn't catch my attention so I'm deleting it from my computer.
392	0	a	ugh... where to start with this game... lets see if i can put this nicely, this game makes me want to punt babies and kittens... broken from the get go and crashes constantly, however the opening scenes are ok. the good thing is that the best part... before it crashes...
393	0	a	played 2 minutes, the voice acting is unbearable, unistalled.
394	0	a	Doesn't work properly without changing game files, installing third party bloatware like DIVX, and basically jumping through way too many hoops.  I wasted more time on Google trying to find ways to fix thios piece of crap than actually attempting to play it.  Ended up uninstalling without having actually played, as the mouse wouldn't work (among other problems), rendering the game unplayable.  I'd almost classify it as malware, but I'll settle for fraud.  It should be removed from the shop, as I'm pretty sure knowingly selling products that don't work isn't exactly legal, but since Valve doesn't seem to care, stay away from it unless youlike wasting money.
395	0	a	Do yourself a favor. Don't buy this game. Nothing about it...let me emphasize that again... NOTHING about it is good. NOTHING.
1201	1	a	Dead Mountaineer's Hotel is pure brilliance...knocked down a few pegs by some glaring flaws. At its heart Dead Mountaineer's club is a beautiful, brooding, sophisticated, crime noir mystery. The incredible artwork is supplemented by great music that eventually gets repetitive over time because there are only a few measures. The story builds up quite a bit of suspense and intrique that strings the player along and leaves them wanting more. The locations, while pretty much all within the confines of a dilapitated ski lodge are surprisingly numerous, though could possibly still stand to be supplemented. Quirky characters, each of which has his/her own personality and self-interests coupled with a creepy environment that always hints at some form of potential danger on the horizon makes for a rather paranoid journey through the wash of clues and suspicious events the player has to sort through in figuring out how the crime took place, if there even was a crime.   Sounds like a masterpiece, doesn't it? Well, not quite. Unfortunately, there are a number of flaws that prevent the game from being the forerunner of the puzzle/adventure genre that it really aspires to be. First, the pacing is odd. There are moments of intensity while other moments leave the player wandering around with no real direction. While freedom given to the player to solve some story elements in different orders in a way that actually allows for multiple story endings is a great addition to this game, there are some minor problems with the way the developers implemented this feature. The player can actually break the game by doing something before doing another required task, which leads to some sort of missed cue in the game that stops the progression of the major game events. This is probably the biggest problem with the game. Another, lesser problem is that the game is slightly anticlimatic, partially because the major events in the game overshadow the ending, and partially because the game builds up so much suspense as the game goes on that we're expecting a bigger resolve toward the end of the game.  Being the adventure game fanatic I am, I still enjoyed the game enough to put more than 51 hours into it, but I don't think everyone would share my exuberance. Given the flaws, I would recommend it for unbending fans of adventure/puzzle games. At the same time, I would probably advise those who are new to adventure games and more casual adventure gamers to steer well clear of Dead Mountainer's Hotel. For those types, there are plenty of other challenging adventure games that do not have the same pitfalls this one has.  In the end, I would rate this one at a solid 6.5 out of 10, because in the areas where it excels it does so gloriously.
396	0	a	you get the character standing in front of the hotel, and you got through the dialogue up to entering the hotel, and that's it. you have no cursor anywhere on my screen you can't do anything. Why Sell Crap like this. Steam is Going to Crap Selling Crap like this.
397	0	a	Nice, old-scool graphics, reminded me a bit of Syberia. However, story-wise it was a complete blah with no ground for anything and tons of mistakes: You have tons of locaions (rooms) and such, most of which you never need in the game. It makes reacing places so difficult! You have tons of actions which bring nothing to the story.  A number of items which you can view, say what they are and that's it. Usually, this cancels the 'view' action in such games. Once you see it and know what it is, if it's uselss otherwise.. it just mustn't stay active. Here, it's the opposite. You have a generator and a room which you may never 'see'.  Collecting stuff with no need for it.  Tons of useless mini-quests (like seeking for the same item twice).  Idiotic ending.
1203	1	a	i recommend that you dont buy this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game , i cant even get guy to move from spot i started game at . and i hit every key possible hehe 
1205	1	a	A nice classic styled adventure game. A few unintuitive things were needed to progress though, had to resort to walkthroughs.
398	0	a	Good Premise, mediocre execution. Having not played a point-and-click since Titanic, over 14 years ago, I thought I'd try this as the WW2 spy theme seemed interesting. Sadly, it proved nearly unplayable. Someone experienced with this sort of game may do fine, but I struggled to figure out what I was supposed to do and eventually gave up. You have to do so many boring tasks to get something simple done, as if they tried to prevent the game from being to short, instead of making a better longer game. Example (MINOR SPOILERS): struggle to set up spy camera with correct lens (no instructions given), tripod too low for view out of window (seriously?), go back to office and search for taller tripod, try camera again only to find steam from leaky pipe in nearby building blocking view, find someone to fix pipe...take photo...develop photo (no instructions given), give photos to your boss who does not accept them because you apparently had to take more photos (this was never made clear). The game is full of this, tedious and not enough guidance or help. The voice acting is very mediocre (why get sleepy americans to do german voices?). There were also some problems with screen resolution and loading crashes. All in all a pity, as this game clearly had some potential, with great and historically authentic looking visuals. If you like the subject material and have a lot of experience with these sorts of games, you may like it, otherwise, give this a miss as there are probably much better point-and-click games out there.
1207	1	a	Very nice game in general, with an original historical background. You play a SS Standartenfuhrer, who chooses to get involved in a plot to assassinate Hitler, using his authority in the Gestapo. What called my attention is that the character you play -intentionally or not- is not the typical 'good guy'. He's far from noble, actually. His main reason for being disenchanted with Hitler was that he saw  Germans  in the concentration camps (apparently he was cool with it when it was only the Jews). Mild mild spoiler (not really, but just in case:   He doesn't care about exposing the conspirators to his superior, saving only who can be useful to him in the future, or about accusing an 'innocent' man as communist because he was in his way, even after he stated that his motivation came from seeing Germans in the camps solely for being communists or personal enemies to people in power  . This is unusual, and was very interesting for me during the gameplay.  THE GOOD: + Nice visuals, with beautiful artwork in the cut scenes. + Excellent attention to detail, especially with historical elements. + The music isn't overwhelming or annoying; sound effects are cool. + Different dialog options. It doesn't change the main outcome, but you may learn more or less, according to what you choose. + The plot was believable, historically accurate within the context of this fictional little story, and made sense.  THE NOT SO GOOD: * Two of the 'mini-games' inserted in the game are exclusively about luck, rather than skills, and losing them may block your game, forcing you to use a previously saved game. * The first mini-game was quite poorly explained. * The game has you picking up stuff you don't need at the moment. This is a common trait of most point-and-click games, but it kind of spoils the immersion. * Voice acting was... not that good. Some characters were ok, others less so. * Even though the main plot was somewhat solved, many point were left open in the hopes of part 2. But let's hope!  THE HORRIBLE: - The pronunciation of German words was preposterous, especially by certain characters. Every time someone said 'Wehrmacht', I felt like someone was scratching a blackboard. Note that I'm not German, and I'm cool with actors pronouncing 'Gestapo' instead of 'Geshtapo', but some of it was too bad even for me. - The woman who did the voice of 'Victoria'. That was the worst part of this game, and the worst I ever heard. I heard kids in elementary school reading from history books better than this lady did her lines. PLUS: she pronounced the word 'Fuhrer' as 'fur-r', and that wasn't the worst part of her 'acting'. (Another reviewer deemed her probably the worst voice actress in the history of gaming, and I agree)  Not mind-blowingly good, but I recommend it. I had a very good time playing it, and I'm looking forward to playing the next one!
1209	1	a	There should be really more of those games. An adventure game with nice puzzles, not to hard and a capturing story line. I really enjoyed the time spent on trying to kill Hitler.
399	0	a	A Stroke of Fate: Operation Valkyrie is a typical point-and-click adventure containing dry, emotionless, and uninspiring voice actors. They really should have done the game in German with English subtitles or at least cast actors with German accents. But even then, when you supply actors with no personality, it wouldn't have mattered much.  The story takes place after the failed attempt of the original Operation Valkyrie and you play the role of an SS Officer with a secret desire to carry on the mission. Many of the clickable objects provide a mini 1940s German history lesson. It's slightly interesting, but the storytelling is pretty bland making this a boring experience overall.
1211	1	a	Placed in 1944 Mayer, a Gestapo soldier, is attempting to hide his love for men with his never ending flirting with females. Engage in awkward dialogue and confusing puzzles in order to suceed with the plan to ki- TO BE CONTINUED.
1213	1	a	Overhead Mech Twin Stick Shooter with gorgeous graphics, bullet hell inspiration, coop and plenty of content. Leaderboards, 3 difficulty levels, cloud saves via Origin through Steam o_0 and an ace presentation. Picked this up in the EA 'indie' bundle and this one shooter is just about worth the cost of the whole bundle.
1215	1	a	A solid isometric action game of the mech kind that's challenging and fun enough to demand a sequel. There's a 25 level campaign with three difficulties, and a three map arena challenge with three difficulties. There's also mech upgrades, aesthetic upgrades and pets. It's over five years old, and with all the isometric garbage out nowadays, I petition for The Butler to return!
1217	1	a	A solid twin-stick shooter set in a mech/steampunk world. You can upgrade your vehicle's weapons and armor, and even get a cool pet to follow you on your dangerous exploits.
1219	1	a	Gatling gears is an oldie. but goldie. i have to be honest they just dont make games this good anymore. you remember the days when there was a big buzz about games. and massive interest not just by gamers but by the guys making the games. and the way they was describes in demo mags. they use to love showing off what they done. showing you how much better there games had got and giving you demos etc so you could see for yourself how good it was. those days was golden. its just not the same anymore.   i definatley recommend this game. its an arcade shooter platformy type. you run around in what they called a walker back then. and you can modify it build it up improve it get better weapons and even change the way the walker looks.  its just one of those games that got a lot of love and attension. and its so easy to see. as soon as you pick up the controller the movements feel great, everything is very well put together. its also a really nice looking game. with nice lighting and shadows and sun glare. black smoke effects that look great. nice explosiojns. and so much more to enjoy.   i promise you this is a game you wont regret buying and its so good value now. a must buy ive loved this game for years. its kinda special. and big.
1221	1	a	I received this game as a gift and after playing it for a while I'll have to buy my friend a drink, tap him on his back and forgive him his foolishnes.
1223	1	a	Major fun especially on a HDTV with a controller. The game is so fun and the graphics are quite good for a game of this price. I'd definitely recommend this game. I'd like to see a sequel.
1225	1	a	A non auto scrolling shoot em up, you can upgrade your walker and the overall artstyle is just wonderful!   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFxigQPjygk 
1227	1	a	 https://youtu.be/OsnaGt0NXbA   Fire up your engines and tighten your twin sticks for 'Gatling Gears'. Overall a very solid game with minor flaws of aggressive forced scrolling and a little sluggish turning on your character.
1229	1	a	I really love this game.First hours in and I am in love with the game.The graphics are just okay-ish. The campaign has a decent story, overall this game is almost worth your money.
1231	1	a	Great top-down shooter....cool graphics....xbox 360 controller works great also...best of all it is 9.99....8/10
1233	1	a	Great graphics, great gameplay, balance, controls and amazing soundtrack. This is definitely one of the best schmups ever made. They really need to make Gattling Gears 2 soon!   5 Stars!
1235	1	a	fan game ant goot game ant 9/10
405	0	a	For me, this Shoot'em Up lacks of that 'chaotic' feeling of the genre. Is a little slow for my taste and poor on the variation of the situations so is very probably to fall on monotony. Have some customization for your ship and challenges to take on but nothing special to recomend it.  Requires EA activation.
406	0	a	Its good fun, and not too hard. The only problem I have is the game getting stuck at a point (for me, the end of the first level on Katharsis) with no way to progress. It seems to be common and it's quite frustrating.
1237	1	a	
1239	1	a	A decent, but safe and familiar, twin stick shooter that takes a little while to get interesting. The later levels are more fun and provide enough of a challenge to entertain me.  6.5/10
1241	1	a	Very nice co-op. Was a bit shame that it was only for 2-players but still... funny game. Maybe wouldn''t play singe player though.
1243	1	a	Judging by its cover, one wouldn't immediately assume Gatling Gears to be a bullet hell shooter. Features familiar to this genre include dodging insane amounts of enemies and projectiles mid-combat as the camera forcefully pans horizontally or vertically.   Gatling Gears mixes the formula up by letting the player drive a ground-based machine. This not only heightens the player's maneuverability, but it also allows him to control the pace of the camera - a nice addition that aids the less hardcore audience.  For combat, there are a total of four different weapons at the player's disposal, three of which are upgradeable by collecting gold scattered through the levels. Using them skillfully is pivotal to maintaining a high multiplier which will boost your ranks in the leaderboards and unlock aesthetics.  In terms of a bullet hell shooter, Gatling Gears is arguably the most beautiful. However, it is neither the most challenging nor the most memorable. It's also pretty repetitive.  Grade: C
1245	1	a	Fun little twin stick shooter. Campaign is about 5 hrs long. It's enjoyable if you have time to burn.
1247	1	a	Excellent co-op experience. Ranks up there with Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light.
1249	1	a	If Gatling Gears didn't require the absurd Origin login and require an internet connection every time you try to boot up the singleplayer game, I would probably more highly recommend this game. It's a hell of a lot of fun if you're a fan of any modern twin stick shooter and it really challenges you early on. If you can look past the terrible DRM, you'll have a lot of fun with this one.
1251	1	a	Nothing will give you the shooting satisfaction of this game. The graphics are beutiful. Lots of explotions and different weapons.
1253	1	a	Reminds me of polished Amiga titles like Chaos Engine and Disposable Heroes. Noisy 3D shoot-em-up that gets quite difficult but challenges in a good way, best played with twin analog stick controller.
1255	1	a	Very good, polished and dissestressing
1257	1	a	Shank 2 its very good game, like shadows dancer, metal slug, final fight or other retro games but with more best graphics design,best game play.... very good time..so cool...so fun..
1259	1	a	Shank 2 is a cheap game in every way, its hard, and occasionaly unfair. Its hard for me to recommend it. But still, I cant be unfair just because I've lost my nerves playing it. When you make it work it offers decent fun, interesting cartoon-network-like design, and some nice music.  Before you start, however, you better be playing this on the controller. Don't you even dare to play this on the mouse and keyboard, because you'll be cursing the day when you were born. I had to because my controller was working in one part of the day, and stopped in another (I dont have problems with other games). With the mouse and keyboard you are controlling your movement on the keyboard (also throwing grenades/molotovs/knives), and attacking with the mouse. The problem is that your character is following mouse cursor, so he attacks and shoots in the way where the pointer is, and if you don't pay attention you will swing/shoot/throw grenade in the wrong direction.  Another problem with controlls is that they are going nuts in co-op mode after you call-in menu window on 'esc' and close it, or Steam overlay on 'shift+tab'. Your character is dodging instead of moving (or even completelly stopping), using heavy instead of light attacks,... The only way to fix this is to press 'esc' again and then close menu window.  Boss battles are epic, especially the last two, that is - if you know how to dance... Just as with all other bosses in the game early fight is relatively easy. When their health comes near the first half you are getting an opportunity to perform some special attack that trigers a cutscene. Afterwards 5#!t hits the fan; since they are considerably larger than your character you can be damn sure they are going to exploit that in every possible way: they are going to grab you and squeeze like a lemon, throw you around like a rock, burn you, slice you in pieces, call their minions to help them, and generaly just make your life as miserable as they can.  By accomplishing certain tasks in the game you will unlock other characters with their own bonuses, and you can also use them in the co-op survival mode. You can play it alone or with the friend, and you have to survive 30 waves of enemies. With their elimination you are getting gold which you can spend in the shop (items are unlocking progressively), on healing, decoys, turrets, all of those will come in handy vs bosses (and zombies too).  I also have to say that playing hard mode of this game (no checkpoints in levels, once you die you have to start all over again) reminded me on the past when I have played, as a kid, NES games and throwed my controllers in anger....    
1261	1	a	The campaign is fun, but the real beautiful core of this game is in the survival mode, which is one of the most delightful co-op experiences I've ever had. It's tough but fair. Get a co-op partner and ♥♥♥♥ some mooks up
1263	1	a	Pros  * Great gameplay, tight controls. * Tons of enemy and weapon variety. * Really satisfying combat, very meaty, natural and robust. * Really hard, start in normal difficulty.  Cons  * Checkpoints are few and far between, it's very frustrating to have to replay the last 20 minutes because you died near the end of the level. Sometimes the only checkpoint in a level is just before you get to the boss. * The game is cruel, if you die it gimps you by removing two ammo from your explosive weapons (you have three in total). It sucks because it often means you have to kill the boss without the often much needed help from grenades/mines/molotov, especially in hard mode.
1265	1	a	Such a fantastic and affordable game. Great story lines with over the top action and mayhem! Harkens to the games on my yesteryears (I'm 40!) when you knew an epic boss battle was just around the corner! I discovered this game first and must go back to pay the original Shank. I can't wait! Full controller support is a bonus too. Highly recommended!
1267	1	a	Do you wanna gut your way through a variety of foes continuously with your shank until they drop to the floor? Or Would you prefer to juggle them in the air with your machete? No?...Well then how about shredding them to bits with your chainsaw? Still not satisfied? Ok, lets throw a handgun or two into the mix? Nawww...What you really want is a shotgun, right? And maybe a grenade to go with your molotove cocktail? If you still aint smiling at the thought of all this, well, then...you my friend dont know what a REAL game is...  Shank 2 is an awesomely fun, yet challenging game; a veritable mesh of some of the more old-school platforming experiences mixed with the new. And if the campaign aint enough for you, and you have a friend that has some free time, then crank up the Survival mode and try and protect yo stash together against countless waves of enemies...and uh...zombies from time to time. Watch as you quickly lose track of time being sucked in by the thrill and enjoyment :D  Oh...and I forgot to mention that there is also a female character, complete with her own set of weapons and arsenal too? Yeah, thats right, and she's hawt...so go and spend that $9.99 you cheap ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Cause there aint many games out there that deliver the same punch as this one for such a low price. Peace :D  
1269	1	a	Shank 2 is not a thing to remember for long, but the things it brings are undoubtedly bloody, crazy, weird and, best of all, entertaining like the first game. Although it's a slightly crippled remake of Shank, it's still good, but the gameplay just seems icky when compared to its superior predecessor.        Shank 2 - Ad&nbsp;
1271	1	a	Great 2D beat-em-up  PROS +Big Arsenal +Great Battle System +Nice artstyle +Big amount of skins +Nice storyline +Survival Mode with coop  CONS -NO coop for campaign -A bit short  Nice and enjoyable beat-em-up=)
1273	1	a	THIS GAME IS AMAZING!! Mark of the Ninja without stealth, this Commando-esque game is worth every penny. Very fun and challenging at times, just like Mark of the Ninja is. The creators have really shown their talent with this game. Get this game!!
1275	1	a	Interestingly enough, I ended up picking up Shank 2 before the original. Don't ask why, I honestly don't remember other than it was somewhat of an impulse buy as I loved the demo. If you've played the original Shank, you know what you're getting into. If you haven't, Shank is a grind house style 2D action game where you shoot, slash, and sometimes shank your way through waves of enemies. The artwork is all 2D in a hand drawn style and looks beautiful. Excellent character animations (especially death animations) really bring the game to life. While the original Shank was relatively bare bones in terms of level presentation Shank 2 has a lot going on in these levels. It's not exactly Rayman Origins but it does look pretty great.  In terms of game play this is a huge step up from the original. There is a much better counter system, the grab system is a little more robust, and the game actually encourages you to try different weapons as there are far more enemy types in this game compared to the original. In the original, I made it through the entire game using the starter weapons, which is not how Shank 2 plays. Shank 2's levels are longer, more challenging, and require you to really think about your load out before each mission as you can't change on the fly like in the original Shank. Whereas in the original Shank the game was divided into bite sized levels (which helps a ton when attempting hard mode by the way), Shank 2's levels are fuller, longer, and always feature a boss battle at the end. While most bosses are actually quite more challenging than the original Shank there are a few that are pretty cheap and winning takes more luck than skill. Fortunately, once you get to a boss you have a checkpoint (even on hard mode) so you really get a chance to learn what you are doing wrong and how to overcome the enemy.  As far as controls go, however, I can't recommend playing this game with a keyboard and mouse. I never even attempted it but as with most 2D, side scrolling games a controller is almost necessary for success. Fortunately, if you have a controller, the game controls beautifully. Actions are very responsive which helps when dealing with swarms.  In addition to the main story mode (which has two difficulties that don't stack with achievements) there is an online co-op survival mode. This is a welcome addition as the original Shank only had local co-op (which was fun, if a bit easy). This mode, however, is VERY difficult. There are a number of different stages and you are dealing with almost every type of enemy in the game. It takes practice, but with another player it's doable.   Regarding achievements there are far more than the first Shank (almost twice as many). Most of these are kill grinds with different weapons or level specific actions in addition to difficulty modes as well. The survival mode achievements are tough, but definitely possible if you have someone else. Trying it solo is not recommended.  Although I hadn't played the original Shank until after the sequel I thoroughly enjoyed this game. The visual style is amazing, the game play is fun and challenging, and even the soundtrack is pretty great. I would highly recommend playing the original Shank (even if it is an inferior game overall) as it will get you used to the play style. Even though it's not as good as the sequel it's still definitely worth playing and if you have a friend and two controllers, you can do the co-op campaign which is short and easy but still fun with two people).  I highly recommend Shank 2 to any action fans out there. The action is fast, fun, and extremely violent. There are a wide variety of enemies to fight (most requiring different strategies or weapon load outs) and some great boss battles.  8.5/10
1277	1	a	A good game, improves on the predecessor on all aspects except maybe the campaign is still short, also is less frustrating than the first one on hard difficulty! Rating: ★★★★★
1279	1	a	So good ,I like game cartoon graphic!  10/10 In the BEST ♥♥♥♥♥
1281	1	a	This game ought to have more attention. Side scrolling hack and slash, manly death heterosexual warfare. The only game I can think of in which a solution to a shark attack is ripping its jaws out from its mouth. Over the top violence without being lol edgy.
1283	1	a	This game is great. You run around, brutally dismembering the minions of the end boss, Magnus, through the use of your shanks, your heavy weapons (machetes, chainsaw, and sledge), ranged weapons (throwing knives, shotgun, and dual handguns), and explosives (grenades, molotovs, and landmines). The combat itself, regardless of weapon, is also immersive.  Also, you will die. A LOT.  In addition to the campaign, there's a survival mode where you need to work alone or with a partner to survive 30 waves of enemies by both not dying (a quite obvious aspect) and protecting three points on a small map from bombers, who put timed explosives on these points. There are many characters to unlock, including Shank's outfit from the first game.  This is an excellent game for those who like side-scrolling games.
1285	1	a	The edgier version of Shank 1. The gameplay got some upgrade that is both good and bad (why would you leave out block just to give me more dodging moves when Shank 1 gave me both) and most of the game is just you killing people for no real reason so no good story that goes well with the gameplay this time around. This time the Co-op action was moved to a new mode called survival; in survival you'll have to kill whatever comes at you for 30 waves and thats all, no Co-op story mode this time. Shank 2 is an okay beat em up that loses points when compared to Shank 1 but works more than fine if you look it as a standalone game, get it if you want some mashy mashy gorey edgey action
1287	1	a	Shank 2 is a great game, so much fun! remind me old time arcades! and you know, it has STEAM TRADING CARDS !! yeap.. even in the store page dont say it , it has !
1289	1	a	If you enjoy retrostyle sidescrollers with a modern feel, along with some dark humor and awesome game mechanics then this is for you. I've been playing this game since it came out in 2012 and I've been playing it since. Before this I used to play the first Shank. I usually play on the PS3, but this is for my gaming on the go =P
1291	1	a	The same as Shank 1: cubic tons of blood, cartoon characters, more violence than in the Venezuelan newspaper, short but with enough replay value, etc. Virtually nothing was improved, and feels more like an expansion, but if you liked the first one, I did, go for it
1293	1	a	Shank is like ramboo.  -fast paced game thats full of action , story is too short and quick to be judged , you feel that theres no story at all. -the artwork in this game is fairly decent. -this game is sort of too short , you may finish up with the main story in 4 hours~ -if you're intersted in action combos , trying different weapons and moves , you may like this game. -well , theres also multiplayer in it , which may extend the fun from this game to afew more hours.  In general , this game is not bad , not worth the full price i recommend buying it during sales or bundles. 6/10.
1295	1	a	Great game, nice graphics and works very good on controller. The survival mode is really good, even offline playing with your little brother, the fun is guaranteed.
1297	1	a	Shank 2 is a great sequel and in my opinion, better than the first game in basically every way.   The visuals are definitely an improvement over the first game, and one of the very first things I noticed was the larger variety in locations you visited. The first game suffered a bit from repetitive areas that didn't change very much, but in 2 you're always fighting in a different area from level to level which is a nice addition.   Another improvement is the weapon variety. You still have the signature weapons Shank uses in the first game, but there is a lot more to choose from this time around, and also you're able to pick up quite a few weapons that the enemies drop for a limited amount of uses until they break and they usually do fairly good damage. You can also change weapon loadouts in the middle of playing which is extremely useful, especially when you're on a boss fight and you don't have the optimal weapons equipped to do the most amount of damage.  Everything else in the game is quite similar with not much change. There are quite a few boss fights which are all fun and some are fairly challenging, especially when other enemies come out to join the fight. My only complaint of the game would probably be the length. It seems to be shorter than the first game, but it could be because I didn't die as often as I did in the first game. It's an action packed few hours, but it's a minor gripe. I didn't get to the play the multiplayer section of the game, but it would definitely add more replay value to make up for the shorter single player campaign.  Overall, definitely worth the money if you're into the genre.
1299	1	a	Must-have. Awesome single player story mode &amp; VERY challenging co-op mode that's just tons of fun. Took us about 40 hours to beat Wave 30 and it was worth every minute :)
1301	1	a	Bloody good time, side scroller with tons of blood, action and just fun to play. Using a controller makes for a more enjoyable game.
1303	1	a	Surprisingly an extremely fun game once you get past some of the control problems. Makes me want to buy the first one...
1305	1	a	Is realy good game but,is hard,VERY HARD
1307	1	a	Amazing game + need players to play with.. in survival mode
1309	1	a	A Fun, simple, throw back of a Beat Em'Up. It has wonderful animation and is somewhat of a challege. Fun for the whole family.....except for toddlers...
1311	1	a	A great sequel to the first Shank installment, which is also pretty good. I love the visual style and the animations in this game, its definitely one of most entertaining platformers i've played.  The length of the game is also good, controls are solid and easy to learn. Survival mode can be really fun, too bad i could not find anyone to play online. I should have played this back when it was released, but oh well. :/  The only thing this game lacks is online and local co-op for the Campaign, which could have been a great addition to the game, but still. I highly recommend both games if you still haven't played it. The first Shank did have local co-op, i don't know why they removed it.  Also, try Mark Of The Ninja, another epic platformer from the same creators  Score: 8,5/10
1313	1	a	Fast, bloody and hard beat-em-up sequel of Shank. Basically, it has the same gameplay as the first game with some tweaks like dodging system.  The most (and I would say the only) significant difference from the original game is the difficulty. Encounters are longer and tougher, but there are more interactive environment elements like turrets to help you. Health/damage balance was improved to make your life harder and shorter. And there is no more trigger hunting on bosses. Only pure skill of dodging their attack patterns may help to defeat them. So, even normal mode became a very good challenge.  Anyway, it's great example of modern beat-em-up game.
1315	1	a	I never play the first Shank, regardless, I don't feel I'm missing anything playing the second installment. In terms of story, Shank goes around making bad people go away by asking them nicely with blades, guns, and a chainsaw. The gameplay is fun and looks great in terms of style if you like the cartoon-comic look. You run around performing combos, grabs, and exchange blows with three weapon types with various weapons. There is a great feeling a versatility when fighting and its fun to be creative and make custom combos.  My biggest gripe with this game is it's difficulty. I'm not one to devalue a game because its hard but damn this game feels difficult in some places for no reason. Wether it is a large abundance of projectile/heavy enemies attacking you at once, small health (or enemies that do a ton of damage), the game will have you contastly reseting until the one time you get mad/lucky enough to push through to the next screen.... only to run into the same situation.  There is a local/online co op survival mode where you take on hordes of enemies as long as you can. I find this mode my favorite, aside from playing it with a friend, it doesn't feel as nearly ridiculous when a second person is carving mayhem alongside you. Overall despite it's frustration level, it is still a solid game I wouldn't pass up on a sale.
1317	1	a	Amazing game. Fluid controls, visceral combat. and best of all, great couch co-op!
1319	1	a	Great fun, good game if you just wanna slice ♥♥♥♥ up.
1321	1	a	This is a fun game as well, finished the 1st game a couple of days ago, gotta say this sequal adds for the Combat and follows the story, it plays well with a gamepad, used a X360 controller, also works with a K&amp;M, but you might not be comfortable K&amp;M. I found no matchs online, its ok, asI played it a while back, and it was fun. If you have a friend to play the game with, i suggest you play MP. It supports both local and online MP. So you can play MP localy with K&amp;M + Controller.
1323	1	a	Single-player is a blast. Beat it on Normal, and then beat it on Hard. THEN, beat the survival mode by yourself. Oh how I love this game. I AM a glutton for punishment, however.

1327	1	a	OK, to be honest, they added simple nothing with this game and I can say first one was better than Shank 2 in almost every way. Story was terrible for me. It's all about going after someone called 'Helena' which we know almost nothing about her. Well, he raised Shank and some other guys from Rebellion that's all we know but we don't know why he goes after her. Apart from the story, they added some things like counter attack, using dropped weapons from enemies etc. They also messed up controls. Blocking is gone and you can only dodge now with the right analog stick. The old blocking button is pounce now and you can pounce fat enemies too. They added more epic soundtracks and animations but I still prefer first one's animations. They also added 'Survival Mode' and you can play online co-op, too. We couldn't because of annoying connection problems. Long story short, buy it if you really want to play Shank 2.
1329	1	a	If you have played the first one, there is no need to recommend this one. But if you haven't play the first one - play it! And then you'll come for more here!
1331	1	a	first game was really nice piece of fresh air for me in gaming, i was blown away with spaghetti western revenge theme and atmosphere, anti-hero and bunch of similar things.... i also highly recommend this second instalement in the series but in my opinion it is too identical to the first game. i assume i would be equaly amused with it as i was when i played shank for the first time, but to me it seems like some extra levels for the first game, it really does not add anything to feel like new game. i found nothing new in sp part but challenges are fun to play with friends i guess.
1333	1	a	A good sequel, but not so good as the first game...
1335	1	a	Buy the game. There's a part in it where you rip out the jaws of a SHARK!!!!?!&gt;?!??!?!?!??!@#&gt;?@!&gt;?#?@!?$@ !#$
1337	1	a	'Shank is back!' From this words a new chapter of Shank's story has begun. After his revenge, Robert 'Shank' Torres returns to his homeland, to orphan house, where he was raised. But there are new threat. A military force called 'Militia' takes over everything what's left from destroyed narcotic cartels. Murder and kidnapping is spreading across the land. And now Shank wants to take care about this problem by his own style. The fighting system was completely remastered. Becomes more comfortable, more dynamic. New weapons and a large number of pickup weapons from baseball bat to various Miniguns and Grenade Launchers. 10/10 Plot is nice, but not so breathtaking as Shank 1. 9/10 Music and Sound - of course it's great. Music is epic, no doubt. 10/10 Graphics - more gore and blood)) 10/10 Cooperative in Shank 1 was showed by extra campaign. Shank 2 have a new mode for single and coop - Survival. Can you defend yourself and important ammo from enemies?  I have to say. It's a great comic-styled, dynamic and bloody slasher. 10/10
1339	1	a	Klei done it again! I love Shank 1 even with all the hate.. Shank 2 follow the mechanics that made his predecesor fun and bring a new level to it! Lots of achivements, hard game and a survival mode will keep you sweating your controller!
1341	1	a	awseome story.. but KB/mouse controls ruined the gameplay
1343	1	a	If you see this dude, just stay away from him or he will shred you to pieces.
1345	1	a	Very short and mediocre side-scrolling brawler. Well put together with no particularly good or bad elements. Nice graphics though. There isn't really much more to say about this one. Would play if nothing better.
1347	1	a	This game is awesome. Test yourself to see if you like it. One point for every question you answer with yes: Do you like 2d scrollers? Do you like monstrous combo moves? Do you like a good story?  1. You may or may like this 2. You will probably like this 3. You need this game 4+ Stop cheating. This is why we can't have nice things!
1349	1	a	If you liked Shank 1, you gotta buy Shank 2. People often talk about the commands, I see no problem with them, of course they are more complicated, but you can rebind the keys, also, the most complex commands let you do more complex attacks, tricks and such, not to mention its another challenge to be added to the game, it isn't hard, but still very entertaining, the graphics are amazing, now heading to the Story. Most people say the story sucks, in fact, it does not, if you pay attention to the storyline, tips hidden in the levels themselves and the secrets(called rebel intel)you can know much better about the story, and it isn't a bad one, you can acctually understand what happened, what is going on and why. There are games with better storylines, but this one isn't a bad one, its just a matter of perception. You can unlock new characters that have an utility instead of just reskins. The weapons and Multiplayer mode are also very nice, I recommend that game.
1351	1	a	Play it if you are a fan of side scrolling beat-em-ups.
1353	1	a	Very fun game with an intuitive and simple gameplay. If you like the genre of 2D kill 'em all you'll definately will like Shank 2.
1355	1	a	Only played the 1st level so far, it was FREE for the weekend, and I flipping LOVED it.
1357	1	a	This game has it all, its one of them arcade games but with a great story to it. Shank 2 reminds me of 'Commando' which was on miniclip and Shank 2 made it like that, but on steroids. The art is great the becuase it is like a comic feature. The combo system and the combat brilliant, Everything is great. The best £3 ive spent, its been a while since ive played a fast pace action video game and this is one i'd reccomend to people. :)
1359	1	a	Awesome game go for it
1361	1	a	Fast, responsive, quick, deadly  SHANK 2 M O T H E R ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ E R
1363	1	a	you have knives. they have knives. knives.

1367	1	a	If you ever played the first Shank, then you pretty much know what to expect from this sequel. It improves on some of the frustrations the first one had, but unfortunately not all. First of all there are more weapons included in this Shank adventure, which makes killing more fun overall.  Second, they have included counter-attacks, meaning you can press a button when a red exclamation mark appears above your enemy. It looks cool in motion and works really well.  On to the stuff that isn't quite alright... it's short. But I don't see that as a downside. When you finish the game (about 4 hours) you've probably seen it all. The game doesn't overstay its welcome, thankfully. And then we have the difficulty. One moment it's easy as I-don't-know-what, and the other moment (which can be seconds later) the difficulty ramps up making it practically unplayable.  It's a good game nonetheless, and if you love beat 'em ups you'll love this one as well, I'm sure.  [Rating: 73/100]
1369	1	a	Nice beat 'em up sequel 'directed' by Quentin Tarantino :)
1371	1	a	Great Platformer and time-shoter :D
1373	1	a	Named Shank 2 for a reason. Other possible names: Knives 2, Machettes 2, A lot of Blood and Badassness 2  +: woo hoo it's a fun game. Nice graphics, great gameplay, gamepad supp, intel to collect, difficulty is balanced, story, cutscenes, blood, blood, enemies, bosses, weapons  - : sometimes annoying deaths but that's because wasn't good enough :(  overall GG, 8/10 would slice through peeps again

1379	1	a	good game, had a lot of fun smashing things and destroying people
1381	1	a	It should be illegal for things to be as fun as Shank 2 is
1383	1	a	What a butt.
1385	1	a	Better than Shank 1.
1387	1	a	6
1389	1	a	I liked the first one more but that's probably because this one is really anal about using a 360 controller.
1391	1	a	Shank 2 is the bomb, quite literally. It’s an action packed title, filled to the brim with tons of gratification, a beautiful outline, tight controls and great replay value. Cynics can argue that it doesn’t offer a ton more than the first game, but it’s still just as appealing as it ever was, now with more stuff.   Full Review  [www.noobfeed.com] .
1393	1	a	This game is extremely fun but the survival mode is damn near impossible alone.
1395	1	a	good game, had a lot of fun smashing things and destroying people
1397	1	a	Entertaining
1399	1	a	It's just good clean... well not so clean, beat em' up murder and mahem. This reminds me of a classic sidescrolling beatemup game that you would find in an arcade, except it's on my compter, and it oozes blood from every orifice.
1401	1	a	Entertaining
1403	1	a	Mutch harder than the first but its good. 12/10 would rage on hard mode again.
1405	1	a	2D brawler with sense of humor. Kick some ♥♥♥'s with this very well made game.
1407	1	a	This game kinda reminds me of Metal Slug
1409	1	a	Some ok 2D action
1411	1	a	This game should have been called Shank 2:The Real Chuck Norris simulator. After the events of first game Shank returns to his home village which he finds outruned by bad guys. And so another epic adventure begins for Shank. Shank 2 is a 2d side-scroller beat'em up game where you can kick some butt and break sculls of your enemies. Devastating arsenal of weapons including pistols chainsaws and ending with brutal sledgehammers. Game also introduces new 2 player coop survival mode which is actually fun and challenging. Awesome bosses fights, numerous goons to kill in different ways, and cool comic style landscapes. So everything is great here and it's full of badass-ery even though game is short but it's worth it low price. One of the best downloadeable games of 2012.
1413	1	a	Shank is back and hes more dangerous then ever. Shank starts a few years after the first game. Hes on his way to see hes orphanage keeper but to find out shes taken away by army people. So Shank joins the resistance to fight against the army and get her back. This game is way better then the first one and is down right awesome. The game has tight controls which work smooth. The combat stay almost the same. You have new guns to youre arsenal like Molotovs, mines, throwing knive, sledgehammers and a bunch of weapons that youre fallen enemys drop. The game has some awesome boss fights which to get pretty epic and the cutscenes are awesome to look at because the art style is still amazing. The game is also hard as nails and some parts do get annoying. Also the survival mode is pretty fun. In it you play as a charecter of your choice and you have to protect three supply boxes while people try to destroy them. Overall the games is fun as hell and you really need to check out the whole franschie and i hope Klei make part 3 soon i give this game a 8.5/10
1415	1	a	I shanked a mexican and he died 10/5
1417	1	a	I want Shank 3 plxxx
1419	1	a	The most fun co-op mode I've ever played. End of discussion!
1421	1	a	Liked the first game?? Then you gotta buy Shank 2, too!!
1423	1	a	Beat it on PS3. Even better than the first.
1425	1	a	One of the greatest 2D games to be used with a controller
1427	1	a	Actually rather entertaining, if not a bit short. Gory but fun!
1429	1	a	Really nice game! The Co-op survival mode is really fun! You can get many hours of playtime when trying to unlock all of the characters.
1431	1	a	I love this game, just to play casual between things. Or you can really competetive with friends in co-op or by comparing campaign scores.
1433	1	a	A smooth, slick, and rather gruesome beat-em-up, but nothing more than that. Also hard difficulty is freaking ridiculously hard.
1435	1	a	Avoid this one, it's inferior to the first game in every way. Weapon loadout is more restricted, the difficulty ramp up is enourmous (even on Normal), and it doesn't have a co-op mode (IMO the most fun way to play the first one). Even the story is much worse: the first one is pure Robert Rodríguez/Tarantino, while this one has zombies, cannibals and other supernatural elements. A real letdown, because the first Shank is a great game.
1437	1	a	One of the best 2d brawlers I have ever played
1439	1	a	Shank 2 puts you in the role of shank , looking for redemption and justice you fight countless enemies in your path with brutal weapons, machetes,shanks,pistols,shotguns and even grenades. The game lacks on enemy variety and combos you're pretty much doing the same attacks every single time. The graphics of this game are like it's predecesor very well done but not great. The story is pretty dull and the characters involved barely have any personality or screen time to develop themselves. There's a ton of unlockables which mainly consists of costumes for single player. The co-op of this game is enjoyable at first but unless you're really into being a perfectionist you won't even care for a second run.
1441	1	a	ITS LIKE MEXICAN CARTELS BUT WITH KNIVES NO WAIT IT IS JUST A ♥♥♥♥ING MEXICAN CARTEL
1443	1	a	Actually rather entertaining, if not a bit short. Gory but fun!
1445	1	a	Beat it on PS3. Even better than the first.
1447	1	a	The Shank2 coop mode has been my top couch coop game with my girlfriend to date.
1449	1	a	Awesome game, i enjoyed the first one very much, so it was a no brainer to get this one. Visually it looks better, the art style is still the same as the first but more refined. The single player campaign is cool, but not very long. In my opinion the single player was just enough, because the Survival mode co-op is tonnes of fun.   Highly recommended and if you get it during a steam sale then its a win, win.   Make Shank 3!  10/10
1451	1	a	10/10.  That's it. Just 10/10.
1453	1	a	Just as fun, if not more so, than the first game.
1455	1	a	A really nice game with brutal animations :=)
1457	1	a	First just to get it out there i did buy this game while it was on sale for 2 buck so take that into consideration. Anyways, i feel that the comments of the repetitive nature of the game are not truly deserving. In my opinion beat em ups should never overstay their welcome and should be fun pick up and play games. Throughout the game Shank comes across different weapons that will help him on his adventure and provide a change in how you approach different situations. While not game changing, they provide enough intensive to play around with the options. This combined with the extremely addicting survival mode makes this game well worth the buy, discount or not.
1459	1	a	Great game, very fun!
1461	1	a	Play this if you just want to have some senseless violence
1463	1	a	Klei Entertainment did not disappoint with Shank 2. Inspired by Grindhouse flicks (from what I've read) Shank 2 places you in the shoes of Shank. I don't really know much about Shank since I didn't play the first game but I will give my 2 cents on the story and gameplay.  Story:  The story is kind of weak. Shank goes to his hometown to see his mother figure Helena. In between the 2 games a new military government has taken over and they are bad dudes/dudettes. Shank only starts fighting them because one of them makes him mad. After that he just mellows out on some booze before he goes to see Helena. The military sets the town on fire while he is drinking. When he attempts to get to Helena he sees her along with other villagers being hauled away by the military. So begins Shank's quest to save his mama.  You don't need to know much about Shank except that he is a cool dude. It would've been nice if he smiled or cracked a joke or did not sound like an old man in the restroom when he got hurt but that is just my opinion. You can also play as Corina, Shank's foster sister, in a level along with the multiplayer. She is a determined rebel member who is probably not a drunk. But you don't get to know her much either.  Gameplay:  The gameplay is excellent. You have a light attack, heavy attack, bombs, and guns. You can juggle people around using the light attacks. You can also pick up weapons on the road that are super powerful but only have a few uses like a bat, a pipe, an IV pole, and a sink. There is also a dodge mechanic which works really well. You can dodge at any point in your attacks. The dodge function will cancel out your attack so you won’t get hit because you are in the middle of one. There are also environmental traps you can activate to kill your enemies. There are a variety of enemies that will keep the game fresh. You have quick grenade throwers, regular dudes, fat dudes that laugh like Scooby Doo, and heavy dudes that go 'hoo rah!' when they do a spin attack. Each game has a boss as well.  If you like beat em ups then this is a game you will not want to miss. A coop survival mode (I have not played) will add replay value and there are also leaderboards, a hard mode, and intel to collect. Getting achievements also unlocks skins.  Buy it!
1465	1	a	Alot of fun :)
1467	1	a	Quick Brawler - 4 hours to complete. Couldn't get the hang of all the button presses. B-
1469	1	a	Same as first one, only little longer but still funny action game...and you will still think that script wrote Tarantino/Rodriguez but didn't have enough of red color and limbs of all kind. :D
1471	1	a	This game is really awesome  Sometimes its really hard to catch because many details on a 2D games
1473	1	a	It may doesn't look like good game, but it's great.
1475	1	a	One of the best games I've played the past couple of years. A bit short, but nice replay value on other difficulties.
1477	1	a	Hard to get into but very rewarding combat.
1479	1	a	this game is boss buy it and feel the power of tequila
1481	1	a	Excellent game with very good action and, ofcurse, violence! Very bad Shank's sequel, one of the greatest disadvantages of this perfect game. Shame...
1483	1	a	I ♥♥♥♥ing loved Shank. I’m putting that out there up front. I loved every minute of playing it. It was really really hard. It’s been a while since I’ve played a game like that. Now, when I say “really really hard, I don’t mean impossible. Super Meat Boy is impossible. I mean really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ challenging. Shank is by no means a perfect game, but it’s so much fun. Even if you aren’t a fan of beat-‘em-ups, I still recommend giving Shank 2 a shot.  We’re going to pretend like I know what happened in the original Shank. Right? Right. What’s research?  Shank 2 is, as previously stated, a beat-‘em-up game in which you play as (appropriately) Shank. Shank is a member of a rebel group who is defying the warlord, General Magnus. Magnus and his militia have taken over the government, essentially throwing the entire system out of whack. The militia is tearing the cities the government controls apart, taking in slave labor, burning entire villages, the whole shebang. For a game whose story is completely unimportant, Shank has a considerable amount of thought put into it. I mean, don’t get me wrong, the story is a tired tale that’s been done a million times over, but it sets up an excellent backstory for Shank.  Shank’s mentor, Elena, has been captured by the militia. Not only does she mean to world to Shank, but she also is the leader of the alliance group. It’s up to Shank and his partner Corina to save Elena and take down Magnus once and for all.  The first thing you can note about Shank is that he is BADASS. He uses a flipping chainsaw and shotgun to take out hordes of enemies, cranes, superhumans, and airplanes. His weapons actually range from machetes to molotovs. Yeah, how flipping cool is that? Unfortunately, Shank isn’t a relatable character in the slightest. I know that the game wasn’t going for an emotional tale, but what’s the point in having a backstory at all when you can’t feel any emotions toward the characters? Shank, and even Corina, to an extent, were too Gears of War-like for me to actually care about why I was killing all of these deranged lunatics.  Putting the stupid characterization aside for a moment, I’d like to discuss the flashback I was continuously having during my playthrough. There was a game made for the SNES called Blackthorne. Maybe you have heard of it. In, a badass character runs around shooting a shotgun to save prisoners, etc. I haven’t personally played the game, so I can’t attest to how good it is, but I’ve seen in played and learned about it. There are so many callbacks to Blackthorne that it isn’t even funny.  Let me give you some examples. Blackthorne’s signature move was shooting with a shotgun… one handed and backwards. Guess what Shank can do? Of course, there is the obvious saving prisoners from the bad guys… I could go on, but I think you get the picture. Before you go calling Shank and Blackthorne the same game, though, recognize that Blackthorne was actually a cinematic platformer. This is a genre that isn’t really touched on as much nowadays, with the exception of the recent re-release of Flashback. My point is, whether they meant to or not, the developers of Shank made Blackthorne cool again.  Before we dive into the gameplay, let’s talk about the art of the game. The animations are all very comic-book-like, which I’ve always been a fan of. The animations are simple and cartoony for such a violent game, but this is hardly detrimental. What isn’t the best part of the game is the music which is… bland. Sure, it sounds epic… at first… and then it gets repetitive and fades into the background. There isn’t anything wrong with it, per say, but it isn’t as good as I would like it to be.  Shank is hard. I know I’ve said that a lot, but I’m trying to ingrain this into your mind. There are two modes of the story: Normal and Hard modes. Normal mode is doable, but Hard is… ♥♥♥♥ing hard. In Normal mode, you get plenty of health powerups, checkpoints, infinite lives, etc. In hard mode, you get very few powerups, next to no checkpoints, and infinite lives. To give you a quick perspective, I beat Normal in about four hours, give or take. I have yet to get past the third level in Hard.  Some of the better things about Shank are his weapons. You see, there are a variety of weapons, like I said earlier. Each weapon has a different amount of damage, speed, and some variation of stun. You will be able to find which weapons work best for you as you play the game. You don’t unlock all of the weapons until the last few levels, and by this point you’ve probably already figured out what you wanted. For instance, my lineup was the Chainsaw, the Shotgun, and the Grenades.  I like that the game balances out the weapons. You have a real chance to figure out which weapons are best for your playstyle. If you’re like me, you like to deal with one problem at a time. This is where the Chainsaw and the Shotgun came in handy. If you like to take on lots of enemies at once, you may find that the Pistols and Machetes work better for you. Even when it seems like a weapon is unbalanced, you’ll find that it has a certain ability, like leaving enemies burning in your wake. The weapons are arguably the best part about the game.  The gameplay is pretty straightforward. It’s almost, but not quite, button mashing. The enemies range quite a bit in size and power, so some weapons will work better on them than others. For example, when I was in close quarters with several enemies, I’d end up flailing about and murdering all of them with my Shotgun. If I needed to clear the field and make space, I’d use the Chainsaw. You’ll find that just using one will not work. You’ll need to chain combos together to help you take down the multitudes of enemies.  Speaking of multitudes of enemies, there are quite a bit of them. These basic enemies range from swordsmen, to female ninjas, to guys with pistols, to guys with machine guns, to guys with axes, to midget bomber, to gigantic ♥♥♥♥ing cretins… There are so many. Each level may or may not present you with different enemies. Occasionally, this could just mean the same enemy reskinned, but some levels do include zone-specific enemies.  The best enemies are the bosses. And there are not as many as I would like. The levels in Shank only end up being about 20-30 minutes long apiece, and there are only eight levels. This does mean there is variety in bosses, but there aren’t enough. For such a BA guy, you’d think he’d constantly be taking on guys three or four times his size.  That being said, the bosses are awesome and also not. Each one of the focuses on a different aspect. For example, there is a psychic boss, and there’s fire boss, and there’s a strength boss. Each of these bosses seem perfectly fit for their levels. Alternatively, there are minibosses in some stages. For example, the crane I mentioned earlier. It has been a long time since I’ve had this much rage towards a boss in a game… You can’t hit the crane unless you’re using your gun. The crane repeatedly tries to smash you with a boat that takes up a third of the screen while guys with pistols try to take you out from a mile away. It’s tough. But I beat it. I can’t get past in on the Hard mode, but I got in Normal.  The bosses are not awesome in some parts… Mostly because they all use the same tactics. To a degree. They have a predetermined moveset that consists of maybe five moves at the most. Once you take out about a third of their health, they all call backup. It’s the same thing every battle. On top of that, once you figure out the movesets of each boss, they aren’t that hard to beat. Hell, even the final battle against Magnum I beat on my second try. For a game that can be as challenging as Shank, the bosses aren’t hard enough.  ......read more of this review at  http://theoblivianstudios.com/post/62088773680/review-shank-2 
1485	1	a	good way to kill some time
1487	1	a	Challenging but fun game with an interesting art style.
1489	1	a	It's fun with very good graphics. Funny violence, marvelous scenes. But it's too short, I could do it in 4 hours in normal mode :(
1491	1	a	not too easy not too hard  has simple controls and very good gameplay
1493	1	a	The gameplay is very good :D
1495	1	a	Hell yes. Works great with gamepad, fun campaign, and great graphics.
1497	1	a	Fun and crap.
1499	1	a	A decent sequel with good graphics and music, lots of blood, co-op survival mode (not many players though), weak story and bad controls (untill you get used to them).
1501	1	a	Great beat-em-up platformer. Put on the Pendulum In Silico album in the background and it's perfect.
1503	1	a	Like a great grindhouse action movie turned into a 2D platform. Just like its predecesor Shank 2 has been infused with awesome fighting mechanics, soaked in blood and sweat, and left to bake in the hot desert sun. As all sequels should be, Shank 2 turns everything up to 11, trumping its predecessor on all levels. Klei would only continue to outdo itself with Mark of the Ninja
1505	1	a	fun to play and great gameplay
1507	1	a	Very fun and controller friendly, an overall decent button masher and I love it :D
1509	1	a	Very fun and addicting!
1511	1	a	Super fun brawler. Lots of really gratifying combos and button mashing. Combat is simple, but complex enough to keep it interesting throughout. Campaign is only about 3.5 hrs. Also has a co-op survival mode that seems cool if you like that sort of thing. The art style and violence are both over the top and a lot of fun!
1513	1	a	Not a prison ♥♥♥♥ simulator, I was disappointed.
1515	1	a	Shank is back with more brutal style combat animations. Action platform is rised to more deadly and overall are harder than the origin. The story is about conflict between rebels and militia. It's shorten and less interest than origin. For the combat, there're variaty of melee weapons, but some are cut and limited in your inventory. Enemy now can do damage even you're fell on the ground, so be careful! I'm really disappoint that developers cut co-op campaign mode off. But replace with survival mode as tradition. Well, it pretty fun with various characters. But they should maintain the old ones, not just cut them off including team combo. By the way, it's good game and great Maxican art style. I hope Shank 3 would be focused on both story and gamemodes.
1517	1	a	Very good game! Fun and fast
1519	1	a	Festival of blood and gore...
1521	1	a	The cutscenes are terrible, the story was ♥♥♥♥, the 5th boss is a massive pain in the ♥♥♥♥, but somehow I still throuoghly enjoyed it all the way through. The level design was great, the combat quite fun and overall its a fantastic short game.
1523	1	a	Rip and tear through these weeklings all while having a vast array of badass costumes you can use! SO MUCH FUN!
1525	1	a	It's the kind of game you want to play with friends in your spare time.
1527	1	a	This game ROCKS as the first part.
1529	1	a	Not as good as the first one, but a nice addition nonetheless.  Story is non-existent and the shotgun is still overpowered. Art is good, obviously. I mean y'know, KLEI ent. Co-op campaign is replaced by survival mode, pretty neat in it's own way (if you can get a friend to play), but again, not as good as the first installment.  So if you want to try a Shank game, go for 1 first.
1531	1	a	Combo potentional bonanza, loved this game, shank 3 please!
1533	1	a	Hard to get into but very rewarding combat.
1535	1	a	This game is really fun. Shank is he toughest guy around. If a shark attacks him he rips its jaw out.
1537	1	a	A decent sequel with good graphics and music, lots of blood, co-op survival mode (not many players though), weak story and bad controls (untill you get used to them).
1539	1	a	Not as good as the first game, but fine nevertheless. Beware: it's as hard as the first one. Even harder. :)
1541	1	a	Good refinement of the fun gameplay of the previous game. A bit short and lacks co-op story mode, but worth the price for me.
1543	1	a	Even better than the first! Awesome!
1545	1	a	The original Shank and Shank 2 are fundamentally the same game. You will be doing the same combos with the same weapons on the same enemies.   They did add some fun tidbits such as weapons enemies drop that you can then pick up and beat other enemies with. Some of those weapons are insanely powerfull which only adds to the fun. However, I did not find myself using most of weaker pickups because the game’s balance was more focused on Shank’s default weapons so you cannot combo as well or as quick.  Bosses are considerably more enjoyable than the original Shank. While they are fundamentally repetitive, they feel challenging. Add that to the bosses are no longer tanking you with their health pool and you have a very enjoyable experience that will leave you screaming at your screen with excitement.  Another definite positive is enemy animations. Though it might be unimportant to game play, it defiantly adds to atmosphere. After a brutally insane and satisfying combo, it is fun to watch your beaten enemies roll around on fire or with limbs missing.  However the biggest negative is the story. If the story was bad in the first Shank, it is even worse in Shank 2. The story seems to have no point what so ever and you will find yourself wishing it was not there. The ability to skip cut scenes is the greatest thing I could hope for while playing Shank 2.
1547	1	a	Shank 2 is a great followup to the original boasting good action and a fun amount of fighting. The story and theme is set more around a tropical place as Shank tries to help overthrow the corrupt mafia with some help from others. The cutscenes usually boast more amounts of action and bloody gore than dialogue fromo the first, fitting for a good action movie. The fighting mechanics have also been beefed up with a more robust system enabling longer combos and more launchers along with new weapons along with some returning ones. Visually the game looks as great as the first with its animated style along with a great backing soundtrack. With an action movie charm, Shank 2 is great for players of the first or those wanting a fun beat em up experience.
1549	1	a	A good platforming blast with humour.
1551	1	a	This game is really fun and fast pased, the co-op is really fun. i really enjoyed playing the single player mode. this game is fun and if u enjoy indie games u should get this game.
1553	1	a	Had so much fun playing the first that I picked up the second one. So much fun too! Hoping there's a third, forth and fifth!
1555	1	a	Try out this bad boy while waiting for an update on your favorite game.  It has it all and only for 9.99.
1557	1	a	The follow up on Shank... also a good (side scrolling) brawler!
1559	1	a	Just Wow !  10/10 ...If you're a Metal Slug Fan ! what r u waiting for ! go ahead and buy it xD ...
1561	1	a	Even better visuals and re-invented, more fluid combat. About as short as the first one, but the co-op survival mode adds longevity and is a lot of fun, especially with a friend. If you liked the first one, you'll love the sequel.
1563	1	a	Another great successor of Klei Interactive (creators of first Shank and Mark of the Ninja). Great visuals, Amazing Soundtrack and Unbelievably enjoyable gameplay. If you are a hack-n-slash fan, pick it! beat-em-up fan? pick it! Like to chainsaw someone's face? Pick it! This game was intended for you! If you have a bloodlust desire, this game can grant your wishes :3 p.s. It's also have a co-op survival mode, worth checking out too
1565	1	a	Excellent game with very good action and, ofcurse, violence! Very bad Shank's sequel, one of the greatest disadvantages of this perfect game. Shame...
1567	1	a	This game is great. I just started it, but I mean I just have to write a review about sooner or later. Right? If you like games where you walk and fight enemies on your way, this is what you need to get. I like the idea that you can range attack and hand to hand combat and the story makes a great first impression. Like, Shank (I hope that's his name), he started as a prisoner and they start to get hi-jacked by these goons and everyone leaves. Except for one person, Shank. He sat there, stood up to them and ♥♥♥♥ed them up. Can't wait to finish this game.  That's a great way to show that you can face your fear right there.
1569	1	a	This is a decent, button-mashing time-waster. It's worth it if you can pick it up for cheap.
1571	1	a	A very good game, cheap and easy to learn. The style of the games great and I love the gameplay. Controls are can be a little hard to get used to, but after the first 20 minutes or so you'll have them down. One of the few rare games when the 'Hard' mode is genuinely hard. Would recommend to all friends. 
1573	1	a	Alot of fun :)
1575	1	a	This is a good side scroller, 2D combat game. I think it is unique and if its on sale, I would reccommend it for a fun Indie game
1577	1	a	LOVED Shank 2, never played Shank (Is there a Shank). Oh well this game was fun and action packed from beginning to end and it was a great difficultly level for this 40 year old gamer. I have really been enjoying these side scroller games alot as I enjoyed Ninja Scroll just as much. This one was a lot less on the stealth and much more on the action. As an 80's kid who grew up on kick @ss action movies like Rambo this one was right up my alley!
1579	1	a	A funny arcade style beat em up.
1581	1	a	16.5/20
1583	1	a	Still damn fun!. But sadly the story is so bad compare to the first one.
1585	1	a	Even better than the first! Awesome!
1587	1	a	Although Shank 2 will last you somewhat longer than its predecessor, it is mainly due to, at times, frustrating encounter design where you'll struggle to differentiate enemies from the background and enemies who are perfectly capable of stunlocking you in certain group compositions. Also worth noting is that already simple but effective story structure from the original is further diluted and merely serves as framing device to move you from location to location without any personal involvement. That's not to say all is bad in Shank 2, though. On the contrary; game plays to its old strengths - more cosmetic unlocks were added, scoreboard bragging rights are still around and combat is still as satisfying as ever. It almost evens things out. Almost.
1589	1	a	The art style and gameplay is just amazing. I love it so far, very action-packed, good platformer. Good job Klei!
1591	1	a	ITS LIKE MEXICAN CARTELS BUT WITH KNIVES NO WAIT IT IS JUST A ♥♥♥♥ING MEXICAN CARTEL
1593	1	a	10/10.  That's it. Just 10/10.
1595	1	a	A really nice game with brutal animations :=)
1597	1	a	Fast pace, 2 dimensions game. And good story line.
1599	1	a	Rip and tear through these weeklings all while having a vast array of badass costumes you can use! SO MUCH FUN!
1601	1	a	Not as good as the first one, but a nice addition nonetheless.  Story is non-existent and the shotgun is still overpowered. Art is good, obviously. I mean y'know, KLEI ent. Co-op campaign is replaced by survival mode, pretty neat in it's own way (if you can get a friend to play), but again, not as good as the first installment.  So if you want to try a Shank game, go for 1 first.
1603	1	a	Shank... What a gaming jewel...  Great game, great gameplay, wonderful graphics and good enough story for this kind of game.   10/10
1605	1	a	I havnt spent alot of time playing Shank 2 and havnt played Shank but its a fun game and reminds me when I used to play metal slug in the arcade. Fun game.
1607	1	a	I have not played shank 1 A really competent brawler with quite sophisticated fighting mechanics that might be slightly overwhelming in the beginning, but feels really satiesfying once you've mastered it. Tight and fair controls - It is mostly your own fault when things go bad. I recommend a controlled for a better experience even though keyboard and mouse works well.   Great art style and animation, similar to other klei titles. Perhaps a bit too bloody for my taste but it fits the theme. It is animated in a cartoony style but perhaps not the best game for the yonger audience due to gore and violence. The story is otherwise completely forgetable.   You have two fighters that you get to play through the story. They vary slightly in play-style are based on the same mechanics. What matters more is what weapon-load you choose - I spent quite a lot of time on a certain bosses until I realized I could do much better with different weapons. Bosses are otherwise just right and are easily beaten once you've figured out what patterns they have and what weapons work best.  Campaign mode is just right timewise, and then you can unlock outfits for the two characters and also play survival mode.  Probably one of the better brawlers I have tried.
1609	1	a	I like this game even more than the first one. The violence is even more satisfying (I'm not crazy. My mother had me checked.) and the extra weapons &amp; characters are a nice addition. It still has a nice challenge to it. I only beat it on the easiest setting and was still pretty challenged to finish some levels.   Here are some videos I did of my play through of Shank 2:         YouTube™ Video:  Shank 2 Ep1 - The Dark Road Home&nbsp;
1611	1	a	Awesome sequel, this game is everything the first was with just a little bit of updating and better animation. Survival mode is addictive , fun and challenging. Really hoping for a 3rd game in the series.
1613	1	a	Great game! A Hack and Slash at its best! I started a blind lets play/first look on my YouTube Channel. Below is the link to my channel! Thanks for watching and let me know what you think!          YouTube™ Video:  &nbsp;
1615	1	a	Shank 2 is a beat em up sequel of Shank from the developer Klei who makes Mark of The Ninja. like Mark of The Ninja, Shank 2 has a really good animations and presentation. the humor, cutscenes and the gameplay really makes this game so enjoyable to play. the combinations of melee attacks, heavy attacks and range weapons are really good that it makes the players free to experiment with a combo that works best in certain situation. Shank 2 is a fast-paced game but it also has some slow motions that works well, it makes the players rest a little from its fast-paced world and come back again. Shank 2 successfully blends beat em up with strategy because if you play just to keep attacking, you'll end up dead. Shank 2 is a really hard game which forces the players to plan a quick strategy for successfull attacks. Shank 2's story is a combination of violence and humor. some times it's really violent and some times it's funny but Shank successfully combine both aspects to be a good game. unfortunately, Shank 2 has a very short length of Story Campaign and it doesn't really do well in telling the characters and what's happening in its world. nevertheless Shank 2 is an enjoyable game with very good gameplay, good animations and presentations. it just doesn't really have longer length and story. 7.5/10
1617	1	a	Excellent game. It's like Shank reloaded! My recommendation is to play it with a controller. It can get a bit confusing and much less fun with keyboard and mouse.
1619	1	a	Shank 2 is a huge improvement on the underlying gameplay for the series. Whereas the original amounts to a pretty imitation of the oldschool brawler games, Shank 2 is better in all aspects (+new coop survival) and stands on its own as a worthy entry for this genre.   Dear Esther may be more artsy but this is the better game for the same amount of money. You wouldn't go wrong paying 15 for this even, in fact that's what they should've charged!
1621	1	a	I like this game even more than the first one. The violence is even more satisfying (I'm not crazy. My mother had me checked.) and the extra weapons &amp; characters are a nice addition. It still has a nice challenge to it. I only beat it on the easiest setting and was still pretty challenged to finish some levels.   Here are some videos I did of my play through of Shank 2:         YouTube™ Video:  Shank 2 Ep1 - The Dark Road Home&nbsp;
1623	1	a	A really good 2-D brawler. The 2-player 'survival mode' keeps me coming back for more.
1625	1	a	Glorified violence at its best
1627	1	a	Love this game
1629	1	a	worth the price and its a lot of fun both in co-op and singleplayer, gameplay is better but i miss the co-op story from the first game and the way that you had to find difrent aproche for each boss, now its kick them till they dead and it makes them boring and basicly they all feel the same, in the first game you died a lot till you find the way to kill the boss but when you did you can kill the boss fast, and feel smart, the same was in coop story
1631	1	a	You really can't beat this game for the price. So much fun with a friend!
1633	1	a	Lots of action, classic story and BRUTALITY.
1635	1	a	This is the best 2d action game I have been played. Very very good for playing with friend or your brother.
1637	1	a	this game reminds me of my childhood , best game ever played !
1639	1	a	Good fun to play, but honestly a lot more fun if this had co-op. Co-op is only in limited survival mode...bah!
1641	1	a	Nice game
533	0	a	And why do I not recommend this game. EA's Origin! Never even got the game running, 20 minutes of painfull Origin create profil, login, enter game serial.

1643	1	a	You warp into people and turn them into blood geysers, is there anything more to say? Good atmosphere, nice sounds, good looking animations. Unfortunately this is pretty much a direct 360 port so the controls are not as tight as they should be unless you have a 360 pad, there are no video setting outside of resolution and vsync, no mouse usage, and mixed control prompts. It's a shame about the lack of graphics options because this game could go from nice looking to gorgeous with ease. Overall the mechanics,unique, well executed, and so much fun it is well worth the full price and a steal when on sale.
1645	1	a	Loved this. The little alien is so easy to control. Good story line too. Still need to finish the game as it does get tougher the more you play. 9/10
1647	1	a	I really enjoyed this game. It mixes top-down, Metal Gear-style stealth mobility with puzzle elements. You can upgrade several different skills that can really change your approach to the game -- whether you prefer sneaking undetected, running and evading capture, or blowing up enemies from inside.  Graphics, sound, and controls are all nice. The story is somewhat linear, but fun nonetheless. Granted, it has that EA account nonsense, but I'd reccommend this.
1649	1	a	A really fun little game that's well worth buying, despite the EA account nonsense. There are some great game mechanics in use and the puzzles are pleasantly challenging. It manages to be both cute and gory at the same time, too. Should note: I was playing with a controller (which works great), so I can't vouch for keyboard controls.
1651	1	a	I have played this for many hours on pc (without steam). I love the cute main carachter, and all of his cool powers. I would recommend this addictively great puzzle game to everyone!
1653	1	a	Very Challenging and interesting game, the way you aquire and use your powers to solve puzzles are nice, the challenge mode is also very nice and the story has 3 different endings, that require you to play the game all over again, however, thats not a problem, since this game manages to be always entertaining and a great time waster. I recommend it, specially if you enjoy Puzzles and stealth based strategies...and if you don't enjoy stealth, you can be an uncontrolable killing machine too! :D
1655	1	a	Very easy game (except a few locations), almost without any storyline, but I've great time with it, it's nice, cute and funny. I don't often play games more than once but in this case I will.
536	0	a	It's a fun game but the EA login killed it for me. It doesn't remember my account and have to recover password every time because it doesn't accept my credentials.
1657	1	a	It definitely is a fun little game, I would recommend it to anyone who wants to play a simple adventure type game. I enjoyed spending time on it. You play as a little critter that can warp through thin doors and such. You can make people explode if you warp into a human so thats neat too :o
1659	1	a	A good game marred by horrible console porting. Poorly optimized and bad controls (arrow keys instead of a mouse, wtf) means it can be very frustrating to play at times. But still, you should probably try it anyway. It's like Portal but with more exploding scientists.
1661	1	a	lemme just say...I hate Origin...the game was fun though :)
1663	1	a	This game is intresting with the mechanics and storyline and also after u get all the abilities u will need to discover some of them secrets which is awesome
538	0	a	i dislike this game, bad graphic quality
1665	1	a	In the distant future: the year 2000, a small alien named Zero is kidnapped from his home planet and taken to an underground science facility known as Black Aperture. He and his mysterious crystal-like companion begin to fight back against the cruel and unhumane scientists by doing cruel and unhumane things to them. Days passed and there was no sign of progress for Zero and his follower, the scientists and soldiers just seemed to keep coming back through the floorboards. Proabably beause they did. Zero was becoming very frustrated and began to question his allegiance, so he did what any logical alien with warping abilities would do. He played by the rules. He would concede to every guard he met and acted politely to everyone he met. But his follower didn't like this. So he got over it.  And you should too.
1667	1	a	There's the good news and the bad news.  The good news is- this is one of the best games I've tried this year!  You're playing this cute little alien guy who teleports around and brutally murders people by blowing them up from the inside. If you've played Unreal Tournament, that's also known as 'telefragging'- actually, this game could easily be named something like 'Telefrag-the Game' :P Now, that's kind of justified because the humans captured the little alien and were performing horrible experiments on it, and are trying to shoot it on sight without any attempt of communication, so... yeah :) The gameplay is strangely addictive and the puzzles (because of course there are puzzles) are reminiscent of Oddworld games, where one wrong step spells doom for the alien guy. Based just on those facts, I could HIGHLY recommend grabbing this game.  Now... the bad news. This game WANTS you to have an Origin account. Yeah, that's EA Games for you. It asks for EA login, then it asks for the serial key, then, after activating and starting the game, it asks for the SAME serial key, only this time you can't paste the damned thing and need to type it in manually. After that, you need to log in to the Origin account, AGAIN, from the game...   WHY? Why doesn't it just let me play the game when I try to start it? Why does EA HAVE to meddle with pointles layers upon layers of DRM?   I guess at least the only 'good' thing you have from all this is, the game actually registers on your Origin account as well, so yeah.  BOTTOM LINE: If you're prepared to endure a bit of pointless logging in and typing a 16-character serial number manually like in the olden ages (or registering an Origin account if you don't have one), this game is AWESOME. Go get it!
539	0	a	EA accout crap.
1669	1	a	Fun little title. IMO it's somewhat underrated.
1671	1	a	One of my favorite games :)
542	0	a	Badly optimised, significant loading times even on my high-end CPU despite such a simple game.  As far as gameplay goes it's a good concept but poorly executed, with minimal stealthing or thinking required.  On top of that - it requires ORIGIN.
543	0	a	Love the concept and it's kind of fun, but. ♥♥♥♥♥♥ frames, weird controls and Origin... I don't mind Origin i use it from time to time, But i much prefer steam, that's why i bought the game on steam.
544	0	a	Crashs and doesn't run
545	0	a	Crashes as soon as you log in, do not buy.
1673	1	a	If you fancy something a little different and enjoy testing yourself then this is definitely for you. Fantastic game to get away from the rages of other games!
547	0	a	This game was not enjoyable at all and I felt like I was smacking my head againist a wall because of my machosistic desire to finish games. The puzzles weren't awful and the atmosphere was okay but stuff seemed off and when enemies spotted you it seemed at times unfair and then they randomly swear at you for no apparent reason.   Not something I'd recommend to anyone.... =(
548	0	a	This game's puzzle mechanics are satisfying. They're definitely unique, especially since a preferred playstyle can be chosen. You can stealthily get around by means of trickery and concealment by creating fake copies of things and swapping around the locations of objects, people and yourself. On the other hand, you can find creative ways to use your powers to waltz on out of every guarded room without leaving anything recognizable as human behind you. You can also blend a very functional gradient between the two. There's plenty of variation in the enemies' appearances and behaviors, not to mention humorous dialogue.  Where the game comes short isn't really a single issue. In general, it feels watered down. It's a great game in concept, but the execution leaves much to be desired. Puzzles lack variation. The art is nice, but it gets monotonous to walk through the same hallway for the umpteenth time. The aforementioned playstyles are enjoyable, but they're not flexible; upgrades are irreversible. To mitigate this, you'll have to backtrack and hunt for the currency used to purchase the upgrades, which, admittedly, can lead to some of the most enjoyable puzzles.  Essentially, the concepts offered potential that was untouched. The game feels incomplete in important aspects of gameplay. Many puzzles are bland, repetitive, or unchallenging. The gameplay is somewhat incompatible with the physics engine used, allowing exploits that get you to higher elevations than you should be able to get to. The game's length is short. Overall, it feels underwhelming. I really do think that this game's core mechanics are far from lacking, but it's the nuances that overshadow the parts that would otherwise shine.  TL;DR: While mechanics are creative and enjoyable, the presentation is trite and disappointing.
549	0	a	I wish there was a way to NOT RECOMMEND games. REQUIRES ORIGIN! :(   Edit 11/26/2013 - Steam finally gave a way to not recommend games. Thank you!
550	0	a	Neat idea for a stealth action, sorta metroidvaniay kind of game. However, suffers from frame rate issues, poor gamepad support (mine only functioned 90% of the time, which isn't enough), UI problems, and swingy difficulty curves.  It's hard to really sum up how all the little problems just add up against Warp. Small stuff like having to go back to an older checkpoint, so you can resave at your current one.  Some of the worst parts of the game for me were the optional challenge rooms, which thankfully were truely optional.  I actually ended up playing all the way to the final boss, then decided I wasn't having enough fun to want to spend the last 30 minutes to finish the janky, unpleasant fight, just to see the ending.  Really the definition of a below average game. This could have been much better with just even a little more consideration of the overall package.  Avoid this one and save your money for the next stealth game.
551	0	a	I hate when I need to loging to Origin while I'm playing a game I bough in Steam. I did it... Now I think I can go back to play Portal - it is way better!  
552	0	a	My video review:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HolQMp6q6A8 
553	0	a	PC port not so great, controls are sketchy and can be frustrating. Story is meh at best. Sad really, great premise, bad execution.
554	0	a	Uh oh, poo my pants, Warp is from EA and indie?!? Hmmm!  The floppy sloppy design and buggy wuggy mess you often run into mid-game definitely brings that indie feel across. Warp's a cool idea with the most mixed of executions, but it's mostly good. It's never terribly fun, but it's not like it's boring or anything, either. It just kinda floats around in the vacant, drooly department that leaves you staring at the screen until you finally reach the game's ending. There's no worthwhile story in Warp, so the bulk of the game should rely on level design when we're talkin' stealth and platforming, but, unfortunately for Warp, the level design remains middling, and difficulty pops up and down unpredictably.  On that note...not shabby! ;)
555	0	a	Game looks nice but on my PC, it runs at ~15fps. Unless I find a way to optimize (unlocking fps in warpengine.ini did jack) it's $2.49 wasted.
1675	1	a	WARP is a stealth-action puzzler where players take control of little alien who is abducted by humans and must find his way out from research facility. He must use powers of other aliens to accomplish this task while completing different puzzles and defeating his enemies. While game may last only 3-4hours it’s actually great and enjoyable. There are 3 different powers to wield and amazing locations. Also to note you can collect grubs that can help you upgrade your powers like walking more silent or just make better use of your abilities. Finally after completing story you can try out challenge room to test your skills and manage to kill enemies as quick as possible. While it may be a poor port from console it still manages to hold on high spot as good indie game. The only flaw may occur is that you are required to have Origin account, and maybe for better gameplay use controller. Otherwise great game to enjoy and relax. 8/10-Overall. 7/10-PC version. 
556	0	a	It's not Portal -- that 's for sure. Stupid people just should refrain from making puzzles. Beat it in a few hours. Challenge mode leaderboards are polluted with hackers' fake records.
557	0	a	This game is bad. The AI is bad. The level design is bad. The gameplay is bad. The story is nonexistant. Another poorly developed EA title.
558	0	a	This piece of crap goes with a hard lock of mouse filter (meaning coursor movement is forcefully smoothed and sharp aiming is impossible). Be aware!
559	0	a	Warp is a console app store game brought to PC without considering the PC client base at all. Not only that but like all games sutured onto to the glutounes corporations you need to sign up for an account under another game client to play it.   Gameplay wise the puzzles are extremly simple and clearly made by uncreative people. You are never challanged and the upgrades you receive are never impressive. They try to tack on some narrative like all modern puzzle games, but that falls flat on its face in how trite it is. You won't want to purchase a soundtrack for this music score either, it's completly lackluster by all account.   *SIGH* you actually feel like you're getting dumber while playing it.
1677	1	a	if you are going to buy, GET A CONTROLLER ON YOUR COMPUTER IMMEDIATELY!!
562	0	a	I Demoed this on console and it was was fun, but this pc version a terrible port. Origin account making and constantly logging in is terrible, game constantly crashed, never got to play this download.
563	0	a	The activation key doesnt even freaking work, this is bullcrap
564	0	a	Horrible game. Doesnt even load, and no one can fix it. Not even the producers can fix it. DONT BUY IT IF ON PC!
1679	1	a	Interesting
1681	1	a	who would turn down the opportunity to play as an overly agressive sentient teleporting jelly that can warp inside people? exactly. 10/10 would warp agen
566	0	a	This game it a bit broken... Its not possible to set the key mapping yourself and you are forced to use the arrow keys instead of the WASD. It is bought in steam but registered in Origin (?) THis is abother EA fail game... Same for CNC4 and Mirror Edge.    4/10
567	0	a	the game is mediocre at best, the concept is kinda cool but not worth $10 i only payed $5 cause of summer sale thank god but even then i wish i didnt buy it. The story is painfuly boring and lack of creativity and the upgrades in the game do very little. As for all the people ahving trouble with the origin account? i logged in once and played the game smoothly ever since the only thing is it said i wasnt logged in everytime i started the game but to be honest i just wanted to finish the game to see how it ended (it was a dissappointing ended obviously lol) and the save game was never an issue. I dont recommend this game because its blan and boring go spend your money on something better. Hope this helps :)
1683	1	a	Nice sense of humor and interesting mechanics. Teriffic stealth action game.
1685	1	a	Really nice little game. It will be worth your while.
1687	1	a	A really good puzzle game that has three different endings. Graphics and sound were ok. 8/10
1689	1	a	Warp is a different way of thinking but I loved the challenge and the game play.
1691	1	a	Under all the bland Indie shovelware that has plagued STEAM in the recent decade, this game stands out as a Diamond In The Rough.
1693	1	a	♥♥♥♥ will Blow your ♥♥♥♥ off
1695	1	a	good game to pass free time.. just u have loggin everytime to origin account to continue from where you left your game else start a new game again
1697	1	a	Warp is SO much fun! The top-down style of puzzle is very clever and fun! If you liked Portal and Portal 2 but wanted something a little more casual, this is definitely the game for you! I have only played about 73 minutes so far and only have three abilities but it is a ton of fun to play!
568	0	a	The gameplay was fun but the boss fights were way to hard
1699	1	a	7.2 / 10
1701	1	a	Great game, nice mechanics. Few skills that work together perfectly. Just the final boss is a slapp in the face because it requires hardly any skill but mostly just dumb luck.
1703	1	a	Bloop! This game is adorable. Dunno why it didn't get more attention. The PC port isn't super great, but it works okay. Show it to your kids! They'll love it. Fun/5
1705	1	a	Warp is a game reminiscent of the old Metal Gear series, but with Portal elements. A stealth game with teleporting features is a bit of an odd mix, and so whether you like this game will be entirely up to you. I found it entertaining, but after one playthrough, I think I'm good.
569	0	a	I'd recommend against picking this one up. The game was clearly built for the XBOX and so it doesn't control very well on the PC. Worse, is that the game, while novel, is not intuitive; ultimately you will find yourself getting through obstacles via trial &amp; error.   I like the idea of the game, but it's poorly executed and poorly ported.
1707	1	a	This game is insanely fun! The little guy reminds me of Stitch of Lilo and Stitch only he has no qualms with warping into a person and reinacting the chest popper scen from Alien. This game is a great mix of puzzles, stealth, and little bits of awesome that make me squee.
1709	1	a	Nice Puzzle game. It has charm, good pacing and the right lenght (about 5 hours). It's not as memorable as Portal or Braid, however, and the puzzles are on the easy side. I would say $5 is the perfect price for this game.   The store page says it requires Origin, but actually you just need to accept Origin's terms of service the first time you run the game, you don't need to run the client or log into Origin when playing.
1711	1	a	Just buy it !!!
571	0	a	Good Point : Fun Puzzle Bad Point : Boss Battle, really, really really HARD
1713	1	a	if you like Portal games... you'll like this one... so much fun and bloody! xD
1715	1	a	This is a fun little game, and the bonus of getting it on sale makes it worth having. Really adorable concept, if the idea of blowing up bad guys from the inside can be referred to as 'adorable'. I'd pick it up, you can't beat 7-10hrs of entertainment for $2.50 (especially when a movie costs like $8).
1717	1	a	Great Game. I need Warp 2 now!
1719	1	a	Terrible, terrible console port. I tried my very best raising the FPS above 20, without any success. Don't buy this one for PC. Even if it's on sale.  Edit: Now that I've got a much more powerful PC it seems to work alright, with the exception of the framerate being capped when first installed. There's a handy reference to unlock it over on the PCGaming Wiki:  http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Warp  It's an alright, quirky little game and quite fun. The port still stands out as terrible though, so beware before buying it.
1721	1	a	EA sucks! They make you sign in to Origin, twice! Then they make you 'activate' the game with a CD key, twice! The menu sustem is also crap. It's inconsistent and clumsy. Please EA, just die already.  That said, the game is pretty awesome. I had a hard time putting it down and played for 3 hours in the first sitting. Graphics are good and control is decent, at least with a controller. I love all the little sounds the alien makes. If you're a fan on minions, you'll love this little guy.
575	0	a	This game is fun, but until they actually do something about the aweful coding, dont buy it OR get it on consoll, it's hardly doable on pc as it is now, I have sent them an e-mail about this but they dont seem to care...do we really wanna support such bad service?
1723	1	a	A really tiny game and the story is simple: you are a alien. You are caught by a scienist group when you fell onto Earth and they attempt to 'look inside' you. Your power is peeled and you need to get your power back and escape from the lab.   Yet the game is very attractive in its idea. The ailen is able to walk through items( including humans ) in order to escape from traps, gunfires and deadly mechine. You need to think where to hide, where to put the items and where to go first in order to get to your destination?   As a Indie game, it is no compare to those 'big company' product, but the presentation and the creativity are really impressive.   If you are looking for a tiny fun game to smile and think, get this one and you wont regret.
1725	1	a	Short but really fun game!
1727	1	a	yeah its from EA but its a very polished game well executed but bad ported to pc, u will need a game pad and the game needs some steam achiv..its charming and disturbing, its a good indie game. u should give it a try :)
1729	1	a	It's a great game where you're an alien running around a government facility killing scientists and trying to escape. Very brutal and very fun.
1731	1	a	Pretty cool game until the last level. I couldn't beat it it was so hard.
1733	1	a	Excellent little puzzle game, the only down side is having to login to EA/Origin at every play.
1735	1	a	I don't play free flash games in my browser anymore, I pay $0.50 and download them on steam now.
1737	1	a	This is a really charming game, I only found this game because I won it during the Winter 2014 Auction, and i'm surprised that i've never seen it before because it's fantastic. I like the art style of the game, The game has quite a lot of attention to detail, such as a 'level select' area where you can pilot a space shuttle and you can mess around with it for a few minutes and crash into space rocks. I've only played through two levels so far but they've both been quite atmospheric as well and i love the underground areas as they feel like they add even more to the levels.   I really like the physics of the game too as the physics add to the experience and add another element to the gameplay rather than how physics are incorporated into most games now, and just 'being there' rather than actually adding anything to the game.  So far it's quite simple and i'm not sure if it will manage to stay captivating for the entire game but right now i'm having a lot of fun with the game.  Only had a quick play of this game so far but definitely looking forward to playing more.
1739	1	a	Worth every cent of the $0.21 I paid for it.  Best game made with MS Paint ever.  Okay, a more serious review.  Beep has some good ideas, and with the recent sub-$1 sale it's was a good value, but this game was tossed out to customers before it was done.  Game play concepts are good and the game is fun, but it starts too slow and the early levels are somewhat boring. Later levels get better, but it doesn't seem like this title was in development for a long time. It seems a little rushed.  Every time something like a bomb explodes, I see black blocks on the screen where I suspect smoke would be, but instead I am getting some kind of graphical glitch.  The user interface, especially the main menu and options, were slapped together at the last minute by an unpaid intern.  Barriers and puzzles are unfortunately a bit weak. I was hoping for a better challenge.  And finally, I think some players give up in the first few minutes to game play when they have trouble figuring out how to deploy for the first time. It took me a few minutes to figure out what I was supposed to do, and it was unnecessarily frustrating.  Beep is kinda fun, but be sure to get it on sale. It's not a value at full price.
1741	1	a	Tight controls, colorful levels, zany enemies...would recommend for younger audiences, not really equipped to challenge an adult audience.   Play this one with your kids.
1743	1	a	 B  rilliant  E  ntertaining  E  xcellent  P  latformer
1745	1	a	I made a profit from selling trading cards I got from this game.
1747	1	a	A real gem of a game, I haven't finished it yet but what I have played so far was really enjoyable. Even if it seems there won't be hours and hours of gameplay, what I have played so far is still incredibly fun and since the game is cheap, well worth it. I recommend this game!  (There was a slight bug at the start with screen size, but to fix this all you need to do is press ALT + Enter to go windowed)
1749	1	a	I played this with my son, so I may have a bias here. This is a simple platforming action game. You are a robot in search of gold in different worlds. Your robot can fly temporarily and you must go through a few different worlds ranging from ice worlds, to desert worlds. The game doesn't necessarily stand out, however the tight controls and the cartonny graphics and animation make it a good play for young children. Definitely gets a thumbs up for its accessibility for my son.
1751	1	a	You be a cute WALLE-esque robot and try not to get blown up
1753	1	a	its nice, starting to get boring but.
1755	1	a	It's better than it looks. The gravity gun mechanic is done really well, and the physics puzzles are solid. And there's new stuff to play with introduced in each world to keep things fresh.  Plus it's really cheap. I recommend it
1757	1	a	This game is a cute adventure that starts out a cakewalk then ramps up.
1759	1	a	A fun little platformer. Took me a little over 6 hours to complete the whole game and I'm usually not very good at these games. The later levels were quite challenging. Aside from some graphics glitches (black boxes sometimes randomly appear when you kill an enemy) this game was a lot of fun. Too bad certain game elements were restricted to specific worlds, like flying and grappling. Some sort of Expert levels with all of these elements at your disposal, mixed with hordes of enemies, would have made a great and more challenging addition.  Well worth the price tag, but I reckon most of it will be too easy for fans of the platformer genre.
1761	1	a	Just bought the game the day before writing this review... I don't usually write reviews on such short play time however this is one of a very select few side scrolling platformers that have actually kept my interest...   1&gt; the little robot you control is absolutely friggin adorable...  2&gt; the gameplay is so smooth and clean...  3&gt; the graphics and sound are just crisp and clear... 4&gt; Great setting  A VERY WELL put together game... I bought it on sale for $1.29, buI feel it's definitely worth it's usual price tag if you are into the puzzle side scroll platformers... Similar games I'm also a fan of are: Limbo, Giana Sisters and Trine...
1763	1	a	Awesome game   A simple game with sweet graphics and good physics and awesome soundtrack.
1765	1	a	This had to be, one of the best 19 cents spent.            Just gets hard at level one in desert xD
1767	1	a	Extremely fun, highly recommended
1769	1	a	I bought this game, laugh and tears, looking for a reason to live. I then proceeded to download the 2 mb of joy this gem has, and clicked install. At first, I was astonished, stunned in front of such graphics. I was in the main menu, in the space shuttle. I bought this game expecting nothing, but it was so big. I have no further need to buy No Man's Sky, this game has it all. Alien tractor poop with physics of gamemaker 2003, I still don't know how I could be more amazed by such a game in the next years. This game has revolutionized the industry of gaming, and renamed the whole concept of fun. As an ex-Christian, I have to admit I changed my religion, to BEEP. This living creature gives me chill everytime I open it. It's a tunnel of fun which leads to confidence and creativity. Before BEEP, my life had no meaning and sense, but I now follow the true life that other people would be jealous of. I often post screenshots of BEEP on my facebook page, but it seems like no one else likes BEEP as much as I do, which is why I think it is the greatest spiritual presence I could follow.  If you are reading this, I am truely greateful for you, because your life can get meaning with the simple ''Add to cart'' button.   This game is a masterpiece, and I will forever be happy that BIG FAT ALIEN released this incredible pearl.
1771	1	a	If you combine platforming from the Mario games, and mix it with the half-life gravity gun and physics, you have BEEP.  BEEP is a colorful game about physics and platforming.  Pros: Colorful and bright graphics. Amazing puzzles and physics. Picking up random crap and throwing it to kill enemies is the funniest thing ever. Many different levels and worlds, each with their own enviroment. Cons: The physics can be broken very easily. Not a very good storyline. A few bugs I've ran into, but not very many. There should be a 1-2 second delay between reloading your gun.   I would recommend buying this game on a sale (I got it for around 0.20$ on a sale) because the game goes on sale often.   Now, for the rating: I'm giving this game a recommended 6.0 rating, but that's just my personal opinion. I love these types of platformer games, so if you don't like platformers, don't take this rating to heart.  Anyway, that's my review.  I'm out. ~Darkel  
1773	1	a	Fun little platformer with a nice physics engine, a nice combat and a very forgiving difficulty. At the current price it's a must have for all.

1779	1	a	ehh~~ buy this game for fun pls, not for farming card :P
1781	1	a	BEEP... The BEST...ROBOT...EVER!
1783	1	a	Robot has gravity gun 11/10 Half-Life 3 confirmed
1785	1	a	BEEP is a simple physics based puzzle platformer. No controller support that I could detect, but the WASD keyboard and mouse controls provide a good degree of control and feel right. You maneuver a little robot that is equipped with a cannon and a tractor beam which allows you to shoot enemies and manipulate objects in the environment in an effort to collect energy crystals. The game also has some fitting sound effects and music for the game's theme. Kind of average--nothing that hasn't been done before.
1787	1	a	It's a game where you play a little robot who I imagined is the love child of Wall-e and Eve. The game has puzzles that range from easy to agonizingly easy. It did however play on my love of throwing crap at other crap. If you are going to play it I recommend playing it carelessly (John Rambo style) otherwise there is no challenge, except for the last level which the horrible swinging physics will kill you. There's a hint that there will be a sequel, so hopefully they will ramp up the difficulty and give us a proper ending. Alright, could've been better.
1789	1	a	-Buy this game on sale -Get trading card -Sell it  Profit $$
1791	1	a	Somehow the soundtrack is more expensive than the game itself.
1793	1	a	This game is adorably fun! Like some weird cross between Yoshi's Island, LocoRoco, the Gravity Gun from Half-Life 2, and imaginings of Dead Cyborg (look it up, it's awesome!), BEEP is worth $5 USD!
1795	1	a	 ..beep?   Seriously, though. It's a fun game if you're looking for something to waste your time on or just mindlessly explore.
1797	1	a	Worth every ♥♥♥♥ing penny at .19 cents.
1799	1	a	Thanks for cards! YAY!
1801	1	a	' a gravity gun right out of Half-Life' not quite 'Despite its friendly art style, this is a hardcore platformer in the truest sense.' not quite. it's a casual time waster but it's okay not worth $5
1803	1	a	' a gravity gun right out of Half-Life' not quite 'Despite its friendly art style, this is a hardcore platformer in the truest sense.' not quite. it's a casual time waster but it's okay not worth $5
1805	1	a	Very good! Genuinely puzzling yet fun levels, at least 4 hours of gameplay.  Remarkable physics for an indie game, though totally exploitable to glitch through some of the obstabcles, though that part just adds fun. I would buy this even if it costed more. The graphics are a bit cartoon-ish, more appealing to children, but that's fine. The only downside is - I could not find a settings menu, so I guess you can't change controls and volume.  10/10
1807	1	a	Tab and Click for Beep  BEEP is cute style platformer with puzzle solving and action shooting, but pity that it's Keyboard and Mouse control only.  Good: - Cute character and world design - Nice Happy mood music - Stage select by spaceship is funny - It's cheap and with cards  Bad: - No controller support - Step on damaged evil robot as platform sometimes tideous - Stage and enemies type is few  Verdict: Only recommend to get it on big sales  Score: 5/10
1809	1	a	I bought this game on a sale for 0,19 cents, hoping that the steam trading cards that come with it, would grant me a profit once I sold them.  EDIT: 0,08 cents profit lolz
1811	1	a	Relaxing gameplay, makes you think, cute grapchic, awesome music and sound effect, fair price for this kind of game.
1813	1	a	Very fun and calming game to play. The physics are amazing while the plateforming mixes perfectly with the physics and combat. I recomend this game to any type of gamers because it really does capture almost all types of gameplay in one amazing game. Pros -Includes trading cards -Puzzles mixed with physics and plateforming make it a superior game with combat -Can run on a wired potatoe -Small price for a large and amazing game -A good game to play offline in like a airplane ect. Cons -Multiplayer I would really like to see a multiplayer version of this either its just playing the levels with a companion or its a death match I would really like to see it -Level editor Same as multiplayer I would really like to see this in the game and you could download other peoples stages off the workshop  But anyways, with or without multiplayer and/or level editor I strongly recommend this game to any type of gamer. 
1815	1	a	Great platformer to play when you have some spare time. Simple yet very fun and gives a challenge. Was trying to move a rock and hit myself with it and launched myself off the map. 10/10
1817	1	a	This game really shows how we can make good 2D Platform/Action in our time. It's the perfect exemple of a SuperMarioBrother-Like that evolved to the better. It's not Super Meat Boy but... The Gameplay is great, the sounds are good,  The Graphics are simply awesome, taking you where we couldn't before  Short and Sweet. The New School of the Old School. A must Play, A must Have.
1819	1	a	Fun little side scroller with a nice art style and music that will lead to marital problems in your 30's.
1821	1	a	It's an ok game. I bought it for 15p so I can't say I was expecting the world. It has trading cards which is pretty nice for the price I bought it at. The game feels decent, it feels slightly like one of those free flash games you'd find on the internet though but generally it's a nice experience that I'm sure many enjoy. If it's onsale for a price similar to what I bought it at, get it. I don't think I would buy it for 3.99 though.
1823	1	a	Note: I'm trying to play all the games on my Steam library and give a quick review. This is based on aprox 30 min gameplay.   Despite looking like that Flash game your dad played one night that gave your computer a virus, BEEP is kind of ok. It's certainly not as tight as Yoshi's Island, and how dare anyone mention this glorified browser game in the same sentence as Half Life? The cheek, the very cheek of it! Despite being slightly overated, and over priced, BEEP has got some substance to it. The hub world in which you select your stage by navigating a rocket ship around planets is kind of cool. Shooting enemies and throwing them around with the gravity gun is also pretty neat. There are better games out there that are more polished and cost less that the 5 bucks asked for BEEP. However I will say I can recommend BEEP if you have little kids , or are looking for something kind of relaxing and easy to play. Pick it up on sale like I did (paid .21 cents) and you shouldn't be dissapointed.
1825	1	a	Considering how cheap this game is, I'd definitely say it's worth a go. The graphics (and art style in general, as well as some of the programming) seem to be pretty sloppy at times, but it has a unique charm to it!
1827	1	a	fun and challenging platformer, great art style, and right now very cheap (1,95 CAD) if you like platformers, then this is definitely worth your money.
1829	1	a	I am definitely too underaged for this game.
1831	1	a	game of psyco or you can throw any onbject do you like xD and some shooting POWER pew pew :U
1833	1	a	You play as a robot that has a gun that can be used to break physics. It's addicting and you die quite frequently. Play this before going to bed.  10/10 would rage
1835	1	a	This game is sooooooooo BRILLIANT! Its addicting like addicting games and coolmath games and that one game RUN 2!
1837	1	a	I got it on sale for $.20, and it was worth it. It's a fun platformer you can play when you're bored, but sometimes it can get too repetitive. It's a short game, so don't spend too much money on it because it doesn't last too long. With some more development, this will be a really good game.
1839	1	a	Kinda fun, puzzle game that you would play if you're waiting for something.
1841	1	a	This is pretty nice game for it's price. It has all kind of different levels, i recommend this game to all who like Puzzle games!
1843	1	a	Super Shooter Mario.  HL3 Confirmed.  10/10 would no gravity noscope360 again.
1845	1	a	Simple game that has some interesting physics aspects. It is cheap so don't expect amazing but if you are looking for simple yet a little challenging here and there, this is a good game on the cheap.
1847	1	a	A gorgeous little game where you play as a jumping and flying little WALE*E robot. I played it for about an hour, but then I fell asleep. In that hour, I had loads of fun playing this cute game. I highly reccomend this if you have a rough internet connection, or none at all, as it can keep you occupied for hours on end.   Things I don't like: *The 'rogue' robots, they die too quickly. *The unlimited ammo on you and the 'rogue' robots, it just gets a little unbalanced. *The death screen, It could be a little less 'horrifying', instead of the 'YOU ARE DEAD :(' It could instead be replaced with a soft depressing jingle, along with a little less dramatic or terrible death screen.  7/10
1849	1	a	Got it with Developer Alliance Bundle for something like 0.99 $ on summer sale.  Died about 100 times and got about 13 hours of gameplay on completion (ok i suck at it).   + The controls are tight (keyboard + mouse combination) and platforming action is decent.  + Physics is unassailable. You could try all kinds of weird stuff in game without the engine complaining or acting out. + Initially the gameplay seemed too easy, but eventually the difficulty ramps up(especially towards the end). Challenges are not very hard though. + There may be more than one way to get past an obstacle. + Enemies are nice, and each have their own unique strengths, quirks, and weakness, which is not immediately apparent. It may be a while before you figure out how to kill an enemy. Again several approaches are possible.  + Some twist or break in gameplay on different levels, maybe a new weapon, power, enemy, new kind of environmental hazard. Doesn't get monotonous. + Music is ok. I liked the weird arab/oriental/fusion track in the ice planet. - Graphics are meh. Simple, cartoony, flash-like. I don't mind those things. Its not poorly done or anything like that but overall it doesn't come together to build a suitable feel or atmosphere. Each planet (of which there are 3) has it's own climate/environment. The last planet is the better of the three. The world, ominous music, come together nicely to give good atmosphere. The creepy firebreathing monster in that planet is a nice touch. - No real story or setting. This could have made the game more interesting or provided reward for progression.   Overall. This puzzle platformer was competant if forgetable. Passing a stage while collecting all the lums - or whatever it is we are supposed to collect- is a good way to while away 10-15 minutes. Definitely worth the price and not unworthy of your time either. Get it if it comes on sale.
1851	1	a	BEEP is an amazing physics platformer made from good developers. It has lots of fun and tricky puzzles that will make you feel determined to solve them. Definitely worth its price especially if on sale.
1853	1	a	Cheep Game only $0.49. Real fun game and easy controls. Nice look and feel. It feels like a android game but is right at home on the pc. If I found this for $10.00 knowing what it was I would still buy it.
1855	1	a	  It's a really cool game, It's like Wall E and Mario
1857	1	a	Get it soon now, as it got big discount, only cost few bucks. It's a good game to wasting your times btw
1859	1	a	I really liked this game. It may be a bit short, but the puzzles are challenging and the graphics are cute and delightful. That being said, I did get this game when I saw it on sale, but it seems to go on sale all the time, so consider keeping an eye on it.
1861	1	a	Bought it for 19 cents and isn't that bad tbh
1863	1	a	Simple, colorful yeah may be too much simple but it has a gravity gun! Give it a change
1865	1	a	For 0.19, it's deffinetly worth it.
1867	1	a	This game is awsome! The level design is good and can be challenging at times. I love the sound affects from the chacters and the music. The game also has a lot of levels and will keep u busy for a LONG time.
1869	1	a	BEEP is probably one of the best 2d puzzle games I've ever played
1871	1	a	Not really a big chellenge here, but a simple, fun and colorful game. Excelente for an younger audience. The controls are pretty simple, enemys arent a big problem. Easy but brilliant game.
1873	1	a	I don't know where to start with this review. I started playing smaller indiegames not that long ago and I'm totally addicted to it. BEEP is one of that little games that just is totally worth it's small price. The only reason that I write this review is that this game really deserves to be bought.   Pro's
1875	1	a	Do not be deceived, this game is trickier than it seems... It was given to me and I went 'oh sure, I'll try it before going to bed'.... an hour an a half later, I'm still on and no longer asleep.. &gt;.&gt;   
1877	1	a	SUPER fun! My only problem is that the gravity gun is broken. You can get anywhere by jumping, pulling the object up, and jumping off of it. Repeat until you get to your destination. Other than that (especially with the Steam sale), it's a really fun game!
1879	1	a	So far of what I have played in this game has been amazing. This platformer is a must buy and is unique.
1881	1	a	In this game you’ll control the eponymous Beep bot in search for energy blobs around the galaxy, a simple setup for a platform game. While you might take this as a small budget indie game, this is actually much better polished than any flash game you’ll find flooding the net. The animation is smooth and the stages are smartly designed, not only will you find it a challenge to complete each stage perfectly, you’ll have to devise your own strategies in doing so as well.  The protagonist is essentially a clone of Wall-E given Gordon’s gravity gun, but the mechanics used is perhaps the most innovative aspect of the entire game. You’ll use rocks to block incoming projectiles and you’ll use your enemies’ miniature carcasses to activate switches. When all else fails, you can always jet pack your way out while gunning down bots with your machine gun; like a boss.  Another twist came from Beep’s partial immortality, since the mothership can churn out any number of bots as it wished and beam it down to the last checkpoint. Beep is by and large, expendable. This means you can be free to explore the stages as you wish, completing areas via some bizarre manners manipulating the physics engine.  If you can’t tell by now I’m totally recommending this game, with its low price tag and the aforementioned features, there is no reason why you shouldn’t give this a chance.
1883	1	a	If there is one word that I would use to describe this game, it would be adorable. Everything about this game is adorable. The world design, the level selection, the characters, the hints, even the death screen. Also, this game has the most satisfying mechanic of picking up your fallen enemies and doing as you please. Wheather that be throwing them away or stacking them up to get to higher places, the gravity gun is one of the most genius things ever and it works so smoothly. The platforms are super fun to jump onto and move around with the gravity gun and the world is just overall fun to move around despite being linear. There is so much detail in this game that dirt specs fly when you ride over grass, but they aren't at all distracting. I love this game so much, and if you do not have it yet, get it. Now.
1885	1	a	Side scrolling &amp; Rage inducing, two of the most addictive things about games today. It has several planets, each planet containing different levels.   In the game you play as BEEP, BEEP is a small robot which has a Zero Point Energy Manipulator and a cannonball launcher, you are up against several different enemies, these include; a Robot, Zappy fish, Allhau Akbar robot, and many more!   There are several types of levels including; Desert Levels, grassland Levels, Ice Levels and Lava Levels!  Flying through space in your little rocket ship, choosing from the levels, gradually getting more and more difficult, enemies aim getting better and a less defined goal.   The soundtrack belonging to this game is also calming, it is space age music, but relaxing. As if 2001: A space oddesy &amp; Wall:E had a child, this would be it!  This is a great game for children aged 7-11, I give it a 6.5/10
1887	1	a	Great game. I'm skeptical about games with large discounts but this was worth the money and I reccomend this no matter what the cost
1889	1	a	Fun and definitely worth your money, I got the game on sale for 50 cents, but the full $2 seems worth what i have played so far, definitely reccomended  ~Rating~ 8 bacon strips out of 10
1891	1	a	An exellent casual side scrolling platformer that is one massive homage to all platformers before it. Fun to play and cheap too. Has very fun and challenging puzzles and gameplay. If the nostalgic premise doesn't pull you in, the beautiful art style will.
1893	1	a	i swear to god i hear '♥♥♥♥ you' come out of the BEEP's mouth
1895	1	a	But seriously what is this game, i bought it for my whole family since its cheap but, I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO SO BUY IT AND TELL ME WAT TO DO STEAM! Oh wait steam cant buy games XD
1897	1	a	A game where you can shoot robots, and use their corpses as a stepping stone. Really smoothly controlled and it is easily worth the price that you get it for.
1899	1	a	An exellent casual side scrolling platformer that is one massive homage to all platformers before it. Fun to play and cheap too. Has very fun and challenging puzzles and gameplay. If the nostalgic premise doesn't pull you in, the beautiful art style will.
1901	1	a	i swear to god i hear '♥♥♥♥ you' come out of the BEEP's mouth
1903	1	a	This is a Indie 2d Platform Puzzle Video Game  I like this game to begin with it;s like a Mario game...  It's have some good soundtracks. Game has a very good tutorial how to play the game. It's not a really hard game to learn and pickup. Fun..... and gives you a good challange.  There are no achievment and some people will not like this. For me not a must have. It still haves trading cards... so you can make a badge !!  I give it a 7/10 score.
1905	1	a	No man's sky in 2D and guess what the price you pay for, it worth it and same as no man's sky it has the need for co-op. Game is fun though.
1907	1	a	It's regularly on sale for $0.49 and while it's short it's worth way more than the asking price.
1909	1	a	Beep  Pros: -Great art -Easy gameplay -Cheap -Trading card  Cons: -None (imo)  Summary: this is a puzzle game with some arcade. the art is great. the gameplay is easy. This game got some trading card too so its worth it.  9/10
1911	1	a	this is a really fun game  
1913	1	a	Cheap and great game !!
1915	1	a	well BEEP says the robot.  10/10
1917	1	a	There's a chapter where you have to stack two robot bodies in order to reach the exit. ♥♥♥♥ing brutal. 10/10.
1919	1	a	Good game, a little too short tho. 8/10.
1921	1	a	It's 2 dollars and could probably be worth 5. Spend the money! Super fun concept in this game.

1925	1	a	HL2 + Yoshi's Island = This Game Anyways here is my formal review about this game Gameplay - Pretty awesome platforming game, totally worth buying it :)  + 4 Graphics - Cool graphics though, I forgot what game engine did the developer use though + 3 Controls - Its ok :3 +1 GUIs and stuff - Can't change resolution and audio volumes D: -2  Overall - 6 / 10 Would stack dead robot's bodies again xD
1927	1	a	This is probably the best 79p I have spent. It's a fun relaxing platform game with some little puzzles. It looks and sounds great. To quote Bob Ross, “This is a happy little game!
1929	1	a	Great Game
1931	1	a	Awesome game with unique graphics and interesting level selecting design.
1933	1	a	It's like Mario with guns. 9/10
1935	1	a	HARDER THAN DARK SOULS. CHEAPER THAN DARK SOULS.   I can't tell if that's good or bad?   11/10.
1937	1	a	Not bad game, I like to play it sometime.  Im selling this game gifts for cs go skins (it can be even 3.00$ or 4.00$ ill see, what u gonna offer), invite me to friends if you need. (2 left)  And i have one more game who costs 5.00$ and im selling it for cs go skins too  Invite if you need
1939	1	a	I do recommend this game, but play it at your own risk. It's ♥♥♥♥ing impossible. The third level from World 6 is the hardest level from a video game I have ever played (I know World 6 is the last world meaning that level is technically the second last level, but still). And yes, that includes COCKING DARK SOULS AND HOTLINE MIAMI! If I gave this game a difficulty score between 1-10, this game would be 12. DS would be 11 and HM would be 10.  Even world 2 was stupidly hard.
1941	1	a	I love indie games that have a story with them just like this one! And for those of you guys who do like these types of games be sure to check out 'Thomas Was Alone', another awesome indie game I played a while back.
1943	1	a	A cool platformer with some puzzle elements. It controls well for the most time, has a good progression through 24 levels divided in 6 'worlds', and it's fun to play. It's not difficult, although some parts can be a bit frustrating. But most collectibles are mandatory, so they feel a little pointless. They should be just collectables to unlock extra stuff. But what's here is worth 5-6 hours of good content. Some achievements would also be appreciated.
1945	1	a	This game has changed my life for the better : ^)             Kappa
583	0	a	An annoying platformer, some will say this is fun because it's difficult, and I'm sure for some that is fine and good, but for me this doesn't do anything special or fun enough for me to want to spend the extra effort it takes.  In the fourth level I started running into physics issues and that sealed the deal for me. When my character just starts flying around the screen not because of anything I did (I think) and falling into a pit, I can't recomend it.
584	0	a	one of my favorite games the story is very touching
1947	1	a	Not as easy as it seems...
1949	1	a	BEEP, is a funny Plattformer, Puzzle and Brain game. It´s was fun playing it even if i do not personally like that Art of game. (i´m a Fast Paced Action lover) Still BEEP was so far one of rare games that i would play some hour´s (until i get frustrated because i somehow being very bad on such games) It doesnt really has Story.  It´s more like short explains about BEEP´s Skills in the levels (There are those 'info plattform') Controls were good i do not had any problem´s with my Mouse and keyboard playing it! Graphics are good. Emeny´s make you think about how to get not killed or get the Tresure´s you can collect. In overall i would say play it and make your own opinion about this game!   Here is now a small list how i would give points for the game in each categorie:  Gameplay: 8/10 (Well made)  Graphics: 6/10 (serve´s the meaning for the game and it fits good with the effects etc)  Support: ?/10 (never had to go support)  Price: 7/10 (5€ seems fine to me)  Story: 3/10 (There isn´t really much about to say)  Sound: 7/10 (like the Graphic´s it serve´s the Gameplay as well in a good way! like having a Jet to Fly with it´s effects)  Performance: 10/10 (no problem´s @ all)   FAZIT: 6.8/10 (well made game, but it could contain more Story in it for better gameplay and more Addiction for the game, as it really has good gameplay!)
1951	1	a	It's a very nice game, where you play as a small robot that collect orb fragments scattered on the levels also 3 antimatter fragments. You have a gravity weapon to move objects, obstacles or dead robots, and a gun to shot and kill the enemy robots. It's a really good game, and it's fun and addictive to collect all the orb fragments. The level select screen is a small solar system i loved that, its better than other games where the select level screen is just something with numbers.
1953	1	a	The game is alright, and at a fair price.
1955	1	a	Spent 20 minutes attempting to stack 4 dead robots from the previous areas to get to an unreachable spot, :P ____________________________________ Seriously i love this game ____________________________________ 10/10 would waste my time gathering and stacking dead robots again. XD
1957	1	a	Heeey and this is my review about the game  You are a little robot, with asmall hover jet and some machine gun.  It's sort of a mario game, because u have to collect coins and 3 stars and it is a platforming game. You have unlimited lives if you die, you have the option to be teleported to your last checkpoint. Graphics are a little bit, classic? it's not high tech at all, same goes for backgrounds. You also have a weapon to move objects, like dead robot bodies. You can take this with you to use it as a weapon. Like bashing it into the enemy's face. Or just small the dead robot body against the wall or ground :D  If you are playing the game, and u leave in a middle of a level. Every collectable that has been collected will be kept and safed. So you don't have to pick them up again. checkpoints however are lost.  If you are in a dark area, you get a light lamp. the light is well done though. Game has some puzzle elements. The game is calm, music is calm.  Game is okay if u like platforming. Otherwise wait for a discount.  7/10
1959	1	a	It's really good for a cheap game. Well made little platformer. I like it!  7/10
1961	1	a	Great, cheap, platformer game. One of the better ones. I recommend buying this game. Don't forget that there are trading cards dropped as well!
1963	1	a	Ruined my life    10/10
1965	1	a	You know what they say, a little BEEP never hurts, if you don't like it there is this other game named Brilliant Bob and it is just amazing trust me, (Don't see my review in Brilliant Bob) so yea you'll have the best gaming experience with BEEP and Brilliant Bob in your library, trust me, I do.

Graphics are a little bit, classic? it's not high tech at all, same goes for backgrounds. You also have a weapon to move objects, like dead robot bodies. You can take this with you to use it as a weapon. Like bashing it into the enemy's face. Or just small the dead robot body against the wall or ground :D  If you are playing the game, and u leave in a middle of a level. Every collectable that has been collected will be kept and safed. So you don't have to pick them up again. checkpoints however are lost.  If you are in a dark area, you get a light lamp. the light is well done though. Game has some puzzle elements. The game is calm, music is calm.  Game is okay if u like platforming. Otherwise wait for a discount.  7/10
1969	1	a	You know what they say, a little BEEP never hurts, if you don't like it there is this other game named Brilliant Bob and it is just amazing trust me, (Don't see my review in Brilliant Bob) so yea you'll have the best gaming experience with BEEP and Brilliant Bob in your library, trust me, I do.
1971	1	a	Not as easy as it seems...
1973	1	a	  The Brave Little Toaster Rebooted
1975	1	a	truly ganteng
1977	1	a	Not as easy as it seems...
1979	1	a	A good platformer especially for the 19 cents I paid for it on sale. I just bought it for another title in my collection though and it probably won't keep me entertained for long since puzzle games just feel like a chore, but the game is made well enough to enjoy if you have a lot of patience. I don't. 7/10
1981	1	a	good game! you will smart by playing this brain games

1985	1	a	physco robot flying around killing peeps and making more beeps while the animals hang out with eachohter no hommo  420 Blaze it/10-IGN
1987	1	a	A fun little game that is quite simple but still makes fun. Recommended if you like Puzzle/Indie games.
1989	1	a	The best game for 10 cents^^
1991	1	a	BEEP is a pretty decent, challeging platformer featuring slightly unnerving robots.
1993	1	a	easy to play  
1995	1	a	hahah what a good game! i got it for 15p, i dontn know if its worth £4 but £3 would be good. i played polarity witch was good so i looked at this game made by the same people, 1337 times better then polarity!
1997	1	a	Great game 10/10
1999	1	a	LocoRoco is that you?
2001	1	a	Surprisingly Fun.
586	0	a	I got this game for cheap. I'm happy I didn't pay the full price, since the game doesn't work. The resolution of the game is messed up and I can't run it in a windowed mode, even with startup commands. This means that I can't even start the actual game.
587	0	a	BEEP has very little going for it. The overworld serves little purpose in the hour that I've played other than to make it take slightly longer to select levels and is overall awful. Once you get into a level the aesthetics are unappealing to say the least. The background and characters are cartoonish, but don't have any particular thing that grabs you about them, but the pickups (antimatter nuggets and cores or something) look like bad gif files of 3D modeling done by high school students.  The music and sound I can't comment on as I turned them off within 3 minutes of getting in to the game. As far as the mechanics go the controls are sluggish and sometimes not responsive and the camera is attached to the cursor but not smoothly and you can easily get motion sick from the jitteriness of it.  It isn't a terrible game but there are so many other better examples of interesting platformers that I cannot recommend this one.
588	0	a	cannot enter the game. tried several times but it always freezes when loading  I believe it is a good game such a pity :(
589	0	a	Well I was expecting BEEP to be a lot worse that it looks like at first glance - yet another 2D platformer.   Still, the controls aren't insultingly clunky, and the artwork, while really low effort, isn't the worst I've seen either.  Should you buy BEEP, then? No, not really. It's got fewer flaws than most 2D platformers, but neither is it the king of the genre.   Also, technical problems prevent the game from being run under Windows 10 if you have a high res display and use DPI (required if your PPI is at or near retina level). Overscan means you can only access 1/4 of the screen with your mousepointer in full screen mode - you have to run it windowed.   So, while not worth buying, it's worth acknowledging the game is polished enough to be tolerable, meaning at least some of the developers on the project could achieve greater things in future.
2003	1	a	It's a fun game.
590	0	a	And yet another platformer which I'd love except for the controls. Come on, devs, if you expect me to do a skill jump while waving a robot around on a grabber beam (2-2, 2nd 'supergrain'), the least you could do is to make sure that: - Movement and grabber can be fine-controlled, separately - The grabber doesn't accidentally release the robot (in like 50% of the cases) - Once held in an orientation, the robot doesn't randomly revolve, exposing me to the big bad laser beam  I like challenging setups, but the challenge shouldn't be hoping for the lucky situation where all controls work properly at the same time. Also, on a multi-try challenge, spending one minute to get back again from the last checkpoint tends to grate after a while.  It may be harsh, but I'll keep giving non-recommendations to any game which frustrates the player by control inadequacies - no matter how good the other aspects are.
591	0	a	Just another unpolished, probably unfinished platformer. It felt like one of the games I would play for 5 minutes on AddictingGames as a kid. The art style is inconsistent throughout the game, and sometimes it feels like they didn’t even try. The gameplay isn’t anything special and the only redeeming feature, aside from it’s somewhat ok lighting and physics engine, is the anti-gravity beam, which only seems to work when it wants to and likes to drop things a lot.  I would never pay a full $5 for this, but it might be worth it to someone else to sell a couple cards when it’s on sale for $0.19. In the end, I’d just recommend you go and play some free flash games or something instead.
2005	1	a	&gt;buys for 19 cents &gt;gets 24 cents in trading cards &gt;best game i have purchased 10/10
2007	1	a	  Worth every penny
592	0	a	At first, I thought this was a great game. I soon found out that on one of the levels, it is literly too easy to get stuck. I got it during this steam summer sale, so I thought why not? But then, I ran into the level. A few weeks past, and here I am, writing this review. If its on sale for cheap, pick it up, I had a blast on the few levels I did.
593	0	a	 Won't start
2009	1	a	I spent the first 10 minutes in mode A flying around the universe wondering what the BEEP am I doing wrong. Once I figured it out I got to the platform side of things where I found it very enjoyable. I am not big on platform games but this one I could make an exception for. This is like a little hidden gem that everyone should try at least once and for the lovely price of 19 cents, how can you pass it up.
2011	1	a	Good Game!! Recommend!
596	0	a	It would be fun if i was four again
2013	1	a	Old but gold.
2015	1	a	I'll tell you what this game, and what this game isn't.  It is: -An addicting, yet casual platforming physics games -Very ingenious with its puzzles  -An exprience worth having solo, and people should go into it blind or based off little reviews -Quite calming -Very buggy at times, but only adds to the goofy charm/replay value as some of the 'glitches' add new ways to finish  levels -Intense at times with battles against other robots, and a lot of the fun figuring out what weaknesses what robot has  It is not: -A game that should not be speedrunned, take your time with it -A hardcore game in any sense, I don't believe the few times that it can be intense isn't enough for the hardcore crowd  It should be: -Apreciated more, I do believe it is quite underrated  Buy it, especially on sales.
2017	1	a	Pretty good
2019	1	a	This Game Sucks. Enough Said. 5 Outta 10...
598	0	a	This game is too hard and whacky to handle not my type of tea the achievements are worthless and they cant speak for themselves!  it doesnt deliver an epic tale,cool preference tho,and globally might satisfy some old school gamers but not me love the burrito master
2021	1	a	A fun strategy game that increase in difficulty with each level.  This game is a really fun, yet challenging (at the later levels) timekiller.  I bought it on sale and it was totally worth it, would recommend you give it a try :)
2023	1	a	i realy liked beep. it has fun chalenges and is a game all librarys should have
2025	1	a	Goes on sale a lot. Worth the $.19 i had paid for it. Great Platformer.
2027	1	a	Take the f****** checkpoint, because 'The 'Lie' its a 'cake''.    After this game -&gt;&gt; Einsten genius -&gt;&gt; P. Nobel of Peace -&gt;&gt; Die  11/10
2029	1	a	I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO ANYONE THIS GAME IS DA S#@T BEST ♥♥♥♥ING CHANGE IVE SPENT EVER!!!
2031	1	a	Better than War thunder
2033	1	a	I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO ANYONE THIS GAME IS DA S#@T BEST ♥♥♥♥ING CHANGE IVE SPENT EVER!!!
2035	1	a	Its a fun game, good to get your mind off things :)
2037	1	a	I thought that it was only an cheap not interesting game. But it is not fully true. The graphics is enough for me and you can kill time with this game without getting bored. Worth the money
2039	1	a	Great game for free time and worth trying !!!
604	0	a	I hate when I accidently go into a portal and I have to start over to get all matters.
605	0	a	I typically don't like hard video games, so this review might be biased. And, my definition of hard might be easy for someone else, so there's that too. I bought this game for the full price in India (55 Rupees). If you get it on an offer on the bundle (was on sale for 23 Rupees with three other games), then you can make your money back just with trading cards (and that's how this game got so many positive reviews). With the above in mind, here's my review:  The game, as such, was too hard for me. The story was not a story, just mere reasons on why you had to go out and control the bots. The monsters/enemy robots/whatever they're called are way too powerful. Many of them can't be destroyed and fire at you a  lot . The game has a demo on the game's website for three levels. The fourth one was OK, but the fifth was down-right impossible in my opinion. The first three levels, on the other hand, were extremely easy. The difficulty curve is  not  a curve at all. it went from easy to impossible in no time flat. Also, the game introduces new mechanics at an alarming pace, with little to no explanation on how they work. No training wheels, nothing (Portal: First Slice was far better).   The graphics are OK, but by no means good. To be honest, even the game 'Thomas was Alone' looks better (or at least I think so). The 'Bonk' engine is not so good at physics either. In my opinion, the developer could've easily used Unity or even a tool like Stencyl. The controls are non-remappable, so you're stuck with WASD/Arrow Keys. Also, right-clicking to reload is a bad idea. Why can't we just use the E key? All-in-all, the game could use a lot of work and in it's current stage, don't recommend it to anyone who wants a game to play.  Want to make money? Buy it on a sale and sell your cards. Want to play? Look into something else.
606	0	a	Kinda janky, and feels pretty cheap.
2041	1	a	It's like mario meets wall e
2043	1	a	I finished the game on a short time period with all things gathered and it was really fun. Waiting for the second of the game . Best money that i spent.
2045	1	a	Bought it on sale for the cards.
2047	1	a	i got this game for 13 cents  +has nice graphics +has a cool asf menu selector like you fly in a spaceship to pick what map you want to play  10/10 id pay 13 cents again
2049	1	a	This is a videogame.
2051	1	a	Made a 4 cent profit on the game after selling the dropped trading cards. The game is a cute and very fun platformer, that deserves the good reception it has enjoyed on Steam (91% positive reviews). What more do you need to know?  5/5 would get 0.04€ of wallet credit and a great game again.
2053	1	a	Gr8 Game  It seems Mario and Wall-e meat each other. There are many ways to solve Puzzles. I'm in love &lt;3
2055	1	a	♥♥♥♥ yeah  I am beep  the master and ruler of the galaxy  I fly around ina spaceship ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ up  on inferior organism through the universe  with my awesome all terrain robot and dark matter  machine launcher cannon
2057	1	a	Pros:  - Nice Mechanics - Physics are really good. - A useless story that you can put a theory to... - Cool cheap puzzles.. - Paid 10 cents for it...  Cons: - ♥♥♥♥ you - More ♥♥♥♥ you - You ♥♥♥♥ you - Killing of your own kind while you ♥♥♥♥ you. - 10 cents for an innocent high pitch babbling ♥♥♥♥ you!  Overall rate 7/10...
2059	1	a	Very cheap and well worth the 19 cents
2061	1	a	This game is cool! If you can't start the game because of resultion problems, you have to press the 'F11' button on your keyboard, then you can press the full screen mode view in the up-right corner in your screen. And then you can play in full screen without any problems! Super cool little game, I like it!
607	0	a	Have you ever gone online and plaid those crappy flash games?   That is exactly what this feels like. It's great for bit if you are playing for free and just wasting time, but there is nothing substantial enough that I found in this game to actually warrent paying money.
2063	1	a	It reminds me Wall-E :) What do you want for 19 cents ? :D :D :D I made 5 cents profit :D   9/10
2065	1	a	Got this, bcouse my roommate is funny  Even do this creeped me out.... (see the screenshot)  69/10 - Would play this game again and again to see weird,... things.. like on the screenshot again . 
2067	1	a	3 hours of platforming for not even a dollar - worth it completely.  If you're able to pick this up on a sale, go for it.  The difficulty ramps up nicely (to the point of mild frustration towards the very end)
2069	1	a	Nice gameplay! ;dd
609	0	a	The game does not even display the whole area. You're often under your screen, and getting attacked from units off the scrren too. This game needs to be updated to even be playable.  Other than the bug fix, I believe that the game lacks a lot of depth. It is very basic. Basic and buggy are not examples of anything one should spend their own money on.
610	0	a	what a stupid game, when you load up the game its just blank grey  the develpers are stupid for not finishing the game and i have a huge pc
2071	1	a	Platform. Walk, jump, shoot stuff with weird balls. Fly sometimes. Nice game to play while you wait for dinner to be ready, if you get it for less than 1€.
2073	1	a	Unless you can get this for 19 cents like i did dont buy it
611	0	a	Beep. A game made for children under the age of 12. Except for the fact that it's hard, and JEEZUS the screams of a robot as it goes off a cliff, thinking there's a hidden area there... *Shivers*   TBH, only good with a mouse. And then to a point. Confusing as hell as to how the game actually works, and basically makes little to no sense throughout the whole game. Haven't played much, but doesn't seem amazing.
2075	1	a	Really nice game for only 5€, one of my favourite indie games!
2077	1	a	Great platformer, recommended to everyone.
2079	1	a	Very Fun platformer. IT HAS A GRAV GUN. 20/10
2081	1	a	This is a fun and cute platformer where you play as the robot BEEP. You are trying to find out why the other robots... are fighting you? To be honest, I payed little to no attention to the story, but the gameplay was very fun! Good music and you can kill robots using other robots dead bodies! I would recommend this game, For $1 you can't go wrong! (Also, it's usaully on sale for 25 cents so just buy it then if you're super cheap) Creative, tough and worth it!
2083	1	a	I have some problems with my desktop(even if i have the right resolution it stilll syasy that it cant this display in this res,but this happens to me to other games too,so..),but my m8 that does have a steam account(wont share cuz he doesnt wnat to ,and we arents friends on steam XD)let me play it when i visited him and it was fun AF
2085	1	a	Me an' my homies got dis game. It's gucci homies.
2087	1	a	  Absolute masterpiece. One of the single greatest games i have ever had the joy of being able to play. Its portal mixed with mario on a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ flash engine with awful graphics and puzzles an autistic person could solve blindfolded. 10/10
2089	1	a	Such an interesting game.
2091	1	a	I like this game. It has a Maria Galaxy kind of vibe, but of course that isnt a bad thing. If you are into that kind of gaming i recommend BEEP to YOU yes YOU. Another point it is dirt cheap! I got this game on sale for $0.19! I was amazed at how cheap it was for such an awesome game I totatally recommend.
2093	1	a	Spent 44 mins playing and I sure as hell enjoyed them.
2095	1	a	it is really fun get it
2097	1	a	Bloody Excellent indiE Platformer! Cute graphics and story, okay music, great level design. Difficulty: Easy-Medium. I really enjoyed playing this physics style platformer. The levels get progressively trickier with more strategy and logic puzzles, with well placed checkpoints to stop them getting frustrating and annoying.There is a nice variation in level designs with different environments and tools changing up how you control and use your robot. The game felt about the right length but I would have happily played more levels or perhaps a game+.
2099	1	a	It has cussing robots in the game and random anime in the arkwork section  11/10
2101	1	a	very simple game!
2103	1	a	good game fun to play from time to time
2105	1	a	This game was surprisingly awesome! I got it free cause it was on sale for .19 and gave cards for .21. Still, I thought it would be another freebie game to get cards from but this game was really fun. A bit on the short side, but totally worth it. It basically is Mario mixed with WALL E. Its a great mixture of platforming and puzzling. I like how its challenging enough to keep me engaged but not too hard to make me pull my hair out. The puzzles were a bit straightforward but took thinking to complete. Plus the environment, music and ambiance were very soothing. Totally worth the 2 cents I earned to play it and I think you should play it too. I hope they make a sequel. They should be proud of what they accomplished.
2107	1	a	Cute little lovely cool game and i like the grafichs ther colorful and defently recomand this game
612	0	a	Game crashes upon running. No fix found.
2109	1	a	BEEP is the best game in the world would have paid $20 for it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2111	1	a	11/10 would buy for 21 cents again
613	0	a	Boring, repetitive, waste of money
614	0	a	Poorly put together puzzle game. Enemies are much more annoying then hard.
615	0	a	Just play a free puzzle game online, and you will have more fun!
616	0	a	This stupid application does not have a tutorial or even a menu with settings to disable the stupid music. This is enough for me to write a negative review without even trying it.
617	0	a	Any game that you cannot adjust the volumeof is a fail in my book. Glad I got this in a bundle and didn't buy it outright.
618	0	a	Not a lot of fun.
619	0	a	Game is okay puzzle platformer, but BEEP crashing my machine on start up half of the time means I can' recommend it. This has been a problem for a good while, judging by the forums, and nothing appears to have been done :(
620	0	a	Had a huge horrible glitch where it was 32 bit, could not play at all, and lucky me, it was before the refund system came out.
621	0	a	THIS ♥♥♥♥♥ GAME CRASH EVERY TIME I START IT CMOON WTFFF FIX IT PLZ
622	0	a	I got stuck on pressing the 'New Game' button. Not even worth it if you go it for free.
623	0	a	Nicely polished game, but gets boring quite soon.  Buy it only at a high discount (&gt;90%) and only for collectible cards.  ^_^
624	0	a	Not bad for the price but poor control.
625	0	a	why is this game even exist? 
626	0	a	Same sh*t with flash games you can play completely free on internet. Dont even bother, waste of time.
627	0	a	Pros: - Makes you want to do speedruns. - Has the platform feel you look for. - Grabbing thing and throwing them around is fun!  Cons: - Gets you easily bored because of too many repeated objectives. - Aim-lock sometimes may end up aim-locking you away from your target. (Considered moving around) - Doesn't have a speed option for doing speed runs. - Graphics could really use an upgrade.  There's room for improvement for this game. But overall it didn't appeal me as much to keep me going with playing (Played until 4th level).
628	0	a	Mario-like platformer and I hate Mario.
629	0	a	pleased as punch with this gr8 game, i wish i got to play it since the cursor can't reach the right side of the screen.

634	0	a	My friend gave me this. I had no idea what it was ,and he set me up for an amazing adventure. Needless to say I will be dead soon.
635	0	a	i do not like this game i want a refund please
636	0	a	IT was okay for a while, got it in a bundle. I mean i Wouldnt pay money for it alone
637	0	a	interesting world map if not impractical. its a basic platformer which i would expect to be on newgrounds or kongregate not worth its normal price
638	0	a	How to enjoy this game -Leave it on like 3-4 hour while your busy -Get and sell the cards  -Delete and never play this game again :D
639	0	a	Don't like games without the option to control the sound. This is poor develop crafting
640	0	a	The only positive for me was that I made more on trading cards than I paid for the game. I expected a cute but difficult platformer from the reviews, but what I got was bland and boring.
641	0	a	Nope even though i bought it under 1 Euro, it was not worth it..... Even if it would be free, it would not be worth it....
2113	1	a	great game, if you buy for 19€ you get more money from trading card ;) xD    sorry for bad english   
648	0	a	Very simply side scroller. No better than the typical free mobil app.
2115	1	a	hardcore
2117	1	a	I left it running by accident.
2119	1	a	I just want card drops.
649	0	a	Poorly optimized side scroller. FPS drops to 20-30 fairly often on a decent computer that runs much more complex 3D titles. However, good trading cards if you get this on a sale.
650	0	a	Can't play because the game loads in a resolution too big to play or even see more than 1/4 of the game, changing screen resolution does nothing  0/10 would not buy again
651	0	a	Bought for my friend. We aren't friends anymore
652	0	a	Meh. Glad it was 19c. Lackluster art, mechanics and overall game. If you're awake at 4AM for some unknow reason you might spend half an hour on it.
653	0	a	  Although cheap at the price of $1.00, this game gives very little even for the small price tag. The game has nothing to offer, it's bland and holds no real cards, and if it does it doesn't play them when it should (I.E to grab my intrest). It's 'My first game' should go on newgrounds not on steam. Don't buy, not worth your time.
654	0	a	It's like one of those browser games everyone played when they were younger.
655	0	a	My friend gave me this. I had no idea what it was ,and he set me up for an amazing adventure. Needless to say I will be dead soon.
2121	1	a	Worth Playing damn Enjoyable Game .
2123	1	a	Cheap game, trading cards, pretty fun. Reccomended!
2125	1	a	Bought it on sale. Paid itself back in card drops. Decent game too.
2127	1	a	This game is awesome and fun! I reccomend it!
656	0	a	  A friend gifted this to me last christmas. I'm rethinking our friendship
657	0	a	Lacks a lot of things, it was very mediocre. Bought it for 19 cents, and yet I still think this might be a little too much. Luckily I can get these 19 cents from the trading cards! Positive!
658	0	a	Fun little game that would have defenitely got a positive review from me had it been free. It's simply not worth to pay for, certain free browser flash games provide you with more entertainment. I guess it is worth to spend like 20 cents on this game.
659	0	a	Unpolished platformer
660	0	a	How many times can one game crash?  If the game is Beep, let's just say my playtime may read 8 minutes, but I've been at it for 20.  At $0.19 I feel I got a bad deal.  MY THRILLING INDIE EXPERIENCE: - Launch game - Reach main menu - Set it to windowed - It crashes immediately - Relaunch game - Set it to windowed at splash screen - It works. Amazing! What a time to be alive. - Game proceeds to crash at any provocation from dying to hitting the escape key to just because it feels like it - Have to re-window the game every launch because it never remembers - Decide it's just not worth the hassle to try to wring $0.19 cents worth of fun out of this basic ♥♥♥ flash game  Just go on the marketplace and buy a baller emote instead like a mouse with a hat or a sleeping goat.
661	0	a	I wish I could write a review about what the game was like, but It wouldn't work so its impossible. Im disappointed that I wasted my emoticons to buy this game for 19 cents.
2129	1	a	I made profit from selling trading cards I got from this game.
662	0	a	Crashed, and wouldn't let me close steam because it thought it was still running. 0/10 Awful.
663	0	a	I have owned this on steam for several years now before early access was even a thing, I'm confused how something I bought in 2012 is now a new release.
664	0	a	Its crap it was given to me as a gift, but is still a rip off.
665	0	a	Boring spinoff of super mario, glad I only payed 19 cents
666	0	a	how to get past the story? it wont let me click anything.
667	0	a	Release Date: 1 Apr, 2016  My ♥♥♥!!!! Liers mOFOS!
2131	1	a	Not as good as Bernards but still pretty nice game.
668	0	a	Game I could only recommend for people starting their adventure with platform games and if they are under 10. Quite borring and not surprising in any way.
669	0	a	This game is very annoying in that it does not allow a windowed mode with reduced graphical settings and is a resources hog otherwise for what it does.
670	0	a	No windowed mode option, no video settings!
2133	1	a	I would recommend this game to a younger crowd, it works out and is kinda fun, but it would probally be more fun for a 8 year old instead of a 20 year old. My bad impulsive steam-purchase.
2135	1	a	yo this game's gay
2137	1	a	BEEP is very good game because it's very fun and easy.
2139	1	a	This Game Is Awesomeness:    I payed 20 cents for this, after playing it I feel this game  deserves at least 10-15 bucks.
682	0	a	Crap game with boring level design and ♥♥♥♥ performance on a pretty decent laptop. Didn't enjoy having to search every inch of every level to progress.

2149	1	a	Nice and simple look, great physics engine, what's not to like.
706	0	a	got for trading cards lol
707	0	a	extremely annoying that this game does not have a windowed mode with lower resolution and graphics (for better alt + tab experience)
708	0	a	This game is not fun, unless you are a young kid then maybe it would be fun. It is a nice indie game but for steam, not the best publisher. IT IS A GOOD GAME it doesnt interest me though and to people on, because most people on steam are 13+ so it put this game it steam not a smart move.
2151	1	a	I just bought this game on sale to get some profit. (Y)
2153	1	a	BEEP is a game where the title was such a horrible swear word that the devs had to censor it in order for the game to still be legal.
2155	1	a	Great! Finished collecting the cards and you have made me the happiest hamster that has ever lived :SaddenedRobot:
2157	1	a	Fun physics platformer, probably not worth $5, but well worth $0.19.

2163	1	a	This game was on sale for so much that I actually made a profit selling the trading cards it drops.  10/10 even better than Free2Play!
736	0	a	Bought for my friend. We aren't friends anymore
737	0	a	ONE BIG ISSUE: Kind of wish I could recommend this game, cute, simple, light, but there's an issue, an issue that only hits me now. You see, I bought this game a while back, I had one monitor, the game worked fine, come back some time later with two monitors. if you have not caught on, the multi-monitor support is bad, the game stretches out the game across displays, I tried many things in effort to fix this, turn off second monitor, disconnect second monitor, restart computer, look around the files. Now with no luck and with the same results, I gave up and I can't recommend this game while this is an issue.
738	0	a	Wasting money simulator 2015
739	0	a	I saw this and thought it looked cool kindof but it sucks
740	0	a	This Game gets repetitive.
2165	1	a	Good game, but so hard to reload
2167	1	a	A cute little platformer made by a super small team of people. Actually a lot of fun especially for the price point. A few glitches here and there, but overall it's a decent game. Fair warning though it's a bit older of a game.
2169	1	a	Lovely 2D action platformer with physic puzzle elements.
2171	1	a	A pleasant suprise...what else is there to say? 
2173	1	a	.20 cents buy this now
2175	1	a	5/5
2177	1	a	Great game for 18 cents
2179	1	a	Really FUN!!!!!!!! I recomend it to everyone! 
2181	1	a	I had a lot of fun with this game. The controls can be a little challenging at times, but that makes the victories all the sweeter. You could probably beat this game in a day if you wanted, but it's still worth it.
745	0	a	I bought this game as part of a bundle, a very bad bundle. this is the best game in the bundle but thats not saying much since the other three games in the bundle are abysmal. This is basically a cutesy casual platformer that gives you the gravity gun from HL2 but suffers from bad level design, an uninspiring barely existant story, no boss battles, and a few bugs. There are better platformer games out there to buy.
746	0	a	Well I am not sure about this game. First off can't even play the game starts up black screen then never opens. I read the forums of it saying it might be a sound card thing. But wtf. No prob with any other games. Don't recommend unless you wanna take a chance of wasting your money
2183	1	a	What a load of *BEEP
747	0	a	A flash game worthy of newgrounds but worth paying for.
2185	1	a	Kinda like Wall-E looking robot, quite fun little game.  Why is it fun? Well you fly to a planet with the mothership, get to drive the robot (probe) on the planet. Get the gold, sometimes through physics puzzles.. then you have to shoot enemies as well. Later stages you can fly as well. Oh you can throw around your dead enemies with your little tractorbeam, stack them and use it to jump on higher platforms.  Recommend? YES!
2187	1	a	Pretty puzzle game !!! its Recommended!
2189	1	a	This game is literally the definition of weird. You play as a robot, fight other robots, can partially fly, and as a little side-note it is a platformer. This game has only one shortcoming, one that every platformer has... every time you fall off the damn edge.
2191	1	a	Pretty good for a game i got for 30 cents
2193	1	a	Beep is a great game, and definitely lives up to the claims it makes of being like yoshi island with gravity guns.  Following a ship of robots [beeps], you aim to travel a solar system and collect anti-matter. The levels are your classic platformer side-scrolling style, but there is a lot of variety in landscapes, from levels that require a jetpack, to those in underground flooded caves. There are also enemies that you can either shoot or avoid.   The majority of the gameplay is pretty casual, for example there is no limit on your ammo, you can reload an infinite amount of times. Some of the enemies require a bit of experimenting to find the best way to deal with them, which provides a challenge. That said, most of the enemies have a very simple AI.  The gravity gun provides for some very interesting gameplay. You can pick up many objects, including enemies, which can lead to finding some interesting solutions [not always the intended ones] to progressing through levels. This coupled with the gravity reversal in the final zone definitely makes this a great gameplay object, rather than just a gimmick.  The art in this game is very nice, and aside from a few [what i suspect are] spritesheet glitches when a certain enemy explodes, it is consistent throughout the game. On top of that, the music in this game is great.  This game is also short. The main level selection screen shows you have essentially 6 'zones', each with 4 levels. If you are a veteran player of platformers like this, you will probably breeze through it in no time. Regardless, if you like platformers, you will also enjoy it very much.
748	0	a	nothing special
2195	1	a	'what have i been doing the past few hours?'- says anyone who buys this game  9 out of 11
2197	1	a	Cute, kind of frustrating controls but otherwise a great casual game.
2199	1	a	A fun and casual physics puzzle platformer with a good variety of game mechanics to learn. Very fair up until the last level of the last world, that can burn in hell.
2201	1	a	It's Great! It's a lot of fun playing and I really do enjoy the game play experience, as well as the story line. Travelling the universe, exploring and discovering new planets, as well as creatures. The fighting is fairly straight forward and I always dispose of my enemies by using the gravity gun and whack them around a bit before I throw them into a pit of despair! Overall, a fun and adventurous game.  Great job! :D
2203	1	a	Really 10/10 game pretty difficult throughout and free profit from sale
2205	1	a	This game is 15p! BEEP!
2207	1	a	I like the art, despite cartoonish but isn't childish. And I like the game mechanic.
2209	1	a	It was good in the 5 minutes I played of it. I got it on sale for 19 cents. the first levels awesme, same with the world map. thx for reading. 999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999/10
2211	1	a	For a game that costs 21 cents CDN, it was definitely worth the price! I haven't played much, but from what I've explored it is incredibly fun. It runs smoothly and I enjoyed the level design. The graphics aren't the best feature to be honest, but it looks good for its price. Not only that, but you could just sell the cards to get your money back so you're technically getting a free game!
2213	1	a	I bought this game during the sale in which it was 96% off. Generally, these type of platformers make me nervous, but for 19 cents I couldn't let it down. If you love platformer games, you will LOVE this game. It's a mix of adventure, puzzle solving, and strategy.
2215	1	a	*BEEP*in' good time for the couple of days is lasted me. *BEEP*in' good value for the 19 cents they asked for it too. ♥♥♥♥♥ing ugly though.
2217	1	a	got it for 19 cents , made it back and a profit from trading cards , it is also a really enjoyable game , with some puzzle features to it , I do recommend this as it is just a generally fun game and is a great time passer
2219	1	a	Played through the first 3 levels, was fantastic fun, better than most platformers and more enjoyable too. 15 pence most definitely well spent.
2221	1	a	Wow this game is so good. Platformers have been under represented, this is not like that though!
2223	1	a	the use of both w,a,s,d and the mouse is awesome   really fun game
2225	1	a	Lovely 2D platformer with beautiful artstyle.One thing that annoyed me was that the game looked so good in 2D but the checkpoints,nuggets,anti-matter etc. were kind of 3D and I felt that wasn't really fitting in.8/10
2227	1	a	Pretty fun its the best 15p i spent in along time
2229	1	a	its an ok game and i got it on special and made 2 cents
2231	1	a	really fun, there are more levels to complete every time.
2233	1	a	Pretty awesome so far! One bug i have noticed that is a little annoying, is when youre in windowed mode and not full screen if you click escape to enter the pause menu, the game crashes. Well it does on my laptop anyway- which is not that much of a potato. Lol. But anyway! new game! low cost! I'm sure it'll get fixed and improved. In the mean time, i'm having a lot of fun just playing in full screen, but it is handy to play in windowed mode when multitasking etc. THANKS! :D
2235	1	a	Enjoyed this little game.
2237	1	a	awesome game,really like the trine style of playing and its not easy for 19 cents it is a must have
2239	1	a	:)
2241	1	a	I really liked this game. Nice design and a perfect structure. You should check it out.
2243	1	a	I like the game alot, it's fun to play. And it's always a time killer. This is the kind of game that you play when you're bored or when you are live streaming and you're not in for any serious action games.
2245	1	a	Just started the game and i already like it. The levels are fun and well made. The use of physics with the enemies and objects is awsome. The caves are great too it's dark and makes it a bit harder and that's fun. I recommand this game for anyone that likes platform games it worth every penny.
2247	1	a	Awesome Sauce!!!! .19 cents best price ever!
2249	1	a	I should buy this for my sweet sister Not a bad game 8/10
2251	1	a	This game is *BEEP* awesome!
2253	1	a	I didn't think it looked fun when I was gifted it for a friend.  In fact, I only installed it for laughs  Now, No matter how childish and simple the game LOOKS,  There is actually a challenge to the game  Some things are fun, too  Such as beating an enemy to death, with a dead enemy.  Even the unkillable beetle thingies with a powerful deathray,  Just bash it with the corpse of an enemy  10/10 would play challenging childs games and bash enemies with their fallen counterparts
2255	1	a	I got this gem of a game for just 15p and it is worth EVERY penny.  A super fun little platform/puzzler with great gameplay &amp; graphics that starts off very easy then requires a LOT more thought!  Excellent value for such a great game...a 'must-have' title if ever there was!!! 
2257	1	a	This is an awesome game! It somewhat compares to Super Mario Bros. 3, but way more awesome! It has a cool soundtrack, awesome mechanics, and cool level design. But recently it keeps crashing, which is a shame... Great game though!
2259	1	a	A pretty solid little game. I enjoyed it enough for the price.
2261	1	a	The game is just a little something to do when your other games don't appeal to you at the moment. Its a nice little game, nice graphics, a cool little ship you can fly around and smash into asteroids and space rocks. The dark areas add a whole new aspect to it as well.
2263	1	a	its a cheap little game its very fun doe
2265	1	a	Thanks for the 96% off sale! :D &lt;3
2267	1	a	So cute and amazing.
2269	1	a	I got this for 19 cents and made 20 cents from trading cards... good times  
2271	1	a	This game is *BEEP* Awesome
2273	1	a	great game 
2275	1	a	Easy to play and I like Its simple graphics.
2277	1	a	Bought this for .17 cents during summer sale. Played first few levels nice indie title for the price. Play it with family 10/10
2279	1	a	10/10
2281	1	a	It's as if someone took Winona's Gym from Pokemon Ruby, put in a shooter element, and extended the puzzles.
2283	1	a	no need to buy ammo. better than csgo
2285	1	a	Yoshi's Island + Half-Life + 21 cents on sale = fun.
2287	1	a	Game didn't beep.  0/10 Game of the Year
2289	1	a	Although I haven't played too much of this game (around two and a half hours), I can say it's deftinately worth it's cheap price (96% off)    PROS   -Great Graphics -Loads of levels -Nice mechanics -Brilliant Gameplay    CONS   -Somewhat poorly optimised: I have quite a good machine - an intel i5 4440 and a GTX 660. It runs pretty good however I can tell it sometimes drops for no reason. -Repetitive music  Overall, it's a good game if you can get it on deal but I wouldn't pay the full £3.99
2291	1	a	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hhrySCbTdU&amp;feature=youtu.be   BEEP is charming action plaftormer with not-so-complicated puzzels and great physics engine.  The story is almost non-existent. In the distant future, people created BEEP-ships that create BEEP-bots and send them to explore the universe. One of the ship find something and goes to see what it is. That's it.  The game have two problems. First one: lack of any kind of options. The game graphically won't blow your mind, music and sound fx are fine, but still it would be nice to have some options. The second problem: you jump with W. It's just not intuitive at first. But those two problems are not a big deal.  I like art style. It's simple, but so charming, vibrant and colorful, especially the locations you visit. Swamps, volcano, ice and desert places, forests and caves. They are diverse and full of obstacles to shoot and puzzles to tease your brain. There is one strange bug. When you kill a little flying kamikadze robot , a black square appear for a few seconds and then disappear. It's bizzare, but other than that I didn't notice any other bugs.  The main star here is the gameplay. It consist of platforming, puzzle solving and shooting. Even the level selection screen is great. With the mouse you move the rocket and after hitting enough asteroids it's time to deploy the BEEP-bot. The next level unlocks after beating the previous one. The BEEP-bot have three things available for handling the dangers – a single weapon, anti-gravity ray or Anti-Grav and he can float for a breif period of time, that way he can jump larger distances. The first thing I notice is the physics engine. It's great. A lot of thing can be move, stacked and even used as a weapon. Physics are the core of the game and anti-grav will be your best friend. At some places you have to rotate platform to step on it or put few stones on top of each other to reach higher place and so on. For a few levels, you will even get jet pack, which keeps the gameplay fresh.  Through the hole game you will search, if you want, for antimatter and when you find it, most times puzzle awaits you. Some require just to move out something, others test your reflexes and so on. Anti-grav is required for the puzzels. Level after level they get little bit complicated, but not too much. Some of them have to be solved to continue the game, others, like those for the antimater, are not. But if you not look for her, you are missing half the fun here. It's satisfying to solve puzzle, that seems at first glance difficult. They are not too easy or too hard, they are just right, fun and diverse.  For all the things I said about the gameplay, you need perfect controls. They are. When you die, it's entirely the players fault. But like I said in the beginning, W is kind of not intuitive. It took me few level to get use to it. I think Space bar is more appropriate. There is even counter for the deaths.   Enemy design is okay, they won't blow your mind. Several types of robots with various attack and movement patterns. But few enemies require different approach, like one that first you need to remove his helmet-thingy from his head and then shoot. They may look mean, but at the same time they are cute.  Sound design is good. The music is great, not too loud, diffrerent tracks for every world you visit and they fits really well . Few levels don't have music and I wonder if this is deliberate or the game bug out. Sound fx are nice. When you kill enemies they make cute noise and I kinda feel guilty for shooting them.  I was quite surprise by BEEP. I didn't expect to have so much fun. I bought it impulsively on sale. It took me little more than 7 h to beat it and i was never bored. Great and cute world, lengthy, nice mechanics, great soundtrack, but lack any kind of options. The game ended with open door for sequel and I hope some day to see the light of day. I highly recommened it.
2293	1	a	Beep Beep Beep!  + : simple, cute robots  - : classic platformer, nothing new really  6/10 would beep again
2295	1	a	worth it for 21 cents i sold the cards and got a booster pack so its basiically prphit from buying a game 
2297	1	a	FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO GET CARD DROPS : I got my drops in 9.1 hours of gameplay - drops are not fast for this game. FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BUY THIS GAME : Steam, please. Beep beep and money goes for a super cool strategy game. I recommend buying this if you have too much time on your hands and have some money to waste. Go ahead, buy it. 
2299	1	a	This game is quite simple and I don't have to write a complicated review for this. In BEEP, robots discover new planets and you have to get all asteroids in the map to get a good score on the level, while shooting and manipulating objects in the map to get through your way to the end. For $0.19 cents, it was worth a buy.  8/10
2301	1	a	Pretty good game
2303	1	a	Good platformer. 7/10
2305	1	a	Very cool, arcade game where you have to think a little before you do that, a lot of levels, the game hardly contain and priced very low. :)
2307	1	a	It's awesome, and its not a gun game its like Rated E For everyone.
2309	1	a	A fun and difficult platformer, I'd definately recomment this! Of course, sometimes using the enemies as platforms is sometimes frustrating. My only real gripe is that there is no sequel. Not because of how fun it is, but because of how the game ended. The ending suggested a sequel to the game, where we go to the Creeps home planet. The game was released in 2011, and there is no sequel. Big Fat Alien, you get to work with that. For what it is though, it's a pretty fun game, and it's only $2.
2311	1	a	Loved this game. I've apparently played 233.8 hrs of it in the last two weeks!
2313	1	a	Play as bloodthirsty robots sent to invade planets, steal natural resources, and murder locals.
2315	1	a	decent game for its price when its on 96%, some levels are quite challenging if u wanna get all the antimatter things ofc, decent platformer to pass some time
2317	1	a	great game! deffinatly worth 18 cents! im not a singleplayer nor platformer fan, but this game is challengeing and fun. many puzzles within the game and lots of action... im still not finished with the game but im almost done with the first world and i plan on finishing the game.
2319	1	a	This game is awesome!!!!!
2321	1	a	If you are bored and have nothing to play , try this , a child game but fun lol
2323	1	a	It's like a downloadable flash game you have to pay for. Still, really good.
2325	1	a	Pretty good physics platformer. You control a robot on wheels that can shoot enemies and move things around with its gravity gun. The goal is to get to the end of each level while collecting enough pieces of antimatter to unlock the next one. The puzzles are very easy, but stacking blocks (and dead enemies) to get to a high place requires some patience. You have infinitely many robots (lives) and you keep your progress within the level when you die, which is pretty good.  The game never gets very hard. Still took me 8 hours and 100 robots though.
2327	1	a	Fun to mess around in. It has a nice overworld and fun gameplay with nice-looking levels.
753	0	a	As much as I'd like to give this game a recommendation, I just can't. I had a blast in the first hour or so of the game, but the fuel mechainc really threw me off as I feel like it made the levels too big and it got easy to miss stuff. The music, while being very fitting, became way too repetative and boring after a while. But the biggest issue I had with this game was a bug that sometimes made the remains of enemies appear as black boxes. It would often make it hard to see the platforms and sometimes result in my death.  It's a good thing it's cheap, but I feel like it could be free. 4/10
2329	1	a	Lovely little game. After playing only 40 minutes of it and beating just one half of a planet I can already tell that it's great fun not only for kids. I'm very excited for difficulties and puzzles to come! Also the fact that BEEP says 'Beam me up Scotty!' from time to time at the end of a level helps a lot and with a final grade and I didn't even watch Star Trek.
2331	1	a	10/10, you will never be as cool as the makers of this game...
2333	1	a	BEEP is a cool game. Would be cool if we could use controller but oh well.
2335	1	a	There are alot of cheap platformers out there that I have to get a refund for, and theres alot that I look at are rubbish, but this one stands out as a GOOD cheap game it runs well and the gameplay is good for its price I highly reccomend if you are looking for a cheap puzzle platformer!
2337	1	a	If you're looking for a review you've come to the wrong place, if you're here to cook a pie then read on ! Napoleon from the final puff pastry  You will need:  Ready flaky pastry - 1.5 kg five eggs Flour - 150 g&gt; Sugar - 400 grams Milk - 1200 ml Vanilla sugar - 1 n. Cognac - 1 tbsp. l. Shelled walnuts - glass sequence of preparation: dough defrost naturally at room temperature (defrost time indicated on the package).

2339	1	a	Very fun game. Good physics
2341	1	a	It's nice.
2343	1	a	Although it's cheap tag, it's surprisingly well made from the fluidness, game mechanic, level design, control, and even the dinamic music. It's worth the full price, very recomended (y)
2345	1	a	(BEEP) ! This (BEEP)ing flying robot keeps killing me and i can`t pass him, i swear i`ll (BEEP)ing destroy it. The (BEEP)ing piece of (BEEP) !  8/10
2347	1	a	Much better than I thought, worth buying, even if not on sale.
2349	1	a	very fun platformer! easily worth the 49 cents it cost me :)
754	0	a	This review is base on the game not on the card.  Platformer/Puzzler who get really boring just after 2 level. No fun with this game. So I decided to land on the sun!  If you look for excitement, play at mario galaxy, Yoshi will be in it at least!...  I said it so. NEXT!
2351	1	a	The robot from Sealab 2021 has to kill other robots and collect gold nuggets.   Delightful game.
755	0	a	There's nothing particularly wrong with  BEEP , but I think that's at least partly because the developers weren't innovating or taking risks with it, and ultimately, it just feels too generic and simple to hook me. The gravity gun, touted as a unique mechanic and the game's main attraction, really isn't unique at all: it's functionally identical to, and used for puzzle-solving in exactly the same way as the wizard's telekinesis in  Trine , which is a much more highly recommended game.
2353	1	a	BEEP is a cute little exploration platformer game. You have to explore three planets and collect golden nuggets. There is enemies, annoying platforming, jetpacks and more. Definetely something you need to have in your library
2355	1	a	Platformers, by and large come in two varieties: Cute and Cuddly, and mentally difficult. While things like SuperMeatBoy fall into the latter, this very firmly falls into the former.   Beep is, essentially, a keyboard/mouse physics puzzler/platformer crossover. You take control of a little robot, exploring a solar system of three planets, 'beaming down' into level after level, looking for 'antimatter', and then beaming back up.  The game features all the usual favourites of platformers - you'll be teetering on edges, jumping over enemies, sliding blocks, running on rotating drums, solving machine puzzles, shooting bullets, and my absolute #1 favourite: dying a lot.  That's the thing about platformers: They're set up to kill you. Some are fierce and you're expected to die every 10 seconds, while others involve tactics, long run-ups, and really spectacular jumps (e.g. Sonic). This falls midway between the two: It never presents a level which is ridiculously hard, usually giving you a relatively safe place you can 'fall' to, but although there are some really nice long jumps, and great swings, it doesn't have the majesty of AAA platformers like Sonic.  This feels like an indie Flash game that outgrew the technology and needed to visit the big leagues. It's cute, cuddly, easy to pick up, has good music, fun sound effects, and is nicely balanced. There were very few occasions where I got truly narked with the level design, but generally, I found a better way to do it than I had been trying.  The game rewards mild exploration. Unlike some games that cheat with invisible doors, off-screen specials, or collapsing platforms, this game is pretty straight-up, and says 'There's a special up here. Come get it if you can work out how.'. I finished the game collecting every single last piece of antimatter, and didn't spend ages banging my fists in frustration either.  So, yeah, this is a really really fun little game. I don't recommend playing on a touchpad. It REALLY benefits from a mouse. Similarly, if your mouse skills aren't great, I'd pass on this, cos you have to be a bit good on the point-and-click.   For the price, this gave a lot of entertainment, although not a lot of story per se. The game hints to a sequel, which I'd consider playing if the price was as low as I got this one for. Pick it up if you have a few hours to kill: Each level takes about 10 to 30 minutes to master and complete, so you can play it in short bursts.  Great fun.
2357	1	a	For puzzle-platformer lovers, it is worth giving a try. Besides, It's quite cheap.
757	0	a	I wanted to like Beep. The music and art style is charming and some of the level design is good, but the difficulty is very uneven. Worse, the difficulty arises not from a solution being hard to think of, but because the controls are too loose to precisely perform what you've thought of.  Tighter controls would have turned this game from a no to a yes.
758	0	a	The game has nice graphics, but overall is pretty boring.  BEEP makes annoying sounds; Sharacter design is not to be found; Soundtrack is chilled, but ignorable; BEEP makes a scared face whenever it jumps (WTF, this is a platformer, you're SUPPOSED to jump); The telekinesis system is kinda broken;
2359	1	a	I really like this game and it is worth it. Its just another one of those really fun indie games
2361	1	a	I don't play free flash games in my browser anymore, I pay $0.50 and download them on steam now.
2363	1	a	Great little game, I bought it on sale, but even for $1 equivalent it is well worth buying. It is a really great combination of platforming with strategic and creative use of a gun for shooting/manipulating items in the world.  Just buy it!
2365	1	a	The best game ever made 
2367	1	a	So, I bought this for €0,24 when it was in a sale. And there are trading cards, so it is even cheaper than that. This game is a cartoonish-like puzzle platformer. It felt pretty easy, but there was quite a lot of music and many levels. Even some storyline! And all that for a few cent. Buy it already! (at least when its at sale)
2369	1	a	im not sure about this game, the mechanics are cool and the whole physics engine behind it works really well i would suggest it for a little local flash game fun if you know what i mean.  the game runs smoothly and probably has the worst story line in history ( still better than twilight) but for a flash game it really is fun to play around with  I rate it 6/10
2371	1	a	10/10 Would Platform Again  
2373	1	a	This is by far one of the most value packed games I have played. For such a small price why not just grab it and try it?  It was gifted to me by a viewer and so I thought I'd give it a try and I was impressed. For an indie game there are some challenging puzzles, hours of playtime(~10 if 100% completion) and tons of infuriating moments. I can only hope that with the sale that recently featured the game that the developer will make a sequel.
759	0	a	Just so people are aware, this game's name use to be Orion Dino Beat Down, and they changed the name and re released it multiple times as a new game just to keep people from seeing all of the negative feedback it was getting. This is the same game that utilizes stolen assets and the head of Trek Industries, formerly spiral game studios fired the real team working on it just before release without paying them. I'm writing this review now because they are attempting to get out of a DMCA and possible suit of their new game 'Orion' where they are literally doing the same exact thing and trying to play the victim. I bought this game before even knowing all of this, and felt so dirty for doing so, and im hoping and urging people away from buying into this mistake and scum of a company.
2375	1	a	'Well its only a dollar, how good can it be?' 16 hours later... 'HOW IS THIS ONLY A DOLLAR?'
2377	1	a	If this game was priced at $30+ I would say avoid it like the plague.  If this game was priced at $20 I would say don't bother waiting for a sale.  If this game was priced at $10 I would say just buy anything else.  If this game was priced at $5 I would say you could buy lunch instead.  If this game was priced at $1 I would say you have no reason not to own this.  So what I'm saying is you have no reason not to own this. If you even get one hour of entertainment out of it from soley looking at some nice graphics and laughing at some bugs and glitches that was a dollar well spent. It beats the hell out of paying $70 for a AAA-title for the same effect. The devs know this is not the greatest game ever made, but they have made leaps and bounds in progress from the days when this was considered 'one of the worst games on Steam.' And for precisely this reason they have dropped the price so much. They want to redeem themselves. They want people to play their game and give it a chance. What are you waiting for, you heartless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥? It's only a dollar. Play their game.
2379	1	a	99 cents.  It cost me 99 cents to shoot at dinosaurs for nearly 40 hours.  Yes.
2381	1	a	 UPDATE : ORION PRELUDE   There simply aren't enough games with dinosaurs &amp; even fewer of these that are actually worth playing! For me, Orion: Prelude (O:P) is that rare exception. Although not much in way of a story in the game  (no single player after all) , there is quite a tale on how Orion came to be the game it is today...  The short version is, that O:P is an evolution of previous Orion titles, Dino Horde &amp; Dino Beatdown originally dating back to a successful 2011 Kickstarter campaign. Although recieving early criticism  (that would normally kill a game ..dead.. disappearing into obscurity) , the game continued to evolve with constant updates (big &amp; small) over the years from the developers. Spiral stuck with it! This dedication &amp; gradual refinement of the game has resulted in an excellent first-person co-op experience, with a well rounded collection of modes, weapons, enviromental effects, vehicles &amp; more to enjoy.   PvP isn't forgotten; it's also selectable. PvP feels more alike to a retro deathmatches, than a modern PvP  (in a good way!) , but I mainly enjoy the co-op modes. In co-op, you essentially have to defend your power core against waves of bloodthursty dinosaurs. Dinosaur kills will reward you credits, which you can use to buy perks &amp; weapon upgrades, in-turn helping you survive the later, harder waves. Some waves also have you securing objectives. Co-op doesn't feel ultra competitive, most of the time you don't watch your credits/kills, rather finding yourself just having fun surviving &amp; helping your teammates! I've found the community to generally be helpful &amp; friendly in-game too.  One of the real stand-out features in O:P has to be the enviromental effects randomly cycling on the alien world. From the day/night cycles to the extreme variety of climates &amp; types of weather. Adds so much to the atmosphere. Couple this with excellent lighting effects through what seems to be a thicker atmosphere and the results can sometimes be spectacular! Even overwhelming! You definitely get that  feeling  when your final wave gets a night cycle with heavy rain .. you know you are gonna see an epic close quarter battle!  Along with the awesome effects, there are 3 distinct classes to mix-up the gameplay. Each has unique strengths &amp; each you can progress/level-up in online play to unlock starting weapons, power-ups &amp; perks. Initial learning curve isn't steep, so once you get the hang of the basic flow it becomes very easy to sink multiple hours killing dinos! O:P rarely feels like a grind; even at lower levels  (without a lot of perks)  you competently kill dinos &amp; gain good XP. Plenty of dinos to go around too :)  If you can't find a friend to play with, there is also bot-support added in O:P to fill the ranks. This can be helpful to get playing quickly if server populations are low (which regrettably does happen).  The trilogy of classes are well balanced (no need for any other classes), as is the gameplay in general. Difficulty is super scalable. Weapons are mainly shared between classes so quickly become familiar, and vehicles are easy to use &amp; offer a good range of practical &amp; destructive uses. Repetitive? Sure, to a degree, it is the same thing over &amp; over and despite there being a lot of 'accessories' to the spice up the character classes &amp; tactics, modes etc, there are not a huge number of maps for each mode. I expect this will change soon with Steam Workshop support being added.  The A.I. generally employed by the dinosaurs is a fairly basic 'rush' tactic, which can feel pretty predictable  (there are a few surprises though) , but I find the larger dino numbers to counteract this limitation to a degree anyway. There are also the occasional technical glitches like querky physics (flying Stegosaurus anyone?) or clipping inside a dinosaur. Nothing game-breaking that I have experienced, but sure does make for some funny moments! Just like my many failed attempts at some of the more creative 'Ride a Dino for 10secs' &amp; 'Slap T-Rex 100 times' achievements :)  O:P reminds me a bit of those classic, simple shooters like a Serious Sam or Left 4 Dead, but with a bit of high-tech sci-fi flavor. This future-tech feel across the game contradicts the jurassic era dinosaurs &amp; remote wilderness landscapes nicely! O:P is not as complex mechanically or technically when compared to a top end AAA FPS, but its simplicity is also its underlying strength. It is great value ($1!), has strong replayability and the focused, balanced gameplay  (some bonus ..ahem.. querks)  offers a truely fun &amp; intense, dino killin' co-operative survival experience!     Too much to read?    Yeah ok then (fair call lol)..   I'll let Dave Chappelle quickly summarise what O:P is really all about:   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=269015668   (original artwork uploaded by  Grayscars !)

2383	1	a	The Metacritic score is misleading. That was for Dino Beatdown, not for Horde. The game has been changed a lot since the days of Beatdown. From the original 3, it has been updated to 10 different dinosaurs. 4 of which are playable in a game mode. Balancing patches, as well as optimization patches have been implemented and the game now runs like butter on my computer. There's a combonation of 50+ weapons and gear, customization of armor color and hats and other cosmetics. The Developers have been working their asses off making this game as fun as possible and it paid off.  So, what is this game like? Halo + Turok + Killing Floor. You've got your standard pistols, machineguns and shotguns and then you get your rocket launchers, laser guns and heavy weapons. Each class has their own special abilities like Jetpacks, cloaking and healing beams, all which can be augmented to be more effective. You can also level your classes for better performance like in Killing Floor which lifts the burden of having to buy certain augments and use that money for other things. You've got player vs dinosaurs, player vs player dinosaurs, player vs player, player vs harder dinosaur waves and Conquest which is coming up soon.  My only gripes right now with it are the animations being a little rough, dinosaurs can be a little derpy and the music is the same in EVERY map. I know that old music from Beatdown will be implemented once Conquest rolls out, but not sure if that's just for the Conquest maps or for all the maps.  But other than that, it's a pretty great game that has my full love.
2385	1	a	Let's be brutally honest here.  How many other games can you drive a tank off a cliff, smash into a T-Rex, jump out, noscope T-rex with a bow and then club it to death with a lightsaber?  Exactly.
2387	1	a	 Dinosaurs, jetpacks, lightsabers, teleporters, invisibility, high-tech vehicles, extreme weather effects... omg this game is everything! And epic victory music is playing in the background all the time. Seriously I have really good time playing this game.
2389	1	a	The community is very strong. Guys with jetpacks hide on cliffs, laughing while everyone else gets smashed on the ground. Not bitter.
2391	1	a	But sh*t, it was 99 cents.
2393	1	a	It's bad... In the best way possible. Will Dinohorde go down in history as an innovative piece of gaming? Not in any sense of the phrase. Will it be remembered for its cutting edge graphics, intuitive gameplay or captivating story? Negative. What you will remember about Dinohorde is the unreasonable amount of fun you will have playing it with a few of your best gaming buddies. Its difficult to describe why, and it might just be how ridiculous the whole thing is, but Dinohorde is one of the most fun games I've played in 2014. The quality isn't quite there but you won't regret dropping a couple dollars on this inexplicable gem.
2395	1	a	OPEN THE DOOR GET ON THE FLOOR EVERYBODY WALK THE DINOSAUR
2397	1	a	Some advice:  1) Kill the flying jerks first. The larger ones can pick you up and drop you out of the sky. Very disconcerting.  2) If you get picked up by a large flying jerk, melee it. It will drop you.  3) T-Rex's can 360 no-scope you with rocks. Keep your rear end in motion.  4) Save up your dough and buy the greedy perk first. Then buy stopping power. Life gets easier after that.  5) When you buy this game - and you should buy this game - remember that stealing your teammate's speeder bike is a big no-no.  6) Keep the generators up and running. Because reasons. Also because the game will end if it stays offline too long.  7) The vampire perk is gross but cool.  8) T-Rex's that 360 no-scope you with rock throws... Did I mention that? Pretty sure I mentioned that...
2399	1	a	Its like Cod Zombies without Zombies or Cod and theres Dinosaurs
2401	1	a	$0.99 to shoot a triceratops right in the face. Thanks, Obama.
2403	1	a	I really love this game and i would like to ask anyone reading to just give it a try even if its just a free weekend.  Spiral has done an amazing job of post release support with tons of new maps, modes and improved graphics all free.  If your looking for something co-op thats a blast to play with friends and quite playable solo (your characters go up in levels offering perks and better starting gear) this game is a diamond in the rough.   Dont let the metacritic score turn you away and come play a game where the developers care about thier product.    
2405	1	a	Great game, tons of not-too-serious fun. I actually felt bad only giving the dev's 99c for this ... so I bought 2 :D  PS. msg me if you'd like that extra copy. I've only got 1 for now!
2407	1	a	Orion: Prelude is the revised version of Orion: Dino Horde, which itself, is a revised version of Orion: Dino Beatdown. Confusing, isn't it?  Orion: Dino Beatdown; the original, was a terrible game that launched as an alpha, with terrible netcode, and justly received a Metacritic rating of 36. Ironically, if you check the Metacritic rating, it'll be for Orion: Dino Horde. Apparently Metacritic hasn't received word from the developer that they've changed the name yet again.  But enough about how Spiral Game Studios keeps trying to reinvent the game by renaming it and patching problems that should have been fixed at release; what is the game like? Orion: Prelude is a team-based, cooperative, sci-fi, wave-based, FPS where your goal is to kill dinosaurs and complete objectives. The game is essentially what you'd get if you took Killing Floor and Halo and mixed them together. It's borrows Killing Floor's wave-based combat, where every kill gives you money to better arm yourself, and every wave gets progressively harder; and it borrows from Halo in the Shield mechanic, the vehicular combat, (although this could be atributable to other games as well) and the overall look of the game.  Up to five players can play together on a single server. Within the game, there are three classes which further distinguish your role from the role of the other four players. The classes are Assault, Support, and Recon. While I'd normally explain in depth the differences between these classes, I can't because there really isn't much of a reason. If you're playing this game, you're playing it in either Survival or Conquest. Sure, there are other gamemodes to choose from, but they're all variations of standard PvP gamemodes that exist in better incarnations in other games, so you'd be better served playing them there. If you bought this game, you bought it for the dinosaurs, which means it's Survival or Conquest for you. In that case, pick Assault if you want to kill things, and pick Support if you want to keep teammates alive. There's no reason to pick Rogue in these gamemodes. It seems as though the developers made it for PvP only, as in Survival and Conquest, it suffers greatly.  The differences between the classes really come down to the single class skill you get at spawn. The Assault class gets a jetpack ability which can be improved by purchasing augments. (more on this later) The Support class gets access to a medigun which can heal a player, and with the proper augment, replenish their ammo supply. The Rogue class can turn invisible which can act as an effective temporary invulnerability, as all Dinosaurs will immediately de-aggro from you and never attack you while stealthed. Those are the differences. There's also some weapon differences, but all weapons can be bought by purchasing an augment that allows you to purchase class restricted weapons.  What are these augments I keep referring to? Just like in Killing Floor, at the end of a wave which is usually around 20-30 dinosaurs, you have a minute to buy weapons or augments at their respective shops. Weapons are divided into four categories: primary weapons, secondary weapons, pistols, and Adrenaline weapons. Primary weapons are your standard rifles, LMG's, and Sniper Rifles. Secondary Weapons are SMG's and shotguns. Pistols are pistols, and Adrenaline weapons are class-specific weapons.  Augments provide boosts to your character's fighting ability; from double jumping to boost jumping, to additional armor. There's even an augment which allows you to feast upon dinosaur corpses for health which sounds neat, but is utterly worthless. While Augments are important, there's really a select few which are far and away better than the rest which you'll find yourself buying in the same order every game, irrespective of what class you are. There are a few class-specfic augments which I alluded to earlier, but most of the desired ones are shared amongst the classes.  Onto the dinosaurs. There are tiny dinosaurs like Compies, medium sized dinosaurs like Raptors and some larger spitting dinosaur, then there are large Dinosaurs like Triceratops, Stegosaurus, and of course, the T-Rex. Instead of being smart and making the large dinosaurs the primary objective of the game, the entire game focuses around killing the small dinosaurs, because the waves are determined by a specific number of dinosaurs that spawn, not the type of dinosaur. A dinosaur killed is a dinosaur killed no matter what type it is. So your best bet is to just kill all of the easy-to-kill dinosaurs, and leave the large ones alive to clean up after the wave has ended, assuming you don't have anything pressing to buy. This is the main gripe I have with the game. The main pull of the game, fighting giant dinosaurs, has been relegated to a mere distraction and nothing more. If you stop and spend time killing the large dinosaurs, you're opening yourself up to a whole lot more damage by the smaller raptors.  When I refer to the large dinosaurs as distractions, I really mean annoyances. They'll hone in on one particular player, then constantly harass that player until one of the two dies. The T-Rex is especially annoying because it has this weird snare effect when it's damaging you which prevents you from getting away from it, so you just get caught and repeatedly bitten until you go down.  When you lose all of your health, the game borrows the downed system from Left 4 Dead, where you can be helped up. I say they borrowed it because it seems to be a combination of the system from Left 4 Dead and Payday. Your character can fall three times. If it falls a fourth time, you're dead and can only respawn next wave. Killing a dinosaur while downed gives you a second wind, or you can be helped up by another player.  The graphics are shockingly mediocre. It seriously looks like Halo 2 on Xbox circa 2004. The Source Engine has never looked as dated as this in a long time. The character models are all low poly count, and the environments are all bland and uninspired. They are large, so there's plenty of blandness to go around.  Overall, Orion: Prelude is exactly what you'd expect it to be; a bland cooperative shooter which has no identity of its own. The developers apparently tried to ride off of the novelty of players fighting dinosaurs in a sci-fi setting, but the game requires more than that. On top of that, there's something rather deceptive about trying to hide your failure by re-releasing the game under a different name, as if to try and avoid that ugly metacritic rating.  The game is nothing more than Orion: Dino Beatdown, just patched to be a working copy of it, rather than a buggy, laggy mess that shouldn't have been released. All these complaints aside, the game will provide you with a few hours of entertainment before the repitition and realization that all of these gameplay choices have been pulled from more successfull games. Considering that at the time of this review, the game is being sold on Steam for $1, with a 4-pack of it costing a grand total of $3, I struggle to think of another Steam title which you can get several hours of entertainment for four people, for just $3. Perhaps in that regard, Orion: Dino Beatdown/Dino Horde/Prelude succeeds.
2409	1	a	The ONLY thing that could make this better would be if there were game modes with nazi dinosaurs.

2417	1	a	What can I say about ORION: Prelude? Let's start with what it's  not ...  It's not a perfect game. It's not 100% bug-free. It's not a contender for Game Of The Year.  But more importantly, let's go on to what it  is ...  It's extremely fun. It's very well supported. It's extremely fun. It's got a great community. It's extremely fun. It's amazing value for money. Did I mention that it's extremely fun?  For the price, you wouldn't believe that this is a fully-fledged multiplayer FPS with solid progression, numerous weapons and power-ups, a decent array of vehicles and goddam  dinosaurs  to gun down! But that's exactly what it is. You probably won't put hundreds of hours into it but it certainly doesn't feel like a £0.79p / $0.99c game. In fact, I reckon this is the single best value for money of any game in my entire collection. I've certainly got my 79p worth and then some - and I still keep coming back for more!  If you like multiplayer FPS and you're not literally penniless, why are you still reading this review? At this price, just buy it already!
2419	1	a	Fun game. Was skeptical when saw it for a dollar. But it is a hidden gem. Definately worth at least 5.
2421	1	a	Over the years this game has been bashed as one of the worst games to be released on steam, however now I'd say get it.  For £0.79 game the graphics look like they are from a game costing £30, and the weather effects you get on your helmet is a nice addtion too, the main enemys in this game are dinosaurs and there are 7 of them and 2 flying reptiles and a giant Crocodile, all 10 of them feel unquie and fun to fight against.  You can get vechicles in this game, theres the average jeep with turret, a jet and a tank, but best of all theres a MECH! YES A MECH YOU CAN FIGHT A TREX WITH A MECH! All of the vechicles are great to drive and are really helpful overall.  Game breaking glitches like map glitches or crashes are very rare in this game, the only one I can think of is where you can leave a map by playing as a flying reptile or playing Assault with the jetpack and fly above the boundires, luckly this is only on one map and it's unplayed often.  However this game does have a few downsides....  1. A lot of weapon clipping, sound glitches and firing glitches, most noticeable with the default pistol, duo pistols and using reload speed upgrade. 2. Ragdolls are really glitchy at times, however more tame then any from the Source engine. 3. Playing as Dinosaurs is nearly impossible with the terrible camara angle and controls. 4. Soundtrack is really stock. 5. Small, but very friendly commuinty  Overall the game is much more better then it orignally was, a fun CO-OP horde game to play with your friends!
2423	1	a	Broken in all the right ways
2425	1	a	You can fight t-rexes in helicopter gunships, enough said.
2427	1	a	WTF ?! Why its Free ? give my 0.49$ back I want my csgo skins back
2429	1	a	This game is really freaking awesome. The metascore is bull!! This game has been remade from the start. Great Survival Action against dino's. Great weapons ,upgrades and vehicles. Ill do a larger review later, get it basically for free now!! 99 cents is more than a steal!!
2431	1	a	i got my 99 cents of fun from this game, better then buying a soda.   9/10  
2433	1	a	Yes, buy this game. Its Killing floor + Halo + Turok.  It has its flaws, but the devs seem devoted and are present on the steam forums. If you played this game in beta and not again(like me) give it another shot, it is now playable(LoL) and quite awesome. The difference is uncanny. I reinstalled it yesterday and I'm already level 11. It never felt like grinding. Buy a four pack, get some friends who will play installed and have a blast together.   For me the biggest con is the limited players. That easy to solve though, buy and play this WAY under priced game.
2435	1	a	Best 99 cents wasted of my life...
2437	1	a	You pay for what you get. The FPS mechanics are awful, seriously awful, but - in the end - is a fun budget sandbox game about shooting dinosaurs together.  Do not expect much more.  P.S. I'm gonna say Yes only thanks to its cost (0,99€) and the addition of a Steam Workshop.
2439	1	a	I enjoyed it since the dino horde update. It's like a mixture of killing floor, halo and dinosaurs, sounds silly but it's a really fun game to play with your friends. Good graphics, no story mode(single player), 5 different difficulties, pvp and co-op mods, three classes and many equipments to choose from, vehicles, simple serverlists, simple level system that rewards you boosts, ''starting weapons'' and more. This game is worth more than the price says, grab it and share with your friends! :)
2441	1	a	From what i see this game changed a lot... +1 for developers that delivered what they promesed and that is a rare thing this days
2443	1	a	Me and my friends were playing for 2 hours, but when we were almost done with the map, my friend drove us into a rock and we got stuck and we exploded.  11/10
2445	1	a	Q:Do I like it?Why? A:I cant decide.5 minutes into the games and im noclipping though the dinosaur while reloading.  Q:Overall? A:stuck on level 1  Q:Any useful tips? A:nope  DA SENTENCEEE  help.
2447	1	a	My friends call this game 'The good game because it's so bad'. A bare mininum shooter game with surprisingly good varity of weaponry. Expect glitches and bugs because it's not a triple A game.
2449	1	a	How much fun can you have for 60p?  Chased by a T-Rex Picked up by a Ptera Thrown onto a tank Proceed to blow up everything  Better than a bag of Walkers 10/10 would scream hysterically again
2451	1	a	   Basic Information
766	0	a	  It's A Trap!
2453	1	a	Have this weird need to drive all of my friends into things and get blown up. Drove a vehicle full of my buddies into a triceratops. Blew up. Killed all my friends. Got an achievement: Teammate From Hell. Pleased. 10/10 Would drive buddies to their deaths again.
2455	1	a	This game? This game is awesome. It costs only 0.79$. Thats pretty cheap for a game like that.  Lots of features, funny gameplays, multiplayer matchmaking super fast and lots more. Verry nice co-op with friends. Totally worth the money. Buy it!
2457	1	a	Ever punch a velociraptor in the face so hard it does a backflip as its head turns into a fine paste? Well now you can do so for a price worth paying to see it.
767	0	a	English (US) Look, the game is not bad ok, but the multiplayer community is pretty much dead, so... for a multiplayer only game, like battlefield, you won't have much to do, only buy if your friends are going to play with you...   Protugues (Brasil) Olha o jogo não é ruim mas a comunidade morreu, poucos ainda jogam, e como é um jogo exclusivamente multiplayer não há o que fazer mais, por isso não recomendo... Somente compre se voce tiver amigos que querem jogar com voce e vão voltar...  Nota: 7/10
2459	1	a	This game is like Dino D-Day, only better.
2461	1	a	As much as I absolutely despise games that try to be Halo, Doom and Dead Space all shifted into one blobby, stinking mess, I have to admit, this game caught me by surprise. When I saw the game on the Steam Store, and the big, hunky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with some sort of shiny, LED space suit caught my eye as he stood rather awkwardly next to the title, I thought 'Oh, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, not this ♥♥♥♥♥ again.' However, then I began playing the game and, over the span of about four hours, I realized what it was all about.  Most games pride themselves on intriguing characters, amazing, scripted scenes and all-out fantastic storylines. But, nope. Orion Prelude isn't about any of those things. Now, I know what you're going to say. 'Hold on there one second, Contorted. If it's not awesome, intriguing or fantastic, how is it a good game' Well, let me tell you. Usually when playing Call of Duty, Far Cry, Halo, you name it. I sometimes find myself thinking. 'Isn't this practically another one of those stories but just happening a different way? I mean, you start the game out not knowing what the ♥♥♥♥'s going on, a villian is introduced. Somewhere down the line he does something terrible and probably kills off one of your mates and then you ♥♥♥♥ him up for it and the game ends with you walking cockily into the distance?' With Orion, that kind of every-day ♥♥♥♥ doesn't happen. It's the simplicity and almost childlike logic on which the game prides itself on that makes it somewhat charming. It's one of the only games I've ever played that actually exists simply for fun and, somehow, the lack of anything huge or emotionally powerful happening actually works towards aplifying that charming simplicity. It literally exists for FUN.  However, the game isn't perfect. The lack of logic may work towards the game's advantage and atmosphere, but in some places it does get a little annoying. The slightest nudge from a T-Rex can send you flying to the other side of the map screaming 'To infity and ♥♥♥♥ you' in the opposite direction. Also, the idea that a flying Dinosaur that's about the size of a large Human can push away an air-based vehicle that's about five times its' size never fails to floppify my action boner. But, once again, these annoying little pockets of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t is what makes it all the more satisfying when you unload enough bullets into the Dinosaurs that are coming at you to kill them and they flop dead to the ground. Watching a flying Dino fall about five hundred feet and splat on a rock never fails to make me giggle. Also, one of the most, and I can't find another word to describe it, 'epic' game mechanics ever is the fact that, when a teammate dies, or you kill a T-Rex or Spinosaurus, the screen flops into slow-motion. Why? Because it makes killing a Dinosaur all the more awesome when its' body falls limp in slow motion.  Overall, Orion: Prelude is a fun little game, which is very childlike, but also quite charming and adorable to play. It's like you're one of the Spartans from Halo, stuck into a game of Primal Carnage, but you have a jetpack, medigun or a massive, armoured vehicle to help you out.
2463	1	a	Enjoy this game for what it is, a buggy piece of ♥♥♥♥ with horrific controls for Dinosaurs.  But ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ it's great.   Plus it's cheaper than a tap water from Starbucks.
2465	1	a	I shot a T-Rex in the face with a revolver, killed it, and then got eaten by it's mate. 8/10, would recommend.
2467	1	a	Is it a great game? No. Is it worth the price? Yes. Can you get some absurd fun out of it? Yes.
768	0	a	ORION: Prelude. Previously known as Orion: Dino Horde, and previously known before that as Dino Beatdown. It's a nifty little FPS about...well, the mass killing of dinosaurs. The name changes, despite what the developers will claim on their forums, are repeated attempts to avoid their perpetually low metacritic scores. Each iteration of this dino slaughter game is merely just a shameless repackaging, in an attempt to shed it's horrible metagamer score. Perhaps neither here nor there, but it does give you an idea of how dishonest this publisher is willing to be to ensure the game continues to sell.  The game has a glaring lack of polish, tends to run at very low framerates, even on powerful machines, and has the nasty habit of crashing...repeatedly, for no apparent reason. Notably, some people only rarely experience these crashes, but for many people, the game is rendered unplayable. And of course, when you're not crashing, your friends are disconnecting. Playing through a single match of any appreciable length becomes rather difficult.  Pair that with the repetitive music and downright embarrasing voices the humans feature, you get the distinct feeling that there was a notable lack of love going into the visuals and sound in this game. Seriously, though. The voices are reminiscent of an athsmatic in a bathroom with seasonal allergies and a horrible headcold. (Looking at you, support class! If you call me 'homey' one more time...)  Notably, the lag and the crashes and the disconnects are issues that have persisted for me and my friends over a year, since the game was called ORION: Dino Horde. If you are among the lucky people who can play this game without crashing non-stop, then I suggest you immediately stop to thank your lucky stars.   The game features a variety of modes, but most modes involve slaughtering dinos. (There are a few that allow you to play as dinos.) The game contains 3 classses of humans you can play as, support, assault, and recon. (Think of a clunkier version of Tom Clancy.) While assault is fun to play as with his jetpack, and the recon is nifty with her invisibility, the support class wins hands down, with his ability to heal himself and others....to an extreme degree. He can tank just about anything with his healing gun.  Even though the support class is massively overpowered, playing the game as any other class is quite difficult. Between massive dinos that create unavoidable earthquakes, or even bigger dinos that merely swallow you whole, ORION exists on a strange difficulty spectrum.  So long as one uses the support class, and uses the turrets on the backs of the vehicles you can ride, the game seems relatively easy. If you, like me, decide to explore what else the game has to offer, you'll run back to your support class/turret combo relatively quickly, as you find that the world of dino horde is quite a cruel one indeed.  In short, Orion: Prelude, under any name, is a glitchy, laggy, poorly thought out PVP shooter/dino killing game/dinos vs humans, that attempts to excuse its mediocrity with a low price point. Considering the legions of pvp shooters out there, you're probably better off picking up any one of those and leaving this one be.
2469	1	a	A 6 year olds wet dream
769	0	a	Game is ok. Devs are shady little children who can't handle negative feedback or make original content. 3/10 needs new dog models
2471	1	a	Guess what? It's actually fun. And guess what again? It doesn't look that bad. MY GOD WHAT SORCERY IS THIS
2473	1	a	7.5/10  $1 thats pretty good for dis game.
2475	1	a	Dude, it's cheap, it's worth it. Shooting dinos with your friends just for a dollar, cmon man. I see nothing bad here, good graphics and great fun with friends. Ok, it obviously could get boring after a while, but it's worth the price. I would say, it's even little bit too cheap for that kind of game, but whatever. Lol, believe me, you won't regret it.
770	0	a	Stop looking at the negative reviews this game is amazing and for $1 it's an absolute steal. 9/10
2477	1	a	Call of duty. For 50 cents. With dinosaurs. 10/10- IGN
2479	1	a	they should have made it free 2 play, the minute they put that money harvesting store in the game.  trek industries a.k.a. spiral studios a.k.a. Dave Prassell, isn't doing anybody any favors.  the game however, is still pretty good. i recommend it, begrudgingly. at least, now, you can't beat the price.  still, the company that made it is just as shady as any other video game company because they are ALL shady. it's an inherently shady industry, so you can't show me a game publisher who is not shady because there aren't any of those.
2481	1	a	I spent over 5 dollars on this game for other people...  I say money well spent, I enjoyed this game.
2483	1	a	1 dollar? Worth its price
773	0	a	Terrible game. Fun for first five minutes. After that it's problems show. Firstly, the dinos are all very static. Static in the sense that all the dinos ever do is just run at you with the same animations straight at you to attack. No lurking, no ai intelligence. The dinos are like tracking missiles just running directly at you. Next the vehicles feel very basic. The game's mech is a clunky mech which you click to fire a turret which is pretty much the same turret on every vehicle with a turret. The vehicles feel slow and not fun to drive. It is just endless waves repeating after each wave of dinos increasing in number and doing the same thing until you die.   The game's mechanics could do a little better at some things also, like when a ptero picks you up and flies if u kill it while it is flying it drops u and u die from fall dmg(wth?). Weapons in this game don't feel powerful at all. Imagine just firing at this dino and the dino does not even flinch or stumble. There is just the same blood splatter backwards and you grind him down until he dies. The music is loud and makes it feel like some arcade shootout. Even without the music, the dinos sound even louder than your guns.   This game is actually just Dino:Beatdown but re-released to try to get more players to buy after dino beatdown got bad reviews.  Now don't get me wrong the game is supposed to be co-op fun, but even with friends after awhile it will be just the whole team split up running in circles around the rocks shooting dinosaurs which are herded behind them.  What's good about this game though is that it had a nice concept and could be fun sometimes, but either buy it now at $1 or don't buy at all.
2485	1	a	I killed 5 Dinosaurs with a pistol  11/10
2487	1	a	That game can make the time you spend playing it fun and pretty interesting. The game has a fine graphic and good gameplay, the soundtrack is cool. That was a unique experience playing that game, I liked it a lot.
2489	1	a	One of the worst games, I have ever played. It's pretty fun.
2491	1	a	Never have I had so much fun insulting a t-rex's mother while doing my best impersonation of Duke Nukem.  10/10 would shoot dinos again  and again  and again.
2493	1	a	kinda like if halo and turok had a baby and that baby was thrown continusly off a building 10/10
774	0	a	Even for 99 cents, this game is a waste of your money. It's funny at first but the glitches and bad gameplay take their toll on that fun. After playing this for a while I just couldn't take it anymore. Still, it was 99 cents, not the worst waste of money.  EDIT: I will have a new look at this game soon, people have told me that these bugs have been fixed and the game is a lot better now. Until then you can pretty much disregard this review.  EDIT NUMBER TWO: I played the game some more, and honestly not much has changed. My review remains the same.
2495	1	a	For it's price, it's great. Had fun playing with friends.
2497	1	a	+ Environmental visuals were very well presented + Maps are extremely large, and you'll find yourself traversing them on your way to capture objectives + You get to shoot dinosaurs in the face; I really cannot stress enough how ridiculous and awesome this concept is + Weapon selection is not extensive, but the developers did a good job making sure that EVERY weapon is fun to use + Weapons also felt balanced, in that there weren't one or two that seemed to stand out as the best; if you rely on skill in this game, you'll be able to get away with using pistols and a knife and that's it + You can play a game mode that makes you a dinosaur + Very fun and numerous character customization options that further serve to show you this game does not take itself seriously + Vehicles were very fun to use, and had a contorl scheme reminiscient of the Halo franchise + Still frequently updated; you can tell that the developers just adore their own game  - Sound effects for the weapons were disappointing - The maps can be TOO big, turning a trip to capture an objective into a walking simulator - Needs more game modes; it has multiple game modes, currently, but they're all variations of a wave shooter
777	0	a	These developers are frauds.  As much as I hate Activision, these guys are just frauds.
2499	1	a	This game is very unique and one of its kind, in more ways than one. If you read the reviews of others who had been following this game since its beta/early access stages, you'll quickly notice that every one of them says that this game was practically a piece of garbage back then, and any games that get labelled as such will seldom get the opportunity to see the light of day years later.  Enter a group of stubborn developers who refuse to back down and watch their work go down the drain, they salvaged whatever's left from the wreck of the cruiser and built a collosal aircraft carrier out of it. The story basically sums up the history of ORION: Prelude.  With so many shooters involving zombies or aliens these days, this game's theme is very refreshing to say the least. It is a FPS where you get to shoot the long extinct reptile inhabitants of the universe that are dinosaurs. But that doesn't mean you're going to do that with makeshift bows crafted out of wood and stone-headed arrows. No no no no no, far from that. You'll be doing that with state-of-the-art futuristic gadgets and weaponries.  Combine that with cooperative team action and you have yourself a top of the notch game that is teamplay-worthy. The audio is also impressive, sporting above average voice-acting comparable to some high-end games out there. For its price, this game is good. There aren't many other games quite like it.  10 out of 10.  I am aware of the recent, what could I call it, “scandal that Spiral Game and TREK are involved in with the other game that is the spiritual successor of ORION: Prelude. However, I am only 2 things: a customer and a gamer. I purchased this game as a customer, and I play this game as a gamer. I’m not a game designer or a politician. Whether or not the game contains assets from games by other developers, stolen or otherwise unintentionally imitated, does not concern me as long as I get my money’s worth from the product I paid for. Even if the developers did mess up, it is up to the higher ups to settle the dispute. As gamers, you have the right to demand a refund or just boycott the product, but expressing your opinions on the developer’s actions is irrelevant because it is not going to change anything, and if you’re not an attorney who is going to represent either TREK or Activision in court, I’d advise you not to at all because it just makes you highly suspicious of being an employee of a competitor organization attempting to sabotage.  Because let’s face it, having all the negative reviews arise  after  the incident is like having “this game now sucks because of that written all over your review. If that is the case, it is funny how you still support games like   Payday 2 by Overkill, Killing Floor 2 by Tripwire Interactive or Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide by Fatshark,   because those developers are easily at the top of the   ♥♥♥♥   tier list. See, your duty as a reviewer is to determine if the game is good, and if the developer did a good job. If the developer didn’t implement anything that are detrimental to your gameplay, you need not whine about it. In which case I’m fairly certain that implementing assets from some other games does not affect your gameplay at all. I’m not saying I support the idea of stealing assets from other developers, but I’m just a gamer trying to enjoy a game I paid for.
2501	1	a	It does worth playing, is fun. I'm addicted.
2503	1	a	  It is a good game especially for Dino lovers it was the first game I play on PC and I loved it it is just such a good game I hope you also have a good time with it.
778	0	a	Do not buy or touch this game - it is run by filth. See below.  I recently read about all the evil, lying, deceitful shenanigans the company has been up to. A great summary here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4q6xo5/activisions_dmca_claim_on_orion_is_legit_orions/   2 of many of their stunts...  1. People on forums, discussing how the company is lying about various things to get good PR - get threatened with legal action and possible jailtime (nice try).  2. Gives their game to a YouTube channel, with permission to even to give negative feedback, on assumption it would give good PR - doubles back on decision, and issues DCMA takedown request to remove the video.  I believe an accurate description of David Prassel (of Trek Industries, developer of Orion) is that he is the filthy scum found in a gutter that can't be cleaned out.
779	0	a	The game is honestly not THAT terrible, but the developers are absolute scumbags. Don't give them your money.  For those unaware, in a nutshell, they took assets from other games (notably Call of Duty) and when they got taken off Steam because of stealing copyrighted content, they made a big fuss and told everyone big bad activision was unjustly attacking them.  And upon people discovering the claims were not Activision being evil, the developers tried to censor everything they could as the tide turned against them.  ♥♥♥♥ you TREK/Spiral. The Internet isn't your personal attack army.
780	0	a	scum developers steal game assets
2505	1	a	In just a little over 3 years, this decade of gaming will be coming to a close. Eventually, when we're all just a bunch of nostalgiac old folks looking back at this era, what are we going to remember most? In a discouraging period of unfinished games and broken promises, which productions will truly stand above the rest, leaving their mark on videogame history? I've been a gamer as long as I can remember. I've been waiting for that 'perfect game', the one that grabs you by the shoulders and doesn't let go until you've experienced every little ounce of detail the developers so masterfully placed within its frame. Today, I'm ecstatic to announce that my wait is over. All the years of sifting through garbage have finally paid off. ORION: Prelude is the game that I'm taking with me to my deathbed. Even at surface level, ORION: Prelude is a beautifully crafted masterpiece. Never before have we encountered such extensive level design that truly leaves the player breathless. The first time I stomped into the world of ORION: Prelude as the bold, massive Spinosaurus, I was nearly brought to tears. ORION: Prelude does not care that this decade still has a few years left. It's fully prepared to present itself in all its prehistoric glory as the best game in recent history. The intricately crafted but comfortable controls, gorgeous level design, and gripping story leave me yearning for nothing more. It's all I've ever wanted in a game.
781	0	a	I gave this game a chance, thinking it couldn't be as bad as people said it was; I was wrong.  Let me put it this way: there are Source mods that have higher production value than this game, and that's not saying much when you consider that those very same Source mods have funding from their own pockets and not some Kickstarter. This game might be running on Unreal, but it looks and feels like a bad Half-Life 2: Deathmatch mod.  Some could say that I can't compare this to AAA games, but I believe it's appropriate to add that I had more fulfillment out of both Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City and Aliens: Colonial Marines than I had with this.  It's worth the $1 they're charging as of this review, but no more than that.
2507	1	a	This is really, really good for a $1 game.   For a $1 game. 
2509	1	a	&gt;I get the game &gt;I join a server, the map is called 'Hell' &gt;It's ok i guess. &gt;Suddenly the map gets smaller &gt;A pumpkin appears out of ♥♥♥♥ing no where &gt;Kills my team &gt;We restart the map &gt;Pumpkin King again &gt;Fight him &gt;Trip &gt;Get on the floor &gt;Everybody walk the dinosaur
2511	1	a	Turn off in game music. Play Jurassic Park theme in background. WIN
2513	1	a	AMAZING. Now,I haven't been here since the beginning of this game but I can tell you one thing . . . it's AWESOME. It's entertaining and fun,I can never seem to leave the computer. ORION: Prelude is the best $1 game I've seen.
2515	1	a	Bought a four pack and gave it to some friends. We're not friends anymore.  10/purple.
2517	1	a	Fun game to do for a while  Their they come wave after wave. Just try to survive its awesome :D
2519	1	a	Today I've played it for a first time with my friends (thanks for the 4pack) and we had much fun with this game. :-) And for sure we're goin to play tomorrow again! 
2521	1	a	Since the original release (which I never played), the game has been completely remade. So the old scores aren't valid.  It's a little rough at the start when you're figuring out how to play it, as there's no tutorial. But it's easy to pick up.  Then you kill a stegosaurus with a bow to the face, mow down a pack of raptors with a supercharged laser beam, and shoot a t-rex in the face with a tank.  Extremely fun, very frantic gameplay.  'Run or shoot. RUN OR SHOOT?' 'BOTH.'
2523	1	a	This game is worth only with friends.
2525	1	a	7 hours for a quarter... beats an arcade any day
2527	1	a	lot of people say this game is crap or weird, but everyone has different opinions, and everyone is entitled to their opinion. This game has more positive features than cons. I'd say that the only real problems with this game are that it's not well-optimized, it's somewhat repetitive, the animations kinda' suck, the graphics aren't impressive, not all the game-modes are good as horde, the dinosaur AI is extremely basic, some of the sounds are basic, and the dinosaurs aren't like their real-life counterparts. I also don't like the new name and logo, they should have just kept 'Orion: Dino Horde.' Looking past that, this is the best dollar I've ever spent. Dinosaurs, Jet-packs, guns, robots, vehicles, LIghtSaber, explosions?. And the soundtrack is freakin' amazing! Overall, I give this a 9/10. (Cheap But Way Better Than you Thinks) 
2529	1	a	One of the only games I know that lets you fight dinosaurs     and I love it :D
2531	1	a	i've bought items in team fortress 2 that were more expensive than this game
2533	1	a	This game is seriously the most fun I have had in a long time, it may not be as polished as some other triple A titles but cmon, Mechwarriors, Vtols, Dinos, etc! This game is like a bizzare yet awesome fusion of Jurrassic Park, Halo, and Killing Floor. Its not at all a serious game but I love that fact about it and playing with other people you are sure to have a good time and laugh at some of the bugs in the game which were never breaking the game or experience but only enhanced it with hilarity! As they come out with more updates the few bugs in it that did kind of bother me will be fixed. If you are looking for a cheap game to play with friends that isnt all serious its WELL worth your time to try this one out!
2535	1	a	Best Cheapo on Steam and a must own!   again. good thing they realized, that F2P was a crappy Idea)  
2537	1	a	Incredibly buggy, yet somehow really fun. Although the game is pretty broken I can't help but have fun killing dinos. Think kind of like Left 4 Dead survival mode, but like 100x dumber.
2539	1	a	I've only spent 99 minutes in this game as of writing this review, and already I have been; Blown up by my teammates. Swallowed whole by three different large dinosaurs. Picked up and smashed on a rock by a pterodactyl. Swarmed and devoured by chickens with scales. Forgotten to buy ammo and then murdered by a horde of everything. Bullrushed by a triceratops. Had the time of my life.  Buy it. Now.
2541	1	a	I ran into a dead T-Rex's body and it moved like it didn't weigh a ♥♥♥♥ ton. Dino/10.
2543	1	a	I recommend this game if you love dinosaurs or things with dinosaurs on them, like blankets, towels, little baggies. Dinosaurs fo'eva.
2545	1	a	Orion: Dino Horde is a big improvement on Orion: Dino Beatdown and is great to play. Many people buy games like this to play with their friends and such, but this game is great with and without friends. There is a diverse range of gamemodes and maps with a large selection of weapons and vehicles. Zoom around in your jetpack or revive your teammates or go incognito and tactically take out some dinosaurs or enemies. Customise your player model with hats and armour types. Who wouldnt want to do that? This game has great visuals and fantastic gameplay. Like seriously? Who doesnt have fun running dinosaurs over in jeeps and taking a t-rex down in a mech suit? Who doesnt love burning little raptors to a crisp? This game overall is fantastic and I highly recommend it.
2547	1	a	Great game for sure. It is worth your money, so you should definitly decide to buy this game. After the update, it is very replayable and there is so many game modes to explore! Do not wait! Concept 8\10 Graphic 8\10 Gameplay 8\10 Replayability 9\10 
2549	1	a	Do you like killing dinosaurs and are on a budget?! Then grab your high powered bow cause its killing time.  A simple arcane like defense came where you gain credits after every round to buy new skills and perks along with weapons depending on your class (and some neutral ones that everyone can buy) to help you survive the increasing hordes of small an large dinosaurs.  Featuring a couple game types, you defend a generator from waves of enemies with vehicles and weapons. They perks allow certain feats to be obtained, like jumping high, being able to heal machines (as a medic) and many many more.  Several different types of dinosaurs are present in this game, like pterodactyls, raptors, t-rex and spinosaurus. Depending on the round and which objective is present, certain dinos will spawn. These large giants are considered the bosses of the game, having very high health pools and insanely high damage.  While the game isn't hard to master, and very easy to understand, I found it got boring playing by yourself or with random people online. I would recommend playing with a friend or two if you can.  Its really cheap when its not on sale and a steal when it is. Give it a try, you will get atleast a couple hours out of it at the very least. 
2551	1	a	This game is so ♥♥♥♥, good and fun at the same time. Totally worth it.
791	0	a	Stolen Content, Bad Company that will sue you to cell if you say something bad about them
2553	1	a	Though lacking in polish, it's a  fun  game,  for $1 or $4  you can have a fun afternoon playing around with your friends for  free .   The  UI  is pretty bad as is the quality of many of the interactables and markers, but it's functional.  Some of the modes like the (Player)Dinos VS Marines(Player) require lots of players since they can't be played with bots.  The netcode could use some work, PVP between 2 computers in the same network was pretty laggy, so LAN play would be a nice addition.  It's a pretty basic game and on the lowest settings practically any PC can run it.   Overall, I'd recommend it if you are looking for some  fun  co-op if you know you can get past the game's lack of polish, and no there's no barrier to entry.
2555	1	a	Every time this game was on sale, the low metacritic score made me keep my distance. I was still skeptical when the developers offered it at 90% off, but it's hard to not try something for a dollar. And that was a good decision. Burnt out on Killing Floor? Give Dino Horde a shot. There's lots of different game modes, plenty of weapons and augmentations, a few vehicles, three classes of characters with different abilities, 50 levels of character unlocks, several levels of difficulty, and even Borderlands style second wind. I've had an enormous amount of fun so far with this game. Ignore the useless metacritic score and check it out--a welcome addition to the coop club.
2557	1	a	This game cost me £0.39. Its the best £0.39, I have ever spent. Simple game. You get cars, you buy guns, you defend points and shoot dinos. What more could you want?  10/10 would buy again
793	0	a	This game is a scam. The publisher didn't pay the developers and they are using assets they stole from Black Ops 3. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!
2559	1	a	It's fun.
2561	1	a	This game has a lot of bad press about it, and it doesn't deserve it as much as it did in the past. Things have gotten a lot better since ORION: Dino Beatdown, and even from the original release of ORION: Dino Horde (which people got for free if they already had O:DB, so check if you already have it from the previous name), and the amount of fun you have with the game is linked to your disposition to it.   If you go in thinking it's going to be a terrible game, you're not going to have fun with it. If you think it could be good, then you'll probably give it more of a chance. There's been a lot of updates and additions that probably fixed something you didn't like about it before. (I'm looking at you, TotalBiscuit, and everyone that follows him blindly about his first impressions.)  With that said, this can be a lot of fun with friends, playing by yourself is okay, but it really shines with more people. If you get on Skype/TeamSpeak with some pals (because who uses in-game voice chats anymore, really?), you can coordinate and assist each other in your fight against waves of dinosaurs who apparently find the noise/smell of your energy generators really annoying/tasty. I've found it to be an enjoyable alternative to Killing Floor or especially any of the modes in the CoD games (save for MW1 or BO2).  Sure, it's had a past behind it, and there's some concepts borrowed from other games, but if you wait for a sale (namely right now, it's free to play for the week of Feb 20-27, and you can have it forever if you pay a single dollar), then maybe you can justify the purchase. Personally, I don't think that it's worth it at full price, but once it goes under 50% discount, that should ease the hesitation. Now go ahead and try it on a sale (maybe get a 4-pack to share), bring some friends along, don't be a filthy public match joiner.
796	0	a	This game is simply bad. Based on a weak engine (Unreal 3 - outdated, doesnt support ms antialiasing just the terrible fxaa etc.) Awful animations, boring gamemodes and maps... Dont believe to those who tell you dont believe to metascore.  If you want to try out an interesting multiplayer fps with asymmetric teams I can recommend Natural Selection 2. That is a well made game. This is not.  Oh and I mostly forgot to mention the ingame shop where you have to buy extra skins, equipment and animations for real money - but fortunately that wont be a big temptation.
2563	1	a	 Great value for money
2565	1	a	Orion: Prelude A dinosaur survival/TDM/CTF/etc game that has you shooting dinosaurs wave after wave, upgrading your character and buying yourself better weapons. This game is incredibly fun and never gets old, I have been playing this game for quite some time now, and now that I persuaded my friends to buy the game, I play even more. I strongly recommend you buy this game if you have not already.
2567	1	a	I love Orion Dino Horde. Don't listen to lowell he doesn't know ♥♥♥♥.
797	0	a	Every time this game gets too many bad steam reviews, the developers re-release it under a different name. I think this is like, the 3rd or 4th time?
2569	1	a	I got to say it's a lot better than I expected.  However, play it with friends, alone it isn't quite that fun :/
2571	1	a	Yes, it is worth $.99, almost all games are.
2573	1	a	It is halo and dinosaurs. I repeat: halo and dinosaurs. Why would you want to be killing stupid zombies when you could be killing all of your favorite prehistoric beasts? Don't think about it. It's true, it's good, and it gets better everyday. Have you ever killed a t-rex with a bow? No? Then get the game. I recommend.
2575	1	a	Shooting T-Rex and driving crazy cars for 0,79€
2577	1	a	I know that the first version of Dino Horde didn't get very good reviews, and many people pass this game up because of that. The game has had a revival since then, and has gotten much better as a game. Having not actually played the earlier version, I personally find it hard to believe that a game so creative and well made could ever deserve the terrible metascore and overall hate that Dino Horde has recieved. This really is a great game, it probably won't be on a top five FPS list any time soon, but for people that love science fiction shooter games with simple objectives and a gun purchase system like in CS:GO, then this is the game for you. It also has dinosaurs in it, so that's a plus.  Edit: This review is for dino horde. Prelude is a terrible game; the creators messed up big time.
2579	1	a	This is a real interesting game, and I don't understand why people give such awful reviews about it. It has a fun twist with survival, and should recieve more fans.
2581	1	a	Well..   its a good game just need more server and people to play this game
2583	1	a	The port is kinda poor for low end rigs even 6 years later ahaha, but honestly, one of my favorite games, grab a couple buddies and hop on and youll have a blast!
2585	1	a	  You can't go wrong with that tag.
2587	1	a	One of my friends let me drive a mech onto the back of a jet, then we went around and murdered a ton of T-rex's. Then I got hit with a rock and fell 75 feet to the ground. Got out of the mech, and started flying around in a jetpack with a minigun and a rocket launcher.  Play this game, its only a 1.00$
798	0	a	This game give you some amount of ♥♥♥♥ in ur ♥♥♥ cuz you eat large D while shootin dinos. BAd game Like 3/11teen
2589	1	a	Kiwi spent 2 hours punching a grand total of 2136 dinosaurs.
2591	1	a	THIS IS THE SEQUEL TO BAD RATS, ITS CALLED: BAD DINOZ. ITS A REALLY COOL GAME THAT KICKS A LOT OF BUTT AND IS CRAZY WACKY GOOFY FUN FOR ALL THOSE NUTTY DINO ENTHUSIASTS ACROSS ALL OF PANGEA AND BEYOND!
2593	1	a	I thoroughly enjoyed this.    11/10 Have never played would review again.
2595	1	a	Greatest game ever.
2597	1	a	If u liek Primal Carnage, or at least shooting dinos, ur probably gunna liek this
2599	1	a	I like this game because you can try out wepones and meet new friends
2601	1	a	Awesome game , really it is well done guys
2603	1	a	The game is a s#!t show. But a glorious, messy gooey dino s#!t show, a s#!t show that for a price of one dollar will give you a jetpack and rocket launcher, mechas, warplanes, massive maps and ptaradctyls. That is quite a lot for a s#!t show. Would you like to come to the s#!t show? I think you should. Now excuse me, as I go kill a triceratops.
2605	1	a	Got in tank to shoot T-rex, T-rex flipped and blew up my tank 10/10
2607	1	a	This is a really good game. You kill dinosawrs and they die. Worth buying. 11/10 Would play again. - Warning! - (Needs real friends to play with for this to be really fun)  By the time I'm writing this it costs only 0,79€ ... I bought it for 10€ or some ♥♥♥♥ like that. So this game is REALLY worth 0,79€. Recommended. Play dis nao.
2609	1	a	Truth be told, I am not a big fan of the 'standard' multiplayer. But the open world missions are entierly different. You must protect your base, explore and fight off hordes of dinos. The most fun I've had since Minecraft alpha.
2611	1	a	good game for the price of a biscuit from popeyes  biscuit/10
2613	1	a	Ignore the Metacritic reviews, this game is a lot of fun. Survival game mode with friends is very fun and challenging. Gain money to buy new weapons an perks, choose a class, level up. A+ game.
2615	1	a	So everyone on the web apparently dislikes this game a lot. I don't see it.  Dino Horde is a delightfully fun Horde shooter with various modes including pvp that pits friends up against waves of dinosaurs. Similar to Dino-D-Day, there is pvp modes where one team are the dinos, and the other are humans. It's pretty fun and works about as much as dino d day does.  The survival mode is where the game shines. You fight increasingly hard waves of dinos as you try to defend yourselves and various generators around the map. The maps are huge and the graphics are really nice to the eye.  Right off the bat, the HUD looks like it was straight from Halo. The gameplay is a mix of Borderlands, Left 4 Dead, Serious Sam, and even TF2. When you go down, you have to either revive your teammate, or kill a dino to get back up, similar to Borderlands. The game is highly customizable, and is insanely fun.  The Metacritic score can go ♥♥♥♥ itself. This game is great.
2617	1	a	Dino horde brings back my childhood dreams of paleontology. Rather than digging them up, you put them in the ground. An absolute blast.
2619	1	a	After many game updates from the old title ORION: DinoHunt, they gave the game a new title called ORION: Prelude.  The game is a lot of fun since they fixed it and I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who is casual on the FPS genre. Although a bit taxing on old computer hardware, it's really cheap and feels like a cross between Unreal Tournament and Jurassic Park.  With many game modes to choose from, how the dinosaur action is played is up to you and able to play with other people as well. Go nuts!
2621	1	a	it is a nice game, i hope they add more into it and best 1$ i ever spent, i recomend that everybody buy this game!
2623	1	a	The game is pretty fun, I would classify this game to be that type where u mess around and stuff. Unless you want to take it serously and go on the HARDCORE mode. Mostly all the 'bad' reviews are all the players that paid for the game and when it became free to play, players raged. Pretty good game. I would rate it 7/10
2625	1	a	it is a nice game, i hope they add more into it and best 1$ i ever spent, i recomend that everybody buy this game!
2627	1	a	this game is about jeff goldblum in space
2629	1	a	There was a dinosaur I got a laser rifle There was no more dinosaur  10/10 - Would murder dinosaur again
802	0	a	Badly done, boring and low quality
2631	1	a	OK i played in short time but I really recommend this game for all people who like killing each other or killing dinosaur.Overall,graphic are really damn nice and perfomance of this game is work well for me (I got steady 40-50 fps) which is good sign.Also its just 1 dollar guy,so come buy and support the developer~!!  Will look foward of what Spiral can do next...Goodluck
2633	1	a	Bought for $0.99....should of bought a 7/11 taquito to enjoy the inferno ♥♥♥♥ cleaning.
2635	1	a	WORTH BUYING!! 10/10  Highly recommend this game, I simple love playing it! - Reminds me of playing UT - Reminds me of playing Halo  - Reminds me of playing Killing Floor. - But most importantly it reminds me of playing Turok back in the days on the N64 &lt;3  This game is very underrated, metascore 90/100, easy..   Way better then the high priced games in my list, so why are you still reading instead of buying? HURRY UP AND BUY!
2637	1	a	Steam just downloaded an update for this game, which reminded me of it. Funny, I thought I reviewed this game before. Nevermind.   The first big problem with this game was that people expected too much from it, even when it was selling for $0.99 (or €0.99, or £0.99, whatever...). It looks tired, outdated and it's got glitches left, right and center, but for that kind of money, who cares? It's a nice, casual little dino shooter to play either solo or coop with friends and/or foes, that's all. And honestly, Orion is way better than most of the indie crap which is sold on Steam for way more than that, also not to mention that the devs are still updating it, surprisingly...  Up until when I last played (a year ago or so), the second biggest problem was the lack of players (and servers, as a consequence). Because most people who bought it wouldn't take it seriously -- and I'm not sure if even the devs took their own product seriously, first selling it for that price, now giving it away for free --, it was always the same little community playing and a few newcomers in between. Hopefully now that it's gone F2P, things will change, and if so, I may be back playing it.  Well, it's free now, so no excuse for anyone not to try it at least...
2639	1	a	I had no idea what to expect going into this game. Had it gifted from a friend since IT'S $0.99 RIGHT NOW!!! Turned out to be a riot. You could take it seriously if you wanted to, but it's more fun to treat it like halo with dinosaurs in it. I mean, come on. I can't think of a reason not to buy this game, especially for a buck.
803	0	a	Even though I bought for discount nowadays I feel like an idiot for still having about 4 copies in my inventory that was supposed to gift for friends to play with, but felt embarrassed of doing so because the game was so unfinished. And the other issues with the company itself won't help its popularity. Still kinda fun to play if you take in consideration that it is buggyish.
804	0	a	It's just a bad game tbh.
2641	1	a	This game is unoriginal in the sense of the weapons, vehicles, gameplay, and layout. But don't think i disliked the game, it is phenominal. The action and co op make the game perfect for multipalyer. At the heart of it, this game is plain fun to play.
805	0	a	really ♥♥♥♥ game but worth the 99c price tag
2643	1	a	Great fun Game to play with your friends
806	0	a	With 160++ hours on this game over the course of almost 1 years seeing this game in steam. Good game with high potential, sadly the devs take this game lightly.   the game stopped developed after the 1$ promotion and later the F2P status. and lead to other kind of problems.  I tell you with my honest point of view  - no or too little guide for newcomers (in-game help) - bugs, frequent crashing problems and poorly optimized game mechanic. - time consuming steam achievements. - lags or high ping problems (if unlucky, mostly unlucky) - inactive community in forum  - repetitive and easily get bored. nothing much to explore. - unforgiving for newcomers, you need to level up to get advantages on your characters. - too much game mode with each of them have under the mediocre optimization. (too little players play the game) - servers mostly empty. rarely seeing others game mode in play. - very bad radar display - glitched map. - bad optimization on rampage mode especially for dino part.  the good things are:  + a lot of species of dino. flying one, small one compy, big one t-rex raptor, etc + has fps style mixed with survival elements againts dino. + vehicles. a lot of vehicles + 3 classes to be played. + it went F2P, so no harm if you regret playing this game.  conclusion - no harm to try this game. sorry to say, due to its state i cannot recommend this game to you until the devs perform any responsible action to fix the current issues.
2645	1	a	I really love this game. The graphics, atmosphere, weapons, tactics, co-op, multiplayer, dinosaurs, and every other things are really awesome. This game reminds of Crysis sometime and other games too because this game is almost like it, halo, KF and others but having dinosaurs! You cannot only kill dinosaurs, you can also become a dinosaurs (rampage mode) which makes this game great fun to play with your friend. I started off with the DM mode which was quite good and after that I was basically playing survival mode with my friends, it was fun chasing the small dinosaurs, flying dinos, huge dinos, and others. I really recommend this game - the developers put alot of effort into this game. Really this game is not really worth $0.99, I should've spend more money on this!
807	0	a	Absolutely terrible, do not waste any money on this whatsoever. Complete trash.
808	0	a	Just don't buy this game.  Why? Not because of the CoD weapon copy situation that is happening. But because this game is just boring. The enemies run straight up to you and do the attack move thing, and this game doesn't add anything new that makes me enjoy this game.  I've played it once, and the next day the game just doesn't want to start up. What the ♥♥♥♥...   I wish I didn't buy this game.
809	0	a	Unfortunately shady devs.
810	0	a	Ooo he stealin'!
2647	1	a	Pros  Great graphics and high framerate addicting multiplayer, singleplayer and lets not forget co-op You get to kill Dinosaurs WHO DOESN'T WANT TO DO THAT? Nice players Awesome vehicles Awesome Guns Smart bot AI  Cons Not many servers vehicles lag if the server is to far away and you have high ping  Raptors will kill you to fast if you dont melee them like instantly because they swarm you you have to pay for skins there are no loot boxes for the skins (I totally didn't buy one because im addicted)  Overall Ratings Score in Graphics 7.9/10 Score in Framerate 8.0/10 Score in AI 8.9/10 Overall Score is 8.7! (avarage for me being 7-8) Do I love this game and will I keep playing it? yes and yes! At the time of posting this review this is my favourite game and I bought this for my friend to play with me I love it so much!
2649	1	a	Can't...Stop...Playing... Vehicles with weapons, plenty of guns, different play styles, and teamwork! Dino Horde gets a 9.5/10 because, unlike other dev teams, here development and new content never ceases. The community of players are great and you quickly meet veterans ready to help you out, share credits, and help you level. Not to mention there are a variety of game modes, the most exciting (for me) being survival mode, where increasingly large waves of dinosaurs arrive in game to munch on you. On harder game levels the battles are so intense you find yourself narrowly escaping with your life by killing a t-rex just before he chomps down on you, or getting ground stomped by a stegosaur that sends your vehicle flying through the air...but it is okay because you got a jet-pack!  
2651	1	a	What you pay is what you get bro. A $0.99 game and expecting to be a great game? nono. But it's lots of fun playing with friends. Rating 5/10
2653	1	a	Wow I'm suprized this game kick's A$$ 2 friends and I played co-op and it's really addictve All diff kinds of vehicles like bf4 and hordes of dinosaurs almost like left for dead but dinosaurs and A lil like sanctum 2 with the tower deffense of protecting the generators.Great amount of cool futuristic guns and jet packs if u want. What more can u ask for $0.99 I Love It
2655	1	a	This game is like a combination of Starwars, Unreal Tournament, and Jurrasic park, by far 3 very popular things together couldnt turn out better than ORION. The dinosaurs will actually use pack strategy on you, and instead of being high and mighty in vehicles, larger dinos can put you in your place quite easily. By far an epic game experience thats never the same twice.
812	0	a	You know its bad when they use Steam reviews in there trailers
2657	1	a	Pew pew pew pew You get to kill dinosaurs What more do you want  11/10 will pew
2659	1	a	YOU ARE NOT IL-2 BOS.  CONGRATULATIONS ON SAVING YOUR 0,50 EU
816	0	a	I never enjoyed this game anyways because it always seemed choppy and unfinished. Now that there's controversy about the dev stealing assets (and trying to blame Activision for stealing THEIR assets) it just adds fuel to the fire. Bad game and bad devs.
2661	1	a	 &gt;&gt;_Summer-Rain_ has joined the game &gt;&gt;C0LDH4RT has joined the game &gt;&gt;R4V3Z3R0 has joined the game &gt;&gt;NOVA-FALL has joined the game   So here you are again. Except this time, you're with your friends,  Ravemeister  and his brother  The Fatman , in a game looking very Halo-esque. Everyone spawns in a bunker with serviceable graphics, before all of you run to yet another bunker, buying your weapons.   'Come on, let's go!'  Ravemeister yells, stepping out before suddenly getting mauled by Velociraptors.  'RUN!'  You scream, as Compsognathus and a huge, gigantic Stegosaurus lumbers toward the base, spawning Compsognathus.   ORION: PRELUDE.   Panicking, The Fatman fires wildly at Velociraptors and Compsognathus, cutting a bloody swath in their ranks  as Summer-Rain concentrates her fire on the Stegosaurus. You clamber about on a vehicle and spin the mounted gun towards the large boss dinosaur, logic and biology be damned. The mounted cannon spins up and empties a volley of lead into the Stegosaurus, sending it to Reptile Heaven.  The announcer yells that the wave is defeated, and now a cooldown period is in effect to stock up on weapons, ammo and upgrades. You attempt to buy something with real world money, but the button in-game seems broken, and you shrug it off. Summer-Rain then checks up on you, her wizard hat the color of purple with yellow stars, bought from a time before you were with her.   'You ok? How's the game turning out for you?'  Summer-Rain asks, checking on her scoped rifle.  'It's cool I guess.'  you begin, before Velociraptors saunter into view from the horizon and a T-Rex lumbers towards all of you, spawning (you guessed it) Compsognathus again.   'We got trouble! AIYAIYAIYAIYAIAYAI!'  Ravemeister shrieks, wearing an astronaut's helmet on top of his space ranger suit which looks like a sleeker version of Master Chief's SPARTAN armor, while firing away with his rifle. You shake your head with a smile as Summer-Rain and The Fatman cover you. The T-Rex goes down when The Fatman and Summer-Rain commandeer a vehicle and use the mounted cannon, proving once more that anything that is mounted and spits lead at a rate of 600 rounds per minute is more than enough to send any dinosaur to Reptile Heaven.   'That was good...!'  The Fatman sings, his armored, anti-bomb-like form shuddering as he exits the Warthog- lookalike.  'Yeah! This game isn't so boring now with you guys, and in a  far better shape than it was in as compared to when it was first  released!'  Summer-Rain sighs, exiting the mounted weapon from the Warthog-lookalike's rear. Ravemeister fist-bumps you while buying ammo and a health upgrade when suddenly, the player prompt flashes across all your displays.   &gt;&gt;HOODED ANGST has joined the game &gt;&gt;KILLER'S CONSCIENCE has joined the game &gt;&gt;SHADOW OF DOUBT has joined the game &gt;&gt;MR. HOLLYWOOD has joined the game &gt;&gt;RA'S AL GOON has joined the game &gt;&gt;MRS. NOVOCAINE has joined the game    'Oh boyyy...'  Ravemeister anticipates.  'Oh damn...'  The Fatman shivers.  'Oh no...'  you breathe.  'Oh great.'  Summer-Rain rolls her eyes.   'STARBOY COLDHEART!'  All of them shout, seemingly in unison. Ravemeister locks and loads his weapon, while The Fatman hops into a randomly-spawned VTOL. Summer-Rain leaps behind the Warthog-lookalike's mounted gatling gun and gives you a curt nod which means  'everything will be ok, baby.'  You hold your rifle as much as you can attempt to be confident.   '...you got married...'  you state in an almost deadpan manner, your chest tight at the sight of the former Ms. Novocaine, along with the person  whom you thought was your good friend, the low-IQ  Ra's Al Goon . In between them is the devious villain  Mr. Hollywood , an inane director out for the blood of innocents.  'Yes, Starboy! Your girlfriend is now my wife!'  Mr. Hollywood gloats, as your previous 'friend' Ra's Al Goon hunches over and tries to fire at you like the deformed arab that he is.  Dodging, Summer-Rain fires the gatling cannon into the air as a warning shot.  'We're supposed to be on the same side if none of us spawn as dinosaurs!'  She says with annoyance, shooting dirty looks at Ms. Novocaine. As if she knew what Summer-Rain was thinking, she fires at Summer-Rain's shoulder, making her shout in pain and fall from the warthog lookalike's platform.   'SUMMER!'  you shout, rushing to her side. Ms. Novocaine squints her eyes evilly as the countdown timer ends and dinosaurs return, spawning.   'It's  'Mrs.'  Novocaine now, dear.'  Mrs. Novocaine sneers, before the dinosaurs approach and the battle becomes an intense free-for-all.  '...and Starboy?'  You glare at Mrs. Novocaine amid the chaos and draw your rifle on your ex-girlfriend, her head dead center in your sights.  'You were never good enough.'  Mrs. Novocaine sneers again.   'DAMN YOU!'  You fire, but a running Velociraptor gets hit between you and Mrs. Novocaine before the dust kicks up and dinosaurs and blaster fire rain about everywhere around the both of you.  'Summer?! Hang on, ok?!'  You motion for her again, and she clasps at your arm desperately. You see that Mrs. Novocaine's shot cut clean through Summer-Rain's shoulder and neck, tears in her eyes as she bleeds profusely.   'H-help... help, Starboy-'  She collapses, and you quickly dispatch a Velociraptor closing in on the both of you, with the Spinosaurus of this wave charging to your location.  'RAVE! SUMMER'S HURT!'  You bundle Summer-Rain close to you and run to the game's exit.  'I'll cover you, Coldheart! The Fatman, get over here bro! Starboy must get back to his room with Summer if it's the last thing we do!'   As you enter your home from the heavy rain pouring outside, Summer-Rain in  your arms, you lay her on the couch in the living room and stay by her side. You've applied a makeshift tourniquet with your hoodie as the immersion from the game you've been playing together with everyone vanishes, and her wound is somewhat stable. The blood soaks to the couch and the floor, but all you can think of doing is whispering sweet words and telling her that you are here, that  you attended to her wound as much as you can, and honored her wishes for no call to the hospital.   'Let... let me die. Please Starboy. Let m-me die.'  Summer-Rain whispers to you through ragged breaths.  'No!'  You exclaim.  'Never! Summer, I love you!'  You hold her hand gingerly, and she returns your grasp tightly.  'I know. That's... that's the problem, isn't it.'  Summer-Rain mutters, her breathing heavy.  'What do you mean? If it's about killing the dinosaurs in Prelude, you did a great job with all of us-'    'No Starboy.'  Summer-Rain heaves a heavy sigh.  'She's right you know.'  Your eyes go wide as Summer-Rain talks to you.  'I'm not good enough, not for myself and certainly not for you.'  She looks at you through tired eyes.  'I love you so much, Starboy Coldheart.'  she whispers.  'Don't ever think that you weren't good enough for me, because that's what I was all this time for you. I love you Starboy Coldheart. Don't you ever forget that.'  Summer-Rain closes her eyes.  'Summer?'  you whisper.   'SUMMER!'  You shout. Summer-Rain scrunches her face in annoyance.  'Starboy, I wanna rest.'  she responds.   ORION: PRELUDE.

2673	1	a	First game, survived a few rounds, bought the 'worse' guns and got eaten by a T-Rex. 10/10
2675	1	a	Sound like a good game despite of the note in many site, it is a real pleasure to play with friends! Alone it is a harder but you cannot dispatch the defense position but it stays completly playable.  However I regret a training mode, with many health (maybe god mode) and so on to discover the ability of weapon and so on... I see somewhere on the forum that developers are creating admin command then try do not forget 'funny' command (or cheaty command as you wish :p)  
2677	1	a	I paid $1.09 for this game not knowing what it was all about but the screenshots looked pleasing, it's very easy to learn how to play. I find this game really fun, so simple, yet very good.
2679	1	a	Worth It
2681	1	a	Killing dinosaurs in a futuristic environment sounds fun... and it is. Especially if you play it with some friends. Grab your guns, upgrade yourself with some augments and kick some a$$. Leveling up gives you some bonuses.  You can choose between three different classes (Assault, Support, Recon) which only vary slightly. What makes every player different is how they customize their augments. This is by no means a bad thing. You are not stuck to a special weapon set depending on your class. You want to be a jetpacking shotgun maniac or a sniping medic? No problem. It's all up to you.I have to admit the weapon balance isn't that great. There is no effective automatic gun. To do good damage you have to pick either a shotgun or sniper rifle.  The maps are huge and it can take a few minutes to arrive on the other side without a vehicle. That's great but therefore they havent many maps available. For each map there is a day and a night variation but this makes nearly no difference to the actual gameplay. Map objectives seem to appear on random locations every time so it's at least not exactly the same experience every time.  Vehicles variety is awesome. There aren't many different vehicles available but they are all different from each other. Steering a minigun welding mech or fly around in a harrier... It's fun. Navigating left or right by using the mouse is something you have to get used to. Other controls are easy to go.  So the overall gameplay is pretty solid but at some points it's a little bit glitchy when it comes to player positioning. In some cases you can get stuck in walls and the hitboxes of the tiny dinosaurs are a little bit weird.  What drives me mad somehow is the 'Spiral Store' where you can buy Hats and colors for real money. This would be perfectly O.K. for me in a free to play game but not in a full priced game. It doesn't affect gameplay but getting them as rewards for achievements would be way more appreciated. It can get boring after a while since it's the same again and again. It offers some different gamemodes but in the end it is PvP or survival... Since player positioning sucks it's only surivival for me. This is why I would recommend to get this game only if you have some friends to play this game together in Co-Op since this makes it a lot more enjoyable.  This is my opinion about the game and may differ from yours...   TL;DR  Personal rating: 6 Fair | out of 10  The good: + Alot of different perks/augments + Vehicles + Huge maps + Plenty of gamemodes + Simple controls  The bad: - Weapon balance - Glitchy hitboxes - Low amount of maps - Fancy hats from the trailer only for real money - Gets boring if you play it alone
2683	1	a	-Opened Game -Joined Match -Immediately Killed by T-Rex -Immediately Love game. In all seriousness though, I absolutely LOVE this game. It's got the gameplay mechanics of Advanced Warfare, the charm and uniqueness of an indie game (despite not being one.) and the amazing graphics of Half Life. It's an amazing game, and it's only $1!
2685	1	a	I realize this game has gotten a bad reputation from it's alpha stages, and people don't like how they changed the name to avoid ridicule. But WOW! It's improved a TON! I don't see why anyone could complain about such a well done FPS Dinosaur game- Freaking Dinosaurs man!!!! I love the game mechanics, and the multiplayer is surprisingly solid. By far the best game I've played seen on steam. So many weapons, vehicles, upgrades, perks and maps make this game a HUGE online experience that everyone should have the opportunity to play. Almost flawless, and still coming out with updates, I think Spiral developers are some of the greatest developers out there! Keep doing what you're doing guys!
2687	1	a	It has its problems, but is lots of fun. lol
2689	1	a	If you like goudging out your own eyeballs and setting them on fire while partying with knifed in your feet you will LOVE THIS GAME.
2691	1	a	this game is very fun if play you with your friend
2693	1	a	Well. it's definitely your money's worth. Otherwise ugly and broken but mildly entertaining, and not (as) terrible (as you'd expect) for $1.
2695	1	a	Experience true combat gameplay in a massive military sandbox. Deploying a wide variety of single- and multiplayer content, over 20 vehicles and 40 weapons, and limitless opportunities for content creation, this is the PC’s premier military game. Authentic, diverse, open - ORION : Prelude sends you to war.
2697	1	a	Top notch banter, with added dinosaurs. Hours of entertainment, though is better with friends. gr8 m8 8/8.
2699	1	a	Had tons of fun playing this game! 10/10
2701	1	a	It's fun, game has some depth and progression...all for $0.50!
2703	1	a	Cool game there bro, needs more d... Oh wait.  10dinos/10mothatruckindinos  P.S. This game needs to be renamed Halo: Dino Edition (screw the rights to the name Halo the truth must be known) 
2705	1	a	There are a lot of reasons to play this game, but none more important than being able to answer the question of why the dinosaurs went extinct with 'because of me'.
2707	1	a	Jet packs and Dinosaurs. What else do you need?
2709	1	a	This game is pretty good for the price you have to pay, it is basically COD:ZOMBIES but with dinosaurs on a huge map. You can have Lightsabers, Bow and Arrows, Hoverbikes and much more. I R8 this game 8/10  'Game of the Year'-Orion: Prelude Developer 'Why Dinosaurs'-My Mom 'I have a dream'-Martin Luther King jr 'potato'-me
2711	1	a	Dino's / Halo Like Weapons and vehicle's / LOTS OF GAMEMODES / CO-OP / hillarious  What do you want more? better graphics? go play another game~!  i say 11/10! #ToFabForYou
2713	1	a	This game has come a long way since it was initially released upon the public and made quite an impact for being a terrible game. At the time of it's release this game was clearly a half-♥♥♥♥♥ and unfinished game with uncountable amounts of bugs, only 2 or 3 maps and about 3 types of dinosaurs. This is all the past now, and though this may not be a perfect game it is a fun arcade style shooter to play with your friends.  The game now sports about a dozen different game modes and maps, a nice selection of weapons and powerups, a working progression system with 3 class types, over 200 Steam achievements and most bugs have been fixed. If you have a couple of friends with you and you just want to mess around and have a fun time on a game with a silly premise and don't mind mediocre graphics and audio then this is absolutely for you, if on the otherhand you like to play a serious survival game then this might not be for you.  This game as I mentioned is no where near perfect, the graphics are pretty mediocre as are the visual effects. The audio quality is quite good especially with the Dinosaur sound effects like the T-Rex's roar (you might want ear defenders for that), the voice acting however isn't the best but that's to be somewhat expected of this type of game. The game runs very smoothly for the most part with a couple of graphical artifacts here and there but nothing I've found gamebreaking yet, and there are lag spikes when waves end on survival. Taking a little step away from the technical problems of this game and looking into the gameplay though is where this game is great, it's perfectly fun to play for an hour or two every now and then prefferably with friends and just have a blast shooting dinosaurs with handcannons, shotguns, gatling guns, sniper rifles, lasers, flamethrowers, rocket launchers and so much more. It's great fun to try taking some risk with your friends and making bets like who can ride the T-rex without getting eaten or who can kill the spinosaurus with a knife and whatever else you can think of doing at the time. Theres plenty of objectives to keep you occupied in game and well paced time intervals between rounds and the large dinosaurs each have their own unique traits.  Overall I'd give this game a solid 7/10 for being a great improvement on it's initial release and a stupid but fun arcade style shooter. I mean it's got jetpacks, dinosaurs and tanks! What more could you possibly ask for?
2715	1	a	This is the greatest game I have ever played. I just love going around not being able to see anything except for the inside of my dinosaurs body. The graphical technology seems to have been developed in 2005 however this only makes sense as since the game is set in the prehistoric era. All in all, I can not see a reason why someone wouldn't immediately purchase this phenomenal title.
2717	1	a	i like this updated verion
2719	1	a	Many Good. Buy for monies.
2721	1	a	Decent game if you can overlook its flaws.
2723	1	a	If you want to Kill Waves of Dinos just Buy this game and you can be a dino. i give it 1/1
2725	1	a	Pretty good solid game, however having to traverse for minutes at a time from spawn point to where you're needed can be a hassle.
2727	1	a	bugs and glitches galore but it has promise. its basically what halo combat evolved was supposed to be and doesn't hide the fact it pretty much ripped it off. but in a good way, hopefully it'll get better over time
2729	1	a	This game promises shooting dinos with guns and vehicles. It delivers. It's a wonderful game for just booting up and killing some time, and it's generally pretty easy to find an open match. I'd say it's a bit like Killing floor, but with dinosaurs and the occasional jet pack. Grab it while it's on sale, or wait for it to be a free weekend, though, because I can't in good conscience say it's worth $15.
2731	1	a	this game like jurrasic park and mister chef is there and killing dinos because the covenant did some ♥♥♥♥ so he needs kill them all in all 8/10
2733	1	a	AMAZING GAME!  KILLED A T-REX BY HEADSHOT WITH A ROCKET LAUNCHER, BLEW UP 17 RAPTORS WITH A GRENADE, 360 NO SCOPE A DILOPHOSAURUS DOWN THE THROAT WITH A SNIPER RIFLE AND PUNCHED A PTERDACTYL IN THE FACE IN LESS THEN 5 SECONDS WHILE USING JETPACK WHILE IN SLOW MOTION!!!!!   420/69 IGN
2735	1	a	Great fun. I love skyping with friends and playing a few hours of this game. But, to us? It will always be Dino-Horde! 
2737	1	a	i love this game :D
2739	1	a	I loved this game even before it got good.
2741	1	a	8/10 would play again
2743	1	a	Games crashes when I connect to servers. I didn't get to play. Not buying sorry :l
2745	1	a	This is a game. You can play this game. I like playing games. Do you like playing games? I do like playing games! I wanna build a snowman now and stuff a dinosaur's kidney inside it! Yay!
2747	1	a	I would strongly recommend this game, it is a mix of Halo and Boderlands. If you like any of those I would spend the 1$ and get the game!
2749	1	a	IT GIVE'S ME SO MUCH PLEASURE! 
2751	1	a	Im really happy to see this game in its current state...It used to suck, now its a Fun game!
2753	1	a	if you bought this game before last month and thought it was ♥♥♥♥, you're right. play it again and it just gets better every match
2755	1	a	Add this to MAC!
2757	1	a	SOOOOO BAD ITS GOOD  Like super fun. for 1$ on the 4 pack you cant go wrong.
2759	1	a	Its Halo if the main objective was to survive/eliminate The Flood. More or less.  Only fun when you play multiplayer, so be sure you have friends willing to try it and get the 4-pack!  
2761	1	a	If you hate dinosaurs, then this is your golden opportunity.  Jokes aside, it's no doubt worth the money. It provides exciting and sometimes terrifying (spinosaurus, deinosuchus, t-rex) combat against various kinds of dinosaurs. You get to use many types of weapons and other tools of destruction such as VTOLs and tanks.   Pros: - Surprising amounts of depth and customization via classes, their weapons and augments that let you play the way you want - Unreal engine means it runs smoothly and provides great visuals - Voice commands and taunts to help you communicate and annoy easily - Gigantic (and smaller) dinosaurs with very impressive animations and diverse approaches to combat - A leveling system to give you a feel of progression and achievement - An open-world game mode which I've not yet tried but sounds very interesting - The developers seem committed and appear to release updates frequently - Many large and beautiful maps to fight on  Cons: - It still needs some work, certain things such as player characters (and the mech) have lackluster animations - While it doesn't really hold any merit in deciding if a game is good or not, its 'Metascore' is low (*) - I'm unsure of this, but it doesn't seem like you're able to earn any in-game cosmetics    * = It depends on the person whether or not they think Metacritic provides an accurate review of the product. Dino Beatdown (the game's former name) didn't go too well and this most likely means that certain people will be discouraged from buying ORION: Dino Horde. There are rumors swirling around Metacritic, saying that the reviewers are paid off by larger corporations to make their product seem better. Besides, reviews are essentially opinions.
2763	1	a	I played this game on a 3-day weekend in 2013, I can't tell you how much I absolutely loved the game.  Recently I've been thinking back to it and wondering 'What am I doing with my life to not have baught this yet?'  Then it hit me, I NEED to buy it, so I did and it was the best choice I ever made, the game is amazing, and insanely fun to play.  For anyone who loves epic battles and insane weapons, I reccomend you buy this game immediatly.
2765	1	a	Best game youll ever have for $0.99 Its nazi zombies+halo+dinos This game is very addicting and has the best intense co-op experience i have ever had in a long time
2767	1	a	This is Hands down the best Dino indie game out there, first of all its only 99cents, and second of all it is just a brilliant and a magnificent piece of game, The graphics are gorgeous, and the gameplay is impresseive. If you thinking of buying this game i definatley recommend it.
2769	1	a	One of the best games I've playe in a while
2771	1	a	Best game that costs 50 cents you will ever play..... its very fun... multiplayer co-op.... aaaand you get to kill waves of Dinos using all sorts of hi-tech weaponry.
2773	1	a	When I saw this game for only a dollar I thought what the hell lets try it. Shortly after that I grabbed the 4 pack and brought some friends in and have had nothing but fun and good times. The $15 price tag might be a little much for some people but I have had more fun in this game than I have had with a lot of the recent AAA games.
2775	1	a	AMAZING! I would recommend it to EVERYBODY i know, keep up the good work, there is a bit of lag with a spawning dinosaur boss however, so there are of course still a few bugs, but can't wait to get my friends together and play this for real.
2777	1	a	its an awesome game 
2779	1	a	A cooperative, wave survival, class based FPS that forgoes pomp and circumstance for a more pick-up-and-play kind of experience. Similar to games like Killing floor, but with dinos instead of zambos. You fight little dinos, get better weapons, upgrades and perks, collect xp to strengthen 1 of 3 classes, fight big dinos, get killed, rage quit, drink heavily, rinse and repeat.  The game is a little clunky at times, but it's solid fun with frands for just a buck.
2781	1	a	Like killing floor but with guns! 11/10
2783	1	a	This Is Better than Primal Carnage 100/100
2785	1	a	good side:  cheap dino killing  bad side:  lack of people
2787	1	a	WORDS CANNOT DESCRIBE THIS GAME.
2789	1	a	The Metacritic score is misleading
2791	1	a	So i got ORION: Dino Horde for 1$ when it was on sale, and im so happy i did that !! this game is a great combination of borderlands and left 4 dead, when me and my friends played it we had so much fun !! ill try get my girlfriend to play it with me.  the positives: +big open world +lots of vehicles +diffrent type of enemies +great graphics +good time with your firends  +easy controls  the negetives: -not newbie friendly -some dino's have strange attack animations -usless ironsights  my score: 9\10 sorry for bad english &lt;3
2793	1	a	Pretty fun game i really like the open world part! It is a hassle to buy a 4 pack if you own the game already or just a normal copy to gift when you are playing it on the free days.... But all in all it is fun to play with a couple friends has some good content. :)
2795	1	a	IF I COULD FIND THE WORDS TO DESCRIBE HOW ♥♥♥♥ AND HOW BUGGY THIS GAME IS, ID GLADLY DO SO... ♥♥♥ U SPIRAL U DIRTY ♥♥♥♥ FUKS. I HONESTLY HOPE A METEORITE SMASHES WHATEVER ♥♥♥♥ BOX U CREATE GAMES IN AND YOU DIE IN A ROCKY FIRE BLAZE. ♥♥♥♥
2797	1	a	Such a good game 10/10  1. Jetpack 2. Bow and arrow 3. Amazing 
2799	1	a	At first, this is a game you'll hate a lot, but as I found out, it quickly gets to be more fun as you invest time into it. Animations are, pretty sub par, and there are some questionable bugs in the game that break it, and, it's soundtrack is forgettable. But ignoring those features to the basic bits, you've got a game built around co-op that has a competitive feature. The co-op includes the 3 classes where each one contributes to the game in a major way. Recons eliminate dinos and do stealthy revives/repairs on the generator. Supports are the only class that can heal anyone on the team, as well as tanking with their beefy life. Assault, well, it's pretty basic, he goes places fast and kills things fast. Competitive allows the player to play as the dinosaurs too, which is actually kind of fun, though I must say I haven't had much experince in that department.  Overall, all I can say is, you get a pretty good laugh and great feeling after you punch a T-rex in the face and either A. Kill it, or B. It eats you and regains life.  7.5-8/10 It does need work, but hell, it makes you laugh and it has a good core.
2801	1	a	Fun game! Found it way easier to go stealth as the recon class with a knife and melee ^-^'   Haven't experienced any problems with the game.
2803	1	a	Review of Orion : Prelude! This game may seem dull at the first hour, but when you play enough of it, you can't stop. The graphics might not be very good, but it makes up for its gameplay, it has several vehicules, giant maps, Adjustable NPC difficulty, 10+ game modes ( only 2 are Singleplayer sadly ). Orion is basically Humans V.S Dinos, Don't see that much often eh? Anyways, Humans have 3 Classes, Each class with it's upgrades and special Skills! 7 or 8 Vehicules! 12+ Guns and taunts!  = Fair Graphics  + Good singleplayer - Microtransactions ( i really hate that! where's the time where skins would be unlocked by a special challenge/ mission?) + Different gameplays + Several modes + Workshop + Several maps  = Taunts ( depends on your view of Taunts i personally hate them ) + Good XP system + Cheap price ( well in my time at least! I heard it's going to be $20 in the next few months ) So get it on sale or not, it is worth the money!
2805	1	a	you can kill dino with an egg 1000/10
2807	1	a	Its like halo but with dinosaurs - IGN
2809	1	a	Would have spent $40 To get this game.  Legit. Amazing multiplayer game.  11/10
2811	1	a	37/100
2813	1	a	Groovy, hip and radical.
2815	1	a	I don't know what's so satisfying about an FPS with temporary and permanent upgrades that's all about killing dinosaurs but I love it. The music is repetative as hell but catchy, it'll be the only thing you might not like and will probably turn off or at least lower it, it's pretty much most the sound. If you haven't seen this game, it has a Kickstater called the Orion project and they plan on making this game an entire precedural universe with story and such. I can't wait for that, I bought this on a Steam sale way before I heard about that and I'm glad I did. I can only run this beasty in 720p or my 440GT takes a duece but that just shows that it wants to have more graphical power. The game runs gorgeously with dynamic lighting and has amazing textures. I wish I had a better videocard.
2817	1	a	This game is fantastic for people who...  1. Play Killing floor and enjoy it.   2. Are looking for a realistic dinosaur roadkill simulator.   10/10 in the name of ragdoll physics
2819	1	a	SO I WAS RUNNIN ROUND WITH A 3 ROUND BURST LMG...WTF RIGHT....ANYWAY IM SHOOTING A TRICERETOPS IN THE FACE WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN IM FLYING HIGH IN THE SKY WITH A BIRD. DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON. THEN I FALL DOWN TO THE GROUND AND A COMPY KILLS ME. SO I UNINSTALLED. WOULD RECOMMEND THOUGH.
2821	1	a	The only way to interact with dinosaurs, is to shoot them in the head, while smaller dinosaurs gnaw on your BALLS. 10/10
2823	1	a	You may expect a cheap ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game (as I did), but you are wrong - this is one of the best co-op shooters for a unreasonably low price.   Futuristic soilders fighting dinosaurs is a weird combo, but it turns out great. Well-balanced classes, weapons and enemies is the most important part of a shooter, and this game has it. It's a little bit confusing at the beggining, but when you get used to it it's a easy to play.  The only thing I dislike is the heavy GPU usage. It maxes out my 760 and only gives about 70fps, which is about the same as I get in BF4. The graphics are not something amazing, but good enough to not ruin the experience.  Overall, this is an amazing game, well worth the 80 cents it costs. The developers are great people, pricing this game at such a low price, while it is surely worth at least 5x more and I respect that very much. Will be buying more copies for friends!
2825	1	a	  Orion....
2827	1	a	Really fun to play with friends, funny as and atually more fun than you probably think it would be. :) I recommend buying it and play with friends.
2829	1	a	This is an amazing game, no doubt about it. I don't know what has happened with the metacritic score, but this game has been judged misleadingly, and unfairly.
2831	1	a	since its under a dollar i think its fun as hell.
2833	1	a	10/10! Have played with my mates (bought the 4 pack)! Super fun MetaCritic deff. goofed up? I wonder how much the big companies have to pay to get 97's (looking at you Valve). -Note I did not help develope the game!
2835	1	a	Definitely the most fun I have had in ages. Sure, it's buggy, but the gameplay is solid and there's shenanigans aplenty to be had. Not to mention that playing as a dinosaur is a rolicking good time. That feeling when I let loose a spine-chilling roar that sends people scampering in the opposite direction never gets old for me. If you like to be huge and stompy, I higly recommend giving Rampage mode a try.  All in all, I think that anybody who is a dinosaur fan should play this game. And really, who isn't a dinosaur fan at heart?
2837	1	a	was worth $0.99
2839	1	a	I LOVE THIS GAME SHOOOOOOOOO MUCH. I AM NOT BUY BUT THE PICTURES ARE LOOK MANY GOODS
2841	1	a	I had this game in my library for a while. I recently picked up Trek Industries newest game, which is in early access and I was impressed by what I saw so I thought I'd delve into ORION: Prelude to see what I could expect from them in the development of that game.  When you know about the history of ORION: Prelude the state it's in now is pretty impressive. The developer clearly worked hard to turn something that was unplayable into a game that is actually really fun. There's no real depth to it but it's a slightly different take on your average horde mode game, the mechanics are solid and there's a nice variety of maps.   It is only 79p so you can't really go wrong if you want to sink a few hours into a decent game that has a small but fairly active multiplayer community. It's definitely worth more than it's asking price.
2843	1	a	Only paying a $1.49 it was money well spent. I have never had so much fun shooting dinos and playing as dinos. I would get this game if you dont have it already.
2845	1	a	Well, i really didn't have high expectations when i first bought this game for 0,99€, which i consider pretty much 'free'. But this game turned out to be great, and not just great - I prefer it over 60€ games such as GTA V, which means something. This game is NO.1 on the 'Fun for the money' List in my opinion. I don't know any other game where you can use your jetpack to power-punch a flying dinosaur, or blow up floating heads with a grenade launcher (Gamemode called 'Silly mode'. Well the graphics are... are... Well, not so good, but that makes the game easier to run on low-end systems. For anyone out there with a low-end pc (laptop?) who does not want to spend much money on expensive 60€ games they cant run, this is the perfect game for you to buy. Its extra fun when playing co-op with your friends, even tho the game maybe doesn't feel 'complete'.  So, fun for the money rating:  7/10 -IGN  KILL DEM DINOS!
2847	1	a	I shot a guy in the ♥♥♥♥ with a bolt action in rust to get this game.......so i guess its good............
2849	1	a	I had the raptor in my sights, but before I could press the trigger I was suddenly picked up by some dino bird and lifted very high. I punched it! I then began to fall to my death, but my trusty jet pack saved me from a nasty fall. I landed safely, reloaded, turned around, and saw the T-rex jaws coming down, and then I think I was in its belly dying. Punching didn't help, and neither did the jet pack. I am now poo.  Game play is tight, not a single crash. Me and the bros were playing survival for 10 hours, then we realized there was even more game play type! We were having so much fun we didn't even check if there was a way to change or alter the game!  No real story that I can see, but if killing hordes of dinos with halo-type weapons appeals to you, who needs it? I grabbed it on a steam sale and it is unbelievable value for my money.
2851	1	a	Actually really fun, get a few mates and it's brilliant, I'd get it in the sale mind!
2853	1	a	Pretty cool game. My friend bought the 4-pack when it was on sale for super cheap and gifted me a copy.  It's a fun FPS game and it was definitely worth the 75 cents. I'm not 100% sure it would be worth 15 dollars though. If this game goes on sale for like 8 dollars, go ahead and snag it. I don't think it's great enough that you would want to buy it at the normal 15 dollar price.  It's still a really cool game, especially with friends.  Edit: Now that it's 99 cents, you really can't go wrong with this especially if you're new to steam and don't have many games.
2855	1	a	Tremendously spartan shooter arcade game. Easy to get into, games can last for as short or as long as you desire. Plenty of weapons, vehicles and user custimisations. Several game modes, from TDM, FFA, 1v1, Survival and Conquest. Survival are matches consisting of several waves of dinosaurs attacking you and your base for you to fend off with you and your mates. Inexpensive, fun and easy to get into for video game novices and experts alike.
2857	1	a	The Metacritic score of 36 / 100 is way off base...I'm thinking that the game was released a little early with too many bugs, but the Developers have fixed that and added a ton of content. This game is a lot of fun. There are many different weapons, dinos, vehicles to drive, game modes, upgrades, etc.
2859	1	a	Great game with great graphics, especially for its price :)
2861	1	a	This game, oh my my...   Beyond the initial metacritic score for the earlier version of this game; it is worth giving a chance. I picked it up on sale; after seeing the game on sale for 99 cents; I was like: The hell with it, I am buying this. No I am not rich and no it is not disposable income; you can be unemployed and living on welfare checks and still understand the whole idea of impulse buying a 99 cent game.. It's like going to a restaurant and ordering a cup of soda, which adds 1 extra dollar to your bill..   So the game itself is actually pretty fun. Don't play this game for 'intense lore'. it is simply such a derp game in terms of atmosphere (storyline and background); simply because it is minimalistic.   How about instead of writing a 7 paragraph review like I always do, I will give you this:  Imagine being in the US Marine Corps, and you are in a Supercobra attack slick; and you are swooping over the marshlands in georgia bored to ♥♥♥♥ because you are bringing the chopper to a new base. Lets say you spot several crocodiles in the marshes; and you decide 'F**K it', and start shooting them to millions of pieces.  Now take this image and turn it into sci-fi, where space-dinosaurs are on some random planet; and you bloodthristy bored-as hell soldiers stationed on some remote planet want to have some action.. Well pick up em guns boys! We have freaking space raptors to murder!  In a nutshell, the game is simply amusing. It is funny, and I think the developers have strong wit they intentionally put into this game. It is fun, jetpacking around the maps with guns and slaughtering dinosaurs with friends has never been so fun of a pastime before!  Now.. Someone bring me a pizza!
2863	1	a	Great game with great graphics, especially for its price :)
2865	1	a	Tremendously spartan shooter arcade game. Easy to get into, games can last for as short or as long as you desire. Plenty of weapons, vehicles and user custimisations. Several game modes, from TDM, FFA, 1v1, Survival and Conquest. Survival are matches consisting of several waves of dinosaurs attacking you and your base for you to fend off with you and your mates. Inexpensive, fun and easy to get into for video game novices and experts alike.
2867	1	a	Despite the multiple unpolished aspects of the game, for some reason it is addictively fun. Dunno what to say... something about shooting endless waves of dinos in the face that is theraputic... and FUN! I think this game is definitely underrated. I wish there were more flying options. The one 'plane' thing is a bit cumbersome.
2869	1	a	this is a great game a mashup of halo jpark a little bit of ctf &amp; survivle
2871	1	a	Pretty much freaked! This game was so Awesome! SO FREAKIN' AWESOME! I love it, but you should make it faster (mean that this game would work on an i3 laptop like mine :) actually it is working but not in a high res) So hope you fixed this!  Anyway, still, you guys are a good developer! I liked the way you survived through bad comments! I always support y'all!
2873	1	a	Just like the trailer says, the game went from zero to hero :D
2875	1	a	I was on the final wave and a T-Rex ate me whole. 10/10
2877	1	a	It was $0.50 on sale for the best 2 hours of my life
2879	1	a	Pretty much the greatest thing I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing.
2881	1	a	Just keeps getting better with all these updates i love it :)! And for $.99 permanately thats just a bonus :)!
819	0	a	Nope
2883	1	a	I don't see any reason to not buy this for under a dollar. It's fun.
2885	1	a	Best dollar I spent in my life!
2887	1	a	Good, Dinosaurs are in it.
2889	1	a	So i bought this game when it was 1 dollar,so you may be thinking,everone who actually BOUGHT the game is mad that it just went F2P,well when there over game, The Orion Project,goes F2P,everone who bought the game at a premiuem cost gets 6 diffrent helmets FOR Orion. Which is pretty cool and this isnt P2W,as most stuff in the store is just cosmetic. So i would recommend you try this game out,as its a pretty good game to play on.
2891	1	a	What a nice game! -Good points: -Nice graphics; -Good gameplay; -3 different classes, each one with it's gameplay and different; -Lots of vehicles; -Lots of weapons; Bad points: -My pc is a potato, so i cannot play this game over 40 fps; -When a T-rex appears, he throws a rock down into your face; ;-;  I reccomend everyone to play, cheap and always welcome to a shopper account!
2893	1	a	10/10 The most graceful thing I have ever experienced.
2895	1	a	Take Vehicles from Halo, And weapons from every fps in the world and add Dinosaurs.  What do you get?  A Metascore of 36   ORION: Dino Horde.  But seriously.. I shot down a stegosaurus in a tank and everything went slow motion and a voice said Dino Down 36/10 best game ever.
2897	1	a	I can't stop playing it.
822	0	a	I found out the hard way that I really don't like being savaged by raptors that have 3 frames of animation to their name while my buddy kills a T-Rex who got stuck in a rock in the background and a very enthusiastic announcer yells 'Bring me some pizza!' at the top of his lungs. No sir, I don't like it.
2899	1	a	Game's nice, but not worth the regular $15 price. It has gameplay affecting bugs up the wazoo, and devs who seem to care more about sales than informing their playerbase (unless I can find more up-to-date info.) The levelling system is nice, if a bit tedious due to how fast the exp requirements go, and the specific upgrades are off a level every once in a while. But despite the game's professional appearance, on the inside, it's a far more amateurish game than it looks, which may or may not actually be a bad thing, depending on what you like. However, if it's on sale for $1 (which is more often than it should be) just buy the damn game and enjoy the time you can spend with it for only a dollar.
823	0	a	I think the metacriti score of 36/100 is correct kinda lifeless and dumb to be honest. i had 0 health but lived ?!?!?!?!?
824	0	a	I ventured into this game excited by the void in my heart which could be filled with dinosaurs. However I came out of this game with half my brain missing. It is very poor. Furthermore this game along with Chivalry Medieval Warfare have been getting rather jealous recently as I havn't played them for a while. They have started to attack and pillage my internet connection. As a result i have rung up BT and they are sending me a new home hub. All because this game is garbage and gets jealous of other, better games on the market. Avoid if you enjoy your sanity/internet connection.
825	0	a	So. The Dino bit is...ok. Not that good overall. Then you open up a new ugly can of worms with actual PVP. Oh, good god is that horrible. The guns all feel the same. Bad. It's clunky and rough. accidenally alt-tabbed out and everything froze. I mean my computer on a whole. It was weird and easily fixed but still didn't bode well when the Voice button is ALT. yeah. No thanks. I'm done and good. I'll stick to my other mindless FPS games.
826	0	a	This is such a bad game I cannot put it down. It has the crappiest programming, the weirdest glitches, the ♥♥♥♥♥iest bugs, and the worst possible sound. With that said, it is addicting to watch giant alligaitors with painted on eyes crawl around you in circles.
827	0	a	This game is horrendous. It's built like a free-to-play game with microtransactions, but this game has the audacity to ask for $15, but the only reason why I purchased this game is because it was 99 cents. I want my 99 cents back. This game is terrible and deserves to be taken off of Steam.
828	0	a	So bad, that is fun....but is a very bad game XD
2901	1	a	Fricking Awesome!SO MUCH FUN!I THINK I'M HAVING AN ♥♥♥♥♥♥!This game has good graphics,A variety of Dinosaurs,Lots of guns and weapons,different and fun gamemodes,Cool Maps,enough server slots and just DAMN FUN! It's worth the $14.00 and on sale it goes for only $1.00!Honestly,if you bought it and didn't like it comment down below(Be truthfull please).WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? GO BUY IT AND GET IN ON THE FUN! My Rating For ORION:Dino Horde: 10/10 (THE METASCORE IS SO DAMN MISLEADING!!!!)
2903	1	a	Great Game!... for a dollar. I got it during a sale for only 99 cents so it was definitly worth buying it then! 15 bucks is a little iffy
830	0	a	Graphics are great, but the gameplay is just tedious and boring. It is like Gears of War Horde mode but more crap thrown in. Weapon cost is extremely high, and the 'defend points' are never near any actual defensible position. If you have 4 or more people playing it can be good, but it still seems very lackluster. In my opinion not worth $1.
831	0	a	this game is awfull at the end of every round you fix your generator and buy new guns you cant get new guns unless you fix the generator up abd you end up fight hordes of dinos with a teir 1 pistol! its garbage dont install or buy
832	0	a	game is very laggy and graffics are bad, if you are looking for an fps that will make you poop your pants this is it though. the game has such lag that the dinos come out of no where and kill you.
833	0	a	Don't buy this blanatant rip-off of halo 1 with dinosaurs. On top of the horrible framerate, graphics, and gamplay you are given very little direction once you start so IF you decide to buy this be sure a friend is able to hold your hand for the first few minutes.
834	0	a	its a really bad game dont even think about buying it even if it is on sale
2905	1	a	Got rammed by a Triceratops while I was in a tank and shot halfway across the map.  10/10 Would fly again
2907	1	a	M8, DINOSAURS! DINOSAURS ARE UP IN YOUR GRILL AND YOU NEED TO SORT THEM OUT! 10/10
2909	1	a	Awesome as hell.But very laggy ;c
2911	1	a	I believe this game has been unfairly critisized. I can't believe the bargin I purchased it for. This is like Halo only a hell of a lot better, though the controls do take some getting used to and not everything is intuitive, but once you got all that down and play with some friends or strangers it'll be a blast!
2913	1	a	Played a bit. Great game (Y)
2915	1	a	cool game 
2917	1	a	Great if you like your dinosaurs to be able to phase through walls. 11/10
2919	1	a	Best 99 cents I've ever spent. End of story.
2921	1	a	I bought it at $0.62. Why haven't you?  Didn't expect much from a $0.62 game initially but after playing i loved the horde based gameplay.Wave after wave will try to attack your generator which you have to defend or repair with occasional objectives you have to accomplish. The map has vehicles scattered all around and each map is different and the effect that comes with it makes it more appealing.   'Peak' is a winter map and your visor can get frozen while playing and this forces you to search for a warm place to melt the ice off. The light reflecting off the snow also makes it harder to spot smaller dinos. 'Raupi' is a tropical map where rain starts to pour in mid game. Really gotta love the rain droplet effect on your visor and the weather makes it hard to spot the pterodactyls flying overhead. During each round you'll get to access upgrades and different weapons while they throw at you different types of dinos that range from velociraptors to T-Rexs.  However, if you're playing in Asia, you might find the servers lacking in number. You can still host listen servers or play singleplayer with bots.   I'd say i got my money's worth from this game at that flash sale price ^_^
2923	1	a	Hey it’s pretty fun!  The game is actually pretty fun. By now it’s really damn straight worth one dollar. I like the sun lighting in the game as well as the ability to upgrade your character and use weapons like sentry guns and rocket launchers to mow down waves of enemies. The game does have some downsides as it's still kinda buggy.  Now the “conquest game mode is something to have a lot of fun about. Try beating that before you leave the game. The game gets even more fun when you level up your character and start spawning with weapons that you would normally have to buy. I also like the fact that you can customize your armor style and give yourself a hat and a cape so that you can look like a badass when fighting dinos. It gets pretty fun in high level games.  The only downside to this game is that it's still kinda buggy. They aren't too much of a bother to me.
2925	1	a	- Killed a T-Rex - Got a free ride on a Petarodactil - Got gangbanged with Velociraptors   Best Jurrasic Park Simulator 2013
839	0	a	This game can be fun at times. Playing survival whilst flying in helicopters and blowing the ♥♥♥♥ out of dinosaurs is pretty fun, but this doesn't make up for the downsides.  The graphics in this game is meh, just meh. The lens flares can literally be blinding on some maps and the textures for the dinosaurs make them look like Jurassic Park CGI (the first one). For some reason, this game is EXTREMELY laggy. Even with my GTX 650 and 8 GB of ram, this game can only run around 30 frames per second. Not only this, but it looks made for the Wii.   The gameplay mechanics are much like Left for Dead 2, except worse. You survive wave after wave of dinosaurs trying to destroy your generator (sidebar, why the heck do they go for the generator?). Then you need to go 'hold points,' after which you are awarded with different vehicles (ranged from jeeps with miniguns, jeeps with no point, a tank, a mech, and yes, helicopters). These vehicles have the absolute WORST driving mechanics...you control your vehicles...with your mouse. It's SOO HARD! You're constantly crashing into things which damges your vehicles quite a lot. You also are able to purchase weapons, upgrades for your weapons, and upgrade your character, which overall is not that bad of a system. Other than lacking a good variety of weapons.   So there is one last problem with this game...the dinosaur AI. Literally the flying dinosaurs (my friends and I call them poops) are the most irritating mob in this game. They randomly divebomb you and have a possiblity of picking you up and dropping you from great hights. They for some reason put dinosaurs that we all reconize (ect triceratops) as bosses that try to kill you. But wait, aren't triceratops herbivores? APPARENTLY NOT!  Overall this is a good game if you get it on sale. It's hilarous to play with your friends and get a good laugh at for it's attempt at being good. DO NOT BUY IT FOR FULL PRICE, NOT WORTH IT.  If you want to watch gameplay to look for yourself, watch here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tVdb28jmDk&amp;feature=gp-n-y&amp;google_comment_id=z12yyjnhior4zplag04cihobbxe2zzaygqo0k 
840	0	a	ONION: Dino Horde is da most thugged-out ♥♥♥♥♥♥ vizzle game I've eva played. Y'all KNOW dat ♥♥♥♥, mutha♥♥♥♥a! I KNOW dat it is unfinished n' buggy yo, but still, why release a game when up in fact it is literally, metaphorically, geographically, ironically, n' biologically da most thugged-out ♥♥♥♥♥♥ thang eva n' ♥♥♥♥. Right back up in yo mutha♥♥♥♥in ♥♥♥. Seriously, why even release it, dawg?
2927	1	a	Apparently the meta critic score is for the original of this game entitled Orion: Dino Beatdown. I'm going to presume that's true because there is no way this game is only a 36 out of 100! It's fun as hell, nice graphics, loads of weapons, different classes and perks, cool vehicles, AND FREAKING DINOSAURS  WHO DOESN'T LOVE KILLING DINOSAURS WITH LASER RIFLES WHILST FLYING IN A JETPACK?! 
2929	1	a	this is a fun game especially if your a person that enjoyed something like killing floor.
841	0	a	Glitchy online play, if you can even get into a matchmaking game. You're forced to start out with a crappy pistol and the dinosaurs aren't as exciting as the trailer made them seem. Don't waste your money.
842	0	a	Even though this review says its not recommended its really not all that bad if you are wanting to play a game about dinosaurs, if you can get past the flaws. Said flaws include average gameplay, bad dinosaur AI, terrible animations, poor sounding, poorly excecuted ingame features and the list goes on. Its like primal carnage or Dino D-day just more terrible and with crack down skin over it just with all the good elements ripped out. Overall its a bad game, but it isn't terrible as its fun at some points as its a basic shooter and can be thrilling when you are taking on the big dinosaurs like Spinosaurus, Tyrannosaurus, Triceratops, Stegosaurus and Deinosuchus to name all the boss dinosaurs. For the causal gamer this is an ok pick up. For £1 its a steal so I would suggest picking it up when its on discount. Overall its a bad game but its not terrible.
2931	1	a	Actually wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.
843	0	a	On modern standards the game feels and looks like a work in progress. It does provide for some fun with friends, and there seem to be larger updates down the line. I don't particularly regret my purchase, but this is not something I would suggest buying.
2933	1	a	I love to play this game with friends, got it for all my mods on twitch so we can play with the whole mod team on stream!
845	0	a	 Onion Prelube
2935	1	a	a bit hard to get in the swing of thing but when you do it is very fun game. lots of achivments and ZI like to try and get them all I like Conquest the best then the slopes I dont care for the free fo all or one v one better to kill if you get the right team on conquest it will keep you going for an hour or so .try and stay alive is the point of the game .MOOSE
2937	1	a	If you want to shoot the dinosaur, this is the gaem 2 play to shoo tthe dinsaaur
2939	1	a	I love this game
2941	1	a	I love this game
2943	1	a	Really fun dinosaur shooting fps, the characters say funny **** when they shoot dinos XD, definitely worth buying and playing with friends.
2945	1	a	this game is the worst game you can have fun playing
2947	1	a	Holy cow. This game is awesome! And for 0.99c it doesn't get any better! I love this game. The graphics is.. Im speechless.. THEY ARE AMAZING. Even on lowest !! Really liked the first couple of rounds I played and will be playing more.
847	0	a	they have made a lot of changes and whatnot over the years but i still think it was much better back when it was Dino Beatdown with just three giant conquest maps. i wish it was still like that.
2949	1	a	Pushed a T-Rex off a cliff 10/10
2951	1	a	While this might not be a title for everyone, it is hard to go wrong for a dollar.
2953	1	a	0.99$ um who wouldnt wanna have the thrill of a fps and kill dinos and dont have to worry bout lil kids saying you hack.
2955	1	a	you can taunt on people that you lick ♥♥♥♥♥ !
848	0	a	Terrible buggy mess of a game, and even worse developer (a whole lot worse than EA or Activision), there's not much else to say about it...
2957	1	a	Lol. Orion is a hilarious game. Worth the 99c. Get the 4-pack, and play with your buddies. You will not regret it. Graphics: 5/10 Combat: 7/10 Running around killing T-Rex and laughing your ♥♥♥ off when your buddy gets wrecked by a baby compy: 12/10.
2959	1	a	I love this game for what it is meant to be. Gotta get that out there first.   If you are looking for a mature, story driven game with deep tactical combat, intelligent AI, and characters of any sort, you will be sorely dissapointed.   This game is stupid fun, comically bad AI, silly unrealistic physics, oversimplified PVP, and less in depth than several of the games you might be used to. It tries to do many things at once (it has PVP, PVE, open world, not open world, leveling systems, vehicle combat, augments like jetpacks and invisibility), and only does them all about half as well as it could.   That said... The game is fully aware of what kind of game it is, and the developers know exactly what you wanted out of this kind of game, and boy do they deliver. The pvp is mostly laughable, but when you have been playing co-op with a group of friends it is perfect to switch to and just start murdering each other for a change. The game will make you laugh as you discover its secrets (you can surf dinosaurs and helicopters, and there are achievements for that too).   The game is best when played with friends, but you do not have to bring any. I got the game alone and played random games without friends, but easily found a regular group of people to play with. People are helpful if you ask for help, and people WANT to be your friend. Be a little social in games and you will be rewarded. There are plenty of people that play this game, it has only gotten more popular with time, so you will never be in a situation where you cannot find an open game (or at least I have yet to ever be in that situation).   Finally, the developers are active. They introduce new things all the time (like the open world Conquest mode) and apparently are going to upgrade everyone's game for free very soon (just like they did with their previous game). This game is easily worth the $15 price tag in my opinion, but goes on sale for less than a dollar all the time so you can just wait for when that happens.   So all in all, 9/10 for the kind of game that it is and tries to be. Buy this game if you ever enjoy playing games for fun. You are sure to find many new friends in the game as you madly laugh like a wildman when you create a firey tornado of death with your flamethrower as you ride the back of a T-rex and hundreds of raptors flee before you in sheer terror.
2961	1	a	This game is good. It's not like Primal Carnage, or Primal Carnage: Extinction but still it's a nice game. If you can't buy these two, get this game. It's really cool if you like dinosaurs or shooters. There are many gamemodes, much classes with their unique abilities and you can customize your character.
2963	1	a	Game of the year.
2965	1	a	This is one of the best games i played
2967	1	a	I've wanted to fly around in a jetpack and shoot a tyrannosaurus in the face since I was five years old.
858	0	a	Very good game for $1 it needs more hats and less dinos
859	0	a	This is a very misleading game its makes you think these Awesome epic encounters and Amazing Gameplay in the trailer it says things like 'Paid $3.99 for this game and is better than some of $60 games' and things like that so then I try the 5 day Trial and what do I get A game that crashes contsantly and has tons of bugs and glitches and SO MUCH LAG and you may be saying you may just need a better computer and no I payed $800+ dollars for this computer and it is one of the fastes computers out there so no i had to lower my resolution disable most everything that i could and still tons of lag and its the same raptor over and over and when you try to actually play the game its way to hard even on the lowest difficulty and no I dont suck at the fps genre its the game the Allasaurus that spits acid its way to hard to kill so the only possitive think i can say about this game is that it has a massive potential and can be very very addictive with the proper updates and fixes to the bugs than I would highly recommend this but sadly no I have to hate this game and i try to not hate games heck I actually Enjoy the game Sonic the Hedgehog 2006 so I am an open Minded person. Please feel free to leave a comment and like this review
2969	1	a	10/10 the game was a dollar Not just once. BUT TWO TIMES. 93% OFF. AND ITS ONLY A DOLLAR NOW
2971	1	a	ORION: Dino Horde had started off on the wrong foot. It was like dino beatdown, and nothing else. Dino Horde, after lots of updates, is now one hell of a game! The game is truly amazing and is fun with friends too. If anything I would defintely recommend buying it now on the sale. Its a bargain for a game with this much potential (y).
2973	1	a	I know this has a horrible Metacritic score and lots of bad reviews here on Steam. But for the price (which is currently $0.99), it is worth it. At a dollar BUY THIS GAME. It's sort of like Killing Floor with better graphics but not as good of a trader system. The maps are large and vast. The dinosuars, especially the freaking flying ones do give a challenge.   If you like Co-op games and can get the 4-pack for $3 and have friends who will play with you, it's fun. You'll enjoy it when you kill that large croc with a barrage of missles and gunfire from the flying croc killer (sorry don't know what that flying thing is called but it's fun).   There is a community of players and that should tell you that the game is at least worth $1 or checking out.
2975	1	a	I shot a dinosaur or something it was pretty cool I guess
2977	1	a	Absolutely worth the money while its on offer 99p or 75p is such a bargain for this game, and has a fantastic multiplayer element to it, and its easy to set up your own servers and start playing right away! Definately buy if you want a fun multiplayer game to play with your friends :)
2979	1	a	As a kid, I've always loved dinosaurs. I've wanted to live with them and love them. Thanks to this game, I now know that dinosaurs are a big ♥♥♥♥ing pain in the ♥♥♥. And ♥♥♥♥ having them as a pet, imagine the ♥♥♥♥♥ they take. Reuplsive, huh?  Well anyways, I love this game. It's very fun to kill dinos with random strangers and friends. No complaints really, just a fun survival dino thing :I
2981	1	a	I'm calling my lawyer because i spent 59 cents... now is free to play. I could buy 3 slices of watermelon :(
861	0	a	Do not buy this game. I installed it since it's free for a limited time. The only remotely unique thing about this game is that it has dinosaurs so I was like heck yeah I can play as my favorite dinosaurs. But they're slow and clunky and if a human player jumps up on a rock, or even stands next to a rock, there's no way to reach them. The attacks have absolutely no range and seem to do nothing even if the human player should be within range. The only good thing about this game is that you can see some dinosaur models that have animations. Beyond that, it's not even worth a dollar.
2983	1	a	Like Halo But with Dinosuars,  I like it. :D Nuff Said~
862	0	a	Let me start by saying this is by FAR the most poorly optimized game I've ever played. For the first hour or so of playing, the game would tab out every 5-10 minutes for windows to tell me that the game was a memory leak (though this did eventually stop for god knows what reason). Upon closing the game, the windows UI was glitched beyond recognition (probably due to all the window switching while in game) and I had to restart my computer to fix it.  Regarding the gameplay, Original it is not. The art assets are ripped from Halo (except for the dinosaur models/skins, which are just plain hilariously bad), the sound clips are ripped from Left 4 Dead and the gameplay is a simplified Killing Floor. There are 3 classes to choose from, but it becomes immediately apparent that Assault is the only viable one because without a jetpack you WILL die. The enemy AI is godawful, so the game compensates by throwing EVERY DINOSAUR IN EXISTENCE at you. Orion: Dino Horde is just a mess of things thrown together. To its credit though, it does have its moments of enjoyability, and I'm sure this game would be EXTREMELY fun to play while under the influence. Though I'm not sure what I was expecting when even the trailer for the game is trying to tell me 'please don't listen to the metacritic reviews'.
2985	1	a	All you need to know is its a ♥♥♥♥ing amazing concept with an alright execution. Imagine Halo, mixed with killing floor plus DINOS!! The game does get a bit buggy and really it still seems like its in beta version but overall the dinosaur-reking adventure is tops. Theres no campaign but its best feature is survival which is a classic earn credits, buy better ♥♥♥♥, kill more dinos; repeat- although its not like L4D infinite wave survivals so its fun cause it can be completed.  Perfect game to pleh with m8s in 6 difficulties (but just as good by yourself- no AI standing around touching themselves) and the some 278 acheivements make it really competitive and keeps you interested. If you get a chance to pick this up discounted, its well worth its 99c.   10/10 would bang
2987	1	a	graphics arent the best but its fun so thats all that counts better then duty of call  ITS .99 CENTS WHAT ELSE ARE YOU ASKING FOR
2989	1	a	This is quite possibly the best cheap thrill you can pick up on Steam.  It's everything and more than I could have ever wanted in a game this inexpensive: dinosaurs, guns, more dinosaurs, flying around shooting dinosaurs, destroying Robot Santa with a rocket launcher, music that you could swear carries a bit of the Mr. Clean jingle in it, and much, much more.   The best things in life are apparently just about nearly free; snag this if you're looking to blow things up with friends and marvel at the masterpiece that is ORION: Prelude.
2991	1	a	I love it the game never gets old always finding fun ways to play this :P i love da game
2993	1	a	I would recommend this game, for sure. But it has it's up and downs, and I'll go through both.  Positives:    -There's nothing that compares to battling a T-Rex one-on-one with only a pistol and a medigun that can recharge yourself.  -Team-play is quite fun, too. The gameplay is simple enough that you can slaughter dinos without doing much thinking, which is exactly what it says on the tin.  -It is pretty stable, I didn't see any gamebreaking bugs and it works just as it's supposed to.  -The Killing Floor styled gameplay works really well with dinosaurs.  -The vehicles are varied and quite fun.   -The Adrenaline weapons are a nice touch.  -Do I really have to explain how fun it is to fight hordes of raptors while using a Jetpack? Steam, you should know this.  -None of the weapons felt 'Useless' in the sense that I could do decent damage with almost anything.   Negatives:  -The Support Class has VERY racist dialogue, I don't appreciate the fact that he calls his teammates 'Homies' and 'Dawg' just because he's of African decent. It's not even well-done voice acting so the point of including it at all is mediocre at best and it kind of detracts from the experience. Why couldn't they have race-neutral dialogue? I am kind of disappointed as it lessens the experience of an otherwise solid game.  -The price is way too high, however I bought it while it was on sale for only one dollar so I can't complain of this personally. If whoever is reading this doesn't own the game already, pick it up while it's on sale.  -There aren't many maps to choose from. It's not that big of an issue, but I could do with a change of scenery. To address this issue, allowing custom maps would be preferable.  -The game is very unbalanced, Supports are almost invincible if they have the Iron Pecs perk and the upgrades that make it so you can't die from heights or chomping. On the other hand Recon is nearly useless in all situations. However, this doesn't bug me very much considering I bought this game to casually slaughter lizards, not to engage the finer philosophical and strategic aspects of warfare in a futuristic society. The unbalance is entirely made up for by the fact there's a minigun.  Overview:  For a Unreal Mod, it has a high production quality, and it definitely deserves a higher metascore than it has in my honest opinion. It deserves at least a 65. If you wish to buy this game, do so while it's on sale, and have fun with it. It's not meant to be a realistic fighting simulator like Counter-Strike, so I don't see why people would complain of the unrealistic setting of a game where you're a space marine fighting dinosaurs on some alien planet. It lost it's realness at 'Dino Horde', and that's okay.   Games are just meant to be played, and I enjoyed every minute of playing this one.
2995	1	a	It's now a dollar, or 79p. Permanently. Definately worth a flutter. And it's come a long way since it's much maligned launch. Whilst not as polished as say, Killing Floor you can tell that the devs have been trying hard to be. And the game improved a lot thanks to their efforts. Hit detection occasionally has a silly moment but for the most part its fine and the game runs pretty smooth. I can even host games with everyong pinging under 100. And its fun. Good assortment of vehicles and weapons, power ups, plenty of maps. So if you like co-op shooters and have had your fill of zombies give it a spin!
2997	1	a	Still a better love story than twillight ^^
2999	1	a	its a fun game. Just get it and you wont regret it ^.^
867	0	a	The company responsible for this game stole many asset from Activision for their new game called ORION, more precisely Black Ops 3 and Advanced warfare.   At first you might think that this is just some Big Guy is bullying a little company, but even if ACTIVISION is not a respectable company, theft is theft. Also, David Prassel of Trek Industries threatened many people on reddit to sue them if they didn't delete their thread calling out their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ behavior.  For more information on their dirty deeds.   https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4q6xo5/activisions_dmca_claim_on_orion_is_legit_orions/   Anyway, this game sucked harder than my vacuum cleaner (Repetetive, filled with microtransaction, physic was ridiculous, etc etc). This game didn't need this obvious theft to get a negative review.  ♥♥♥♥ you anyway David, sue me all you want, I don't own ♥♥♥♥.
868	0	a	ORION: Dino Horde is a painfully average game and still feels like a Unreal Tournament 2004 mod, even with all the updates it received so far. There's nothing that makes it stand out from similar games and it has a long way to Killing Floor levels of greatness. However, if you think that aforementioned KF really need vehicles, dinosaurs and jetpacks, or you're really tired of zombies – wait for ORION to go on a sale and grab it. Everyone else, save yourselves some time. I've made a longer version of the review, available here -  http://www.coffeebreakgaming.co.uk/pc-game-reviews/review-orion-dino-horde/ 
3001	1	a	Futuristic weapons killing dinosaurs? This game is the most fun that YOU'RE not having! Many different game types to suit varied tastes; Hilarious achievements to unlock -including 'Dude on the Toilet,' which Jurassic Park fans will instantly recognize; I'm telling you... I haven't had this much fun since I was blowing up stuff on the demo range. -kniF taR
872	0	a	This game does more than charge you 1 buck, it sucks the life out of you, if forces you to play this buggy ♥♥♥♥ and charge you for it, and for those who played this on the free week, my harddrive is offended and tried suiciding after first launch. 10/10
3003	1	a	Totally LOVE it! I'm already addicted, tho they need more .... female stuff in the game, like accessories and such.
3005	1	a	the beatles of games
3007	1	a	Great Game actually. I see a lot of reviews sayin how the publisher is a piece of crap and all that stuff, I have to say that the game itself is pretty nice.  The idea of the game is simple but hey, if you are a casual gamer like me who just need to wind down a bit after work, this game is perfect. It is an easy goin' dino shootin' fps with nice graphics and a very friendly game community. There is no fancy campaign or complicated mechanics in the game, no scheming no grand strategy, just some good old fashioned brainless action packed shooting. And that is good enough for me.  Of course, if you are a hardcore gamer looking for a challege, this game is not for you. But if all you want is sometime away from it all, this game is the perfect choice. 9/10
3009	1	a	Great game, co-op is really nice :) Some weapons are to OP :( but it's fun to play, especially with friends :) Try it on every free weeked and then buy 4-pack :) it's worth every penny :)
877	0	a	I dug a bit deeper to find out why I haven't had the will to play this game for more than three measly hours. Found DMCA claims, multiple titles with the same gameplay, money-whoring Kickstarter tactics, etc.  I wonder if Steam will still accept my refund.
878	0	a	For the love of god avoid this game in its entirety. It's god some decent ideas but the execution is the absolute worst of perhaps any game ever made. Avoid. Avoid. Avoid.
3011	1	a	The MetaScore for this game does not do it justice. - If you only read the first line of reviews, then this one speaks volumes.  Essentially a wave-based first person shooter (in the same mold as Tripwire's Killing Floor and Valve's Left 4 Dead), this game has a man vs dinosaurs theme set in mulitple locations.  Graphics are smooth and surprisingly good. The developers have thrown a lot of work into making this game not only playable, but challenging and enjoyable as well - and it shows. Not the most immersive game out there, but that fades into insignificance when the bullets start flying.  A worthy addition to any game library - especially when on sale.
880	0	a	I dug a bit deeper to find out why I haven't had the will to play this game for more than three measly hours. Found DMCA claims, multiple titles with the same gameplay, money-whoring Kickstarter tactics, etc.  I wonder if Steam will still accept my refund.
881	0	a	-5/10 would not get ♥♥♥♥♥ by tricerotops. Worst $1.50 I've ever spent.
3013	1	a	This game is a lot of fun no doubt.Highly under-rated.Love the scenary/evironment.And the dinosaurs are wonderful i really enjoy killing them .Fun weapons and vehicles to use. Only downfall is its bugs .Hopefully it all gets resolved in the future to make the game perfect.
883	0	a	This game is just horrible. Metacritic has the right score. this game is so bad that they had to make a fake community apprecitation video to spread lies on how 'good' it is. DON'T BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! There is no replayability, The dinosaurs feel so robotic and unreal. It's way to repetitive because all you do is shoot dinosaurs or shoot other people and you pretty much get the same experience ALL THE TIME. Did i mention that the boss dinosaurs are so freakin bad. they're unepic, they can get stuck in walls and get glitched so you can just fire away, they also feel unreal. The animations are pretty bad especially for the stupid sword. it just looks like you're love tapping those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and not freakin slicing the ♥♥♥♥ out of those dinos. I really dont want to explain anymore of the horrid features of this HORRIBLE game because there are many. I don't know why there are so many Thumbs up it's just making the developers big headed causing them to make a stupid ♥♥♥ video spreading their lies to the world. DON'T BUY THiS GAME.
884	0	a	The graphics are low texture, the AI is buggy as crap and there are a bunch of features that don't work properly. It's fun with friends but you'd be better off playing killing floor for an evening.
3015	1	a	I found the game to be quite good, it makes good use of the Unreal Engine too. To see my gameplay the link is attached:  https://youtu.be/zEILzMO12lk  
885	0	a	I hope you know what weapons to get; because those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that want you to defend that base LOCK YOU OUT IN ONLY ONE MINUTE. The sound seems to work intermittently but one thing is for sure; that stereotypical black guy voice is coool under fire! These dinosaurs are ninjas.  Sometimes the miniguns on the vehicles work. Sometimes they don't. Your friends will swear that they are overheating and take over but you know the spin-up animation isn't happening but now you want to kick your dog. Thank Glob you don't have a dog.  I played my first game and my friend was so happy to be done with our mission that I couldn't even get to see my stats. Frankly, I don't really care anymore.  This game is sooo close to being decent. There are too many niggling issues (it's not racist - look it up) for me to recommend it, however. I can only imagine what it was like to play at launch.  When I bought Audiosurf for 99 cents, I was ecstatic. There should be a 'Meh' button, but...
886	0	a	Do not get this game. It has horrible graphics and very bad fps, even though tipicaly running 120fps on any other game. The consept is ok, but nothing great: you have to survive waves of dinos who come and try to kill you and your generator. get sanctum if you want a game like this but better.
887	0	a	That game is Bad. And i doesn't mean idea, idea is pretty present. I mean the way it realized. Game is Raw, controls feels Clumsy, game is Glitchy, Models looking like axe-crafted wood ... it feels like - game was coded by feets, not by hands. It's looking like school-project created by something like 'build-your-game' tool, it doesn't even looks like Game. It's Awful, Uncomfortable, Embarrassing and Stupid. It's not just doesn't cost fixed price, it shouldn't have any price. I swear, i seen indie Games that has Much better Quality than That.
888	0	a	Worst ♥♥♥♥ing gave i ever played in my life.  The trailer looks really amazing and all, i was really hype when i noticed the new content would be F2P this week but once i started playing i was really not happy.  INSTAGIB, was my first game, your gun take more then half the screen and it take like 2 sec to charge it to shoot, and you can't hold it and shoot at your will, it shoot after the charge.  Second game was in some kind of Power Generator defense map.. no idea what the ♥♥♥♥ was going on... killing dinos for credits and XP, bought a Magnum which aim like potato gun...  Again, this ♥♥♥♥ing gamemode.. follow a random dude... walk 3 km, like 10 min walk (THE MAP IS REALLY HUGE) don't see anyone or any dinos on the way... get seperate from that guy, meet 2 enemies... one of them already had a shotgun, we get really close to each others.. i shoot at him at least 50 times (i'm not an idiot i was totally aiming at him) and like 2 bullets it him for 24 dmg which is not even close to 5% health.. he shoot me 3 times at like 50 feets and i'm dead. I respawn and there's 3-4 guys in our base with vehicules murdering everyone.  The graphics are a mix of 80's games graphics mixed with CryEngine 2. Sounds is terribad... Map is huge for no reason... more ressources to load in your RAM for absolutely no reasons. Peoples won't explain you the game and tell you ♥♥♥♥ like 'I bet you play CoD', well at least CoD is a decent game, even the hitboxes are better in Black Ops then this game.  The fact i wasn't hitting anyone might be due to high ping servers but for me this game doesn't do it. I wouldn't even pay 50 cents for this.  Enough words. I don't recommend it.. if you like old school graphics game like Unreal Tournament 2004 but with some randoms ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ts CryEngine2-like and you like killing ♥♥♥♥♥ randomly for no reason to get own by RANDOM enemies. This might be your game..  
889	0	a	This is becoming quite laughable. This useless and totally anonymous 'game' just keeps popping up as free trial for days. The reason? Uh... let's guess.  The positive reviews in the trailer are those written in the 'store page', paste/copy. Not even good at cheating
3017	1	a	Oh what a mess. Looking through this game's history is quite the nightmare, and makes me glad I have nothing to do with Spiral's PR team (if one even exists). I think the most important thing for anyone looking at this game to note is that it is not at all what it used to be. Over the past couple of years this game has been nurtured and cared for with an obvious love and dedication that I don't often see these days from developers. While the original ORION: Dino Beatdown was a buggy mess, Dino Horde has grown out of that messy goo into something I think plenty of people will enjoy for hours on end.  I recently acquired this game while it was on sale for ~$1.00 thinking I would have a good time playing it with my friends, not expecting a whole lot based on steam reviews and such. My goodness was I pleasantly surprised.   The first thing that grabbed my attention when I loaded up the game was the depth of the options menu. The sheer amount of UI customization and graphical tweaking available is phenomenal. And they scored major points for allowing me to turn off bloom and motion blur. However I will note that I have not yet found a way to change the controller look sensitivity, which is quite the downside if you prefer to play this with a controller, and stands in stark contrast to the quality of the rest of the options menu.  After tweaking controls and graphics options to my heart’s content, my friend and I jumped into a game of survival. Honestly, this is where I think the game suffers the most. We had absolutely no idea what we were doing, and there is very little help to be found online in the forms of wikis or guides. What we did know, was to follow the on screen prompts to turn on our generator. After we managed that, enough help popped up to lead us back to our base to buy weapons and augments (purchasable buffs that last until you die). With the starting money we grabbed a few SMGs and headed outside to kill us some dinos. Once they finally spawned we started frantically murderizing every giant reptile in sight, and they in turn began chewing on our faces. Seems dinosaurs don't appreciate bullets being hurled at them. We quickly discovered that setting the difficulty to medium for your first go might not be the best idea, and we were promptly turned into dino-chow. So we went back to the lobby, turned the difficulty down to easy and tried again. This time we were able to hold our own against the horde of angry reptiles bent on human consumption. Well, at least until wave 7.   After we finished playing a few games of survival I found that I craved more, and dino horde was happy to oblige, allowing for an 'open world' mode they dubbed conquest. In this game mode you can choose from one of two huge maps to play on. One in the arctic and one in the recently added plains. When you load this mode up you are presented with a vehicle or two for traversing the world, and a couple generators you can head towards. When you go to one of the generators and turn it on, you begin a very similar wave driven experience as survival mode, however, if you manage to last the ten waves and secure that outpost, you are rewarded with a load of cash, and the opportunity to go work on securing another outpost. I will admit that I do not know what happens if you secure more than one outpost (I saw three, but didn't have the time to play 30+ rounds).   The biggest thing that stands out to me about this game is the fact that the more I play it, the more I discover about it and enjoy it. I have only played two of the twelve (yes, twelve) game modes and already I feel that this game is worth the money they are asking for it. Admittedly it has its share of issues such as no FoV slider, a lack of pertinent help documentation (took us forever to find out how to get more ammo) and a slightly overwhelming number of game modes that have no description. However, even with these things in mind, nothing beats the thrill of fighting a horde of raptors, a t-rex, a stegosaurus, two triceratops, and a deinosuchus all at once in the middle of a rainy night while trying to capture an outpost. I felt like a kid again, and there are so few games these days that give me that thrill and excitement. Definitely give this game a try.
892	0	a	Graphics 4 out of 10 In-game sounds 3 out of 10 Gameplay 6 out of 10 Story N/A Multiplayer 6 out of 10 Price-quality 8 out of 10  Summary-The game is really worth 1$ but don't expect anything fancy.It's poorly optimised and has bugs.It only has multiplayer function.
893	0	a	It's poorly optimized and doesn't look like the screenshots.
3019	1	a	This is what happens if you cross HALO with Jurassic Park. The game is very enjoyable, but farily repetitive. When it went on sale it was 1 dollar, and thats the best dollar I have ever spent on a game. So get out there and strat powning T-Rexes with mechs and tanks!
3021	1	a	A friend just got me this game with the 4 pack, and we hopped right into it.  While this game might be really goofy, its LOADS of fun!  It really does feel alot like halo when you get jeeps, its already like turock because ... Dinos  Highly reccomend 10/10 would buy 4 pack
896	0	a	Single Player: PVE review. For PVP look for another review.  in this, hopefully final, incarnation the game moves into the world of microtransactions. the game is still unplayable in single player (its just multiplayer mode w/o other players, no bots). best if experienced w/ friends for a laugh, the game has no fun factor asside from dying with style.   i bought the 4 pack for 4.99 and i feel ripped off. if your going to support your product w/ microtransactions you need to make it free. i know it was done to avoid login but do the microtransactions come right out of steam wallet? (honest question. i did not have the endurance to explore the store after discovering it)  basically this is the same terrible game it has always been. good for a laugh if in the dollar bin.  i am The Evil Dr. F and i DO NOT recommend this game. (unless you and your hordemates can get it for about a buck)  URGENT UPDATE 7JUN14: Game still has no realistic Single Player even though it boasts of it on catalog page. Game still requires friends and a sense of humor to play. To some extent a willingness to die with style instead of winning is recommended. It STILL has a store.   Updates have made the game more easy to look at (when crippled, or abducted by a pteranodon). Still cannot run and jump at same time (so no bunny hopping).
3023	1	a	Good exiting game where you have to work together with your team mates a lot to survive. Almost like CS but you fight dinos instead of terrorists.
897	0	a	I can't play this game! I had to put myself into it to play just 1 match, frequent crashes, losing connection from hosts, the servers list doesn't load... there are just too many bugs in this game. When I finally got to play... god... The gameplay is messed up! When you shoot a dinosaur they don't feel anything, they don't stop running. They will only when you kill them. The audio of the guns is a mess. If you shoot with an automatic rifle 40% of the shots will be silent because they are too fast... If you enjoy this game is ok! It's just 0.99 cents right now, but don't buy it if you haven't tried it yet. I had enough after 2 games, there are too many bugs and glitches.
3025	1	a	The Metacritic score is a lie!
898	0	a	Are you looking for fun, excitement, adventure, and a one way trip to cool visuals?? Well then go and stare at a ♥♥♥♥ing wall. Better yet go and try to moon a King Kobra while 3 feet from it and stare at the ceiling in a hospital because atleast you'll get a nice view as you are in agonizing pain. Seriously, this game is like what would happen if Halo and Killing Floor made love and decided they had better things to do so they chucked the thing off a cliff. But then it was adopted by the brilliant minds that brought you Ride to Hell: Retribution.
899	0	a	This game is bad
900	0	a	Pros: Uninstalled really quickly  Cons: DOESN'T SUPPORT MY SCREEN RES feels like shooting a water gun Dinos are Op Boring 3gb of waste   Conclusion- Dont buy
901	0	a	I had this phase where i would buy most anything if it was on sale under 5$ on steam, that Phase ended with Orion dino horde, a very poor game that has mediocre visuals, gunplay, and creativity, its no more than a buggy mess that only pumps out enough entertainment to distract you for a few minutes while waitng for your favorite TV show to come on, and once it does, there's no hesitation to turning it off and getting on with your life. The cummulative money system for weapons is a probably the best idea in the game, and it wasn't ever their's, Counter strike had them beat by at least 10 years, and if you like that system, you should go get Counter strike: GO which is a much better game and i highly recommend it. It doesnt hurt to give them this rating what so ever, 3/10
3027	1	a	For the money, you simply can't beat this game. It does come with different game modes, which in my opinion are all awful except for survival, which is a round based game mode where you buy (not with real money) weapons, perks, and go on missions to acquire vehicles that not only increase travel speed, but also come equipped with guns, rockets, and turrets.  Like I said earlier, this is not BF4, or COD Ghosts, but for the money especially when this is on sale, you can't beat it.  *Update* System Specs have increased due to the new arctic update, you can no longer play this with dedicated graphics, you need some sort of GPU. This degrades my opinion of the game slightly, just because the range of viable players has decreased (i.e. I can no longer play this on my laptop, I have to play it on my desktop with my fx 6300 and r9 270x). This does not affect my overall impresssion of the game, this comment is simply in the 'Other Thoughts' section of the review if you are familiar with newegg.
905	0	a	As someone who loves dinosaurs and violence this game is the saddest creation on Steam. Not worth the .99 nor the time to install a free trial.  The game has horrible matchmaking connectivity, match sizes are too small, and invites from friends don't work reliably. The lobby menus are bloated with an obvious cash grab shop and 'look at me' achievements. After finally getting into the game the environments are so empty. Sad textures on bland geometry. The objectives are agonizingly simple, go here, push button, await dinosaurs.  The AI has simple charge maneuvers with little variance. Other game modes offer different playstyles, but those are just as droll. Playing as a dinosaur should be an exciting encounter with you as a 'boss' monster, instead you get mown down in seconds by standard weaponry and vehicles. The bigger dinosaurs available are sluggish and their hit detection leaves you wondering if you're playing on the same map. How did the developers attempt to balance smaller dinosaurs against their totally-not-spartan soldiers? They've strapped 'dino-mite' (oh god this is probably what they called it) onto the back of Compy and Pterodactyls. Orion: Dino Horde is supposed to be a dinosaur game, or at least about dinosaurs, but there are only two decent selections in the multiplayer. It is more rewarding to be a faceless marine than the game's namesake. I would call that a failure. Speaking of 'original' protagonists. Models, animations, and even the physics feel so similar to Halo titles it is like the budget was spent paying Bungie's royalties, as if they could afford them. The guns are such obvious plagiarisms they appear to have been stripped from Halo 2 and altered in the simplest ways. Round a barrel here, recolor there, different gun! The worst example is the tank. It is the Scorpion from Halo shamelessly reused. Orion: Dino Horde is a decent concept, horribly executed. The developer must be trying some last ditch effort to squeeze money out of the dying player-base. I've found out there is another game in the works, an open world dino warfare game. I can only hope that they've learned from their mistakes and attempt to make something different from Dino Horde.   Despite all that I've said I did play this game, I did laugh at it with friends, but I still feel shorted. I spent .99 on this game and I wish I could have it back. It is that bad.  TL:DR = One of the worst things you could play.
3029	1	a	Damn Good to Play this game
908	0	a	One of the worst games I have played
909	0	a	A game I bought because it was at such a low price, (Like a pound or something) I knew I couldn't of been getting anything great, but I excpected to get some enjoyment out of it.  Where to start?  First off, the entire game is a horde mode, so the game is essentially a side feature of most games trying to be a full game.  The controls are okay, I can figure out how to move and use weapons.  The graphics quality is alright, it's nothing at all special.  The dinosaur models/textures are kind of out-of-place looking, they look a bit cartoony.  Whenever you headshot a raptor, it's head explodes, and it looks awful.  The game's lighting is overall very bland and reminds me of when my ENB for Fallout: New Vegas broke.  I went down, it told me 'Fight to survive', there were no dinosaurs around me, so I died.  Gunplay is fairly weak.  The weapons don't feel real, they still sound like a gentleman coughing on an operahouse.  Voice acting is okay I guess.  A wide variety of three classes, wow, so many classes to choose from, so hard to decide.  Overall this doesn't live up to the reviews shown in the trailer at all, but then again, did you really excpect that?  So what are terms for buying it on?  If you're really really into dinosaur games, this might be for you, if you're not, well then why are you even here?  Overall, boring game, nothing to keep me in it.
910	0	a	Same game, different name. Would not recommend if you're looking for something different from ORION.
3031	1	a	It's a good game. You have the Asault clas there you ee jatpack on. The suport clas, reco class each class has more weapons and contain some wapeons can you buy for each class.Thit is a nice game, Its so cheap for it.  i give it an 8/10.
3033	1	a	This game is so much ♥♥♥♥ing fun, I would recommend any one to buy it, especially now it's only .99€ Driving in a buggy being chased by a ♥♥♥♥ing T-Rex is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing epic.  9/10
3035	1	a	Some insane, crazy fun! Just a little bit unpolished but still fantastic!
3037	1	a	holy ♥♥♥♥ are you kidding me this is the best ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game i ever i did play
3039	1	a	dont wana make a review for this now ima go play it
912	0	a	It trys so hard to be a good game but fails so bad
3041	1	a	Halo meets cod:zombies meets Jurassic Park. would play again!
3043	1	a	This game isn't anywhere near as awful as I expected given reviews. It's not really good either, but it's a great way to kill an hour or two with friends. Like Killing Floor but with dinosaurs and vehicles.
3045	1	a	When I first played this game it was nothing special. The gameplay was average, but fairly fun with friends. Today the game was updated which added a various number of things. The added rain and day and night cycle allows for more depth and realism to the point where i feel like i am actually in the arctic fighting dinosaurs in real life. This game now makes games such as Battlefield 4 and Crysis 3 look like arcade shooters. 9/11 would bang and buy again.
3047	1	a	That first gameplay video that got me wanting to get a single copy of the game, but it was the hats that got me to get the 4 pack, well that and the price was just about 1 free game lol. Well at $0.99 it had me sold at Hats.  Edit: The game is now free. There is no reason for you to not just play it for however long you want. The game is a lot of fun but just not polished at all.
3049	1	a	Halo style (and vehicles) + Open World levels + Dinosaurs + Killing Floor gameplay...  it's not perfect by any means, but for those who don't take things too seriously, it's a fun time killer with friends.
3051	1	a	Guns, Vehicals, and Dinos. Awsome!
913	0	a	This game would be good if it didn't suck so much.
3053	1	a	Jet-packs, dinosaurs and sci fi ♥♥♥♥? literally my favorite wave-style fps.
3055	1	a	Remember playing with those plastic dinosaur figures as a kid? Apparently the Devs of this game did. If you want to relive your childhood this game is for you. Grab a shotgun and blast some dinosaurs till you’ve had your fill of prehistoric carnage. Solid mechanics make this game easy to pick up for anyone who is familiar with FPS games. Various game modes and a variety of dinosaurs and guns make for some fun game play that keeps you engaged. Add some friends and it’s even better. Some of the upgrades and HUD elements can be confusing at first and currently there isn’t a large player base. Overall I'd recommend it, especially if you can get some friends to play as well.
915	0	a	I could recommend it, if something was done about the dinosaurs. Seriously, I'm higly doubting they did any modelling. It looks like a gif placed on your screen and they run very... weird? I can't explain, try if you want it, they did a good job on all the rest! I just can't get over the fact how crappy and ugly those dinosaurs are.
916	0	a	I had a nice day today. I had a above average day at school today, and I came home to see that there was a free game on steam. Me and my buddy were very excited to see that the game was about dinosaurs, as there are very few of those today. So my friend and I said, 'why not?', and dove in.  After an hour of downloading, our hearts were racing. Thoughts of running wild as a gigantic dinosaur, eating anything in our path, running the jungle so to speak. We click 'play', and off we are into the world of ORION: Dino Horde.  Never in my life have I wanted to kill myself. I am one of the most postive people I know, and this game made me the most depressed, dark, and angry person on the planet. My blood was boiling at the sight of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dinosaur animations, and terrible gameplay. I am writing this with my neck in a noose, and plan on hanging myself after I post this review.   God speed.
3057	1	a	The metascore is misleading, it's from the old build This game is awesome and frenetic Recommended
918	0	a	Not necessarily bad, just not really amazing. It seemed like after you've played one wave you've played them all.
3059	1	a	A split between Halo &amp; Primal Carnage. Great Game!!
3061	1	a	Epic and fun! dirt cheap!
3063	1	a	This is orion dino horde a game where you have to fend off several waves of dinosaurs that want to eat you. Ok so the game has some bugs and glitches but every game has them and ♥♥♥♥ the haters at metacritic. This game has changed alot since it came out. Oh and did i tell you that you can shoot dinosaurs with tanks and jets. Anyways i give this game an 8/10
922	0	a	The developer was banned from the Steam forums if that tells you anything.
3065	1	a	Awesome game, recommend getting it. still a few problems but overal great
3067	1	a	Hi there i want to start by saying this game is great. Its a survival game that you shoot dinos in and is unplayable i would recommend this to all who like to waste money.
924	0	a	Trash.
3069	1	a	This is the best game ever it has 4 pvp modes and 1 pve mode and there will be free title updates (dlc packs) in artic dlc (dlc pack 3) conquest is returning! Man i missed that mode and i played it since orion dino beatdown
3071	1	a	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=428IyxSfsls     10/10
927	0	a	Toxic Community:  I thought hey, it's only $.99 so I'll check it out. The gameplay is great, graphics are okay. But it's the people you play with that make the game what it is. Within my first five games. I was consistently told to gtfo. If you're wondering why the recent reviews are 'mixed.' Then you might be part of the problem. Not the experience I was expecting out of a dollar purchase.
928	0	a	The metacritic score is misleading? Really developers? REALLY? How hard are you trying to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t yourselves now? This game is an unfinished pile of horse ♥♥♥♥. If anything the metacritic score is spot on. The servers don't work, the solo game is impossible to play, and the game does little to nothing to tell you how to play. The key mappings aren't the best and in all honesty the game itself just isnt finished. You put too much time into how pretty the game looks and not enough time into the gameplay. And I just love how all those 'Quotes' in the trailer give credit to no one. Who are they from? The developers. The funniset thing is I played this for free! Not only did they sell it at 93% off but I still have 4 days left to try out this utter garbage! This game is awful and I cannot recommend it.
3073	1	a	Ate dinosaur egg and died pregnant with them 20/10
929	0	a	This is an abomination of a video game worse than the holocaust wouldnt download it again if it became permently free.
3075	1	a	Killing Floor meets Halo meets Primal Carnage. Waved based defense vs dinos with veichles! If it sounds awesome it's because it is. It's a pretty solid game and fun with friends and an abosulte steal at $.99 which is a price it tends to sell at from time to time.
3077	1	a	u kill dinos      thats cool
934	0	a	Everything about this game is terrible, down to the real money customization store. If there has really been so much improvement since Dino Beatdown, I don't want to think about how awful THAT was. But really, renaming the game was just a cheap ploy to escape the awful reviews it had deserved upon its original release.  A generous 2/10
935	0	a	Fans of Jurassic Park and Gamers alike have been waiting for years to find a halfway decent Dinosaur video game! To see all of their favorite dinosaurs from when they were children to come to life in a dynamic world with beautiful visuals and emmersive gameplay! Now, after all this time...  THEY'RE! STILL! WAITING!  Instead, play a terrible game with badly rendered character models, horrible animations and ridiculously flawed, generic combat!   Witness a game experience like no other! The development crew spent Days! Hours! Minutes! Seconds making this game! Making sure it was absolutly perf- *laughter* Sorry, oh man, I couldn't do that one with a straight face. But seriously, F**k this game. xD   Experience all of the gamemodes that you've played a million times in every other first person shooter on the planet, but this time, with maybe 6 dinosaurs that you could kill with one shot!   You're going to buy this because you can play dinosaurs? WELL WE'VE GOT ONE GAMEMODE FOR YOU.     Thats it. One Gamemode.    Starring:  Discount Multiplayer Announcer voice from Halo.  Awkward Running.  Lag.  More lag!  Bugs!  Clipping through walls!  Clipping through other walls!  Mediocre soundtracks!  Square rocks.  Invisivble bullets!  Invisible bullets!  INVISIBLE GOSH-DANG BULLETS.           Dayum, and we thought Hunter Blade was bad!
936	0	a	This game is the worst catastrophe since Chernobyl.
937	0	a	This game is a turd. A giant, messy Dino-turd. Even my kids hate it, and they LOVE dinosaurs. Nothing else to say.
938	0	a	Why is this game getting good reviews?
939	0	a	Terrible game. Mosters attacking you in between waves, no time to do anything in between waves, not even close to a smooth game.  1/10 would definately ask for my £1 refund
3079	1	a	THIS GAME IS SUPER FUN. I NEED MORE PEOPLE TO PLAY WITH IT. BEST $2.99 SPENT.
941	0	a	&gt;DO NOT BUY &lt; even when it hits 0,99 DONT BUY STEAM SHOULD HAVE A DEL BUTTON FOR THIS ONE
942	0	a	I cant believe people paid money for this
943	0	a	Not even worth a dollar. Leave it to die.
944	0	a	Dinosaurs that walk on air. 10/10
3081	1	a	This Game Is Amzing !!!! A True Testament Of What Hard Work And Dedication Can Accomplish !!!!!
3083	1	a	Its like jurassic park without electrical fences and space guns.
3085	1	a	Guns+Jetpacks+Armored Mechabots+Dinosaurs= A ♥♥♥♥ load of fun! :) havent even tried co-op yet cause my 'friends' have yet to accept their cheap ♥♥♥ gifts but this game is totally recommended if you are looking for the above. And the graphics are pretty damn impressive for such a little game :)
3087	1	a	From my personal experience this game is awesome and provides lot of fun, especially if u play it with friends, To be honest game needs improvements and fixes but that dosen't mean that u cant have great experience of fun. I recommend this game to everyone. Just lover a bar of perfection for games. I've played this game for 23h and I love it.
945	0	a	This game is pretty repetive. I can not see anyone enjoying this unless they are playing with friends. And only enjoy it for a day at the most.
3089	1	a	Really great game to play with friends
3091	1	a	Used a Lightsaber to kill a dinosaur 10/10
3093	1	a	I was taunting my friends and a dinosaur picked me up and dropped me from the sky to kill me
3095	1	a	You shoot a f*ckload of dinosaurs. That is the game.
3097	1	a	This game is a hillariously buggy mess yet I wouldn't change a thing about it. Best $.99 I spent in a long time.
3099	1	a	This game is so freaking fun! There's an eight year old deep inside me that's jumping for joy after playing this game! 
3101	1	a	too many orions 8/10
3103	1	a	Really fun game. Especially if you find a couple of friends to play it with. For a low price, this game will give you a couple of hours of fun :D
3105	1	a	This game is full of Bexes that just walk around you and derp. Some of them also gets stuck under tanks and makes stupid Bex noises! It's focking derp as hell.  Otherwise, pretty good co-op experience
3107	1	a	T-rex ran at me and flipped my car off the map, gotta get a new one.  3/10 no more cars left rip car 2014
3109	1	a	This game is the best worst game I have ever played. It has such a bad starting menu and no tutorial and it runs like ♥♥♥♥ for average PCs and who ever did the sounds makes me wana laugh my ♥♥♥ off. A T-Rex is ear deffaning from miles away on the lowest volume possible, while a 44 magnum in your hand being shot sounds like a silnced bb gun to a def old man. But for some reason this is just to fun. The first hour or so of actual gameplay and not trying to figure out how to join a friend is proboly the most fun ive had in a multiplayer experince in a long time.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0h-af9TT75A  Buy this game, its by no means a 15 dollar game, but its 1 dollar, and if someone can play it with you, you will have a great time.
3111	1	a	I got eaten by a T-rex and got a achievement for it.  10/10
3113	1	a	Definately worth it, especially since it is on sale. Ton's of game types, great graphics. Don't listen to the meta score.
3115	1	a	fighting ♥♥♥♥ing dinosaurs. awesome!
3117	1	a	♥♥♥♥♥ies game ever made just buy it
3119	1	a	ORION:Dino Horde. this game has a great potential in the future and right now is still a good game. The dinosaurs are not to overpowerd nor are the guns. The vheicals all have thier weaknesses and strengths. and also the classes have been well thought out and put together well so that when all three work together it is a good team. But one of the main things this game has to offer is the community it contains. The community is one of the nicest you can find, they help each other and most of them are playing to survive as well. So make sure you get this game, come join in and have alot of fun 
3121	1	a	This is the best cheap game on steam.
3123	1	a	Not bad worth the 53 cents
3125	1	a	First of all, if you are looking for a AAA blockbuster title, better start clicking the 'back' arrow. Go into this game, just like the TV show 'Pretty Little Liars,' with a lack of expectations. This game is FUN! If you have a few friends, you might want to take out a loan and purchase the 4 pack for only a few bucks. I got it for around a dollar and have played both online and solo. Other than a can of petroleum jelly, what else could you buy that is this much fun for the price? Not a whole lot. Now beware, there are some bugs here and there but that is only part of the experience! If you would like to see some gameplay, here's a video!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reVhVGjRubI 
3127	1	a	I like it.  8/10  Cheap fun, buy it!
3129	1	a	I haven't even played it, and I like it
3131	1	a	If you like ♥♥♥♥ things like me, you will love this game.  Totally worth it for 79p  Great with friends  Loads of free content added all the time  Buy it, even if you dont enjoy it all you wasted was the cost of a mars bar. If you would rather have a mars bar than this game you are a fat ♥♥♥♥.
3133	1	a	this is an amazing game to play with friends its funny for a laugh and not to be taken to seriously. I am completely hooked
3135	1	a	If you are playing with your friends it's good but ıf you are playing with your friends.
3137	1	a	buy it its only $0.99 and insanly fun!
3139	1	a	Modern Human Technology vs Colossal Primitive Lizard was a best war ever!!! But I more like old name: 'Orion: Dino Beatdown'
3141	1	a	Make sure your FOV doesn't get set to something less than 90 as mine did, and the game feels great. For some reason it defaulted to a low FOV on my widescreen monitor and looked like crap until I changed it to 100.   Other than the FOV setting being off, this game is tons of fun for a price that is unbelievable.
3143	1	a	A sci-fi, dinosaur, fps for only 79p; what's not to like? But seriously, this game has everything from character customization to tanks vs t-rex's, I love it!
3145	1	a	Fun little dinosaur game that can be a ton of fun with friends. Would reccomend it if you love accomplishing insane feats such as killing a T-rex with a rocket launcher. Satisfaction garenteed!
3147	1	a	I have had a lot of fun playing this game. I sometimes get the COD zombies feel when facing off against countless waves with numerous hordes of dinos but it takes me back to the closest thing i'd ever like to see to a combination between jurassic park and cod zombies. Heaps of guns, augments, perks and achievements to mess around with, game is worth its weight in gameplay despite lacking much singleplayer function
3149	1	a	Fun game for a 4 people lobby,i played it with couple of friends and we had a good laugh and a nice game,killin the dinosaurs is funny,basically it is all same like l4d but with much lower graphics!
3151	1	a	nice mashup of a lot of familiar weapons. Good coop
3153	1	a	This game is great except the controls make me feel like i might be having a stroke
3155	1	a	Needed more Dinosaurs using Jetpacks.
3157	1	a	this game is alot of fun if you like team fortress 2 but also wanna shoot some dinosaurs instead of other people!!!!!!! who doesn't want to play an FPS that kills dinosaurs!!! the only down side is that there seems to be lots of bug problems. so get this game and kill some dinosaurs cuz well its dinosaurs!
3159	1	a	Best game ever 11/10 played it for days
3161	1	a	OMFG! This game is better than I thought. Got it for $4 in the summer sale and just love it :D
3163	1	a	This game is hours and hours of fun! With a group of friends of even by yourself! How many dinos have you killed lately?
3165	1	a	If Microsoft will not bring Halo back to the PC, Im glad we have ORION:Dino Horde  Halo + Dinosaurs = 10/10  Hours of fun for tha whole family :-)
3167	1	a	Its got decent graphics, fun time killer especially if you get it on sale.
3169	1	a	It's silly, it's weird, it's fun.   I killed a T-Rex in a mech, then got picked up by a pterodactyl only to shoot myself free and jetpack away.   For a dollar, how can you beat this game.
3171	1	a	if nothing else it is just fun times....
3173	1	a	Hold on to ya butts!
3175	1	a	A poor mans Free 2 Play.
3177	1	a	Good game Though i did buy it of Dino horde that was like 15 Bucks?
3179	1	a	This game is woth 0,50 cents, wich is what I payed for it.
3181	1	a	This game is very fun and entertaining. I enjoy the battle of the T-Rex
3183	1	a	The graphics remind me of Borderlands. Very fun, and is better than some of my other games that cost way more. Def a game everyone should pick up and try.
3185	1	a	Who can make a game with dinosaurs and jet packs lame? Spiral games studios thats who. You can get more value from you money by lighting it on fire 
3187	1	a	This game has its bugs and the KI is ultra stupid. Anyway, it makes a lot of fun to fly around and kill badass dinos!
3189	1	a	Good game, Worth it for $1.49. (On sale). Very fun multiplayer
3191	1	a	yes :D its good
948	0	a	This is the worst game since I played Apocalyptica back in 2003. I don't understand how it is worth more than 10 cents. It should be free, or the developers should pay me money to compensate for my suffering.
3193	1	a	Great for Dino lovers
3195	1	a	9/11 Ran into a base as Compy shouting JIHAD!
3197	1	a	this is a great game when it comes to survival mode and could expand greatly i find its like a killing floor halo mix i bought the cryo blade which is like a katna and sliced at the t rex and just rampaged whiile my teamates distracted it and it was all slow mow it was amazing
949	0	a	God awful game. Visuals are worse than the original Halo CE. No working servers. No instructions or comprehendible tutorial. The shooting feels like a trackball arcade shooter with ♥♥♥♥ stuck in buttons.  Do not buy this game. It's not even worth 99 cents.
3199	1	a	Fun game to play with good friends when you just want to screw around and have a bit of fun. Other than that its not that great of a game if you're playing by yourself.
3201	1	a	Hours of fun ,Buy a four pack for yourself and your mates
3203	1	a	For $1 this first-person shooter is certainly fun to play with friends. It truly shines in its Survival game mode which involves you and your team protecting your base's generator from dinosaurs as well as protecting each other from them. You can play as dinosaurs in other game modes as well. You have different abilities, weapons and vehicles. The vehicle combat is okay, but I would recommend sticking with the Assault class and its jetpack instead. Sure the servers' latency may drop at times, but it is still fun to play. My favorite feature is how in arctic levels your visor actually slowly freezes from the cold. THAT is neat. I just love shooting dinosaurs and for $1 that is an experience I'd pay for.
3205	1	a	it a dollar and its functional
3207	1	a	10/10 BEST GRAPHics best grameplay best dinosaur shoot 9/10 GraphicS AND GAMEPLAY PRETTY good 9/9 game game gAME GAME GAME GAme 10/10 worst game ive ever played remove it from earth before i shoot myself in my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ eye
3209	1	a	I got thrown by a giant Spinosaurus, into a rock, then I died. My friend became Rambo and went on a murder spree to bring me back to life in the next wave.   Best co-op on steam.   10/10
3211	1	a	NEWS FLASH! This game is DINO BEATDOWN...yes, the overpriced, broken, glitchy piece of software that was released almost 2 YEARS AGO. For those that bought the game back then, you've probably noticed it has a new name...and that it actually works now! This game finally offers what they promised at the point of sale. Is it perfect? Nope. Is it worth trying out again? Absolutely. And...for .99 cents, you can invite some friends to try it out with you, too.
3213	1	a	hey game creators, can you put in a new dino? carnotaurus please? its in primal carnage anyway it was medium size and would charge things with its horns. and maybe could you put in ankylosaurus and allosaurus? if you can put in one of these i would really be pleased. thanks!  -icerunner
3215	1	a	I got 4 hours game play out of it so far and im planning to play more so I would say it's definitely worth $1
3217	1	a	This game is great but not for the $14.99 it costs. If you were to buy this you should wait till it gets crazy cheap like how I did and got it for around .99 cents.
3219	1	a	This game is a LOT of fun. If you like fast paced run and gun this is the game for you. I mean come on its .99 Cents, what are you waiting for?
3221	1	a	For .99 cents you really can't beat this game. I've payed $60 for games that were less fun and less complete.
3223	1	a	Good game despite the look of it at first
3225	1	a	i bought this game when it was $20 dollars im not gonna lie i was upset but now it has improved greatly
3227	1	a	Kudos to the developers. When I bought it game 2 years ago, I felt that it was meh, and left it alone after playing for an hour. Today, I thought, 'might as well try it again' and played it once more. It has improved vastly and is way more fun the way it is now. It's one of the best games FPS I've ever played so far and I had more fun in it than many other AAA titles. Definitely worth the $0.99 I spent on it. You should definitely give it a go!
3229	1	a	I don't know about this game in the past, but right now in 2015 it is a blast. Seriously, it is some of the most fun I have had with gaming in a long time. IT IS A GAME WHERE I CAN JET PACK INTO THE SKY AND ROCKET LAUNCH A T-REX! FUN! This game is all about fun, and it damn sure is. Highly reccomended.
3231	1	a	such a funny dinosaur game  and its only a dollar...  NICE!  10/10
3233	1	a	This game is really entertaining when playing conquest mode with a couple of friends. I like the way classes are able to cooperate and bring down everything that swarms around. Especially T-Rex, lol!
3235	1	a	Fun game to play with friends.
3237	1	a	Seems like an alright game if you want to relax and shoot things, I dont see why people are saying it is so bad, because I think it is just an average online fps really.
3239	1	a	Cheap game with great EXP :)
3241	1	a	A philosphy of gaming for all you poor souls. $1 should means at least 1 hour of gameplay. I spent $0.99 and got some little bit of time over 13. #worth? Not really. But kinda.
3243	1	a	Orion Prelude is a good cheap game to have fun with friends and if you like achievements then don't worry. You will get an achievement for everything , even for just pausing the game.
3245	1	a	It's 99 cents for what would be the equivalent of a 15$+ game. (though I probably wouldn't have bought it or tried it out then.) I didn't expect much at first, but fact of the matter is the game is pretty damn good.  There are many servers in the lobby, and if needed you can start your own. The game itself has enough enemies to keep it interesting, and graphics-wise is just good enough. The gameplay is such that teamwork is more or less encouraged, though there's still competition at times over the various vehicles and machines that can be found across the map.  The game is just fun overall. I have a minor complaint (which is probably noobish) about the player GUI and being unsure where the healthbar is, but apart from that I think it's a pretty solid package for 0.99$, and more than worth the price. Additionally, the community seems nice. That's always an added bonus.
3247	1	a	Even though it runs like garbage on my computer It's still fun
3249	1	a	Many hours after playing this...untill, YOU notice THAT IT IS ONL'Y 1$ WITH SO MANY REVIEWS AND YOUR SO AMAZED. 
3251	1	a	This game is really good for .99 cents.
3253	1	a	Fun to play with friends but gets repetative fast.
3255	1	a	This game is amazing!
3257	1	a	This game is quite the bomb digity and I enjoy playing it all dayyyyy
3259	1	a	Not the best graphics, but quick and fun to play - if you like shooting small, big and huge dinos! :-)
3261	1	a	I've been holding off on writing a review for this game for quite a long time. I played it a few months ago, and, admittedly, it was less than stellar. If you were to ask me about the game at that point in time, I would have said it was garbage.  However, I don't know what happened, but this game is suddenly incredibly fun. Sure, the dinosaurs are kind of janky, and it's definitely too challenging to play on your own (bring some friends!), but there's something charming about it. It's just a loveable game. Quite fun, too!  I definitely recommend that anybody considering getting this game should get it. (At the time that I'm writing this, it's on sale for $0.99 for like the 5th time, so I doubt this will happen again, but it may.)
3263	1	a	Would never have thought id enjoy this game, but it was free to play so i thought id give it a try. 12 hours of gameplay later and i guess you can say im addicted! Definitely a must play. Worth way more than $14.00
3265	1	a	Best FPS game i have played in sooo long. Don't let the price decieve you, this game is probably better than half the 60$ games being released
3267	1	a	The best pew pew for your bucks.
3269	1	a	Personally I thought it wasn't going to be the best game for a dollar, but I read some other reviews and DID NOT go by the meta game score because thats dumb as hell, I mean why not try it out eh? its only a dollar lol. But I really enjoy it, its fun, challenging, entertaining, a lot of customization. Fun game all around IMO. 8/10
3271	1	a	this is a fun game. def worth the 3 dollars i paid for it. like another post say's in some cases it better than most high dollar games out there. its a fun little run and gun shooter. dont expect anything more than that. get it to just mindlessly kill dinos with your friends.
3273	1	a	This game while receiving many bad reviews over the interwebs, has proven to be quite enjoyable and i plan on spending many hours with friends slaying dinos with high powered weaponry.
3275	1	a	10/10 MLG AS F**K!  Only played 20 minutes.
3277	1	a	bought this game a year ago got aids  played this game today didn't get aids  7.8/10- needs more water
3279	1	a	ya buy if u want good and low priced game
3281	1	a	A lot of fun, recomend for co-op fans and all FPS / Dino Lovers!
3283	1	a	worth the money.
3285	1	a	Pretty fun and big game and it was only 0.39 $  I think its totally worth a buy!!!
3287	1	a	Stabbed a friend in the ♥♥♥ when he was playing as a tricerotops.   10/10 IGN GOTY
3289	1	a	This game is what Jurassic park would have been if the main cast were replaced by soldiers with futuristic weapons. Part FPS, part tower defence, part dinosaur massacre!
3291	1	a	ORION: Prelude is a FPS that, at first sight, reminds one of Halo. It is class-based, with each class leveling up separately. Classes only dictate the special ability your character has, and you can switch them at any time between games. Assault has a jetpack, Recon can jump higher and has cloaking abilities, Support can heal and revive easier. You can further customize your experience by buying weapons in the match (there are some two-three dozen weapons) with credits earned from killing dinosaurs, and leveling up a certain class allows you to set some of those as starting weapons, removing the need to buy them. The weapons are pretty diverse; pistols, SMGs, different kinds of assault rifles, snipers, shotguns, there's even a lightsaber and a plasma bow. You can also use up your credits to buy Perks, improving your ability to fly (increase duration, speed, cut fuel recovery time in half etc.), walk faster, even give you lifesteal. There is also an abundance of game modes, around 7 if I recall correctly, and a variety of maps. Pros: +statisfying graphics with a range of weather effects +a lot of drastically different, big maps +vehicles and mechs +sound +a vast number of weapons +nicely done perks +a good number of achievements +a lightsaber-only free-for-all +the dev team actually listens to its fans +really worth it for 0.99€ Cons: -the classes kinda lack balance (in Survival, Assault is the only class worth using) -in need of a good tutorial -prone to exploits (set the Prehistoric difficulty to the max, so you get the most XP, pick Assault and fly on a rock, it's enough that you kill 4-5 dinosaurs and die to get insta level 15)  All in all, the game isn't perfect, but it's a lot of fun. If you intend on buying it, get a 4-pack and gift it to your friends and then play together. For 0.99€, I'd recommend this game to anyone.
3293	1	a	soooo much fun, controller support is great game works for low end pc's. its also only a dollar so i highly recommend
3295	1	a	This game's reviews are all over the place. Let's just get something straight. Other than having not enough maps this game runs smoothly, looks decent (on ultra) and doesn't crash (if your pc is good xD) I'd easily give this game an 8/10 for just general enjoyment. Anyone who has done survival and gotten bored just do conquest. Even though I have replayed conquest it still is fun each time.  :)
3297	1	a	dollar game dollar fun  unexpectedly fun (with friends)
3299	1	a	Its not the money worth!!!!!!
3301	1	a	I think that it is interesting, and brought something a little different to the table, and I TOTALLY love dinosaurs, but its graphics aren't very good. Hell, that could be my computer. I would still recommend playing it though. Maybe it'll be a better experience for you!
3303	1	a	This game is really funny to play with friends. nothing you need to take serious :D
3305	1	a	An okay game for 99 cents, though it doesnt feel anywhere near complete
3307	1	a	FUN!! EXCITING! I can play a dino or have a good choice of weapons and vehicles to hunt and kill them :) Oh and the best part is I can play with a jet pack!!! :D Wooo Hooo!!
3309	1	a	cool game for u thats want survival game
3311	1	a	The game is good. Not absolutely perfect but also Its only just 1$. And I think for that price this game is Amazing.  Its one of the most fun Fps I have played.  The game is a little buggy but thats another problem.
3313	1	a	Pretty sweet simplistic game. Excellent for low powered computers n min game resources. Also its history is hilarious for using the steam system like an iTunes top trending chart. 5/7 perfect game. Would play again
3315	1	a	No i do not recommend this game, but yolo its ♥♥♥♥ing awsome
3317	1	a	this game is great! its a mix of Halo, black ops (zombie;deathmatch) and a little bit of Nosgoth. if you are hestitating to buy it, its like someone offers you a diamond for 1$: just take it. its not worth the money, this game is worth even more!!!! ps: if you realyy dont like it you can still refund it.  its the bestgame
3319	1	a	(Me): Goes with the recon class becasue of it's stealth ability on survival to repair the generator. (Friends): Goes every class apart from recon. Generator goes down, i stealth past all the dinos and repair it, stealth runs out.........get mauled by dinosaurs.....dies.......generator goes down again.......loses survival.........11/10 would go recon again.
3321	1	a	It has its problems,.. You can't grumble at £0.79... Good banter.... 11/10 would get eaten by a T-Rex again.
3323	1	a	Fantastic! I play this more than most games in my library.
3325	1	a	Really good game, worth playing co-op with friends, steam puts up the server for you so no need to use your own local network. Really funm, good graphics and on and on, recommended (:
3327	1	a	I have played this for a few hours and I am willing to say that I want to play more.  For this picetag, it was way more fun then I expected.  Don't get me wrong, there is still a lot of work to be done on this game, but you can not beat the 1 euro price tag.  PROS: -Tons of people online. -It's a game about shooting dinosaurs. -Vehicles are very cool. -Controls are intuitive and easy to understand. This is one of those games that doesn't need a tutorial. -1 euro. Cheap enough to try out without feeling ripped off if you don't like it.  CONS: -Menus feel unfinished / buggy. -Vehicles are incredibly overpowered. Especially the flying ones, as dinosaurs have little to no anti-air. -Not enough feedback to see if you hit or not, you notice this especially when you play as the dinosaurs. -Weapons could need more 'umph'.  I would not recommend you buy this at full price, but with a discount you can't go wrong with Dino Horde.
3329	1	a	It cured my cancer
3331	1	a	Orion Prelude is a FPS shooter with both online and singleplayer. There is no story just pure action. So if you are sick and tired of zombies? Want to hunt dionsaurs? This is the game for you.   Slaughter  mode is a survival mode with no base generator to protect. For every 25 kills you get a reward to unlock further weapons to help you killing further dinos. There is no shop in this mode. There is a leaderboard to compare your results. You will as in all gamemode in this game level up your characters to unlock perks, weapons, cosmetic skins and more.  My personal favourite is  Survival  mode wich is a bit different. You have to protect your base generator from being destroyed. Dinosaurs will come in waves and for each kill you will earn money that you can use to buy weapons, perks that will make your life alot easier. Each wave gets harder and harder with bigger dinos attacking. You will also unlock objectives that will give you veichles.  This game includes so many gamemodes and maps that probarly any player will find their personal favourite. The game is quite grindy. It will take alot of hours to unlock character levels.  If you have some friends to play with, this game can be really fun for a game on weekends. So grab a few copies to them as well. Note that you will still level up when playing singleplayer modes. Big plus for that!...    Some thoughts for the devs:     I wish you did what others do and make it more rewarding to play for each turn. I know this is no Call of Duty but rewarding on screen and with unlockables will encourage more gametime.   Please make it more rewarding.    A cosmetic rewards page showing badges what you have unlcoked. I prefer badges/medals instead of just statistics page as it will encourage me to continue playing further to unlock further badges.   Look on competive games why they keep getting players comming back.     End words:    Still I have loads of fun in the new Prelude version. And frankly i have been playing more alone than online. Its a game i can play in short bursts or longer with friends. I keep comming back but as said some thing to reward us would defo benefit this game alot. Adding some human bots to the TDM or FFA maps to kill would defo keep me comming back even more. Sometimes you just wanna kill something else than a dino. ;)    Review Score:     GFx 8,5 SFx 6,5  (Music gets repeative after a while, some more tracks wouldnt hurt)  Gameplay 8-10   I have played both the old and new version and i must say it has grown into me. Prelude is alot better in any aspect. GFx is nice, SFx is spot on, Gameplay is easy and fun. I will gladly recommend it.  BUY IT!.. 
3333	1	a	It boots up :)
3335	1	a	Good with friends but needs more depth.
3337	1	a	Addictive gameplay!!!!!!!!!!!
3339	1	a	The best game you can get for only 1€.
3341	1	a	Great game but I think the devs could have just kept on improving this game (like optimization) instead of making a new sequel. However, I got to hand it to them for making such an impressive comeback of this game. Especially fun with friends.
3343	1	a	I think it's a fun game. Most of the problems with this were upon release and not long after but now it seems there is not much wrong with it. I've played 12hrs so far and recommend this for people who's ears tingle at the idea of using jet-packs whilst killing dinosaurs or stomping 'round nomming on humans as a dinosaur.  The early reviews of this are now oudated as this has gone through a few years of updates and adding content. I feel that people should re-consider their bad reviews at it's release. I see this as a cheaper alternative of primal carnage (and could be cheaper). It's generally a fun game but people just seem to over-anylize and focus on the bad which is a terrible shame. I hope to see more games like this (without the controversy would be nice).
953	0	a	This game İs not fun it looks fun but its not you just cant do anything fun. The dinos are pretty crappy and the classes are not interesting. I would have never bought this game if it wasnt on a steam sale.
3345	1	a	Really good for the price. And it has dinosaurs.
3347	1	a	I bought this game when it first came out and everyone hated it. I've always like it but that being said I've always enjoyed wave survival games. I think for a dollar this game is a steal for a dollar and definitely worth a play with a couple friends. I bouth it for twenty way back then and I've definitely got my money's worth out of it. Great developer too, they've been updating and refining it for years since release at no cost.
3349	1	a	BEST Game.
3351	1	a	It's rough. It's buggy. It runs like crap. The resolution is grainy, the music is repetitive, an you always, ALWAYS lose connection at the most horrible times. But you know what? It's only ONE freaking dollar. And for that one dollar, you will get some of the rootinest, tootinest, dino-blasting fun ever seen in a video game.  There are only a handful of different game modes, most of which I honestly haven't tried. The tiny bit I've experienced of the PVP was terrible. Unfun, frustrating, and faaaaaar outclassed by pretty much every other multiplayer FPS ever made. But really, who plays this game for the PVP? It's all about those dinos, mayn. And wow, are the dinos fun.  The two game modes I play the most often, Conquest and Survival, pit you and of team of up to 5 other players/bots as you fight to defend your power generator from hordes of ravenous prehistoric monstrosities. There's no story. There's no explanation for why the herbivores and carnivores are working together and not eating each other. But, honestly, this game doesn't NEED a story. Just don't think too hard and shoot dinos. It's awesome.   The gunplay is quite smooth and incredibly satisfying. Blast a raptor's head with a shotgun and it freakin' EXPLODES, splattering bits of brain all over your stylish uniform. Drive a tank up to a T-rex's butt and fire a super-high powered explosive round directly into its crotch, obliterating it mere moments before it's about to devour your teammate. So awesome!   The best parts of this game are the moments you experience while playing, these little things that stick with you long after you turn off your computer. That time I leaped out of my helicopter to revive my fallen teammate, getting him to his feet and out of the way of a Spinosaurus before flying away and unleashing a barrage of missiles into its side. That time I used my flamethrower to keep an entire swarm of raptors away from the generator while my team respawned. That time I cleared an entire group of dinos using only a knife. It's these things that make you feel like an unstoppable lizard-slayin' hero.  TL;DR, this game has a lot of issues, but it's only one dollar and you could easily get at least 20 hours out of it at the minimum. Really, really good fun.  8/10    As a unrepentant dinosaur nerd, there are a few things I have problems with in this game's portrayal of its prehistoric creatures. First of all, they put two pterosaurs into the game, a rhamphorhynchus and a pteranodon. They called the rhamphorhynchus a rhamphorhyncus (which I have much respect for), but then they went and called the pteranodon a pterodactyl? What?? They also refer to them as dinosaurs, which they are not, they're actually flying reptiles that are barely related to dinosaurs. It also refers to a Deinosuchus as a dinosaur, and, well, its not a dino, just a big crocodile.  Its portrayal of the Dilophosaurus is more accurate than most other peoples, but the thing still spits acid. Guys. There is absolutely zero eveidence that in real life these things spit acid. STOP MAKING THEM SPIT ACID!  And that's it. Great game. Good game. Go play, now. Trust me, it's worth all 99 of the pennies you pay for it. 
3353	1	a	I liked the christmas special.
3355	1	a	Awesome Co-Op game. Don't rely on Metacritic only. The game rocks!
954	0	a	lags whit intel celeron 6/10
3357	1	a	probably the worst game that I have ever played  i give it an 11/10
3359	1	a	Good game with amazing graphics, i usually come back to this game a lot, really recommend because cheap. the bugs tho 8/10
3361	1	a	Orion is a fun fps vs dinosaurs game. It's like halo meets jurassic park! With multiple play modes, lots of levels, perks, guns, 3 classes to choose from and a good community its always my go to game when I'm not sure what to play.  pros -take on dinos or even play as dinos -lots of game modes -good community -lots of maps -really fun game  cons -could use some more dinos, endless raptor waves get dull -more classes would be cool -some game modes feel repetitive
3363	1	a	Good for approximately 3 hours of fun before getting tired of killing the same few dinosaurs over and over again. 10/10.
3365	1	a	this game is soo buggy it should be free to play
3367	1	a	Its essentiallly just like Call out duty Zombies but with dinosaurs. There are upgrades and the ability to buy guns but unfortunately onlt between waves. Its worth it when you see it on sale and is fun with a group of friends!
3369	1	a	Driving a buggy with a friend off a cliff and into a horde of Raptors, T-rex and Triceratop. The buggy flipped over and we both died. Best 50 cents ever spent!  10/10 would drive without license again.
3371	1	a	Finally added 32bit support &amp; fixed a lot of game breaking bugs; but all a little too late. There seems to be no one playing, empty servers all around; although still a great game to play a couple of hours with friends on the weekends. =)
3373	1	a	i played this all the time before CSGO and it was the bomb 
3375	1	a	RECOMMEND BY ALOT This Is A Good Game For $0.99 9/10
3377	1	a	This is a epic multiplayer first person shooter and i love to play this with my friends 
3379	1	a	Joined a game, bought a good ol 6 shooter, killed some dinos, got muched to death by tiny ones, figured out the melee attack button, bought a shotgun, took down a stegosaurus, ran out of ammo, bought an ammo refill gun, got owned by a t-rex, bought an LMG, upgraded everything, won the fight, back to step 1. 10/10!
3381	1	a	I liked it even if others don't!
3383	1	a	Its a good game just try it!
3385	1	a	THIS IS THE ♥♥♥♥♥EST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAY, UNINSTALLED AFTER 8 MINUTES OF PLAY WASTE OF 99c, NEVER BUY THIS AS LONG AS YOU LIVE!!!!!!! 'BUT ♥♥♥♥, IT WAS 99C.......' MACKLEMORE 2012
3387	1	a	I loved the game! It is so much fun, I'm a newbie though and there was a person that insulted me. I'm a girl and I'm sensitive but that always happens when you play with anyone randomly. Anyways, had lots of fun !! :D I totally recommend it to others! Can't wait to play as a dinosaur the little ones are cute xD
3389	1	a	Jurassic Park meets Starship Troopers, WITH elevator music; what more can a man ask for? Oh, did I forget to mention, I am the only person playing this game on planet Earth.
3391	1	a	This game is AWESOME! never experienced any bugs or any glitches, the game runs so smoothly.
3393	1	a	M8 this game, whew it really blew my expectations. I was ROARING to play another round. Though the textures are a little... PRIMATIVE
3395	1	a	I'd buy that for a dollar.
3397	1	a	Good game for when you want to kill an hour... or 100... I'm HOOKED... Ah well, at least this addiction only costed me 49 cents....lol
3399	1	a	this games price is 1€ and its even going into a sale.... its not worth 1€.  Its worth 10 € So theres nothing to complain about a good game for only 1 ♥♥♥♥ing euro so just grab it and ignore the negative reviews. It has many modes from PvP (Dinos vs Humans; Humans vs Humans) to PvE (Survival). It has even vehicles like tanks, cars, hover-bikes and even Aircrafts. You can choose between diffrent classes with diffrent abilities, buy weapons, buy perks (even perks that allows you to buy other class weapons) There are diffrent types of Dino's, Bosse's.  It's definitly not the best dinosaure game you can get... but its definitly a game you shouldnt miss and its worth more then the price ure paying for this.
3401	1	a	Can't go wrong only 59 cents for 4 copies!!!!!! Totally worth it graphics are pretty good for an indie game, lots and lots of fun, coop is good (big community,not laggy and supports 5 players), third person or first person, huge levels and well designed game! 9/10
3403	1	a	Shooting T-rexes is fun. letting yar anger flow on thouse poor dinasours. TL;DR: -Pew Pew works -Hillerious bugs -Dead Multiplayer.  this game is buckets of fun, and if your going for 'Value for money' then this 0.99$ will surely provide its worth but a word of warning tho, if u expect to install this game and jump into a multiplayer with abunch of random people then dont, the multiplayer is dead at best, bring your own friend (Hey, its only 0.99 and it will provide hours of entertaiment)
3405	1	a	Fighting dinasaurs with a lightsabre in a halo suit with ♥♥♥♥ animations, 10/10 ign would never play again
3407	1	a	I'D BUY THAT FOR A DOLLAR.
3409	1	a	I bought this game just to see what is was and now this game is just great i had some fun but i ragged sometimes when i get killed by a t-rex so i recommend this game to anyone who likes fps dino shooting game.
3411	1	a	This game cured my naked molrat from ebola! It's amazing!
3413	1	a	friend drives into a horde of dinosaurs: - --Double kill ---Triple kill ----Mega kill -----Ultra kill ------Armageddon -------Bring me some pizza
3415	1	a	For the price 10/10 Gameplay 9/10 Sound 8/10 Overall i give this game 9.5/10  Fun to Play!
3417	1	a	I shot the dinasour. Ran out of bullets. Dinasour see me. I out of bullets. Teammates out of bullets. I die gg 4/10 reccomend would buy twicw
3419	1	a	MLG aproooved ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
3421	1	a	I swear I thought my friends were messing with me when they told me to buy this game, but I never regret the moment when I bought this. Since I was so forced to get this game, I needed it ASAP. I couldn't sell any skins on the market because I met my max, so I gave the skin to my friend and he gifted me the game because he could sell it. He then continued to give me a note with the gift. So poetic that I first thought he copied and pasted it off a Shakespeare sonnet. The message read:   Dear Zaque,  Please kill yourself, drink bleach, overdose, etc.   XOXOXO  -♥♥♥♥♥♥    This stunned me because he has never written something so poetic in our english classes. I then downloaded the game after multiple thoughts of suicide and right when I opened the game, I knew I made a great decision. Orion Prelude was written next to multiple dinosaurs of all shapes and sizes that I wish I knew wtf they were. Should've payed more attention in the third grade. I then changed all the settings to be fully optimized to run on the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of the PC I have. I was then invited by my friends and a few other ♥♥♥♥♥ to play some co-op. I joined the game and a stegosaurus had one of its multiple stages of her menstual cycle on me. I had no clue what to do, I was lost, just like in real life, So I knew I was screwed. I instantly panicked and I ended up getting puked on by a so called 'Spitter'. This motha♥♥♥♥a's puke looked like it drank 3 gallons of AMP before this battle. Puked like it just had its night out on Las Dino. I learned some of the mechanics of the game, and got the hang of it, but I pressed one button that ruined my dignity, V. I pressed V and I was introduced by a melee that looked like my guy was a 9 year old child trying to kill a butterfly. You're telling me they are trained to fight dinosaurs and robot santas, but yet swing like Ronda Rousey. Jesus H christ. Besides the hideous so called 'melee' animation was horrific, there wasn't too much else. Other than me getting stuck in a rock for 10 hours while my buddies kicked some prehistoric ♥♥♥. I got stuck in a rock because a wolf gave me a bruce lee kick to the back and sent me off a mountain into a pile of rocks. Also of course, I was a support or medic so I couldn't jetpack myself out. I sat there for a good hour taking a roast session. My friends called me a poon and said I should kill myself. BUT, this game is actually very nice for the money. This game passes time easily and is super addicting with friends. Graphics are very similar to Borderlands, and I like it.
3423	1	a	Played for 5 minutes. Drove into a t-rex. Flew 70 feet into the air and into my doom. 10/10 would fly again.
3425	1	a	you can kill a dinosaur with a lightsaber 10000000000000000000000/10 Prehistoric Reviews
3427	1	a	ORION: Prelue manages to take the best parts of some of the greatest games of all time. From the overall aesthetic of Halo, to the scale and sense of wonder of Shadow of the Colossus. O:P takes these, and mixes them with the surreal pleasure of shooting DINOSAURS. ORION: Prelude is, simply put, the greatest game of all time, and the fact that it is only $1 means it is accessible to the general population. If you don't own this game, you owe it to yourself, your fellow man, and even the concept of artwork in general to play this game.
3429	1	a	Best Gmae ever full on legit graphics and stuff also the dino's ai is very good i suppose and the gema is not ever boring and the game is very very very unlike halo and or destiny. i can currently also say that austin is a poo head and such. that is all.
3431	1	a	funny game to play with friends 
3433	1	a	Put that Coke down and pick this up!
3435	1	a	Me: 'Might as well buy it for the price'  1 HOUR LATER  Me: 'Okay so up to now i've killed loads of dinosaurs in mech suits and NOW im playing a christmas map shooting Santa as he holds a minigun'   11/10
3437	1	a	Awesome game with a 90's feel.

3441	1	a	this game is actually really ♥♥♥♥ing fun
3443	1	a	This game is cheaper than EA's marketing tactics 10/10 would buy again !
3445	1	a	Take Halo and combine that with zombies from cod and replace the the zombies with dinosaurs and u get the best game ever
3447	1	a	I was in a jeep with a buddy and we tried to run into a stegasaurus. The stegasourus sent me and my buddy 300 meters into the air and i flew past my buddy in a VTOL Helicopter. 10/10 would try to run over stegasaurus again. (Seriously though this game is amazing like holy crap)
3449	1	a	Orion: Prelude provides at least $0.74 worth of entertainment.
3451	1	a	If you like shooting BIG ♥♥♥ dinosaurs in the MOTHER♥♥♥♥ING face with BIG ♥♥♥ guns FOR ONE DOLLAR then this game is for YOU. 'In 2012 we released one of the worst games of all time.' the devs are rad af too. get this game.
3453	1	a	Buy this game, it's a dollar. What more do you have to lose? Unless you're homeless... wait how'd you get a computer?
3455	1	a	Halo mixed with Jurrasic Park. Thats all i have to say.
3457	1	a	Killed Raptors Punched a t-rex in the face Attempted riding a triceratops Nearly breaking my 'v' key clearing waves of raptors Crashing helicopters into dinosaurs Having a lightsaber battle with a gaint crocodile AND MUCH MORE! All for 99 cents...
3459	1	a	This game is way to fun to be $1.
3461	1	a	I cant even explain this game... ITS THAT GOOD!!!
3463	1	a	Killed a T-Rex with an over powered knife, while jumping over it. 10/10 would stab again.  
3465	1	a	Not gonna lie. I bought this game entirely because of the trailer music and because the the developer honesty. Was it worth it? 0.99€ for a game that fits perfectly for those who enjoy fps survival games. 10/10 would buy again.
3467	1	a	LOVE IT :D best game of 2015  dinos skins hats gunz jetpacks everything i dreamed of is in here 'just not world of warcraft'
3469	1	a	this game is so good it makes my nipples          happy
3471	1	a	REALLY Fun game 10/10 from here
955	0	a	It;s and alright game, however I wouldn't recomend wasting your moeny on it, it's not a game that is worth moeny, also it crashes whenever you move on to a new map after finishing a mission.
3473	1	a	Defenitely worth 1$. Imagine Halo and Jurassic Park mashed together and you get ORION: Prelude.  Pros: -Awesome gameplay -Only 1$!!?? -It has dinos and guns Cons: Needs a GOOD computer to run properly
3475	1	a	This game. Oh this game. It might be silly or bad looking but to tell you the truth if you and a few frinds want a game to play i would recomend this because its fun.
956	0	a	This was so bad, it made my balls hurt..
3477	1	a	Got in multiplayer game for the first time. Saw a pterodactyl flying sideways. Decided to shoot it. Pterodactyl kept on flying even after death. Flew off map.       10/10 would shoot a haunted pterodactyl again.
3479	1	a	♥♥♥♥ Nuggets with a ♥♥♥♥-Cola an a Mc♥♥♥♥♥! :)
3481	1	a	Its fun; a little dated nowdays but still fun.
3483	1	a	Absolutely love this game! Even though I haven't played it as much as other people but the gameplay is awesome, graphics aren't complete ♥♥♥♥ but the ambience of the game is just amazing. The music, don't even get me started on the music. The music on this game is brilliant and is just so catchy. As some people would say, 'Damn yo. This mixtape is fire' 10/10 -IGN  
3485	1	a	Hilarious Co-Op shooter , with dinosaurs, shotguns, bows and bugs (THE BUGS!) Cheaper then a can of coke? i dont even like Coke, so i chose this instead, and didnt regret it. However no matter what spec your pc/laptop is prepare for some bad fps at a few times, but it is 50p so who cares?
3487	1	a	dinos spitting green ♥♥♥♥ and giving electric shock with their teeth  would do LSD again 7/10
3489	1	a	-T-REX does flips -Best Graphics I have ever seen Fun for the whole family! 11/10 IGN 
3491	1	a	What i did, Buy this game say to myself dinosaurs interesting, creates survival lobby on easy on solo...........  INSANITY DINOSAURS EVERYWHERE me on the other hand Jetpack Master Rpg master Flying through the air killing dinos and prelude bots alike having the old grandest of times... until i took a list of boss dinos to the knee and they killed me dead, i could fight to survive and round 10 is where i lie here today 
3493	1	a	Jumped off of a rock on top of a Stegosaurus and stabbed it to death with a laser knife  10/10
3495	1	a	Best part of the game:  'Bring me some pizza.' - announcer  10/10 would pepperoni again, all for 99 cents
3497	1	a	'The only thing worse than a zombie running at you, is a zombie on fire running at you'. This is not the case with dinosaurs, especially when you wield a flamethrower with infinite ammo, and you have a T-Rex running straight at you. Slow roasted goodness.
3499	1	a	first two game... got ♥♥♥♥♥ by T-Rex and his little arms :D  very fun and fast pace
3501	1	a	1 dollar game,.... most entertainment Ive had for a buck, thank you
3503	1	a	THIS IS THE BETA VERSION OF FAR CRY PRIMAL !!1!!!1!!111!!
3505	1	a	Very Nice Game :D
3507	1	a	Hi Billy Mays here!  Well what can I say about this piece of art. it's like Planetsides classes and vehicles made a baby with Killing Floors fight 10 waves of baddies.   But wait there is more! Dinosaurs, that throw rocks at ya! Jetpacks! And also loads of weapons to pew pew the *beep* out of dinos!  Billy Mays approved!
3509	1	a	it's a fun game and it's even more fun with friends     (TIP Play with a friend)
3511	1	a	The game looks beautiful. There is a good selection of weapons and a huge open world to explore online, plus the game is incredibly cheap! The dinosaur animations could use some work but this is still a very good wave based game. Also, the game can be played offline in singleplayer, which is good because I don't really like online-only games. All of this for 0.49p on sale?

3513	1	a	It's so bad, so awful, so tremendously terrible, that each and every time that I try to Steam crashes   No lie...  Plz halp  10/10
3515	1	a	There are multiple reasons why this game is only a dollar, but damn it  it's only a dollar
3517	1	a	9/10  bought it for the slomo
3519	1	a	This game ruined two of my best friendships. 10/10 best $ .74 I've ever spent.
3521	1	a	You can run small dinosaurs over with a car.
3523	1	a	This game has potential. WIth some major graphical updates, bug fixes, improvements to gamemodes, and a larger player base, this game could be really good. But because it has none of those things, I give the game a solid 7.5/10. It is kind of hard to criticize the game too badly, though, because of how cheap it is.
3525	1	a	The game is amazing and sure repeated swarms of the same thing seems boring,but keep in-mind that the game is still in development and will change often.
3527	1	a	Is quite fun. Sort of like TF2 (upgrade stations, classes, etc) but with Dinosaurs and vehicles.  The Metacritic score is incorrect, it is for the first (and terrible) version of the game. The updated game that you would purchace now is much better, is probably a 70 or 80.  Graphics are good, it isn't the best use of Unreal Engine I have seen, but it isn't the worst. Be prepared for this game to have performance issues on lower (embedded) graphics.  I tend to stay away from the Player v Player game modes, as the co-op 'kill all the dinosaurs' is much more fun.   Its good to see the developers paying attention to the game, and to get the 'Prelude' upgrade and other DLC for free. Worth buying in the Summer Sale.
3529	1	a	Apart from some issues here and there, the game is great and fun and very cheap.
3531	1	a	Cheap, unfinished and sometimes buggy as all hell but even with these downsides it just feels like playing a B movie that's soo bad it somehow becomes really good and this game does have some damn good moments.
3533	1	a	Heavy Game , Need High Spec for play this game . cheap game but great , and need faster inet :(
3535	1	a	this game is awesome!!  #ihatethisgame
3537	1	a	This is the most fun Ive had since kicking my litte brother around a co op HALO map. This game has certainly taken the spotlight in my gaming time.  10/10 Would shoot dinosaurs again
3539	1	a	this game stopped me from cutting 10\10 
3541	1	a	i bought it for 99 cents now its on sale for 49 cents i feel ripped off     just kidding get this game! ITS WELL WORTH IT
3543	1	a	I got chased by a T-rex 10 times bigger than me. 10/10 would wet my pants again.
3545	1	a	FIVE DINOSAURS KILLOSAUR BRING ME A PIZZA  Fun times for good price.
3547	1	a	I had a splendid time playing this with my pals and with random people. It's definitely worth the 99 cents.
3549	1	a	WOW THIS GAME IS SO SIQ. GETS ME REAL HORNY. OH THE DINASOURS ARE REALLY REALISTIC AND IT IS SO MUCH FUN. IM NOT BEING FORCED AT GUNPOINT TO WRITE THIS, I SWEAR. THE GUNPLAY IS NEX GEN. THE QUICKSCOPING IS ♥♥♥♥ING 1337. BUY THIS MOTHER ♥♥♥♥ER RIGHT NOW.
3551	1	a	I bought this for the story
3553	1	a	You could buy a soda or you could buy this funky combination of every multiplayer shooter of the last decade and dinosaurs. Blaze or slash away in more game modes than that Atari 2600 cartridge you found at a flea market for the EXACT SAME PRICE in 1987.  At the current list price - $0.99 in April of 2015 - there's just no reason not to own this game. Unless you REALLY want that soda.
3555	1	a	Its an ok game but it was an awesome buy because it was 0.99c 0.99c??????? damn dat is cheap and also if you want fun outof this game make sure atleast 2 other friends own it too  because almost everything is more fun with friends.
3557	1	a	Despite what many people have said, this is an incredibly fun game, especially to play with friends. Albeit, it isn't a huge AAA $60, and it wouldn't be worth too much money. But this is honestly one of the best gaming experiences ive had with my friends playing games. With up to 5 people in a game, and games that can last from 20 minutes to 3 hours, it is truly a fun and unqiue experience.  Try riding on the helicopter wings with a sniper while someone else drives. 10/10
3559	1	a	Good game, Its cheap but very good, you gotta learn somee things but it is very interesting
3561	1	a	So, just think of it like this. Christmas morning you open up a present to reveal it's BO2, so you excitedly pop it in your PS3. However, while it's disapointing, it's basically the zombie mode with CS-GO and Halo elements. Oh, and dinosaurs. While the graphics look pretty descent, it's doesn't feel like a complete game. There is no story mode to speak of, and too many stages are one of two things. A.) An uninspired rocky jungle level or B.) IT'S TOO DARK TO SEE ANYTHING WHERE AM I GOING level. There are a few mechanics that can be annoying as well. For example, a boss dinosaur can spawn at random depending on the round. But that's not to say how many and what type. What's worse is you have to track it down, and at night, where you can barely see anything, this is going to be a problem. And the icing on the cake no one wanted is the fact they can spawn even more dinosaurs! So if you can't kill it and it turns to night, you have to wait 'till it's morning, hope to God you got a good team, or get killed! Besides that everything is generic. Wow, cool robo-suits guys, it's not like I've seen them everywhere! A couple of stages are a nightmare to win too. Hell itself is a map, and you must fight the pumpkin king! And while this is a nice switch up from the norm, EVERYTHING IS ALWAYS BLACK AND RED DOWN THERE. I FEEL LIKE I'M DROWNING IN SOME SUMMERTIME SADNESS. But teaming up with your buddies is a blast, and for only 99 cents this game is a blast. So, overall Orion is a blast for it's price, but don't expect a masterpiece.  Pros: A blast with friends +  A bargain for 99 cents +  Decent Graphics +  A couple of really fun guns and items. +  A good amount of levels.. +  Cons: ..But a lot of them feel the same. -  Nightime is the absolute worst in this game. -  The Boss dino respawn BS. -  Generic Design. -  FINAL VERDICT: 7/10 RECOMMEND: YES.   
3563	1	a	Hi. I'm going to review my thoughts on this game.  Overall thoughts: This game is epic overall. It really sells the picture of a game you can enjoy. It's like buying a can of coffee, only this game keeps you awake for much longer. I wouldn't say this is like the greatest game ever, God knows this game is far from perfect. But this is the kind of game that makes you want to get ready to whatever you have to do later, like studying for a test, for example.  Review: [ Note: Not just my opinion. Also using a critical standpoint right now. ]  Pros:  1: It's free to play. 2: It keeps you awake, more than just coffee. 3: It takes you to a place you've never been before. 4: It has some really good customizable ♥♥♥♥ in the main menu.  Cons:  1: The game is full of glitches. 2: No one really plays it anymore.  Ratings and final review: I would say this game is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing good. I reccomend it to ANYONE. It is far from perfect, but that doesn't make it a bad game. Nothing is perfect. And that's part of the fun, right?  My personal rating: 8.2/10.
3565	1	a	I absolutely recomend this game. It's a ton of fun, nice gameplay and mechanics. Briliant
3567	1	a	Most fun i had in a long time, Thnx Spiral
3569	1	a	Dinosaurs and Lightsabers. $1. I have no regrets.  11.5/10
3571	1	a	Metacritic score is misleading  this game is totally JURASSIC
3573	1	a	I beat the heck out of a raptor with my elbow, blasted the crap out of a T-rex with a tank, and used a bow and arrow to kill a giant alligator. Best game evur 11/10
3575	1	a	Best idea for a game ever dinosaurs and jetpacks am I right?
3577	1	a	There are flying dinosuares.. i love it.. so much. yeah..
3579	1	a	All it's missing is the brute shot.
3581	1	a	Wouldn't pay £12 but have had days of fun on Orion after purchasing it on the £1 deal. If it comes on sale again jump on it because ♥♥♥♥ where else can you shoot dinosaurs in the face with a shotgun and jetpack off into the sunset?
3583	1	a	BUT ♥♥♥♥ IT WAS 99 CENT!!!
3585	1	a	Fight a spitter from Jurassic Park with a Warthog from Halo.
3587	1	a	The only thing this game is missing is a random weapon generator!
3589	1	a	A friend of mine said that the rocks in this game didn't actually look that bad.  He was right, they're pretty good.
3591	1	a	GREAT game fun with friends! :)) dont listen to the year old reviews, its really changed for the better :)!
3593	1	a	Okay, this game has been getting tons of negative feedback, but I don't see what's wrong with it. The previous games were pretty bad because they were filled to the brim with bugs. this game, not so much. It was a bit unprofessionally done, but you have to expect that from this level of a dev team. Obviously, the game didn't and also wasn't meant to have much depth, or a storyline, it was just meant to be fun. I mean, come on, its about killing dinosaurs. The game has a HUGE amount of content for a dollar right now, as well. I never ran into any bugs, there were alot of cool weapons and vehicles, and tons of content. The game ran and looked pretty good, and the controls are exactly as one would expect. Again, its biggest feature is that its simply alot of fun and there is alot to see, but not for you if you want a game with alot of depth. Its incredibly under-rated and the metascore is broken, would reccommend.
3595	1	a	Man, this game is pure fun, plain and simple.
3597	1	a	So much fun, so worth it, 5 man co-op is the best. Buy now
3599	1	a	certainly a lot better than the reviews give it credit for, still rough around the edges though.  in terms of fun, the more the merrier. multiplayer is pretty sweet
3601	1	a	First of all I have to say.... I love this game! Not just for the dinosaurs(which honestly was the main thing that pulled me toward it), but for.... well, all of it! Apart from a few glitches and bugs here and there, it's not that bad. There's lovely areas for you to explore as you fight off the hordes of dinos, with nice music to help with immersion. Also, I really like the credit system that allows you to buy character upgrades, weapons, items and more. It's also fairly easy to pick up and play as it didn't take me long before I was doing well(and I usually take quite a while to pick up stuff in games X3).  So if you can ignore the small amount of glitches and such, and you love dinos and/or FPSs, then I reccommend this to be added to your library.
3603	1	a	This game is ♥♥♥♥.
3605	1	a	Picked the game up for $0.99 - can't go wrong there. I usually play the survival mode. It's like a wave mode with the occasional objective. Its a fun casual game.  My one gripe - the lobby hosts sometimes dont pay attention and dont start the game up. Just try a few lobbies or start your own, people will come.
3607	1	a	Really buggy and lacks a lot of things. BUT IT IS SO DAMN FUN TO PLAY!
3609	1	a	I really don't understand why the game has such a low rating, it's super fun! Playing with friends is fun and I would recommend it to anyone looking to have some casual fun
3611	1	a	DINOS AND MECHS AND GUNS! Whats there not to love about this game.
3613	1	a	Unreal Engine vehicles/10
3615	1	a	i have it and its fun but a few problems are the ocasinal glichyness andhow annoying compys are also needs a back story but overall its fun with lots of guns explosions and killing
3617	1	a	I don't agree with metascore.. You can play as DINO! And you can beat T-Rex in MECH! Oh god
3619	1	a	It is great fun with Friends!
3621	1	a	WARNING ! DINO-HAZARD DETECTED ! GRAB YOUR GEAR AND BE EATEN !  Awesome, Co-op actions !
3623	1	a	This game, Name one other game where a FU@#$ING t-rex throws rocks with it's mouth while you shoot at it! Turok has nothing on this ♥♥♥♥. Fully recomend.
3625	1	a	Don't let the metascore fool you. It may not be a very well-known game but I absolutely love this game for its bare qualities. A shooter that mixes marines, futuristic guns with dinosaurs? Jetpacks, medi-guns, stealthing, and ♥♥♥♥♥in' weapons? Not to mention some pretty fun vehicles. I got this game for a dollar on the Steam sale. I would happily had paid the full 15 dollars since I have over 30 hours so far on this game.  Great to play solo, with strangers, and DEFINITELY with friends! Create your own lobby easily and play with friends. If only I had friends.  Each game you earn credits for kills and you spend said credits on weapons and perks for the current game. You also earn experience as you play with the classes and you earn passive perks (and can even unlock weapons to start out with instead of just a boring pistol) or unlock perks that you normally would buy. Saves you some credits.  More people need to buy this game and give Orion a GOOD name. I know Orion: Dino Beatdown had a sullied name for what the developers did and the bad metascore, but since its release it has been updated lots and is now a very fun game! And in NO WAY are any of the additional fees required. If you WANT new armors or a new blade color, go ahead and spend 5 or 10 extra dollars. I spent an extra 10 and bought a new blade color, TWO new armor colors (applies to your weapon too) AND a taunt pack for only 5 dollars.
3627	1	a	Good game, and the developer still updating the game. it's fun, awesome plane, tanks, and robot. Kill the T-rex
3629	1	a	Really ♥♥♥♥.
3631	1	a	Fun game to play with friends more than it is to play alone. A little hard to get used to at first but gameplay isn't too bad. Obviously with any game there are downsides, and this has very few. Get it if you like playing online shooters with friends.
3633	1	a	Awesome Game! And totally underrated.   Spiral Studios care about consumers, free dlcs, regular updates.  Dinos are way better then zombies.  If you can, Buy it!
3635	1	a	The metascore is very misleading. Words cannot describe the fun I have had with this, I was very surprised with how good the game is.
3637	1	a	this game is funking terrible but fun
3639	1	a	Hello, I am a T-Rex. I will throw ♥♥♥♥ing boulders at your unsuspecting face. Come to play with me so you can rage. You can level up your character and shoot all my tasty friends. Bring all your tasty friends too so we have full course meal. Don't use metal friends or flying bags or ninja skills to fight me. Just run a-way and shoot. Or I will take giant Dino™ dumps in front of spawn. GG tasty n00bs.
3641	1	a	not even worth the time to instal.... no wait not even worth the time to click on to see what the game is on steam.... wait wait hold on... not even worth the time to read the name. thats how bad this was. dont get jiped into this game. majority of reviews are bad and all the things said in the promo video up top is complete BS made up by them.
3643	1	a	Awesome game. Could use some more feedback/news from the developer. What was that patch that just downloaded? What did it fix? What's new? What's coming? The 'news' section as it is kinda feels like BonziBuddy.
3645	1	a	I don't think it's very good but I have to admit IT'S FUN AND GLITCHY AS HELL 
3647	1	a	I only paid 99 cents for this and the graphics are pretty good..I kinda suck at killing dino's but I am having fun with this game :]
3649	1	a	This game makes me think of Halo but with dinosaurs. It is really fun and has a great community.
3651	1	a	In all honesty, I am incredibly hard to hook as far as video games are concerned. There are plenty of games that I will play once, but for me to enjoy any kind of longevity with a single title is rare indeed. I can say without a shadow of a doubt that this will be one of the few awesome games I end up spending a whole lot of awesome time with. Crazy awesome dino A.I., powerful weapons, an addictive counter-strikeesque upgrade system, 5 player co-op, vehicles crazier than anything you've seen in Halo. And that's just one game type! This is an awesome game for awesome people. Any one who can remember being a child watching jurassic park and having halo welcome you into adolescence will absolutely adore this game.
3653	1	a	Dinosaurs.. Not that bad!
3655	1	a	Yes, yes, yes, yes. Seriously it's $1. I dare you to have more fun for a dollar.
3657	1	a	This game is really worth getting it on sale, its only 1 euro/dollar ! The multiplayer has many game modes to select from. You can play versus dinosaurs or deathmatch with real people (wich i play most. It has nice graphics , and enjoyable gameplay . This game is pretty fun , one of the Best 1$ game on sale ! Really worth getting it !!
3659	1	a	This game is amazing. Combination of Halo and dinosaurs I think. Super fun worth your money
3661	1	a	Its not that bad.
3663	1	a	The most fun you will have with friends. This game provides exactly what I would want in a single package. The ability to fly around with a jetpack and rocket launcher and blow off a T-Rex's face. The 3 class system gives the game depth and variaty, and the level progression, although slow, is very rewarding.  Normal survival modes are good for 15-30min stints into the realm of Dino hord, but its the survival mode tundra maps that take the cake. 1-2 hour journys to defend outposts from incoming attacks, this is the mode where you will be pulling out the big guns. Loads of time to earn the big moneys, loads of time to fly around exploding face.  9/10 for pure fun. Recommended
3665	1	a	This is a very fun action game, it is similar to Black Ops Zombies, but with dinosoars. I definitely recommend it. :)
3667	1	a	BEST GAME EVER CANT WAIT FOR THE BIG UPDATE
3669	1	a	I highly recommend this game if you're into ♥♥♥♥ eating.
3671	1	a	its cool very hard in ways like the lag and such but yeah thumbs up 
3673	1	a	This game's PVP feature is extremely limited. However, I found the cooperation of the survival mode quite challenging and enjoyable for hours making it a worthwhile purchase. If you want a shooter that is unique while still familiar, this is definately worth trying.
3675	1	a	This is an awesome game lol, not everyday you can play an FPS game and shoot dinos! As for graphics, they are decent, reminds me of halo based layout. I bought the 4-pack on sale at 96% off for $3 lol it was worth it for sure to have 4 people play for just $3.   If you got friends who play and want to join in its worth the non sale price but if your alone might want to try and get some others to get it with you, much better with friends.
3677	1	a	I have lots of fun with this game. BUT it crashes when I do voice chat with some of my mates. But still great. 9.5 dead dinos! :D
3679	1	a	The only Dinosaur I'll be killing is my computer. Then I can hopefully run this game
3681	1	a	Killy de dino :)
3683	1	a	A free-roaming FPS with very good,enjoyable gameplay,multiple weapons/perks/vehicles,character customisation. Totally worth your money! Plus,you get to shoot AND play as a dinosaur!!  10/10
3685	1	a	such an amazing game! love it, best dino game ever. Right now in my 'Never delete' folder. Tundra map music is so beautiful  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U15YpjIMRjE) 
3687	1	a	This is probably the greatest, and most terrible game on Steam. But really its not a very good game. I would only recommend it for its 99 cent price tag and if you have friends to enjoy the terribleness together. Its bad, in the right way.
3689	1	a	Killing Dino's is fun :D
3691	1	a	I backed Dino Beatdown on Kickstarter...I guess this is a remake of that game. I was really disappointed with Dino Beatdown...but recently played Dino Horde with some friends and can honestly say I havent had that much fun playing a game with some friends in a long time. Sure it doesn't really have a story but who cares...survival mode for me it the most fun. But Hey its .99 so you can't beat the price...play it with a 2-3 friends and I promise you'll be hooked. I plan alot of Dayz which is a slow and patient type of game...so its nice to take a break from Dayz and play something crazy like this and just have fun.
3693	1	a	I love this game. Minor glitch where you can get stuck on top of rocks, but only happened a few times. This game will keep you up all night if you are playing with friends.
3695	1	a	Cool game..... Be open minded Jurrasic brothers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3697	1	a	Great graphics, lightsabers and dinos...
3699	1	a	spennt a long time just fighting off giant pink dinosaurs with a lightsaber and a friend in the snow 11/10 would reccomend
3701	1	a	Love It; Got A Demo And It Was Awesome
3703	1	a	Message me if you want this game I,ve got a gift key that I will give to you guys for a 5€ worth steam item or paysafecard or also a steam gift card
3705	1	a	Been playing this game for 8 hours now, i recommend this game to all killing floor fans. It is a never ending cycle of crazy dino shooting.  I admit the graphics quality of this game is not that good  but who cares about graphics? Real gamers judge a game by its gameplay.   If you are into survival and nonstop shooting of dinosaurs in all sizes (small/medium/large), then this game is for you. We have different preferences, for me this is a game worth buying.   Updated review as of August 17,2014. Game is still awesome as it was before, but i hope there would be more changes during the full release of prelude.   My present gameplay footage:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3rb-04O2qM 
3707	1	a	lemme start with ..puting my socks back on ..cuz this game knockd um rite the ♥♥♥ off....i know a dino game every one does one ..well they do but not like this at all this is like lost planet and halo had sex and out fell tis beautiful bay .....and i love it .ull love it too if u like anything thats close to cool cuz this shiz is top shelf and well worth the .99cents
3709	1	a	Hands down, best .99 Cent purchase ever. a little buggy, but easily forgiven for how great it is, Minus the fact it doesnt have Voice yet.
3711	1	a	Pretty fun, it reminds me of Sanctum and CoD: Zombies. With dinosaurs, of course.
3713	1	a	hit and run, but teamwork is better :)
3715	1	a	The metacritic score is lying to you.  Yes, I totally recommend this game, its a lt of fun with friends, and the funnythings that can happen when your being chased by large bypedal lizards makes for entertaining gameplay.  Great fun and a number of different maps and play styles.
3717	1	a	Dispite the bad reviews, I have heard about this game, I feel that this game is tons of dino fun.
3719	1	a	Its fun but theres alot of room to expand on this, maybe after a few addons or updates, i might get the game!
3721	1	a	The most fun you can have while killing dinosaurs. Very friendly community, challenging game modes, and addictive play. My favorite action co-op shooter by far.
3723	1	a	this game is fun i like the servivel mode 
3725	1	a	cool
3727	1	a	Its a good game just would be better if there was an option to turn off blood for the younger people like little brothers
3729	1	a	This game is awful, the server never work. I recommend you buy a hammer and beat your skull in instead of buying this ♥♥♥♥ ass game
3731	1	a	Great game, reminds me of Halo but with Dinos.
3733	1	a	I think that how the 'remade' the game in a way that it deserves a new rating for its metascore. This game is seriously improved.
3735	1	a	This game is poorly put together, somewhat unoptimized and pretty much looks like a game out of 2003... BUT I ♥♥♥♥ing love it, it is truely a turd of a game but it is a shiny turd. I really wouldn't be able to convince you to play this game if it was full price but when ever it goes on sale ever its so worth the pick up because I'm sure a few hours of mindless fun with friends isn't worth like $3 then what is?!  0/10 WOULD PLAY AGAIN
3737	1	a	It was good
3739	1	a	For £1 this is amazing! The game i have imagined creating as a kid is finaly a reality now i am an old man.  Tempted a few mates to get this in the £2.99 bundle, and everyone one is now loving it.  Does not deserve that low MetaScore! Co-op, Jet packs, Invis, turrets, tanks, mech and Dinos... what more could you ask for. Having alot of fun.  I would love to get in contact with the team though for some improvements. Animation has improved but could go further.  Optimisation is a given. I have a uber rig, and while it isnt taxing at full more than 30%, the system is running soo hot, even with water cooling. Even WatchDogs at max doesnt make it that hot.  Cant wait to see how improves in Aug 14 
3741	1	a	Constantly fought the urge to yell 'SHOOOOOOOOT 'ER'. Enjoyed blasting tiny Compys with a magnum. Screamed in pain as my best friend was eaten by a Spinosaurus in slow motion. Got on Steam Sale for ~$1.49. 9/10
3743	1	a	Surprisingly FUN!!! Great for Co-Op LAN
3745	1	a	In my opinion , in this game , we need to run very more. We have a huge map and the checkpoints can be to 2000 m , and when you don't find a vehicle you need to run , and this run can take more than 5 minutes ...  But it's a nice game.
3747	1	a	Well, this was quite a bit of fun. Imagine Turok meets Halo and you've pretty much got this game.  Fantastic! I would highly recommend getting this game while it's on sale. In fact, I'd probably even recommend it if it weren't on sale. Just play this game!
3749	1	a	The metascore isn't wrong, this game is a steaming bag of **** but for 1$ it's not terrible. 90% of the guns are useless due to crap dps and the dino's are idiots so there are some downsides. With that said if you have some friends that want to play a game where you kill dino's with purple guns then go nuts, it's the game for you! Oh and the controls are the worst thing possible!!!! Worth a buck, no more.
3751	1	a	ORION: Dino Horde -the game has bugs -the game is laggy -the graphics is not so good but they are okay +fun in singleplayer and multiplayer +fun with friends +good price  it gets a 6.5/10
3753	1	a	This game had a lot of problems when it launched and it still has quite a few such as a few things not being balanced correctly (versus mode, for example), there are a lot of things that not well explained by the game (like what you're supposed to be doing and how basic mechanics like teleporting back to base work) and a few sloppy or not well designed menus. However, all these things considered, it is not longer the laughably bad game that it once was before. I used to consider this game my greatest shame as a person who buys video games and the epitome of shallow, impulsive buying on Steam. Now, I consider this game to be a functional game that can be enjoyed with friends.
3755	1	a	Fun as ♥♥♥♥, ignore the metacritic ♥♥♥♥. If you like horde mode games, this is the ♥♥♥♥
3757	1	a	I've played 0.6 hours of this game. That is 0.6 hours too long. why do i get this gaem? i dunno. it no gud and i cant tell if it are a game.
3759	1	a	Very cheap and fun
3761	1	a	This game is hilariously fun with a group of friends. Playing on survival mode and blasting wave after wave of dinosaurs is pure gold. Ignore any older reviews (2012, 2013), they are for a different (and much crappier) version of this game. This new version is much improved, with a ton of game modes and weapon upgrades. The graphics and UI are still a bit rough around the edges, but the gameplay more than make up for it.
3763	1	a	It's a good multyplayer fps game,and I realy like the fact that you are fighting the dinosaurs
3765	1	a	Not bad for the price. Really get a solid group of friends to play, so much fun.
3767	1	a	A really fun game just to unwind. Simple and straightforward.   And what's not fun abt shooting dinosaurs??
3769	1	a	Yes, you need a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t game like this to ♥♥♥♥ of your friends. Great present for your soon ex girlfriend.
3771	1	a	i so recommend dis game when dinos heads get shot off the blood looks like gum its weird and funny at the same time 
3773	1	a	ORION is one of the best co-operative games to play...
3775	1	a	An amazing game to play with friends, Dino Horde is sure to bring about some good laughs and fun times.  - Easy to set up a multiplayer game - A wide array of game modes (PvP, PvE, Co-Op) - Feels like an old school shoot'em up - Stress-less team play, no need to stick to roles and such - Passionate developers - In-game store is mostly for cosmetic items, no pay to win - Just plain fun  Overall Score: 8/10. The game still has some minor issues, but nothing game breaking, and when it comes to having a good time gaming with a couple of friends, Dino Horde is at the top of my list.
3777	1	a	IGN: 10/10 - 'They paid us'
3779	1	a	Still a better love story than twilight!
3781	1	a	T-REX did a backflip 10/10
3783	1	a	Amazing game. We must to work together for battle the Dino (y). I love it !
3785	1	a	I bought this game when it was ridiculously discounted (I paid $.94). Me and a couple of friends tried it out later that night and we were having so much fun poppin' a cap in a T-rex's ♥♥♥. Not perfect, but great for playing with friends. Oh, and there's an achievement for getting eaten by the T-rex called 'Man on the Toilet'. If you don't get this reference you have live a sad, unfulfilled life.
3787	1	a	So much fun with a group of mates... especially when so cheap
3789	1	a	Its a fun game, with or without friends. Now on sale for only for a dollar. Whats not to like?
3791	1	a	This game is actually really fun :P It has definitely changed for the better in the last year. I'd recommend it, and consider everyone lucky because its so cheap!!
3793	1	a	yes its pretty and fun 
3795	1	a	It's sorta like Killing Floor. But with Dinosaurs... I've just been informed that Science has developed an equation. Killing Floor + Dinosaurs = Awesome    ...and for $0.99 it was hard to beat
3797	1	a	Good Game. Didn't play for long, but thats because I was tired and couldn't be bothered learning thigns :P But definately cans ee how this would provide hours of fun.
3799	1	a	My friend crashes into a t rex on purpose and we died.10/10 would play again later when he's offline
3801	1	a	Review:   When I first saw this game, I saw many bad reviews. I thought about buying it, but left it alone when I saw a review video of the game a while back. I got really bored today, and was like, 'Are there any discounted games that are good?', and thought of this game again. This time, I just looked at the reviews, all positives, and it looked much better. I yolo'd it and got this game. I messed around with the options, than hopped onto an 'Easy' game. I was having trouble, not very much fun. Than I went on to a Prehistoric server, kinda hard at first. Than I started getting better after 10 minutes. I started having a lot of fun. This is a GREAT game, considering is only 99c. 11/10, would T-Rex again.
3803	1	a	I remember when this game was Orion: Dino Horde. It was interesting to say the least, but with the new name came what felt like a new game with better optimization, gameplay, everything really. If you're looking for a good quality, cheap game, then this is it. I'd recomend it even if it were $15.  10/10
3805	1	a	Orion Prelude is Fun to play, I like running around and killing Dino's. It has Good Graghics, Sound and Music. I'm just not a first person shooter kind of guy but I do recommend this game and you can get it like for a Buck. Now down to business I would give it a 7 out of 10
3807	1	a	Really fun and good gameplay 
3809	1	a	This game is Titanfall, Advanced Warfare, Halo 4, Crisis 3, Far Cry 4, and GTA V combined. As a matter of fact, all of those game copied this one game. This game is the best game i've ever played in my 15 year experience of playing video games. Even better than half life 2. Who needs Half Life 3, when you have Orion: Prelude. Best game, hands down.
3811	1	a	i honestly didnt know what to expect when i got this because it was lik 1.00$ but when i played it... sure the graphics arent all good, but they arent terrible either the real reason i like this is there is litteraly SO MUCH CARNAGE my pc can't handel it and if you want to customize you charecter well... you gotta pay IRL but you dont see your person at all so there really isn't a point. With amazing vehicles that may be slightly OP the dino carnage is at its max! most carnage i ever whitnessed... ever pretty much
3813	1	a	Better than COD Ghosts
3815	1	a	Dino Horde Is A Game About Dinos And You Kill Them 
3817	1	a	Turn's out heavily armed soldiers riding vehicles caused the mass extiction of dinosaurs. Super entertaining for competetive or casual gamers alike.
3819	1	a	Buggy game but ♥♥♥♥, it was 99 cents.
3821	1	a	Though this game may not have cutting edge graphics, the best voiceovers and some dodgy controls here and there. It is a beautiful piece of work that has adapted greatly from it's release. This game is proof that if you work hard at a game, it will come out great. The Dev team could of left it how it was. A heaping mess. But they looked at their mistakes and improved on them. Making one of the greatest PvD game i've seen. You can play solo, solo with bots, or with friends and either one it is great fun. All for a super cheap price of $1/79p. It's worth way more then that. Best part is that there is not a single pay to win feature on this game. No '$10 for 10000cr' I highly recommend this game to anybody that loves shooters and/or dinosaurs.
3823	1	a	Super fun. You can be a T-Rex. Or get eaten by one. 9001/10 would get my face eaten again.
3825	1	a	Very fun game for a good price, not a 50 dollar game.
3827	1	a	You can play as a dino-suicide bomber.  11/10. Game of the year. 100% recommended.
3829	1	a	cheap, fun, easy to get into and play with friends
3831	1	a	if you want to fight dinosaurs and look swag then this is the game for you
3833	1	a	A fun game to play with a group of friends.
3835	1	a	A T-Rex threw a rock at me and made me fight to survive. My friend being the great comrade he is raced towards me only to get picked up by a Pteradactyl thus plunging to his death. 10/10 would play. For all dinosaur enthusiasts.
3837	1	a	Great game.
3839	1	a	What more can be said, it's a horde style game involving dinosaurs, and don't let the metacritic score fool you, this game deserves much better, great to play with some friends and grab some achievements. 7/10
3841	1	a	I recommend beacouse it's cheap :)
3843	1	a	Great game but could use some updates and detication, Great for helping teamwork and some good laughs!
3845	1	a	Killed a Raptor with a T-REX egg. Would whack again. 10/10 
3847	1	a	Dino !! Dino !! T- Rex RUN !!!!  Tecnologly = Win
3849	1	a	very good game such dino wow
3851	1	a	Great game for a stupid concept. Over all this game is very entertaining providing a unique survival mode where other players take on the role of dinosaurs and destroy new players that don't know what their doing. Through a simple playthrough I beleive team games or free-for-all game modes are the best. The free-for-all duel is wildly entertaining providing huge jumps, great swordplay, camo and awesome side moves.
3853	1	a	Quite fun. It has an intresting gameplay design and is addictive.
3855	1	a	Grab some friends, and have the experience of your life.
3857	1	a	I love this game for many reasons 1. I love first person shooters that are also action packed and just fun to play, 2.I love love love this game because of the dinosaurs just really DINOSAURS I have only once seen a game like this I especially love to be dinosaurs in one of the gamemodes and 3. Its multiplayer for the whole world to enjoy and its a strategy game or if you play on the gamemode where your a dino and your a dino by yourself just eat people overall this is one of the best games so far and i cant wait for its future peace out 
3859	1	a	Awesome game! It's like Jurassic Park meets Halo! I would recommend this game for people who just love killing hordes of monsters!
3861	1	a	This is a great game. It has hours of fun, replayablity, huge maps, weapon upgrades, wonderfull graphics, and great multiplayer. What else can you ask for? This game could cost 10x what it does and still be worth it. Everyone should own it. Great for mini LAN's!!!
3863	1	a	Great fun especially in a group with friends. Excellent game for the price well worth it!
3865	1	a	this game is stupid fun shooting dinos and gets better with a few friends. Just don't expect more than a few hours of fun for the gameplay gets very repedtitve but that first time you 1v1 a T-rex with a lightsaber and win feels amazing. So buy it if you have money to waste and want some dumb game to play with friends for a few hours.
3867	1	a	guys... this is literally the best 99 cents/65 ruble you will ever spend. get it.
3869	1	a	Probably one of the best games you can get for a dollar
3871	1	a	I really don't understand why this game got only 36/100 from metascore. I bought this because it was -93% so it costed me only 0.99€ . It's really fun to play with friends and won't get boring too quickly, I know this because we played this 3 hours straight with my friend. People are saying that the singleplayer sucks, I really can't say anything to that because I haven't tried it yet and won't keep my hope too up because the bad rewiews..  8/10 I do recommend this game if you have somebody to play this with :)
3873	1	a	If you like Shooters i would definatly recommend this game
3875	1	a	Well, I paid $1.49 during the winter sale for the 4 pack and I think it was worth that. It's not bad for the price if you want some mindless stupid fun. Just remember, this game costs 99 cents.
968	0	a	Pros: It doesn't crash and seems relatively bug free  Cons: I had to pay a dollar to play this crap  Might be worth it if you're me aka you have a morbid fascination with design failure   
3877	1	a	 SLG's First 10-hrs. Review
3879	1	a	Dinosaurs = good As long as u have friends that wanna play then great game, Even better when u get 2 be T-rex. 
3881	1	a	First things first, before I go into detail about my experience with the game there are a few things that you need to know:    This is a niche FPS/TPS game    While it has PvP options, the focus is PvE    There are enough glitches and bugs in the game that it feels more like an Early Access title   With that here is a bit of information about this game.    Pros:
3883	1	a	Surprisngly fun! Think of it as if Planetside 2, Turok and Halo had a baby
3885	1	a	Very Enjoyable. Has a lot of potential.
3887	1	a	This is a pretty interesting game.  I got it while it was about a dollar or so, I got a 4-pack, actually, as I'm still hoping to sometime play with people on a kind of lan party. This would be the perfect game for it, and make sure to order pizza.  This game is fun... it can get repetitive quickly, but if you learn a few tricks you can keep things quite interesting. This is the kind of comical game that, well, the way I played at first that I survived by doing? - I was running around knifing raptors - Yes, knifing them.  There's your sign.  Everything about Dino Horde feels like an arcade game. The item/upgrade stores, and so on.. which is neat.   For the sake of repeated play getting boring, and a lot of low appeals other than the comical... bugs -  7/10
3889	1	a	A very fun and intense horde mode, the pvp is not as good as i expected but surely worth the money. Very fun and very addicting. 7/10
3891	1	a	For $.99 it's actually really fun. I played for almost an hour last night after purchasing and I kept thinking 'If I were at an arcade, i'd spend $1 for 1 round' So I like to think I spent $1 for an infinite ammount of rounds and in that respect it's definitely worth the price.  Aside from the great price, there were a few hiccups. I noticed a bit of lag, even though my connection was good. Hit detection seems slightly off, maybe this was because of the lag, but at times I had to aim a the ground in order to hit the little dinos that bite at the feet.  But still, nothing feels better than mowing down a stegosaurus and a t-rex from raining down rockets with an aircraft up above.  Get it, it's worth it, you'll probably like it.
3893	1	a	earrape
3895	1	a	Takes some balls to make fun of your own game.
3897	1	a	This game was terrible as Dino Beatdown, but the recent update to Horde is MUCH better, and was actually fun to play. I reccomend it!
3899	1	a	An odd little gem of a game thats amazing for the price. Theres no reason to not buy it.
3901	1	a	I fully recommend it, gives you more fun than pricier games. Rawrrrr.. rrr.
3903	1	a	So i played enaught of the game to review. Its a fun survival,pvp shooter i liked the survival game the most got 6 trading card i am happy person for 0.79cents
3905	1	a	it's a really fun game! 10/10 BUY IT! 
3907	1	a	This is a great game for a 0.99$ Game.  -The graphics are nice. -The gameplay is so much fun. -Great weapons   Keep up the good work, Developer :)
3909	1	a	It's stupid, all the assets look and feel like they were ripped straight from planetside 2, and playing alone is boring as ♥♥♥♥ after a few minutes.  But I will be damned if this game isn't a party with friends. When it's on sale for $.50 you can round up a group of bored people and have a great night. This game isn't something you play to be good and competitive or to challenge yourself, you play this to have a stupid, wonderful time with other people, and it excels at being just that.
3911	1	a	I really love this game, The graphics are awesome. 1000000 dinosaurs, Aircrafts, Vehicles, And awesome weapons and upgrades! Don't believe the metascore, The game has been updated so much and got so great. The only downside seems to be a bit low on game servers. However achievements are fun too! (I did notice a ingame-store that was a bit of a turnoff, But doesn't seem to make it pay-to-win)
970	0	a	Do not ever ever ever buy this... the fact it is in the flash sale proves the incompetency of steam in gettting rid of decietful, horrible games.... next game is going to claim to cure cancer
3913	1	a	This game is hours of fun, looks good (dat weather) and come on - killing dinosaurs! The only problem I've had is bad ping 'but ♥♥♥♥, it was 99 cents'
3915	1	a	I am not sure why this game gets such a bad reputation. I have been having a blast killing dinosaurs with friends. Its not perfect... but it is a lot of fun.
3917	1	a	Ok to start off this review i going to be honest with you this game isn't the most fun you will ever have or the best game with the best graphics ever its more of a game if your bored and have nothing better to do with your friends. Now i have over with lets get on with the review. p.s. if your do not want me to blaber on go to the summary --- Story: There is none it is just your some peeps who saw a dinosaur and said OH dinosaurs wtf *pew pew* thats it soo yeah so. Score- n/a --- gameplay: The gameplay is very medicore and its not very hard since of the crappy A.I. teammates and dinosaurs. There are three classes medic who can heal peple and heal the power objection, Assault who has a motherf*cking jetpack and recon who can turn invisable. With singleplayer but playing co op is ennoyable with the crazyiness happening with all the dinosaurs but if your stuck with the A.I. because you have no friends then you should not get this game but if you have friends get it and try it. When your bored of just surivial you can mess around with the setting you can make your own fun like starting off with 20000 creidts or pirate dinosaurs. There are a varity of gamemodes such as a gamemode which ripped off quake and some more so more i talk more about them more in the review. gameplay-6.5 --- graphics: Now to the graphics, The graphics are ok-good to the most some maps look pretty good while other to me personally just look ugly which is quite strange but there are things on the screen i hate about it which it the rain and a couple of these snow maps just cover your screen so you can't see has well but i just it make sense because its the rain and stuff but i am stilled annoyed by them but other thet to the most part its good the graphics. graphics-6.5 --- replay vaule: Well there are a varity of gamemodes other then survival which focus on pvp but to be honest no one plays them so its just survial and dinosurvial for the most part so i couldn't try the other gamemodes out. replay vaule-6 --- music + sound effects: There is nothing special about this music its just you stero type action music but the sound effect are pretty good but there is one thing i love and that is that you can change you voice and you can change your voice to a stero type black guy so it get boosted the score music + sound effects -6.5 --- summary: Its not the best game and its not the most fun like i said in the start but its really cheap so gift it to a couple of friends and just have fun becuase for the most part you have to make the fun by yourself but if your ok with that then go it. score overall-6.5
3919	1	a	for half the price of a pack of gum this game is very good. cmon guys i bought thid game for less then a PACK OF GUM
3921	1	a	best 0,39 ill evr spend in my life 
3923	1	a	Metacritic lied to me   10/10
3925	1	a	one of the best game i ever played (that cost 1 dolar:-)
3927	1	a	the most badest game in the world i had fifty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s whan i play the game much sexual very ♥♥♥♥♥
3929	1	a	I paid a dollar for 7 hours of killing T-rexs with a lightsaber. 10/10
3931	1	a	It has dinosaurs.
3933	1	a	had much fun in this tower-defense-FPS while Hunting down Dinosaurs with a wide variety of weapons    9,5 of 10 would slash T-Rex with an overpowered katana-sword 
3935	1	a	This game was great, I definatley recommend it to everyone else. Can't wait until my copy evolves into Orion:Prelude
3937	1	a	Better than Ark
3939	1	a	People say they will dream dreams, dinosaurs are no dreams they're are here, among us in the shrubbery what will you do when they attack? probably die but this game defies everything humans have ever said, ever. this is no review this a witnessed revolution, a game to end all games with a higher metascore than ingame weapons these dinosaurs arent just messing around they're here for the ketchup and brown sauce and it doesn't seem like they're going to leave the mayo with out it. I think im done here, ironic isn't it..? this is the end and yet its only just begun.
3941	1	a	This game is very cheap and its not a bad game the only problem is the graphics.
3943	1	a	a good game. rather interesting concept! i quite enjoyed the fact that i can kill those who walk the earth before me! XD
3945	1	a	Not a bad pick for $1.25. Very similar to the first 2 Halos (guns, vehicle that looks lke the warthog). If you play with friends it's fun, and having cards is a plus also. $10 or more isn't worth it however.
3947	1	a	Very fun game. It has a bunch of different modes that you can play online, with friends, or alone! From survival of survivng waves of dinosaurs, to a mode where you do PVPVE. Its a really fun game! Also, its $0.99, so won't hurt to try!
3949	1	a	Sup. The name's Vuki. I am a game reviewer for the time being to get some cash but after my mixtape drops, im set. I only play Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and if you dont like it... well lets just say the big Vukster is comin for ya. Anyway... this is Vuki, im Out!
3951	1	a	  This is a good, fun game.
3953	1	a	ORION: Prelude. Worst game of 2013? Pfft... maybe 2013, but one of the best of 2015. Okay, that's a little much. I just really enjoy it. It's a fun, fast-paced dinosaur FPS heavily based on the Jurassic Park franchise (don't try to deny the inspiration). It's constant alter egos (ORION: Dino Horde, ORION: Dino Beatdown) can be a little bit annoying if one more comes along. Guardians of ORION seems like an okay game. If I were the people behind the game, swimming in pennies I would be cautious about releasing the full game yet. Even in early access. The trailer (  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3DSl9WmnWU  ) was okay, and seemed like pretty solid gameplay, with decent grapics. I would get it for under $5.00. Maybe at a discount for owning ORION: Prelude? I do kind of dislike the aspect of turning a dinosaur game into a team deathmatch. Maybe if the players could be dinosaurs in the deathmatches, but at this point, it's not the best part of the game. Should you buy this game? Yes. Buy the 4-Pack so you can give it to everyone you know. What's that? You know more than four other people? Well, buy more than one 4-Packs! Well, that's all I have. Thanks for actually reading this. You just read through a run-on paragraph created by a kid that games.
3955	1	a	This is one of the best dinosaur/fighting games, I've ever played! Other than Primal Carnage, I don't know of very many dinosaur games that have both options to play as humans and dinosaurs. Also, the graphics, animations, models, textures, and sound effects are extremely awesome! I also really love the weapons in this game, especially the pump-action shotgun, since that's always been my favorite firearm in general. This game is also like a combination of franchises I love, such as Team Fortress 2, Halo, and Jurassic Park, which I definitely think is one of the most kickass combinations of all time! I completely recommend this game for anyone who loves dinosaurs and first-person shooters!
3957	1	a	STILL better than the 2nd one      u go gurl
3959	1	a	ORION: Dino Horde my first impression Ignore that metacritic, this isn't bad game. Play with friends for more fun  Vehicle, human, weapon are great, many maps and game modes!  some dinos and vehicle still slightly buggy, boring music background But anyway you paid peanut you got monkey, dont expect too much for this game
3961	1	a	this game is rocks this is halo star wars jurrasic park weird game and this game is only 1 dollar sometime I forgot my 1 tl and I don t care but this game need some update still like some bugs and I still need something this game have sooo much pay in thing it is bad and dino has some bug and you can only be a dino in rampage and it is bad I hope devs are read this I love this game devs are relly fuuny and this game has slowmotion ooowww yeaah :D  and if I need to give point 7.5/10 for this game if you ask devs 11/10
3963	1	a	if its less than 5 or 6 dollars than get it. otherwise just get primal carnage if you want to play a better version of this game.
3965	1	a	For a $1 game this is actually surprisingly enjoyable
3967	1	a	You run around, shoot dinos, buy new weapons and drive mechs and choppers, whilst playing with other (usually) good peeps... What else do you need? It also runs quite good. Only problem is, it is kinda badly optimised, though it doesn't mean that the game will run like absolute dogsh**.
3969	1	a	Ill just say this is much better than it was at launch, and i`d give it 7 out of 10
3971	1	a	went on a driving cruise with boosters  11/10
3973	1	a	Maxiumum Immersion Game for max points  Immersion/10 would Immersion again.
3975	1	a	It's like Halo with dinosauars.  A pretty fun game particularly in co-op modes. The game still needs balancing in order to be fully enjoyable in the long run. Overall, it is worth the price of a buck.  EDIT: Now the game is going to be free to play? Everyone, this game is worth your attention. Even when it was a dollar, it is still worth having some fun!
3977	1	a	For one Euro, this game is a steal. Pick it up ASAP! Can recommend to play with friends.
974	0	a	Good game, now return my money.
3979	1	a	Team left me to fight a T-Rex all alone? 10/10 - will be abandoned again.
3981	1	a	its very fun to play with friends not alone.lol. sorry if my review is bland. I just tell it like it is.
3983	1	a	I'm not gonna lie. This game is terrible by all definitions. Animations are hilarious, perks are almost irrelevant, but it's so much fun that you'll overlook it's flaws and enjoy. Definitely at it's best with friends.
3985	1	a	awesome game works well on computers 2010 and up... 10/10 mix of halo, dinosaurs and first person shooter. top game must have
3987	1	a	Very cool game to play with friends. Nice graphics. Dont stop the good work!
3989	1	a	Good game for good price :  Graphic 8/10  Gameplay 7/10  Price 9/10
3991	1	a	Addicting and fun! Exciting and always an adventure with friends! Blasting dinos or competing in Gun Game, this game has it all and is simple enough that it is relaxing and enjoyable!
3993	1	a	A medium dino game. You team up with players and have to survive as long as possible ( i think you win by reaching wave 10). Graphics are medium and gameplay is full of bugs. That doesn't make the game less enjoyable, but it gets boring easily and some times it might even crash. For it's price, I don't see a reason not to buy this game. NOTE: It doesn't have any kind of story mode! It is 100% co-op,multiplayer! Online matches only. Overall 6/10, recommended for it's low price (got it on 0.10$ winter sales deal)
3995	1	a	This is by far the best 1 dollar game i have ever played. You go through different levels of killing dinosaurs while levelling up. This is a very fun game that can keep you captured while playing it. +1
977	0	a	This game is weird, the camera is odd, the controls are bad
3997	1	a	This game is probably the best you can buy for a buck. I love this game. it's not too hard and the graphics are amazing. it's not super easy either and that's what makes it great. I see it as a mix of casual and action because its not too far on either side of the scale. I love this game and although everyone sais there are a lot of bugs, the only thing i found bugged was i got disconnected to the internet everytime i opened the game. this meant i couldn't play online with friends. although that sucks, i still had a lot of fun playing and for a dollar, i say it's a great game. Heck i like it so much, I would have payed $15 for it. Maybe more. So i definately recommend it. Pick it up as soon as possible!
3999	1	a	As soon as I bought this game, I've non-stopped played it for alsomt 6 hours. It is so much fun and so addicting. I recommend this to everyone who loves first person shooter games. This game is better than most of my $50 games and I got it for $15!
4001	1	a	I mean it's only 99 cents so, why not get it.
4003	1	a	Awesome Game!  Believe it or not this is a great game to invest in if you enjoy first person shooter, or shooter games. I know the price of the game is a bit misleading on its value, but I assure you its more then worth it. There are many difficulties in this game, and you can earn your achievements pretty easy on all difficulties. I generally only play Survival as I am more of a co-op type person then PVP. In survival mode you basically have to defend you the generator from the on coming Dinosaurs mobs. As you get kills or team mates get kills you earn credits &amp; experience. The credits can be used to buy better weapons, upgrades, mods, etc at the end of each level. Out of the three classes I enjoy playing assault the most, and I like the special skill of assault which is a jetpack that allows you to get on top of rocks &amp; other places to get away from harms way.  What do you have to loose? Its only $0.99 &amp; if you like it awesome, if not get a refund?
4005	1	a	I admit that I didn't even know why Orion: Prelude was in my steam library and couldn't even remember how I aquired the game. Assuming it was a compulsion perchase, I angerly installed it so as to get at least a little time out of one of the many regretful purchases in my library.   Twenty minutes later the only thing that was real was the jungle, pitch black in the midst of a typhoon. The only light to see by were the bolts of lightning in the sky and the fire that spread accross the countryside. I'm standing on a hill fending off a living tide of velociraptors. My LMG running dry as a T-Rex charges, up my right flank. As I'm about to be eaten, my team mate broadsides the T-Rex with the APC, killing it. two of my teammates jump out of the back and start engaging the next wave, led by a prehistoric giant crocodile. I equip my shotgun and lept back into the fray.  Orion: Prelude is super fun and has some solid mechanics. It is fortunate that the action packed dinostorm never stops because there are some issues. One of the most glaring issues is that the high paced action can immediatly screech to a halt if you die. Depending on the scenario you may be able to only spawn at the begining of the round. There is no telling how long a round can be as there could be as few as 30 dinosaurs to as many as 300, and the earlier you die the longer you will wait. This applies to joining games as well and you can only drop in at the begining of rounds. The objective kept switching every round also, which was confusing. There is only one level with varying weather conditions, the graphics are ♥♥♥♥, the sound is ♥♥♥♥, nothing is clearly labled or explained, the default button mapping for the controller is unintuitive but the game is always on multiplayer so pausing to fix it is suboptimal but exiting the game to deal with it is even worse because you'll have to wait five minutes to get back into the game. on and on I could go with issues.  But in spite of a lot of glaring issues the game rocks. For doing a lot of things wrong it does a lot right. Again the shooter mechanics are solid but need to be polished. the game prevents being overwhelming by having shooting dinosaurs be the central focus and you'll be doing that from the word 'go.' upgrading yourself is easy once you try it the first time and it doesn't take long to get a loadout that works for you. Once you actually do change the controller mapping the gameplay will feel like putting on a glove. As it tuned out I had been given the game as a gift by one of my friends that bought a 4-pack and never picked it up. At the end of the day, the game needs work but is still wildly entertaining especially for its price.
4007	1	a	This game is ridiculous. While I certainly wouldn't have gotten it if it wasn't on sale, this game is still worthwile if you like killing dinosaurs.
4009	1	a	Look it was 99c for a co-op dino slaying FPS. How can you beat that? I experienced no bugs, and the UI is pretty easy to figure out, maybe with a few checks into the options for key commands in game.  So far every server I joined has had great players on it, so spend a buck and have a few hours of fun ;)  trog_79 in game, level 3 when I posted.
4011	1	a	i definly recomed this game Amaziing 
4013	1	a	It's alot of fun with friends. That being said, I need more friends.
4015	1	a	It's a little silly, a little janky and borderline broken in spots, but damn if it isn't fun. :) Worth $15 and a no-brainer if it goes on sale. Also, the recently re-worked Conquest mode (Dec. 2013 Arctic Update) is a blast if you've got a few hours to play through it and a few friends to play it with.
4017	1	a	It's ok i guess.
4019	1	a	This is a very fun game to play with friends. You can play a variety of different game mode on different maps. These game modes range from PvP to Co-Op. One fun game mode is Conquest where you have to defend a generator against dinosaurs in a CoD Zombie style.( more dinosaurs and more difficult dinosaurs appear as time goes on) overall very fun
978	0	a	it may look aowsome .. but it's not it's REALLY NOT ... :) if it's 0.99$ get it .. if it's not don't waste ur money :)
979	0	a	its a rubish game isnt it 
4021	1	a	Cuddly baby dinosaurs rampaging around to chaw your d!ck off. Would recommend.
4023	1	a	Glorious game, nothing more needs to be said.
4025	1	a	GET IT. PLAY IT. LIVE IT.
4027	1	a	It's a mediocre game. I'd recommend a mediocre game for 1$, however. I got this game for the same price as I would have a can of Arizona tea, and this managed to last a little longer. Definitely a concept that needs work, but again, not bad for 1$.
980	0	a	This game is funny for about 10 minutes and then you realize that it's awful and don't ever play it again. It's like trying to watch a movie that you think is funny-bad and just realize that it's bad-bad.
4029	1	a	Holy ♥♥♥♥ what a game for $0.99. I no ♥♥♥♥ punched a T-rex in da face.
4031	1	a	Quite unusual shooter. Fell in love within the first 10 minutes. Well done!
4033	1	a	Probably the best game on the steam market   10/10
4035	1	a	its bad
4037	1	a	This is really fun o.o The art style is a little incoherent/has the looks of a mobile game sometimes but It... It's fun! Like the video quotes say, it's like halo with dino horde mode.  And for 99 cents? Get it!   
4039	1	a	The game is all fun and good, but I feel its no fun without friends. You should mee around in it and have fun. The only thing that sets me off is the graphics of the trailer it does not have those graphics unless the current free week is diffrent or im doing something wrong, but the graphics in the trailer show something like Halo 5 the graphics I see in game are practically Halo 3 and its not my computer I can run WoW on the highest setting besides shadow render to the max and the quality of shadow. So it isnt my Pc I even checked settings for the graphics didnt see much change.
4041	1	a	I used to hate dis game. Now I liek dis gaem. I'd buy that for a dollar.
4043	1	a	Orion Prelude is an cheap FPS game.   Before the review, I would like to preface something, Orion Prelude is not the best FPS game. In regards to FPS, a gamer could boot up the classic TF2 for casual gameplay or CS:GO for a competitive, skill-based game. Orion Prelude is an FPS to play with a group of friends.  The player will usually play as a human (excluding game modes which allow the player to be a dinosaur). Playing a classic game against the AI is fun, until you realize the difficulty curve does not scale. The developers did not make the dinosaurs harder with each incoming wave, they only programmed more dinosaurs to spawn. Therefore, in games with more than two people it's simplistic to defeat the mission.  Playing with friends makes the game more fun. Doing 1v1 gun games can occasionally take 2 hours, while a deathmatch is full of paranoia and adrenaline. Every weapon in the game is more or less creaetive to a certain degree, whether it be light swords, arc guns, or giant robot mounts. The game can provide you and your friends many laughs in regards to dinosaur physics.  Should you buy Orion Prelude? Yes
4045	1	a	Most fun I have had for a dollar...except that time in Thiland
4047	1	a	Good game. Like Nazi Zombies but with dinosaurs and jetpacks.
4049	1	a	It got the ''feel'' of a good game, can't explain. GET IT
4051	1	a	umm... my pc is super crappy only about 5 fps but i still play this awsome game i recomend dis game 10/10 would play again. dont mind how long i playd its my pc freezzzzzzzzzzinggg alot =)
4053	1	a	The game in it's current state is already awesome - can't wait for all the coming updates/upgrades!  You get to play in a team with 5 against a hell of a lot of dinosaurs! Coop-mode is great, and I really enjoy it. Also you can play many different game modes (1v1, Team Duel, FFA Duels and so on...) and you can even play dinosaurs! So, didn't you always want to play as a T-Rex and feast on your enemies? Come on, you know you wanted to! Now you can do it!  Players seem to be very friendly, and helpful towards beginners - at least that's my experience so far.  And since you create your own servers to play with friends (or find servers created by other players) ping is not an issue at all. And if there is no server with the game mode you want to play - just create your own.  The game is fun, and the graphics are nice. WASD-controlled and just like the other FPS-shooters you know, so I was able to hop in and start killing some mean dinosaurs right away. You also earn credits by killing dinosaurs, which you can spend to upgrade your weapons and/or abilities during the match. NOTE: Those changes are not permanent, and credits are earned over and over again every match.  About the metascore: That's total nonsense. The game is far better, maybe around 76 to 81. So just don't give a hoot about that.
4055	1	a	I FREAKING LOVE THIS GAME. Orion: Dino Horde is not only good-looking but it combines two things i love, dinosaurs and guns. This game is a must play for any dino fan or any fps fan.
4057	1	a	its fun, still has some glossing that needs to be done, but definately worth the play
4059	1	a	Much Fun. Many Impress. Such value. Wow.
4061	1	a	LITERALLY THE BEST GAME ANYONE COULD EVER PLAY       EVER      BUY THIS GAME
4063	1	a	Pretty cool game and also the option of getting Steam trading cards from it is awesome! Thanks VALVE!
4065	1	a	This is absolutely THE BEST game you can EVER get for 50 cents.  IM NOT KIDDING, BUY IT
981	0	a	Basic Review: Interesting, but is a short lived game Purchase: I guess so...if you've really got nothing else to do. As this is a neutral review, I can not give this a thumb up.  This game imploys creative new approaches to the basic defense game. Dinosaurs attack your facilities and your team. You goal is to survive each way while upgrading to stay on top of it all.  This game is very fun, if you play it in small volumes. It can get old very fast though, it's very repetitive.
4067	1	a	Awesome game just a little bit laggy and not sure if it's my computer but it has bad motions like running and walking which made me a little bit dizzy when playing :P
4069	1	a	Recommended with a catch:   For the full $15 price? Of course not, that's absurdly high for the quality of the game.  For the $1 when it was on sale? Can't beat it for even a few laughs with some buddies. Pick it up (ON SALE ONLY, mind you) if you're bored and want something decidedly mediocre but oddly enjoyable...for a time. It's clunky, unpolished in places, and rather uninspired at times but is good for some stupid, brainless fun.  --I also can't believe that they get away with the editing and visual tweaking of the screenshots--the game DOES NOT look that good even on highest settings at full resolution. :\
4071	1	a	'1/10 there was no FOV slider' -TB
4073	1	a	7 hours play time and i have already slaughtered 11492 Dinos. I am a one man dino apocalypse!  Definitely worth the price, £0.59p at the time i bought it. Even playing it solo is fun.  Good bits: AI is fairly competent Dinos AI is too Real money shop actually IS cosmetic only for a change Plenty of weapons to choose from Map are big Custom difficulty (Prehistoric mode)  Mutators Community maps etc  Bad bits: Dinos tend to glitch into terrain, especially the big ones Could do with more armor variations Minor lag when achievements/lvl up notifications appear Cheating type user made maps  Over all it is a good game and at the price it is, there isnt much reason not to if you like FPS/Team based shooters or just like the idea of shooting dinos because Turok.
4075	1	a	Probably one of the dumbest most unrealistic games I have ever seen.  Also one of the most fun.  This game doesn't try to be real and gritty like so many games now days. It just tries to be fun and whats not to love? Dinosaurs, helicopters, tanks, mech suits, multiple unreal - like pvp modes, play as a dinosaur.  Using a laser sword to kill a triceratops? 420/69 GOTY - IGN
4077	1	a	'I bought this so I could 360 no scope a Tyranosauras Rex. I was not disappointed.'  At the time, being a 74 cents purchase, it was definitely worth it.
982	0	a	Edit: Auguest 29 2014  This is the second time this game has changed names after giving itself an update. Kinda fradulent since when does having an update give you the ability to change the name of your game from the original version, to Orion: Dino Horde, and now to Orion: Preulde? Short story sweet, the game is fun for the first day but then gets really boring. Not worth $1 imo. If you want to know more, you can read the rest of my review below or look up TotalBiscuit on youtube for gameplay and developement of this game.  Date: March 12 2013 Lots of reviews of this game says 'This game isn't as bad as the metacritic score says it is' or 'This game has improved a lot since the original.' Sorry to say, but if this game improved a lot, it wasn't much of a game to begin with. There's no tutorial at all so you're forced to jump into one of th five or so game modes all of which pales in comparison to survival. There's versus and capture the flag, but it's no Left 4 Dead--that is, the balance is totally off. All the dinosaurs suck except for the T-rex who can toss instadowning rocks (OP) and who can instakill any person close enough to them by swallowing them whole (Super OP). There's other dinosaurs who all boil down to Dinosaurs who all suck and the T-rex. There's tiny dinos who die in like 3 seconds of getting shot or the big ones who can survive getting shot, but who have problems getting kited all day. The marines don't have much variation in viable choices either. There's the assault, the support, the scout, and the assassin--all of whom gets their asses ran over by the hordes of dinosaurs except for the assault who has a jetpack that lets him sits in the mountains on the edge of the map and allows him to pick off the dinosaurs one-by-one while being untouchable to them.  Sure this game (or any game) is a steal at $1 but after about 2 hours of playing I had enough as I got bored of sitting up in a mountain peak and shooting down at the dinosaurs, running around to random checkpoints for unexplained goals throughout the map for up to at least 5 minutes, and playing games where people were only OP T-rexes or OP Assaults. The most fun I had in this game was driving around in a car and running over dinos while I was spamming #Orion:Driving Hit &amp; Run Simulator but that and the game gets old very fast as you soon realize every map is just an excuse to get to random waypoints for no reason which just slow down gameplay just to shoot more dinosaurs.
4079	1	a	a great game. the style of the game is like no other! i got this on a sale for 75p ($1) and it was a STEAL! the only bad thing about this game is that when i reload the gun is out of sync with my hand... i think its just my bad pc though... 8/10
4081	1	a	It's a great game to play with friends but usually this is how it goes  friend- Hey where are you  Me- Oh ya about that  friend- Come on help me out I'm surrounded by raptors  Me- Ya well I kinda got digested by a T-Rex friend- That's it I'm done I can't kill dinosaurs when ur busy being a piece of crap  Me- but..... friend- that's it I'm just going to get a rocket laucher and a helicopter and BLOW SOME DINOS UP!  WELCOME TO PRELUDE
4083	1	a	better than any ♥♥♥♥♥♥ i've ever had or ever will have
4085	1	a	This is one of the best mothertrucking, motherpooping and motherpeeing games I ever played! Its like Call Of Duty zombies but with dinosaurs and tons more guns, perks and gamemodes. Plus i got this game for 99 cents casue it was on the sale so its a very very extremely very good gameboy advanced game for only 99 cents know what I'm sayin G? They should put this game on Steam since it so good yo. Before i bought this game my D was like 2 inches, after I bought this game my D was still 2 inches but thats beside the point. Buy this game its amazing. This is my favorite Rockstar game GTA V step aside for this game. This is also the best Halo game ever made!
4087	1	a	i killed a tyrannosaurus rex. no team, no bombs, me and a rifle. i killed a trex with only a rifle. im the only person i know of in history to do this. remember me.
4089	1	a	This game is the best! It mixes a epic co-op experience with hard core gameplay and strategy! Your either fighting dinosaurs with epic looking futuristic weapons or battling each other!   I give this game 10/10 stars!  Even when i first got the game and played i knew it was gonna be one of my most favorite games!  Here's any example of my daily happy fun times in this game....  Step 1-Walk around the map and enjoy the peace  Step 2-Turn on the generator  Step 3-Get your butt to the weapons depot and get a machine gun you idiot!  Step 4-Take your freaken gun and kill some Dinos!!!!  Step 5-Get to any round i feel like because i love this game!  Step 6-Kill myself then end the game  Step 7-REPEAT!!
4091	1	a	10/10 would play again Has Dinosaurs
4093	1	a	Jetpack +100 136/100
4095	1	a	Great game! For 99 cents this game is a must buy! It has a great storyline, wonderful graphics, and is always a great time with friends or by yourself. this game is possibly one of the best on steam! 11/10 Would participate in the greatest dino beatdown of the century.
4097	1	a	Yanno... I didn't have any expectations to be blown, but, ended up quite pleased and rather surprised with this game. Excelente time waster, very fun to play, good dynamic, and a ♥♥♥♥ton of different game modes to last quite a while. If you didn't grab it yet, do it. Filthy cheap for the no attachments fun provided.
4099	1	a	I can not express the greatness of this creation
4101	1	a	TAKE GUN. SHOOT DINO.
4103	1	a	You don't need friends to have fun in this game, best 99 cents i ever spent
4105	1	a	I wonder why i got this game. i was probably tripping on my own shoes.
4107	1	a	such a funny games, playable games, and enjoyable games when you play it on solo player or multiplayer.
4109	1	a	Broke my computer 10/10
4111	1	a	Have you ever thought, what would happen if you add dinosaurs to halo? Neither have I but it works!
4113	1	a	For the price of a drink from Mc'Donalds, its a pretty solid game, still needs work but just buy it.   6/10
4115	1	a	The game is fun with friends but if you play it alone it is pretty boring.
4117	1	a	36 metascore rate? What they were thinking. This game is just fabulous. Besides that it have some minor bugs, it gives you hours of fun and teamplay. Very recommended for the ones that love big guns, ships, cars and dinosaurs.
4119	1	a	The game feels raw and cheap all over, yet it can be fun with friends and in spite of all the flaws, YES I can recommend this game... for 99 cents.
4121	1	a	I was first skeptical cause of the metascore. But like the other reviewers say, Orion: Dino Horde is actually pretty fun even though it still has its kinks. First time playing it I crapped my pants trying to escape a T-Rex. The game offers tons of customization and weapons, like Killing Floor. But in this case, substitute mutant freaks with flesh eating dinosaurs. I wasn't expecting to be carried off by a Pteranodon either. In all, great game, great updates so far. keep em coming!
4123	1	a	99 cents, shoot dinos with yor friends, bring me some pizza.
4125	1	a	Great game to play with friends.
4127	1	a	Dinosaurs? Check. Jetpacks? Check. More firepower than a National Guard battalion? CHECK. Grab your buddies and go harvest T-Rex Steaks.
4129	1	a	Hillariously bad mechanics make this game a MUST for groups. You can vehicle surf on tires, or the car istelf, making turrents usless compared to rediculously overpowered guns. I and my 2 friends laugh and have a great time. The game mechanics suck horrendus ♥♥♥, but it's still fun.
4131	1	a	Best game for the price, doesnt have the players it deserves, recommended if u have a group of friends u wanna play with from 5-10 friends
4133	1	a	I am a simple guyuy I liek memes I like games i like dinosaur this game is no memes but very fun ♥♥♥♥♥d dinosaur game If i want meme i play undertale, if i want fun i play ORION: Prelubed
4135	1	a	What can I say about this game?  Well.  Prelude sounds better than 'Dino Horde.'
4137	1	a	Shot Velocoraptor while flying on my jetpack. Got chased by giant crocodile 10/10
4139	1	a	The Greatest Game of All Time
4141	1	a	Sucks so hard that it's good again
4143	1	a	It's pretty good for an 80 cent game, I reckon it's worth more. It can be quite fun if you get it for your friends, and for just 2 euros, it's a bargain. dinosaurs / 10
4145	1	a	This game has almost replaced COD and battlefield for me – and for $1 as well! It’s definitely a great purchase even if it only entertains you for a week or two. Play solo or with people online and has Australian servers. Brilliant work.  Dont forget to increase the difficulty after the first 2 or 3 hours though.
4147	1	a	This game is sooo awesome! and cheap... It's sooo worth to buy it! its fun to play and it is really enjoyable! Buy it and play it with your friends!
4149	1	a	But ♥♥♥♥, it was 99 cents!
4151	1	a	Good Game. it is like Halo+Jurrassic Park+Killingfloor=Orion Dino Horde
4153	1	a	This game can be very fun and entertaining if you play with friends and get the teamwork aspect involved. It is very good for a game that costs $1.00//0.50.
983	0	a	I think this could have been a real hit had they just made a few simple changes to the gameplay, but as it stands it's a miserable game that really just doesn't make any sense. The problem is that the plot is just ridiculous and it’s badly executed too. I have to confess that when I played the game it was riddled with bugs, so it may have improved by the time you read this, but I am afraid I just can't recommend it at all.
4155	1	a	sever of this game really hard to connect and have some lag when play. But it is a good game to try and play with price 0.99$
4157	1	a	...Holy HELL! If anyone decides to play this game, make sure you have very quick reaction times or know how to run around screaming with good reaction times. This game is VERY HARD and glitchy to the core. If it ever gets fixed up in the future, I am pretty sure it would be a bit decent for a shooter up game. Otherwise, if anyone plays this, stick inside the buildings always............That's my only advice.
4159	1	a	no matter what all the reviews say, this game is fun as hell. especially when you have a good friend or a couple to play with. i recommend to anyone who has a mic and likes playing as a team.
4161	1	a	Best $0.49 Lost simulator ever. 7/10  Seriously... its less than half a dollar. If it entertains you for 15 minutes, then you got your money's worth...
4163	1	a	Everyone should get this game, it is absolutely amazing, i showed my friends and we all love it :D
4165	1	a	Fired a minigun on a jeep at a charging triceratops, was flipped and thrown through the air while still manning the minigun, took out a few dinos while flying, and landed 30 feet up on a small mountain.   I was able to maintain a stable firing position from there. 11/10 would fly again.
4167	1	a	cant even start, game of the year 10/10
4169	1	a	For a dollar (and my first Steam online purchase) this game is amazing for what it is (except the little bugs). Good amount of dino's, plenty of weapons and perks and stuff, badass murderizing. It's great for $1
4171	1	a	ORION: Prelude has a lot of issues, but it's a lot of fun and it's really cheap, especially right now that it's on sale for 74 cents. Even the full price of 99 cents is probably less than the developers deserve for this game, even considering all of its flaws. The game plays like a budget mixture of Halo: CE, Borderlands, and Killing Floor: After selecting your class (One of three) you and your teammates get a short period of time to buy weapons, upgrades, and vehicles, after which a wave of various kinds of dinosaurs attack you and your power generator, which you must protect. If your whole team is killed or your generator is knocked offline for too long, you lose. Players respawn between waves, when you have the opportunity to buy more stuff with the money you earn from killing dinosaurs. Every so often, your team needs to travel to another area of the map and kill one or more large dinosaurs, which are often stupidly hard to beat, and cause smaller dinosaurs to spawn as long as they are alive. Once that wave is completed, various vehicles spawn, depending on the wave - many of which are quite reminiscent of those from Halo, including one very obvious Warthog shout-out.  ORION: Prelude isn't a pretty game by any means, but it's a lot of fun, and definitely worth the price. Pick it up.
4173	1	a	ORION: Dino Horde is an awesome game to play with friends. It combines everything you love about wave based multiplayer with the exciting concept of facing herd after herd of bloodthirsty Dinosaurs. This game is constantly being updated and developer Spiral has quite outdone themselves on the latest. Adding vehicals and open world maps has drastically changed the games function and flow, but it's all for the better.  The game's price point is average for a multiplayer-only game in my opinion, but Spiral has kept the in-game purchases limited to cosmetic items and their pricing isn't too hard on the wallet. This combined with how hard Spiral is working on the game and the limitless content that cound come in the future makes Dino Horde one of the best values in co-op today.
4175	1	a	Well its like the best of Halo with the best of your childhood dino toys. Its like everything you ever wanted in a game. Because its purple dinosaurs and explosions
4177	1	a	But hell it was 99 cents!
4179	1	a	Very nice game for 0.99ct man 420 blaze it every day and every night
4181	1	a	It will be better this game use COD's engine.
4183	1	a	this game is bad really its not that good at all but when i baught it for a dollor it was amazing its just one of those games you have to play with friends a bunch of people killing dinos thats what u get it would also help if you turned of your brain a bit theres numerous issues that pop up but all in all for a dallor it was 100% worth it
4185	1	a	Great fun, would recomend for all fps fans.
4187	1	a	worth $1, for the weirdly addictive fun that is Halo: Dinosaurs.
4189	1	a	For the price this really is sick.  If you are a (studious) student or someone with a stressful job, this is the game that will kill all that stress, if you combine it with a group voice call of friends.  Stabbing raptors while invisible may seem like a gimmicy sentence, but it is truly fun.  The weapons you can get are also pretty fun!
4191	1	a	Shooting dinosaurs AND getting high tech weapons? This game is awesome!
4193	1	a	Best game ever made! buy it now its awsome :)
4195	1	a	This game is great with a friend or two. Controls are a little hard to get used to but once you do the gameplay is awesome! Satisfying as all hell. If you're considering buying it, BUY IT!
4197	1	a	This game is good. It is basicly like COD zombies with dinosaurs and Halo guns.
4199	1	a	I picked up this game, and I was like, k. Dinosaurs. Then I started playing and proceeded to Katniss T-Rexes left and right. I discovered my inner Katniss with this game, and had **** tons of fun while doing it. We are Katniss. We are one.  All seriousness, fricken awesome game. Definitely deserves a 10/10.
4201	1	a	This game has a great idea and the core gameplay is super fun. It's really fun to play with friends and is well worth the price.  I just have one problem with this game: It runs like ♥♥♥♥ on my computer and desperatly needs to be optimized.  Other than that, 10/10.
4203	1	a	Dinosaurs and lightsabers. What more can you ask for?
4205	1	a	Give it a second try, I hated it at first but it turns out to be not all bad.
4207	1	a	Killed T-Rex with lighting sword 10/10 would kill again
4209	1	a	Hey yo, it used to suck. but now it doesn't. It's pretty average and that's not a bad thing, the gunplay is average, the graphics are average, the gameplay in general is average. You're paying a dollar for a 20 dollar game. Just buy it. You can get a lot of enjoyment.  Then again there are safe spots and the jetpack needs to be removed from assault or something because it completely breaks the game. But still, worth the price.
4211	1	a	Great CO-OP Game. For less than $3 it's a must have! Buy the four pack and you have a night full of fun with friends. Like COD:Zombies? Then Get This Game!
4213	1	a	Defintely woth the 49 cents
4215	1	a	Cool game, nice weapon and vehicles, as you can see playing it the programmer worked so hard! Recomned!
4217	1	a	this game is hella fun!!  lots of customization, MANY gamemodes, its weird hows not everytone playing it atm! for .99c its a surebuy
4219	1	a	Really fun game. Got really bad reviews at release and it deserved them as far as I've heard. they really improved the game and I bought it on the 1 euro sale, played with a friend today and we had a ton of fun. Can only recommend it, especially if it goes on sale again!
4221	1	a	It's pretty damn awesome. I haven't learned the strengths to win much yet, but I am still enjoying losing to these ridiculous monsters!
985	0	a	First of all....this is a bad game! Don't get fooled like I did. I thought: well it can't be THAT bad,but it is. To be fair, I bought it for 99 cents so I guess it's a good deal,but it's not worth like 5 $ or something.
4223	1	a	Great game!
4225	1	a	Short Review: Improved since Orion Horde, but largely remains to be seen. There's still plenty of room for improvement.  Full Review: - Gameplay The game concept is simple. For campaign, you have to survive a group of invading dinosaurs that will only invade you after you start your first generator and after which, you have to drive/walk/fly a long distance to activate your inappropriately-marked second base. The 'Capturing Base' message only appeared after I was some distance away from move the marker and the base itself.  For survival, it's self-explanatory. For PvP, it's self-explanatory. For sudden death, it's self-explanatory (if you've played other games that have this). Every other mode other than campaign revolves around these 3 modes, only difference lies in whether it's a team or one man army or which weapons you get to use.  - Changes in Gameplay The last time I played this game was close to a year ago. I played only Singleplayer and gameplay was at best average. You go around capturing bases, shooting dinosaurs, and perhaps exploiting the map to your advantage. Everything else was left to yourself. There are 3 markers indicating where to get weapons, skills and vehicles. That was about it. Even after the transition from Orion Horde to Prelude, I found it rather boring. Along with a non-existent support team, I decided to abandon the game.  Many months later, I saw their latest video advertisement showcasing 'how much their game has improved'. Reluctantly, I decided to give it a try. (To my surprise,) they had actually improved on Singleplayer mode. You no longer fight alone and have four (relatively dumb) teammates which will help you when you go down, without desperately trying to get a last wind. Campaign-wise, I haven't managed to get pass the first few bases because the AI wouldn't follow and I ended up getting plummeted by two triceratops. That wasn't fun (to die and lose), but nonetheless interesting.  - Graphics/Visual Appeal Despite the 'massive overhaul' from Orion Horde to Prelude, there was not much change in the menu layout and character design. Pretty much every customisation requires you to buy for real money (or earned by unlocking numerous achievements), and the graphics are rather dated (pixelated with its bad geometrical shapes). The only thing that impressed me was the main menu background and that's about it.  In the game itself the developers have noticeably added the weather effect. Your screen will occasionally blur due to the snow and there is a consistent (but annoying) white border around your screen because of snow blowing on your face (at least that's what I interpreted it as). The added weather effects are appreciated and helps you to 'focus' on the game. However, other than that first glance, every other models such as the vehicles, weapons, et cetera are pretty much mediocre. The text do not scale well with the resolution and exceeds the screen (so the skill name and description is cut off for me) and the border between the background and the text is not consistent. Skill icons are also exactly the same as when the game costed USD15.00 before the overhaul to Prelude, which would have been fine if the icon were not extremely visually unappealing. Think of the icons as having secondary school or fresh college students (not graduates) drawing them. It's not simple enough to be 'simple' or complex enough to be 'complex'. It's just... Well, the trailers don't show you the skill icons, do they?  - Bugs (?) There are some noticeable features that I can't really describe it as bug or glitch or whatsoever, because I have no idea if they were meant to be a feature or a bug. For example, you are able to buy the same skill as many times as you want, so long you have the credits from killing dinosaurs. I have no idea whether buying the same skill again have any upgrades (because the skill description remains exactly the same and there is no indication of current level) or it's just bugged and wasting my credits (because even the skill icon colour, everything else remains the same). Sometimes I am also spawned way, way, too far away from the base when I just started the campaign and have to activate the generator to start the game. Again, I have no idea whether being spawned 400 metres away from your main and first base is a feature or a bug.  - Verdict By now, you'd probably wonder why the hell am I recommending this game after such negative experience and I have only 3 hours on record. I'd say the game is actually worth that $1.00 if you have friends to play with. It's fun for a while, and you could probably find some easter eggs here and there and explore the terrain. The terrain is rather big, but there's no sandbox option for me to explore so I can't rate the maps very accurately and I'll leave it out from the gameplay part. After all, with dumb AI, you can't do much (albeit more than without AI). However, if you got no friends who will play this with you (or can't seem to find one) and/or the game reverts to its original Orion Horde price of USD15.00, I'd say skip it. It's seriously not fun playing alone. I would have given this a mixed review if possible, or else a bad review. But for its price, it's hard to argue.
4227	1	a	DEFEND THE HARVESTER! 5/5 Would repair Harvester more.  _______  Nice game, might be little bit repetive since all the gearing and stuff. You get higher gear for higher difficultie ofc. Gameplay is simple, you can play top down or in third person mode. Some say this is pretty much Destiny clone so expect that kind of game. I dont know myself about it since I havent play Destiny. There is bunch of diffrent Gamemodes, Survival and defend the objective (Harvester) Bunch of diffrent Guardians to choose from, personaly I like pyro(shotgun primary and shotgun is the best :D) Diffrent guardians have diffrent special abilities. Little bit optimization after that game is great! I really enjoyed it, and I suggest you to pick up this if you like shooting dinos, topdown- or third person shooters,co-op games or just grinding and gearing.
4229	1	a	Vastly improved since release, originally titled ORION: Dino Beatdown. Don't let the Metacritic score fool you, this game is now a shadow of it's former terrible self. The constant updates and bugfixes have transformed this game from being a very bland and broken basic shooter, to a very fun co-op survival game. The amount of equipment, customization, and vehicles; combined with many months of simplifing the games UI, game mechanics, and constant bug fixes make the entire package a very fun way to play.  The sheer scale of battles, and the fast-paced combat make it fun. If you get a bunch of friends in on it, you'll be coordinating air strikes, tank movement, and infantry battles all in one wave. It's really something just to see two VTOL's fly above you and reign down missle fire, as two tanks flank from both sides... with troops pouring from either side, engaging a T-Rex which is more then enough to take out everything around it.  The AI has been vastly improved, as well. When the game first came out, you would have raptors blindly rush you in a straight line... and pterodactyls swooping in predictiable patterns. Now, the enemies juke and run around, the pterodactyls are hard to shoot and become the bane of any VTOL pilot. Granted, don't expect any amazing AI here, it's still a horde game and horde AI still crowns... but the game is challanging, even if you have the credits and augments to last. Underestimate a triceritops, and it'll destroy your tank in two hits with its charge attack.  In fact, the best way to describe the feeling while playing this game is like living the movie 'Avatar', but instead of Navi... you have face-ripping dinosaurs.  The game has vastly improved on bug fixes, graphics, and optimization since it came out, as well. No longer do you have memory leaks crashing your game, or textures failing to load. No longer does the game lag on high-end systems, and the graphics looking akin to a grainy mess on your screen, hidden by lens flare. The style, while still basic, has been vastly improved; comparable to the style of Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon. Lots of high bloom space colors, lasers, and heavy weaponary... with vechicles that look as much retro as they do futuristic; this game feels right at home... combining a 'Rad' vibe, high-tech space, and a cheesy 'B' movie feeling. The environments are lush, and the maps are large and immersive. A day-time/night-time cycle affects your visibilty and shifts your gameplay. For example, while playing on a tundra map the cold air at night will cause your visor to freeze if you stay outside in the dark for too long, requiring you to find someplace warm. Rainstorms and snowstorms can also hamper your vision, giving the dinos a leg up to ambushes.  The games three classes (assault, support, and infiltrator) have gotten a major upgrade since launch. No longer is the medic gun useless on the support toon... and no longer does the assault dominate maps. The classes seem very balanced, having their own weapons and play styles. An augment system is also in place, which allows you to purchase in-game upgrades with in-game credits you earn per round... allowing you to gain class specific upgrades like double jetpack energy for the assault, or that the support's medic gun can heal structures and vechicles. Later augments will even allow you to purchase and use other class specific weapons, like being a 'boost-sniper' assault... or being a cloaked minigun assassin; as well as having the ability to canabalize raptors for health, earn more credits, or even cause the enemy who kills you to die as well. However, augments arn't permanent... and during rounds you have a finite amount of lives. Not only does dying during a wave cost you a life, but you loose all your augments that you've purchased; giving a larger penalty to death then most games do.  This game has the standard assortament of game modes like deathmatch, team deathmatch, king of the hill; along with having duel modes for both 1v1 and team. The standard horde mode exists as well, called 'survival'... but the meat and potatoes of this game is in it's conquest system, which will allow you to experience those large battles that you see on the screenshots. Players have to fight through waves of enemies, generating credits and protecting their power generator, then use those credits for upgrade, equipment, and vehicles. There's also a 'Rampage' mode that allows humans versus human dinosaurs... so you can live your dream of being a T-Rex and eating people.  The game also features an in-game store with microtransactions, using Spiral Coins:  1,000 Coins - $1.00 6,000 Coins - $5.00 13,000 Coins - $10.00 75,000 Coins - $50.00  Thankfully, this store is PURELY cosmetic with most items costing $1 dollar. No xp boosts, or in-game upgrades... the most you can purchase are hats and skins for your marine or dino. At most, I can see just spending a max of 6,000 coins to get a character the way you want him to look, unless you want to go deeper with customization.  The game also has persistant stat tracking and a levelling system, however the system is very static... only unlocking set upgrades per each level.  The few things I can say bad about this game is that the maps and waves in conquest mode still seem too large. Gathering your entire army to move from base A to base B after you've spent 10 waves defending base A really doesn't make you feel like that base is 'yours'. Also, some weapons are more overpowered than others; and some items aren't that useful to invest your time into (IMHO, the flame turret). On top of that, dinos tend to 'pop in' if they're too far away... making a hunt for a large dino that you can idenifty close by a bit harder to locate. Also, the populations for game modes seem to be a bit low in my taste, with conquest allowing up to 5 people per server. Other modes have different population caps, but overall it feels small. The menu UI structure also is a bit hard to get used to... with the whole menu UI coming off a bit cheap. Granted, the old menu system from two years ago was DREADFUL, and this is an improvement... it's still not up to par with most games.  However, these are nitpicks for a game that really has been risen from the ashes of it's former self. The developers are very active in the games future, and this game does have the love and dedication of a passion project come to life. There's constant free updates to this game, and new features being added all the time; as well as having the team be very approchable with ideas and suggestions. With the changes I've seen with the past two years... and (at the time of writing) a new version of the game in development which will expand on this game, allowing for new features... including a persistant open-world game mode, ala Planetside 2... I can safely say that this game has a bright future.  If you had met me two years ago and asked about this game, I would have told you to never play it... to stear clear, and forget about it... If you had bought it, to try and ask for a refund.  Nowadays, I'd be asking if you wanna buddy up and kill some dino's in a APC. It's improved that much, and I'd be MORE than willing to give it a recommendation. It's cheap, it's fun, it's OOZING with Sci-Fi goodness, and there arn't many games out there like it.
4231	1	a	This game is fun, and a great value.  -Coop and PvP multiplayer modes. -Coop has bots for singleplayer and Multiplayer. -A variety of flying and ground vehicles. -Tons of achievments, some of them are quite funny. -Plenty of weapons and upgrades to choose from each play through.
4233	1	a	It is a really fun game with dinosaurs. Halo with dinosaurs is the easiest way to describe it. The game is really, REALLY cheap and for that reason alone you should get this game. The optimization isn't amazing, especially since this game looks like a launch Xbox 360 title. The framerate sometimes gets pretty bad, at around 50fps, and it is bad because this game looks pretty bad. Surely, it is not too bad - definitely acceptable, but nothing too special. Anyway, you should totally get this game. It is fun, if not a little easy for some people, but worth playing for at least 4 hours.
4235	1	a	this game is good but if you dont like something that can get repeatitive then dont get it I got it because it was a dollar so I got my moneys worth so if you want it get it on sale it is on often
4237	1	a	i played it with low spek, even though i feel heavy lag, but that wont hold me down to play this get gun, get skill, buy bow, ez unlimited ammo 9/10 would play again when i buy high spek laptop
4239	1	a	Punch a T-Rex to death after it wrecked your tank!  Ride a giant Crocodile!   Awesome game!
4241	1	a	7.5/10   Orion Prelude is a interesting game, and for $1 its completely worth it.
4243	1	a	Good engine graphics,can be a ps2 games,cheap :) and many sarcasm in this review :)
4245	1	a	Great fun and can't wait for the new updates!
4247	1	a	i wasnt really sure about this game...... BUT ♥♥♥♥ IT WAS 99 CENTS! (on a more serious note its a good game for 99 cents)
4249	1	a	Surprisingly addictive. Play it with friends.
4251	1	a	I..cant stop playing you monsters. For $0.49 its so amazing. This game is soo addicting
4253	1	a	it's like the low budget evolve thats actually fun
4255	1	a	Good Zombie game with friends. DLC's are cool but not nessicary. (If you are going to buy DLC's wait untill the go on sale, they go on sale offten.)
986	0	a	no seriously. no one should ever buy this game. not even for €0.99
4257	1	a	10/10 best game you could get for $1
4259	1	a	Great Game! Way Better than Before, So much fun!! You have to Play it to believ me, Its GREAT I love it 99999999999999999999999999999999FriedNoodles/10
4261	1	a	This game, oh man. When you get friends together this can be really fun. Fighting off hordes of dinos, having satisfaction for each head you blow off. You can fight to survive, so if a dino kills you, you kill them back and BAM you're alive! I suggest this for those with friends that want to play this. So far, good game. -12/-10
4263	1	a	Spent the entirety of a game running over small dinosaurs in a car with 'Get it on the floor' by DMX playing in the background.  10/10
4265	1	a	Good Game, worth the money!
4267	1	a	Halo, CoD (But better) and a host of other games smashed into one....AND DINOS. Who could ask for more? I loved it the moment I started playing, and bought it soon after!  Amoung the gamemodes, Survival, Free For All, team deathmatch, CTE (Capture the egg) and more!  Strongly suggest getting it, and help keeping this game alive, soooo much fun! 9/10  What could be improved is some of the multiplayer aspects; such as: While in F4A, enemys do not see the damage they;ve done to you when you've killed them. Not only is this frustrating, but they mistake it for you 'hacking' ultimately leading to un-kind words being thrown at said parties. Apart from that, I LOVE THE GAME!
4269	1	a	This game has come a long ways. It doesn't feel like the same game and that why you should give props to developers who stuck with it and made it bettter.
4271	1	a	Glitchy, unoptimized, garbage. If you enjoy generic tower-defence games and have a computer strong enough to run the terrable graphics, go ahead. The only reason it's worth it is because it's 99 cents. If it were 5 dollars I'd say it's not worth.
4273	1	a	Payed $1.49 for a 4 pack for me and my bros. Got at least $2.45 worth of fun out of it
4275	1	a	I'm not entirely sure why the score is so low. I quite enjoy this game and find it to be an extremely fun romp with a friend. We played for hours and didn't want to switch to anything else!
4277	1	a	Bought 5 four packs for $15 and sold the game for a key each on TF2Outpost
4279	1	a	It's worse than having T-Rex arms
4281	1	a	Shot a Triceratops in the face with a rocket launcher while nearing death. ♥♥♥♥♥♥ him off and got sent flying to my death. T-Rex threw a boulder into my face right before a pterosaur of some sort grabbed me. Got loose and fell to my death. 10/10, would have my ♥♥♥ handed to me by dinosaurs again.
4283	1	a	Tokyo drift into dinosaurs and the game's announcer says something about pizza  10/10
4285	1	a	Usually I try to avoid horde survival games like Serious Sam, but oh boy for a dollar, it is really fun to play. Its fun to play with friends and blame them for not healing you. Forever alone? you can play with close-to-useless AI bots to play with!  Also you can ride a dino while raining bullets on their face. 11/10
4287	1	a	Dinosaurs + guns + multiplayer + cars, count me in.  9.5/10
4289	1	a	This is amazing with friends and very intense. 7.25/10
4291	1	a	Good game. Enjoyable when you're bored. Easy achievments aswell.  9/10
4293	1	a	Amazing gameplay, and concept. Sure, its dinosaurs...Could be like aliens, or something....But its awesome!
4295	1	a	Pros- Fun horde gameplay Huge amounts of weapons DINOSAURS Mechs Tanks VTOLS Three classes Dinosaurs Swords Great looking graphics Reminicent of HALO Mulitple gamemodes Co-op PVP You can hover around a T Rex with a jetpack shooting it with a bow and arrow  Cons- Maps all seem similar Takes time to get guns  Hitboxes are buggy Random lag Some people on servers are evil  Overall- 8/10 would bang again
4297	1	a	Seriously a fun game. The graphics are what appear to be Cell Shaded like Borderlands. The leveling system is easy so you don't have to do a lot of grinding for unlocks. The sound effects are ok. Pretty generic. There's a lot of game modes available the one i like best is the horde mode. Its the only mode i've played thus far. The maps are well layed out and look awesome. My all time favorite graphical part of this game is the rain, snow, and frost that's on the screen. Even on the winter maps you have frost all around your visor. And when you end up ice frost over the entire visor once you go indoors it wil melt away which is really cool.   My suggestion while playing this game is have some music of your own playing in the background. It really helps from getting bored with the game. its a great game to come home to after a long day at work and just chill with some music,
4299	1	a	The Best game over with good graphics and anomations!!!!
4301	1	a	It's pretty good. Lots of action, non-stop. The concept is very well done. It's a little unstable at some points - fairly glitchy. The sounds need to be updated as well. I recommend it though. 4.5/5.
4303	1	a	not that many people play this so not many servers. great graphics though!
4305	1	a	Love it
4307	1	a	Pretty fun: The only thing missing is an unlimited survival mode. I don't get why there are things for 20k credits if I can only make that much by buying nothing rounds 1-9. e.e But overall it's a decent game, esepcially for 99 cents.
4309	1	a	It's so terrible it's good.
4311	1	a	A game that tries way to little to actually be its own game.  Instead it tries to take things from other popular games Slow motion time (Zed Time from Killing Floor) Large ingame store with cosmetics and other things to dress up your character (Team Fortress 2, Planetside 2, CS:GO and many more..) The game's animations are clunky, the voice dialogues make dialogues from Ride to Hell: retribution sound like a dream.   The dinosaurs sound horrible, the maps look horrible and the game in its entirety just feels incomplete.  But ♥♥♥♥ It was 99 cents!  So if you buy it don't expect anything amazing, you get what you pay for.
4313	1	a	If you're a fan of Halo: Reach's FireFight mode and love shooting dinosaurs, then this is certainly your game.
4315	1	a	Like Killing floor + Turok, but with dinos, and the wonderfully large ones that will chomp you in half, or grab you by the leg and carry you 80 feet in the air, only to let go and you fall to your doom! (unless you choose assault class, you have a jet pack)
4317	1	a	awesome game for its price. A lot of fun with friends
4319	1	a	very fun. u wont reget buying this.
991	0	a	Played for 10 minutes...  NOPE
4321	1	a	Best dinosaur-quickscope simulator out there.  Wonna get rekt by a t-rex and fly out of the map trying to understand what the f*** is going on? Well this is game for you.
4323	1	a	Didn't give me a headache like other cheap games 10/10
4325	1	a	I found this game by complete accident while browsing the steam store. Seeing it only cost $0.99, I was intrigued to try it out. I got some friends to play with me, and had an absolute BLAST.    ABOUT THE GAME:
4327	1	a	Just bought the game, seems good so far, not too many problems, really fun but then again I like fps.
4329	1	a	the devs took a crap on their keyboards. 3 years later they turned that ♥♥♥♥ into gold!!
4331	1	a	One of the sleeper hits of 2012!
4333	1	a	You can stack a medic on a mech on a tank and be invincible. Best game on Steam 12.967/10.
4335	1	a	The game is definatly worth the dollar game wise, but when you do play, if you find a good game, prepare to never leave becuase it is seemingly impossible to get a game with actual people in it. I'm either getting disconnected while I'm connecting or i'll loose connection to host, and every other server is full so theres nothing else to do but stare at your screen. Then i thought, hey i'll just start a server! nope. Sat there for a good while waiting for people and nobody joined.  TL;DR Good game with bad matchmaking. Fix for the matchmaking would make this game amazing
4337	1	a	Really fun, just don't take it seriously
4339	1	a	This is my favourite game that definitely isn't similar to Halo if Halo had dinosaurs in it.
4341	1	a	When I was the metascore I was somewhat worried, but I tried the game when it was free for 7 days; although I've only played for 2 or so hours the game is worth the cash, especially if you have friends who are willing to play too, but you can always find games online if you don’t.  The game has a nice feel to it. Like Killing Floors except in this game you kill a crapload of dinos. The game does sometimes feel cheap with the whole hip fire not being accurate at all, but down sight you will have no problem. It was pretty amazing to be chased by a T rex, makes your heart pump and leaves you with the feeling of what else is coming... well there are many more dinos and T rex is not the biggest one either.  Ignore the score, the game has been polished enough to enjoy with friends.  
4343	1	a	I rode on a Pteranodons back. 10/10 would fly again.
4345	1	a	Best, or Worst, 99 cents you'll ever spend, depending how you look at it, Those who judge a game for every little detail will find it to be a terrible mess. Those who accept the game for what it is (a game that costed you next to nothing) will find it a fun and joy-filled game.
4347	1	a	Awesome game really interesting i recommend it
4349	1	a	Oh this game is lagggy. but fun
4351	1	a	Absolutely rediculous, however, that is what makes it really fun. Drive a tank, man a mech, fly a hover ship thingie! It's definitely worth checking out on the free weekend or picking up for a dollar for some good laughs to perk yourself up! xD 8/10 This rating is so high because it wouldn't be as great without its many flaws. XD   www.twitch.tv/crescenda 
4353	1	a	Its a fun game. Shoot dinosaurs. The end.
4355	1	a	It's like   Skyrim   HALO with   guns   dinosaurs.
4357	1	a	I am not normally a first person shooter type of player, but Dino Horde definately lets me break out of my norms. It isn't just myself and my friends randomly trying to kill each other, but instead we're all trying to figure out new and faster ways to brutally murder the big bad dinosaur!  The hilarity of it all is the fact that I'm fighting long-extinct dinosaurs with futuristic weapons, and I'm still barely on par!
4359	1	a	Incredibly fun game. The metascore is the rating for the previous game before it was over hauled so don't let that scare you. Overall a wonderful dino-killing experience and a great multiplayer experience.   8/10
4361	1	a	The optimisation could be better, but otherwise it's alright.
4363	1	a	The metascore of this game is very misleading in my opinion, I don't know how bad this game was when is was released but now I think it's really good now. I don't think this game is supposed to be taken too seriously as it is far from realistic but it should be considered as a fun game to play with your friends (or alone like me). Shooting hundreds of dinosaurs has never been this much fun.
4365	1	a	It has dinosaurs and its .99 why not buy it?
4367	1	a	Excellent game.  Beautiful graphics if you have the PC for them, fast-paced gameplay, intense dinos versus humans combat, a wide variety of vehicles to choose from, and it can be very challenging at times. The environment weather-effects are well done and look very realistic, they also add an element of difficulty. It's hard to shoot dinosaurs when it's almost pitch black and raining. The visor effects caused by weather are also very interesting. Your visor can get frosty or covered with rain, making visibility limited.  I bought this game on sale for $0.75 and it was worth every penny. Some people give it a bad rap, but I have no clue why. Who doesn't like shooting dinosaurs with machine guns, driving tanks around and using a jetpack? Even if you only play it once or twice, it's well worth the regular price of $0.99. It's fun to play with friends while voice-chatting, I've even played with some Twitch streamers. I would reccomend this game to pretty much anybody. It's a heck of a lot of fun. Besides, even if you don't care for it, it's less than a dollar.
4369	1	a	Knifed a T-rex to death 10/10
4371	1	a	Solid shooter, Dino AI sometimes a little strange, but tons of fun to play. Would recommend.
4373	1	a	I love this new farming simulator 8/17 Birthday cards would 360 a t -rex again
4375	1	a	I bought this game when it was called Orion: Dino Beatdown. They changed it then to Orion: Dino Horde, It is now called Orion: Prelude.  The game is worth $0.99 if your body 'don't turn cold' purchasing this game you really haven't lived.
4377	1	a	First of all I want to say congratulations TREK Industries, for making a revolutionary product that will change the way we look at games forever. I have logged over 500 hours in this game on a seperate account and bought it again for this one and all of my friends just to prove my loyalty to the product. Now for the actual review.  Orion: Prelude is an amazing game that can be easily compared to AAA titles such as Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, the Halo franchise, the Counter Strike titles, and is better than mostly all FPS indie titles out there.   Graphics: Oh my god the graphics. This is a timeless piece of art that will be revered for as long as video gaming is alive. The graphics are simply timeless and they make the enviroment look absolutely beautiful. Low graphics in this game are basically equivilent to Ultra graphics in Far Cry 4. Water reflections are amazingly vivid, the dinosaurs are textured amazingly. Really nothing else can be said but this is an absolute must have game for anybody who enjoys beautiful scenery and amazing gameplay.  AI: If you can call it AI... it feels like you're actually playing with real people when offline. The grunts that help you move and act like they were real war veterans and move into and out of cover as well as taking positions to give them the upper hand. Advanced manuevers are no problem for this AI. Aside from the humans, the dinosaurs are superb as well. Amazing tracking, great movement recognition. Be careful, these things can spot you from a mile away.  Gameplay: This gameplay is honestly some of the best I have ever experienced. The best way to describe it is a mix of Call of Duty, Halo, and the balance of Counter Strike. While in the game I have had extremely intense situations where the entire team relyed of me to win. Its stuff like that that makes the game fun. In one instance I was being charged by several velociraptors and a T-rex. I turned on my absolutely flawless cloaking device and fled the scene back to the hut where i bought my sniper rifle and killed each and every dinosaur to win the game. Lets say i was sweating after that intense experience and was extremely proud of my self and my abilities to master this amazing game.  Overall I think this is a must have for any video game player looking for an amazing, intense FPS situation with not only good graphics and fun gameplay, but with balance and a cheap price as well. Honestly, this game should be at LEAST 10$ for a copy. I have bought it for all of my friends and we currently all enjoy the game together and play it whenever we have a chance. Keep up the amazing work TREK and make sure you buy this game before the price goes up! It's definitely worth the money!
4379	1	a	I managed to hang a tank off a cliff and shot dinosaurs with it. 11/10 would physics again
4381	1	a	This game is like dinosaurs on steroids it really made you rage quit when a stegosaurus dash onto you  10/10  recommended for dino lovers  Try no scope the raptors
4383	1	a	This Game Is 8/8 M8 Must Get This Game
4385	1	a	Awesome game to play over lan with your friends
4387	1	a	a game for fun with a good price
4389	1	a	Orion Prelude is the ridiculousness of awesome that I didn't know I needed.
4391	1	a	Come on d00d, its a dollar, need I say more?
4393	1	a	about this game a little bit laggy 
992	0	a	I started this game being very excited: ''Powered on Unreal Engine''- Wow, this game looks cool! Nope, this game just suck. The gamplay is very rusty, graphics are ugly and there are just a few of servers.  5/10 dinosaurs
4395	1	a	The most ridiculous game you can get for under a buck!
4397	1	a	I saw the video, because i wanted to know what kind of game that is and... wow ... what can i say ... THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER!!!!! The video was so good that i had to buy this. Everybody says that this game has bugs. I say this game IS a bug. But is not that the thing that makes the game funny ? 
4399	1	a	Triceratops flipped my tank 2000ft in the air and killed itself  11/10
4401	1	a	They turned this from one of the worst games of all time to a pretty decent game. That is some dev willpower.
4403	1	a	Worth the 0.99c, 10/10 would kill dinosaurs again.
4405	1	a	Have you ever wanted to just go nuts on dinosaurs? What about going nuts with tons of weaponry including a sword, gatling gun, and auto pistols? What if the dinos your killing came in massive, unrelenting hoards made of many varying dino types? This game is for you if you answered yes to any of these questions. I myself bought the game not expeccting much besides a fiew hours (maybe) of shooting things. Instead i was met with DAYS of fun packed, dino killing action. This game touched down on my inner child of wanting to blow stuff up and shoot huge guns with crazy power, and also having aspects of cooperative play. I have only played the survival mode of this game because it was exactly what i was looking for, and look at how many hours i have gotten out of this game. Seriously, amazing fun.
4407	1	a	You kill dinosaurs... That's it. 10/10
4409	1	a	Yes i recommend this game ALOT you can be dinos!your teamss are dinosaurs or ?dinosaur killers?There GET THE GAME BRUH
4411	1	a	This game is ruining my free time.
4413	1	a	Orion has been through many phases getting better &amp; better every time, (even though it has been getting more &amp; more powerful so PEOPLE TURN DOWN THE SETTINGS) also you can be a dinosaur. There are many, many achievements to unlock &amp; this is also very fun with friends. I can reccoment this game (an even better review with a more powerful PC) with a 8.2/10 (with the update that allows ships into the game 9.8/10)
4415	1	a	Orion: Prelude is actually really quite a fun and enjoyable game. The bugs are also hilarious.
4417	1	a	The box art looks pretty cool so it's got that goin' for it.
4419	1	a	At first I was like, 'ok'. And then I was like, 'POWJAM MASSEEEAAAUUUUUUU WWWWWWEEEEEEEEEEMMMMMMM REM REM KATEM PEW PEW PEW AAAAAAHHHHH DINOSAUR INCOMING! WE NEED TO TAKE THE FIGHT TO THEM!' Shortly following that I was like, 'Martin we need to get this kid a band-aid.'   'The storyline was alright' 10/10 -Martin Septim   'Well I think we should.' 9/e John McCain
4421	1	a	Fun game! Only $1 right now (June 6). It's sorta like cs or like cod but more realistic and with dinos! a little buggy at times and sometimes the servers arent too good. :)
4423	1	a	this is fun fast paced fps where you kill or be jkilled battle your friends or endless waves of dinosaur in this explosive game.
4425	1	a	Great game. Definatly doesn't deverve the bad reputation it has. It may be buggy at times, but the world is beutiful, the weapons are great, and the dinosaurs are really cool. I would definatally recommend this game to anyone.
4427	1	a	I would have gladly paid more than 99c for this game, it may be a bit glitchy but I have high hopes its going to turn out to be something legendary.  I am unaware of the previous iterations of this game but from what I heard, it was a disaster. And as people tend to get better at whatever they keep doing, I'm sure they will deliver a finely polished and optimized Orion: Prelude 
4429	1	a	Metascore is wrong. Wrong, wrong, wrong. This game is okay, fun to play and is entertaining. This is like CounterStrike, Left 4 Dead, Halo and, well, Dinosaurs, all wrapped into one. In my opinion, this scores an 7.5-8/10.
4431	1	a	The metascore scores WRONG its really fun to play with friends 3 hours to go but only for 1€!
4433	1	a	It's a reallly fun silly game. It's not the best but i really like it. You'll have a lot of fun:)
4435	1	a	Do i overall recomend this game... Yes for .99 cents. But once the sale is over, the 15 dollars is not worth it.  The goods: It is an addicting game that makes my neck hurt when I am done with the game session. The gameplay is awesome, and the money system is slightly flawed, some rounds i only get 500 income, even if I get alot of points.  The Bads: It gets bad frame rates. It probably could have been better on a modified source engine to fix the frames, as I have to run on medium to get 30-40 fps at beginning, and 25-30 at the lvls 10+.  The uglys. The lobby system. It is absolutely terrible. If you click on a game, you usually connect at lvl 5-10, And get desamated because you start out with only 5000 credits, or even less sometimes, with a starting pistol. If you are lucky, you join a game at the beginning levels, and you are fine. If you join a game before it has started, you usually are stuck there for a while because the host is afk while there are 5/5 people on the server. Sometimes it wont let you join games, or it is stuck on 'Connecting to Server'. The worst of all, is that the refresh button doesnt work. So I could be clicking on a full game, even though it says 2/5 people on it. usually after a while, it wont even let me connect, which brings me to my other point. So i have to end up restarting the game 2-5 times just to get in a game, because the refresh button doesnt work.  Once the free week/sale is over., I wouldnt reccomend this game, it gets maddening after a couple hours. The Ugly's and bads outweigh the goods way too much
4437	1	a	I played this quite a while ago. It's definitely not worth $15, but the gameplay was kinda fun. However, considering it's now only one dollar? Buy it, because you could get a dollar for literally ten minutes of work if you felt like it
4439	1	a	An amazing game for it's super low price. Even beats some games that are far more expensive than this. Don t question it, if you have a bit of extra money to spend and you want a game to keep you busy, just buy it. 
4441	1	a	well honestly this game rules  there are a few bugs here and there but all in all BEST DINO FPS ON THE MARKET buyin a 4 pack($2.99) is still cheaper than a whopper at burgerking however...dino meat over an open flame...sounds yummy
4443	1	a	It's amazing. O And theres dinos Yup Its cool
4445	1	a	This game is absolutely amazing. I give the devs props for keeping up with this game and completely redesigning it. This game went from crap to amazing. They gave it a huge graphical update and then added more dinos. This game just got better and better. They did an amazing job. I highly recommend you go check this game out.
4447	1	a	IT SAYS BUY NOW AND GET ONE FREE GAME (SO FAR A GOOD GAME) BUT THEN I DONT GET A FREE GAME I DID NOT BUY IT FOR THE FREE GAME BUT STILL IF IT SAYS FREE GAME I WANT MY FREE GAME
4449	1	a	nice game, but in my country, this game very lag :(
4451	1	a	if you enjoy killing zombies , on endless survival modes . You must enjoy facing dinassours on the exact same situations , except that in this game you can use vehicles for deslocation or attack purposes.  You need to be constantly capturing the outposts , which makes the game harder.
4453	1	a	Shank a raptor, for cash....
4455	1	a	Great Dinosaur First persopn shooter and really Action packed Teamwork is really important and has a variety of weapons , 
4457	1	a	they were busy doing whatever that i don't understand, i just know how to shoot dinosaur
4459	1	a	This game is way better than you expect. I bought the 4 pack for $.59 and had to convince people to play it. Everyone thinks its going to suck because its cheap. The 3 copies I gave away all three liked the game very much. The game is not perfect but if you have a couple friends and want to kill some time this is fantastic. Even at $1 this game is a winner. Id recommend it to anyone looking for a coop shooter. Game in a nutshell: dinos, tons of weapons, vehicles, survive. Im going to pick up the next orion game because I like this one so much.
4461	1	a	Wow. Such Dino's. Much guns. Very team-based. So kill. Ruined Doge's life. Five stars.
4463	1	a	A Fun game when purchased on a sale.
4465	1	a	This game is Awesome to play with Friends! if you got friends to play buy it if its cheap
4467	1	a	 ★★★✮☆
4469	1	a	This isnt a ♥♥♥♥ game anymore, albite its not the greatest game ever. but if your looking for a gmae ot ♥♥♥♥ around with friends this can do it. its score is like a 5-7/10. Not the best, Not the worse. just ok
4471	1	a	Sry bout other review ment to be funny....... anyway for 99 cents who would not buy it? If you aint happy with it so what it was a buck....... not the animal! Anyway BUY IT NOW!!!!
4473	1	a	This game is very much worth a dollar.  It's a competent (mostly), customizable dino-survival FPS with PvP elements tacked on. Granted there's some micro-transactions thrown in, but that's mostly just for cosmetic apperances for your character, dino, and weapons. The game has a tendency to bug out from time to time, but it's nothing really game breaking and at the most will make you laugh rather than get upset. People might be also turned off by the fact that the dinosaurs have a one track mind, meaning they'll attack whoever's the closest or whoever's shooting at them, but what do you expect? They also have a bad habit of puppy guarding the generator when you're trying to fix it.  This is an enjoyable game when you've got a group for it. Randoms are okay, depending on what kind of experience you want.
4475	1	a	Well worth .99 cents, but for .49 cents it can't be beat
4477	1	a	great fun game for hours of fun messing around with friends
4479	1	a	You could say, the dinosaurs got T-Rekt..  -Theodore Trillbilly, PhD, Moderator of /r/dinosaurs
4481	1	a	honestly really enjoy this game purchased it for less then a dollar and expected such crap. currently busy with gta 5 on PC and bloodeborn on ps4 but definatly keeping this game installed
4483	1	a	You use jetpacks and laser guns to kill acid spitting velociraptors and it costs as much as a small pack of gum, of course i recommend it.
4485	1	a	Once I bought the game I was like the game will probably be OK but after playing with some friends for a few hours. This game should NOT be 1 buck it should be at least 30. The devs pretty much made this a give away from a really good game. It reminds me a lot of Black OPs Zombies only you got Dinosaurs, jetpacks, Invisibility , Tons of maps, cool skins and customization options, and some other cool features. To be honest only thing this game needed was a story mode. Other than that, great job Spiral Game Studios!! Keep up the good work you've got a fan now!
4487	1	a	I only played this game for a few minutes and found it to be quite amazing. Some of the aspects in this game remind me of Borderlands2. Very fun co-op modes, loads of guns and tons of upgrades which can turn you into a juggernaut. I really like that you can carry up to SIX GUNS! ( after upgrades of course ) It's an easy game to play for someone that doesn't have a lot of time for gaming and just wants to jump into action.   Graphics are good for the price of this game. The gameplay and mechanics are fine but the AIs' intelligence is a little limited.   All in all it's a fun, fast paced, dino in your face shooter. I give it a 8/10. Worth the price their asking! Thank you for reading my review.
4489	1	a	Graphics are stunning, the most realistic thing I've ever seen. I wish I had 3d glasses so I could abuse the 3D mode. Has a huge class variety, which one is extremely different from the others. The Soundtrack is so nice I feel like bethoveen couldn't do better. Also, the learning curve is so smooth I can always learn more and more!   This game is the new eSport.
4491	1	a	Laggy, Buggy and 99 cents, yet its still one of the most fun games I've ever played.
4493	1	a	  One of my friends gifted me this game. Actually i wasn't planning to play this game but he said that he bought this not only for me but for our some common friends too. So, we downloaded and started to play. I can honestly say, i don't know much about this game's '' games modes'' except survival and conquest(i couldn't remember clearly which one is which.). Dinosaurs comes on to you wave to wave and you have to defend some energy things. There are some huge dinosours such like T-Rex and much more littles. Little ones can be slayed easily opposite of bigs. And flying ones are so annoying. I am trying to say that there are many kinds of dinosaurs are in this game.  For figthing with them, the games serves you a great range of weapons. You can find many things from rocket launches to ion swords. And each weapon make you feel the difference. There are maps that i don't know but the maps which i played are good. They are big and you can fly to the top of the mountains. Don't assume that you're invulnerable just because you are high, the flying ones still can reach you. On tundra, your glasses has frost effect and blizzards occures well, on another map when the rain comes the weather is nearly blackened etc. and these are such good things on a such cheap game. In conclusion this game offers you a great playability and the price is what it deserves even though it's no fun without friends.
4495	1	a	its cool trust me. also im pretty cool bro. i have friends and i have swag, suck it
4497	1	a	I got this game as a gift from my homie. At first I thought he bought a cheap sh*t for me but we had a lot of fun :D
4499	1	a	Wasn't particularly fun but I bet it'd be amazing with friends who are willing to buy it. All in all I would say it's worth the price tag it has on it but only if you have people to play with.
4501	1	a	Thumbs way-up.  The most fun I have had playing a FPS in a while. It reminds me of early Quake LAN parties, constant gibs, and non-stop action. There are several different ways you can play (survival, FFA, conquest, etc), lots of weapons, vehicles, various difficulty levels, etc.   So far, I have only played one class - 3 to choose from. Don't forget, you can play dino classes! Favorite vehicle so far: two passenger assault vehicle with rear mounted machine gun. You can ram/crush hearding dinos, but bosses toss vehicle and crew into the air.  This game is not thought provoking, deep, and will not solve any of the worlds problems. It is entertainment. There are games for solving puzzles, this is not one of them. Low metascore, but hey, it's easy to be a critic. You can stare at the idiot box, or you can roast some Raptors!   When was the last time you had this much fun for $0.99? Keyboard finger cramps included at no extra charge! Buy it. If you play for more than 5 minutes (and you will) it is worth it.
997	0	a	It stills being ♥♥♥♥.
4503	1	a	is cheap and great get it
4505	1	a	Frickin jet packs and dinosaurs!!!!! Dont care what anyone else says, this is fun on a bun!!!
998	0	a	after this 'XP GRIND' came out the game is ruined i would have recommened it but now theres ppl with such high levels who dont even know how to play the game running around and its pure chaos.. other then playing with other ppl this game is great. UPDATE still havent taken notice of XP GRIND and ppl think its just a cheap crappy game and cheating wont matter.. how would you like it if everyone on GTA v was max level with everything after all the work you put into it all now for nothing?! it sucks and all i want is this ♥♥♥♥ gone and at lest the leader boards and levels cleaned up but of corse the devs carely dont care enough to do anything
4507	1	a	Best buy at this price. Not the best game overall, but it gets really funny when you gather up with some friends. Lots of vehicles, helicopters, great weather effects, challenging achievements, and so on. You can also download and try maps made by the community, so the game doesn't really stay repetitive or boring.
4509	1	a	Recommended.
4511	1	a	Honestly,  One of the best experiences I've had with a game. Heres why...  1. The game mechanics are superb 2. Teamplay is excellent and fun 3. The game never lags  4. Graphics are second to none 5. Massive online community 6. Frame rates NEVER drop  All I can say is enjoy.
4513	1	a	Jetpacked into a falling helicopter then used it to kill a T-Rex. 10/10 Would play again
4515	1	a	You can have a party hat with small dinosaurs on it. 10/10
4517	1	a	don't take this game seriously...
4519	1	a	This game is like a First Person Balloon Tower Defense, but with DInosaurs! I love how you cna buy perks from eliminating enemies! All in all I think Orion is a great game.
4521	1	a	awesome game... I recommend it for everyone who like action game
4523	1	a	Wow.... I relize the game is pretty loltastic what I mean by that Is that I mean i'ts glitchy terrible and just wtf. Buuuut to me this game is actualy very fun and it is a original game to me and I would recommend this game to everyone. Keep the updates going and make new maps also... GREAT JOB!
4525	1	a	Got this game on Steam summer sale. After five hours of game play, I can say this is a fantastic game! I love playing the Recon class and use the bow alot. It is very cheap and you can get a lot of hours on this game.
4527	1	a	It is really fun either with or without friends (In the off chance you want to play alone and or don't have any)
4529	1	a	This game is pretty cool for his price, it's very cool
4531	1	a	don't take this game seriously...
4533	1	a	ORION: Dino Horde is an awesome game for gamers all alike. It has all of my favourite in-game things: dinosaurs, guns, death, blood and dinosaurs. Now who doesn't (except for girls) like killing huge prehistoric beasts with futuristic weapons or being the beasts and eating people? WHO FRIGGING DOESN'T LIKE THAT?! Oh and the gameplay is great, although a little laggy and buggy in places, but still great! I give it a 9/10.
4535	1	a	Jetpacked into a falling helicopter then used it to kill a T-Rex. 10/10 Would play again
4537	1	a	This game is like a First Person Balloon Tower Defense, but with DInosaurs! I love how you cna buy perks from eliminating enemies! All in all I think Orion is a great game.
4539	1	a	THIS GAME IS AMAZING 
4541	1	a	This game is the $h!t. You get to wear a jetpack and shoot dinosaurs... What more do you want? Oh u want to be a dinosaur? Well you can do that too. Just drop the 99 cents and start playing this game
4543	1	a	the devs put effort into the game, and improved it quite a bit, +rep the reviews before Dec 2013 are outdated, so think of that before making your conclusion
4545	1	a	It's buggy, ugly, unbalanced, and full of questionable design decisions, .....and mother♥♥♥♥ing dinosaurs. The worst best game I've ever played.
4547	1	a	The short version of why this game is awesome: YOU KILL DINOS. MANY DINOS. IN THE FUTURE. WITH AWESOME GUNS.  I had a lot of fun playing this game with my friends. I got the 4-pack when it was on sale for cheap. Mindlessly shooting dino's in coop is just straight up fun.  The gameplay reminds me a bit of halo, but if the spartans where fighting dinos. It's a bit more than that, but I think the compairison is fair, as many elements of the game give me that feel including wepons and vehicles.  My only problem with this game is it got kind of stale fast. Killing dinos mindlessly in waves with a few random objectives does get old eventually. I hope they put in some more varying modes, otherwise I'll get bored with it and have to take a week off to make it interesting again.  The game also has pvp, but I'll be honest I didn't try it very much. It seemed ok.  For a game though that I got super cheap, it was worth every penny. The developer also seems to be adding improvments constantly, so I think I'll stick with it.
4549	1	a	Game is great, very fun, kinda reminds me of serious sam with Dinosaurs
4551	1	a	The new update(s) have definitely put this game on a better place than what it's earned on Metacritic. It's what the newest trailer explains: Killing Floor x Halo mechanics vs Dinosaurs. If you haven't tried it yet, do so.
4553	1	a	For one dolla' you can flip off a T-rex as it headbutts you to the other side of the map
4555	1	a	you know what people get on my nerves? the people saying 'the graphics are not good' honestly in the 'rebirth trailer' i call it (commuinty appreciation' i dont think they metiond graphics just the gameplay dont judge the game on how the graphics are base it on the gameplay the mechanics and all the things it offers but if the game itself says good graphic sure hold that to them and other things they promised i see allot of promise verdict is                                                               8.5/10
4557	1	a	If you want to play a multiplayer survival shooter with your mates this is one of the best on offer. Just jump in not expecting much and enjoy a great laugh. I've fought a stegosaurus with a flamethrower, jetpacked into the sky and shot a t-rex in the face with a mini gun. I've pied pipered a horde of raptors to rocket jump doom and successfully juggled the slow mo perk of killing a t-rex with carefully timed rocket blasts! All this happened in multiplayer with a mate laughing alongside me. I have a Robin Hood hat, stupid purple guns and can't survive on my own above easy difficulty level even with my acquired perks, but I love it.  In the words of Smash TV, 'I'd buy that for a dollar!'
4559	1	a	especially great if YOU DONT WANT IT TO WORK
4561	1	a	...
4563	1	a	this game is alright a bit like call of duty and teamfortress 2 with dino's i found it a bit boring but if you like shooters with dino's then you might like this 7/10 forme
4565	1	a	It's a very underrated game I think. Altough I have no problem finding a game online I think it deserves a bit more attention.  Gameplay feels very solid, shooting acts very smooth as each gun feels different. Killing hordes of dinos is very fun by yourself or with a friend (witch is recommended) and the ragdoll physics can be quite hilarious at times. However the game can be a little buggy at times. A few times I've found myself stuck in a wall after a dino had rammed me, and I had to quit or your gun will freez and you can't shoot it, but that only happened to me once and I think it was a connection problem. I've had a very fun time playing and while it's on sale for a dollar that's a steal! 7/10  [Edit] Over time I got bord witht this game. Everyone online just wants to play survival, witch gets old after awhile. All the other game modes are left in the dust forgotten about. Don't even get me started on how 80% of the games avlailable the host is idle or somthing because they NEVER start the game! Trust me that gets really annoying. One of the main things I don't like about this game, in fact I hate, is the community. Most people I played with trolled with me or thought I was hacking because of how good I was doing, not to mention little to no teamwork. As for gameplay it's pretty solid. I'd say the game is more enjoyable with a friend. Theres just somthing about the game that doesn't feel right though, I don't know what it is but somthing feels off about it. It is a fun game but if you're looking for a game to spend hours on hours of playing I wouldn't get this game. The only reasons for me to go back and play it again would be if me and a friend wanted to be stupid and play or to try and get all the achievements. Maybe if I were really bord and had nothing better to do, maybe I'd play it again. If I had to rate it again it would be a 5.4/10
4567	1	a	Good! Best played with friends or randoms. When playing co-op or multiplay, there are like hardly any Australian servers to jump on that are free; they are either full or there is none. So you need to make up your own listen or dedicated server(or get one of your mates to do it) if you wanna play with people. And the servers overseas, yeah unless you like playing with 400+ ping, don't bother....  Otherwise fun game, to me it feels like a cross between KF and Halo, except instead of killing zombies or aliens, it's dinosaurs!
4569	1	a	Played it for a while but got bored soon. But since its super cheap give it a try.
4571	1	a	This game possibly the best dinosaur shooter I've ever played. That is all.
4573	1	a	one of the best shooter everyone should try
4575	1	a	99 cents to shoot dinosaurs, and get more updates than DayZ will ever have.  10/10 Devs WILL update again &lt;3
4577	1	a	easily the best dollar i've ever spent
4579	1	a	I am fully encouraged to recommend this game!...... to anyone looking for a horrific gaming experience &amp; the sexual assault of your wallet (If the game is not on sale for a price that can be considered 'expendable').  Gifted to me by a friend during the 99p sale, we were treated to a game with horrible animations, unusual keybindings, not one single form of tutorial, and horrific sound issues where footsteps reign louder than gunshots &amp; death of a player treats all player to a painfully loud slo-mo sequence. And after all of the updates this game has received since it's crtically panned release, it's INEXCUSEABLE that the developer has left these issues completely neglected. I'd speak about how starved of strategy the gameplay is, but I've not been capable to play this trainwreck enough to provide proper judgement. Unbelievably, me &amp; my friends had a lot of fun suffering at the hand of this game's poor design, but it was short lived.  In general, this is a game that is poorly designed across the board, and whose issues most core to the game have been completely ignored in favour of expanding the game experience.  You will laugh, you will anger, you will cry. Whatever the case, fully recommended to those seeking to see a video game at it's worst (when ON SALE). Otherwise, SAVE YOUR MONEY &amp; STAY AWAY!!
4581	1	a	Had inappropriate relations with a T-Rex, spawning little raptor babies, strange men in space suits come invade my land, my baby's daddy charges them and eats 1, my little raptor babies all swarm in and attack their ankles, hiding in the grass. They all die. I spawn more babies.  10/10 best 74cents ever spent.
4583	1	a	can 360 noscope a t-rekt with a racket launcher  `10/10
4585	1	a	Such an ace game, had a friend gift it to me as they bought the 4 pack in the sale and I clocked a solid 13 hours on it from the moment it finished installing!  Most fun I've had in a while when it comes to silly shooting games!  If you're looking for something to kill 30-60min I would seriously recommend buying this
4587	1	a	First things first, that metacritic score is BS. That score was given way back when before the game was reworked and re released. I bought it for a $1 during the re-release and honestly i would of paid $30 for it. The survival mode is my favorite mode, infact i havent really played many of the other modes at all, but survival is endless fun. Favorite thing about the game is the avatar esque ships you can fly in survivor or the mech warrior war suit, or maybe even the tank. I play assault so i have a jetpack because if i didnt the massive trex would rip me out of the map and chomp me in half. He still chomps me sometimes while i try to jetpack away and he chomps rocks to throw at you if you try to land on a cliff and shoot from safety.  Gameplay 9/10 audio 8/10 overall experience with the game is an astounding 10/10.   As we all know games get old after enough play but seriously this game is more than worth it and its epicness is unmatched by many other games with much higher price tags. Also its in no way pay to play you cant spend any money to get better, you can only just play which makes this game better than all those silly microtransaction games.   One thing i want metacritic to do is to review this game again and give it the 90 or 95/100 it deserves. BUY IT NOW!!!!
4589	1	a	...
4591	1	a	  I have to thank one of my great friends for getting me this game on my BDAY, but anyways I have to review this game.  I am not really a fan of dinosaurs BUT this game is indeed good I have to admit, this game does have a decent player base and the gameplay is really good, You can buy things in game to make your character look better like in TF2 (that godawful bucket of........ sorry venting) but yeah this game has a lot of great gameplay assets but I hope you enjoy this game. My score for this is a 9/10.    EDIT: WOAH, I just remembered how many microtransactions there are in this game, not only that but the A.I of the dinosaurs is actually a lot better than the A.I of your teammates if they are bots. I also joined servers where a ping of 300 was NORMAL. Maybe I was being a little to soft on this game but honestly IDK what else to say about this game besides, THE BOTS SUCK AND DON'T HELP YOU THAT WELL! 7/10 (-2 points)
4593	1	a	The game is really fun, even if it looks terrible. It is totally worth the price if you get a four pack and play it with some friends.
4595	1	a	10/10 Good Game - Grab Four Friends and its hilarious good times
4597	1	a	The Metascore is a Lie !!!
4599	1	a	Addicting. Simply addicting. You may be thinking 'Boy, this is cheaper than Garry's Mod on sale and has science fiction elements and dinosaurs. This game is probably a piece of crap or just a Dino D Day rip off'- YOU ARE WRONG. This game has a LOT to offer. I just got it yesterday and I have a hard time NOT playing it. There's too many epic factors to it. The only complaint I have is a low amount of weapons. Don't get me wrong, there's enough to keep yourself satisfied...but there isn't much of a balance. Some weapons may be around the same price, but one is way better than the other. It's really cheap, so buy it, install it, and give it ago.
4601	1	a	Got the 4-pack at 3€, played with my kids a few hours, already got my money's worth.  Don't get this expecting a piece of art, unless you consider goldfish in a blender art.  Go in expecting to shoot a lot of dinosaurs (nothing much deeper, though you can buy perks and guns in the game), and your expectations will be well met.
4603	1	a	cool $ 1.00
4605	1	a	Fun game, Has coop and i met some of the best people i have on my list through this game. This game not only made me have fun, but involved some good team work, has some awesome upgrades and really for .99 the graphics are pretty damn decent. This game is definitely worth every cent :P   If you get the game don't expect it to be extraoridinary, dont expect it to be mindblowing, but expect it to be fun. If you have some friends, jump on with them and just have a blast.
4607	1	a	I have to say this is maybe one of the best games I've played. Its got bugs, lighting errors, but that stuff is for people that play the game to be super serious and such. This game is soooooo fun I've played it alot. Its the type of game where you go to say: 'I'm done.. (Goes to hit ESC and then hears a T-Rex roar) ... nevermind, just one more wave.' You then see that when you went to leave at 9:00 PM its now 2:00 am in the morning, then you catch yourself at around 4 am then finally quit. Thats how it runs for me. I have two more words. Buy. It. (You will not regret it!)
4609	1	a	This is one of the best games ever made. I would pay $100 per round if I had to.
4611	1	a	Fun Game, but only in multiplayer. If you and a couple of your friends have it then play together. It could use some more work, but im convinced the next ORION game will be awesome.
4613	1	a	This game is very fun! I liken it to L4D2, but I personally enjoy this more. There's a variety of weapons, perks, enemies, objectives, maps, and vehicles. Whether playing alone or with friends, I think it's a good FPS with nice graphics. I reccomend this game to anyone who likes first-person shooters. There isn't a 'campaign,' it's just multiplayer/singleplayer arena comat.
4615	1	a	While the game and concept are really enjoyable, eventually, some of the enimies become too fast and tiny to hit... Fun game, just one flaw... still, for the price, i can recommend it, but not as a game I would see myself spending a lot of time on. Seems like a game ill play a few times then never play again.
4617	1	a	This is a pretty cool and fun game. You should get it.
4619	1	a	When compared the the like of Halo and Hatoful Boyfriend, you cant go wrong with this game. But if you compare this game against Airport Simulator 2014 and Gasp, Its still really good!  This game is best for young children. It shows them the importance of staying away from dinosaurs just like in real life. Dinosaurs and guns make a great combination to help their young minds.  Have some self respect and wear a diaper when playing this masterpiece. Taking breaks is a sin.
4621	1	a	ITS AWSOEM 
4623	1	a	People say this game bad but is not. It had layers. It like an onion. Onion have layers. Onion: Peepee is onion. When people say it ogre say no, it isn't ogre. All of the Shrek out of the swamp gas. Very happy.
4625	1	a	There simply aren't enough games with dinosaurs &amp; even fewer of these that are actually worth playing! For me, Orion: Prelude (O:P) is that rare exception. Although not much in way of a story in the game (no single player after all), there is quite a tale on how Orion came to be the game it is today...  The short version is, that O:P is an evolution of previous Orion titles, Dino Horde &amp; Dino Beatdown originally dating back to a successful 2011 Kickstarter campaign. Although recieving early criticism (that would normally kill a game ..dead.. disappearing into obscurity), the game continued to evolve with constant updates (big &amp; small) over the years from the developers. Spiral stuck with it! This dedication &amp; gradual refinement of the game has resulted in an excellent first-person co-op experience, with a well rounded collection of modes, weapons, enviromental effects, vehicles &amp; more to enjoy.   PvP isn't forgotten; it's also selectable. PvP feels more alike to a retro deathmatches, than a modern PvP (in a good way!), but I mainly enjoy the co-op modes. In co-op, you essentially have to defend your power core against waves of bloodthursty dinosaurs. Dinosaur kills will reward you credits, which you can use to buy perks &amp; weapon upgrades, in-turn helping you survive the later, harder waves. Some waves also have you securing objectives. Co-op doesn't feel ultra competitive, most of the time you don't watch your credits/kills, rather finding yourself just having fun surviving &amp; helping your teammates! I've found the community to generally be helpful &amp; friendly in-game too.  One of the real stand-out features in O:P has to be the enviromental effects randomly cycling on the alien world. From the day/night cycles to the extreme variety of climates &amp; types of weather. Adds so much to the atmosphere. Couple this with excellent lighting effects through what seems to be a thicker atmosphere and the results can sometimes be spectacular! Even overwhelming! You definitely get that feeling when your final wave gets a night cycle with heavy rain .. you know you are gonna see an epic close quarter battle!  Along with the awesome effects, there are 3 distinct classes to mix-up the gameplay. Each has unique strengths &amp; each you can progress/level-up in online play to unlock starting weapons, power-ups &amp; perks. Initial learning curve isn't steep, so once you get the hang of the basic flow it becomes very easy to sink multiple hours killing dinos! O:P rarely feels like a grind; even at lower levels (without a lot of perks) you competently kill dinos &amp; gain good XP. Plenty of dinos to go around too :)  If you can't find a friend to play with, there is also bot-support added in O:P to fill the ranks. This can be helpful to get playing quickly if server populations are low (which regrettably does happen).  The trilogy of classes are well balanced (no need for any other classes), as is the gameplay in general. Difficulty is super scalable. Weapons are mainly shared between classes so quickly become familiar, and vehicles are easy to use &amp; offer a good range of practical &amp; destructive uses. Repetitive? Sure, to a degree, it is the same thing over &amp; over and despite there being a lot of 'accessories' to the spice up the character classes &amp; tactics, modes etc, there are not a huge number of maps for each mode. I expect this will change soon with Steam Workshop support being added.  The A.I. generally employed by the dinosaurs is a fairly basic 'rush' tactic, which can feel pretty predictable (there are a few surprises though), but I find the larger dino numbers to counteract this limitation to a degree anyway. There are also the occasional technical glitches like querky physics (flying Stegosaurus anyone?) or clipping inside a dinosaur. Nothing game-breaking that I have experienced, but sure does make for some funny moments! Just like my many failed attempts at some of the more creative 'Ride a Dino for 10secs' &amp; 'Slap T-Rex 100 times' achievements :)  O:P reminds me a bit of those classic, simple shooters like a Serious Sam or Left 4 Dead, but with a bit of high-tech sci-fi flavor. This future-tech feel across the game contradicts the jurassic era dinosaurs &amp; remote wilderness landscapes nicely! O:P is not as complex mechanically or technically when compared to a top end AAA FPS, but its simplicity is also its underlying strength. It is great value ($1!), has strong replayability and the focused, balanced gameplay (some bonus ..ahem.. querks) offers a truely fun &amp; intense, dino killin' co-operative survival experience!
4627	1	a	I love this game its really fun and I didn't find out about the special abilities until I was playing rampage and I accidentally pressed LCTRL, and yes I know I'm a dinosaur but I don't care what others thinks.
4629	1	a	You shoot dinosaurs. 10/10 IGN
4631	1	a	This game is absolute silly fun. It's best played with your bro's!
4633	1	a	Hit a raptor with a truck and it went up really fast. 10/10
4635	1	a	WORST! GAME! I'VE EVER PLAYED!!!
4637	1	a	glitchy but fun
4639	1	a	This game is awesome, I love dinosaurs
4641	1	a	I thought this would be kinda crap but I actually just kick back and shoot stuff. People on co-op are really patient and fun! A hidden gem, but not a masterpiece. I just put some podcasts on sometimes as white noise and go nuts. Also, I killed two triceratops and a t-rex by myself, so I feel pretty good.
4643	1	a	This game is great already and its getting greater. OF course it has soem bad things like all games however it has some good things as well. I really love the game but i barely got time to play it and not much people to play it with.   I will list some good and bad things about the game at least in my opinion and then what but I cant choose for you. So just use this as some information about the game.  First of all the game is really fun to play with friends. I mean it as its one of my favorite things to do. Not just the open world to roam around and explore (That is not endless and always the same) but also like surviving the waves of hungry dinosaurs they throw at you. But also the versus mode can be extremly fun for playing with friends. As one of your friends can be a dinosaur.   I cant say anything of the pvp mode thought as i never did it.  Second the game has a different set of weapons and is a bit level based. The level is not that inportant in a few of the early difficult settings but it can be for like insane or higher. It gives you a goal to work to. As well as the weapon choise and the other things around it is great. And that you can heatshot dinosaurs sort of is also a fun fact.  Third the game is going threw a lot of good changes and got better form were it started. I played it when it started and it was not that great at all. But I loved the idea so even thought my friends suggested no to me I still bought the game. And well the game grew and made more rewarding. However my hours of gameplay are not that great i can tell that the game is going a nice way in upgrates and bug fixing.  Fourth the creators of the game are spending hard work on it. They even check the forums for ideas and post replys. As well as plan events and do work on the game. However there budget is low so they trying to do anything they can to keep the game alive and growing.And they are doing it good as they are fixing problems even added a few of the most requested dinosaurs in the forums to make.   Well i also have to say some bad things but they are working on those problems mainly.  Well one of the bad things is the ragdoll. The dinosaur ragdolls or the movement can look a bit messed up. But trust me its better then when the game started so they are working on it.  Second thing is like its not that active online. Well this is slowly changing as well but not that fast. There are more people coming in the game and it is a growing game. But its a slow growing game so you got to wait some or get some friends or people to know to play it with. Futher after the next patch they are making its propally gonne grow as well. But there is also a single player mode but thats less fun.  Third the teamkilling fact. There is no friendly fire in the game so thats a good thing. However in a small amout games and trust me really small amout of games you can find people that love to drive a car against you and drive you off a cliff. Or they try to get a achievment to drive a car full off team members in a big dinosaur.  I can list many more ups and downs on te game but i listed a few of them.  And my opinion is that the game is a good game but propally gonne become a great game when they are finished working.  I would say you should buy the game to play it and have fun but also to support the creators to be able to make this game into a great game.  However my opinion is not yours so not instand buy this becuse i say so.  Thanks for reading and your time.  Rust.
4645	1	a	Best futuristic dinosaur killer simulator of our day and age. Hands down.
4647	1	a	This Game is as good as it says in the trailer, the only bad thing about it is when it rains or you're on a winter map and is disrupts your view because it either frosts up or you get rain dripping down your helmet, Exept that i give this game a 9 outta 10!
4649	1	a	This game is actually kind of okay.
4651	1	a	Punched a raptor in the face and got 125 points. 10/10
4653	1	a	Miraculously healed raptor bite wounds and dino-acid-spit burns by killing a T-rex with a revolver.  10/10
4655	1	a	The seal is a ♥♥♥♥ 11/10
4657	1	a	7/10. Game has a low score and I wondered why? After playing this game I had a lot of fun playing I just couldnt figure it out. The score was taken a long time ago when this game first came out and was awful. This is not that game. I've played wave games, one of them being Killing Floor, and as much fun as Killing Floor is, in the end the only objective is to survive. Simple and beautiful. This game has that, but with dinosaurs. You also have actual objectives to complete which gives more of a challenge rather than just killing things, and upon completeing said objectives you gain more credits to buy more guns and other perks to help you survive. Not a perfect game but a decent fun one.
1001	0	a	The game itself is a great game that can pass time and bring some fun, I am not talking about something that you would invest time into but a sort of game like a Zombie Mode on Black Ops, It's just a good game that can satisfy your needs for killing some dinosaurs in a huge arena that also has Objectives as well as Cars and planes to help you go around, but really other than a game you are only going to really play for around 30 minutes and never touch it again this game apparently is fraudulent or something along those lines from what I hear which is obviously not a very good thing for anyone, God just thinking about this makes me triggered about insurance fraud and crap from faked whiplash, but we are here to talk about the game.   -Pros  A good timewaster Cheap as ♥♥♥♥ - I mean at around 1 dollar why wouldn't you try it out, (don't try it out)  -Cons The game is not buggy but it is far from fully optimised FRAUD Only going to play it once a year No radar system to tell you where all the dino are so you get buttraped  Graphics are pretty bad  Did I say FRAUD already? 
4659	1	a	Very good Dinosaur Horde game even though there are other modes most players choose to play either survival or conquest. There are three classes in the game and each has a special ability the Assault class has a jet pack that allows him to go reach higher areas easier than other classes, the Support class has a healing gun that should be self explanitory although with a certain upgrade it can damage enemies and repair turrets, vehicles, and generators, and the Recon class can go you guessed it invisible. Gameplay is nice no glitches unless you have a bad internet connection so check your connection before you play any mode. Weapon choice is decent in this game with one assault rifles, two sub machine guns, two light machine guns, two shotguns, two melee weapons, three sniper rifles, and a plethora of pistols which can be bought in temporarily in any game mode and if you die you lose them but if you remember where you died or you use a custom made loadout from the weapons you've unlocked. Now onto the special weapons better known as (to seasoned players at least) adrenaline weapons which can be unlocked each class has two and a universal adrenaline weapon that can be used by all three classes which is a bow yeah a bow what are the odds; The assualt can use a grenade launcher and a rocket launcher, support can use a flamethrower and a chain gun, and the recon can use a laser rifle and a energy carbine. Customization is really the only low point in the game unless you have money with the choice to only change the skin of a weapon when you start the game you have two armor and weapon skin colors black or purple you have to buy more aromor and weapons skins except for one for that one you just have to get 75 achievements for it. There are helmets in the game with one being unlocked after getting 50 achievements but like the armor and weapon skins they have to be bought as well. Taunts are in the same boat as weapon and armor colors so yeah it's more of a pay to look good kind of game. The community in the game is also very quiet not many will use the in game chat function but no one will randomly start insulting someone so it's about 50/50. Final Verdict a 7/10 for hours of fun in survival and conquest, decent weapon choice, and the fact that when a class reaches level 60 that class has unlocked every weapon that is best suited to them do this for every class and you will have 10 weapons unlocked and ready to use for any class it loses points for mediocre community, low customization, no story what so ever, and the fact that you can't unlock every weapon
4661	1	a	Basically what you need to know about this game is that it takes place in the middle of Turok and Crisis where some of the idividuals in both games are in need of some serious dino ♥♥♥ kicking. Play as your favorite characters like master chief, the medic in TF2, luke skywalker, and the guy in crisis (you know the main guy who can be invisible). Then fight hoards of mother ♥♥♥♥ing dinosaurs, and for some reason santa? with all you friends.
4663	1	a	Not a big shooter fan personally, but O:Pre brings out the best of the few that I happen to like: Halo, Gears of War, and Tribes (ah Tribes I remember when you were king!). Haters gonna hate, but I find this game intuitive, engaging, and addictive! Now if I could just get a better set up so I could enjoy it to it's fullest with better graphics.
1002	0	a	this game was ♥♥♥♥, i had more fun wiping my ♥♥♥
4665	1	a	A fun and entertaining game. As you go along you learn new tricks to trick and kill dinosaurs, you learn the best strategies for killing dinosaurs and for unlocking eapons. It's a splendid game with decent graphics. The only problem I have is some of the Dinosaur AI... This is coming from someone who only played the free weekend.
1003	0	a	Such a ♥♥♥♥ game, wouldn't even buy it whilst it's 1 dollar
1004	0	a	This game was 99 cents and I bought it for the laughs with a group of friends and we had laughs and never played it again.  It's got an unpolished UI with icons that look like they were made in paint. Gameplay just handles terribly (as do all the vehicles) and while it looks graphically fantastic it really isn't anything more than that.  The gameplay is boring and repetitive and you need to be playing in a squad to go anywhere.  I don't know why people are recommending this game (but as with most steam reviews, 90% are just bull and have no purpose to help you). But this game, it is honestly not even worth the time to check it out.   Don't waste your money on this even if it is 99 cents again, buy some other random indie game or some trading cards because at least you'll look at them more than you will ever play this game.  Gameplay: 3/10 Graphics: 7.5/10 Sound: 3.5/10 Overall: 4.6/10
4667	1	a	Call of Duty Zombies, but with DINOSAURS instead. Good for the price.
4669	1	a	I respect these developers. I respect them. These guys teach you to never give up on something.
4671	1	a	LoL i want this game ;D. I played the 'demo'.
4673	1	a	A rudimentary Dino FPS, great game for 90 cents.
1005	0	a	Little Changed since I paid that 14.99 $ back in the day for Orion, graphically is Okay, but how the Dino's walk and attack, it's just NOT OKAY, why couldn't they take ideas from Turok with the Dinosaurs, the last Turok game that came out, was awesome as far as Dinosaurs are concerned. In this game here, since it came out, there are new maps and skins here and there for characters and Dinos, but nothing was improved either graphicaly or even gameplay wise, I would recommand this on steam sale for under 5 $, but not at a full price.
4675	1	a	REALLY CHEAP, REALLY FUN. MUST BUY FOR THE MONEY!!
4677	1	a	if its cheap get it ive played worse (black ops 2)
4679	1	a	BEST GAME NA, SO MUCH FUN TO PLAY WHEN TOTALLY BORED. TIMMY DOWN/10
1010	0	a	Just NO... I got so disappointed with this game.. Don't buy it..
1011	0	a	This game sucks, I paid $0.99 for this game on sale and I don't even think I got my moneys worth. My total play time isnt even a whole hour and half of that was firguring out how to play with friends. There is no strategy in the combat because all the dinoaurs out run you. Never buy this...
1012	0	a	Definetly not worth the money, even though I bought it during the $0.99 sale. Terrible game, early 2000's graphics, terrible animations, and unbelieveable amount of glitches. 0 stars and extremely not recommended to be bought, not fun at all.
1013	0	a	This game is broken beyond all hell and sucks DinoDick™  tl;dr When a game has a 36/100 metascore, DON'T BUY IT
4681	1	a	Anyone that says this isn't worth the 0.99 price is kidding themselves. If you can muster up 9 friends then this game will be a blast (just load up a server and play Vital mode). The second biggest drawback is that there is little documentation on setting server administration but if you have any experience at all with UDK you'll be fine. The absolute biggest drawback though is that multiplayer setup is handled poorly with password protection pretty much not working (so get your buddies to join your server quickly).  
1014	0	a	Not bad at All, game looks like playing Unreal Tournament Evasion with more features, dinos, and vehicles.   Good: +Dinosaurs +a lot of Perks  Bad: +UI need more improvements and more easy to look +No Tutorials  it's worth if you want to try or loving co-op games, i'm not recommended because the game still need change some features and gameplay. for me, thinking before buy this one
1015	0	a	I bought this game for $1 when it was on a steam for sale. It was definately worth it at the time even after all the bugs and horrible ai, I still found a way to have a decent gaming experience. But now the sale is gone and is now $15 so all I can say is do not get this game. My biggest pet peeves about this game is its massive frame drops making almost unplayable, from 40 frames down to 15 back to 30 down 20 and its not even a nice looking game at all, you could have a top tier gaming computers and you may have trouble running this game. Although if it ever drops the price point you might consider buying it since it does have some great moments but I should also warn you that this game totally copied their last game and resold you the same thing except maybe a few things changed here and there.
1016	0	a	Terrible game 0/10 needs work
1017	0	a	One of the video games of all time.
1018	0	a	This is possibly the worst game on steam, not worth 99 cents on sale and not worth your time
1019	0	a	I can not recommend this game to anyone. The graphic engine or the way they utilize it is horrible. I get framdrops down to 5fps with a GTX780 at times. The game is kinda fun the first hour or two, but after that it just blows.
4683	1	a	Often cited as 'The Halo series true origin', news of this gem have been spread widely through gaming communities. Regarded by many as the pinnicle of modern-day gaming, competing with such titles as Bad Rats, Mass Effect 3, and others of their caliber to take it's place upon the best of 2014. A true emotional thriller, bringing out the deepest reserves of the audience's primal urges in an accute reflection of modern societies, trying teamwork, testing courage, and pushing those who take the challenge to limits they never have never dreamed.  I shot a T-Rex in the head while flying with my jetpack, it was rad.
4685	1	a	For $1, this game is very fun. A little buggy, but very amazing. I bought this thinking 'Oh it's only $1. Might as well try it.' This ♥♥♥♥ is more fun than spending that $35 on 'Rambo The Game' and getting bored of it in the first 5 minutes. I still don't understand why it has a metascore of 36/100. It should be above 65/100 at least.  10/10 would play again.
4687	1	a	It's a game that has fun gamemodes and also theres diffrent kinds of weapons.Also you can upgarde to be better
4689	1	a	Kill Dinosaurs with a tank.  10/10
4691	1	a	I played it with friends and had a great time, but welp everything is better with friends... But this game isn't horrible and certainly you can have fun by yourself (especially since they added bot support),so for 1$? Hell YEAH, this game is worth it.
1021	0	a	game sucks. I wouldnt have bought it if it wasnt so dirt cheap.
4693	1	a	Great game 9/10 the 1 problem i do have is the lag 
4695	1	a	This metacritic is wrong on so many levels! I am a huge fan of killing floor and this is beyond epic for me! I started playing this yesterday but would have played so much more if I had gotten the time. I recommend anyone who is also a fan of Killing Floor to get this game! I promise you, you won't regret it!
4697	1	a	ORION: Dino Horde is a wonderful game involving, yes, you guessed it, pigs. The game opens up new possibilities in the genre of first-pigson shooters. It includes a variety of maps and gamemodes to spice up the normal pig-shooter formula, and many customizations to make your pig stand out from the rest. Additionally, the visuals in the game truly shine. I was amazed at the Xbox One's new pig physics engine, where even the curly tail is visible and incredibly detailed. Compared to the predecessor, ORION: Dino Beatdown, pig AI is vastly improved. Instead of running around attacking you for no reason, the enemies now act like real pigs! You can play as many different classes of humans to take down the evil pigs, such as Medic, Medic, and Medic. The Medic class is my personal favorite. As for the modes, there is classic Survival, Conquest (a longer version of survival), Gun Game, Team Deathmatch, and more. It even contains a rampage mode where you can play as a pig! I had a lot of fun oinking my way to victory against 3+ friends.   Overall, ORION: Dino Horde is a masterpiece. Spiral Game Studios has made a huge leap in game design. The game benefits greatly from new capabilities of next-gen gaming, and provides a new and refreshing experience for those tired of pig-related FPS. I give the game a solid 4/5 stars.
4699	1	a	Surprisingly Entertaining.
4701	1	a	This game is addicting. The instant you purchase this game, all of your friends will attempt to disassociate with you as fast as possible, so no one will play other games with you, and you will have nothing to do outside of games. This leaves you with three options: Literature, single player games, and school. Literature sucks, so that's out. Single player games like Skyrim all seem bland after the immersive cooperative experiences you face in ORION, so they're out. What's left is ORION, which, like a fine liquor, must be taken in small doses. Your life will become a tempest of ORION and nothingness, continually honing your dino horde removal skills lest the apocalypse occur while slowly devolving towards insanity in the breaks between ORION sessions. Eventually, like an alcoholic, the tradition and care that playing ORION carries will be replaced by a burning desire to play ORION, and do nothing but play ORION. The periods of insanity in between sessions become periods of insanity in between maps. You will turn to heroin and methamphetamines as a means of escape of these loading screens, hoping that as your perception of time dilates, the game of ORION will blur into one continuous stretch. ORION is the world, and the world is ORION. ORION is you, and you are ORION. Time and space are replaced by an infinite moment, a string that coils in upon itself forever, the Mobius strip, the Ourobouros, the infinite, of ORION. Eventually, your mind fades to black, and the last thing your mortal eyes can comprehend is the image of a triceratops foot stomping on a human face, forever.  10/10 would play again
4703	1	a	Protect the generator and kill dinos in co-op or kill each other in multiplayer mode. Many game modes to play and a good number of weapons and vehicles to kill dinos with. Level up your class and unlock perks and weapons as you go great game at a great price.
4705	1	a	People got excited for titanfall, just cause it was cod with a mech. This has that mech, and then theres dinos.  Check and mate.
4707	1	a	'It's like skyrim with guns with dinosaurs; It's okay I guess' - IGN 12/10
4709	1	a	i'm not so sure why this game has such a low meta score its not overly a bad game in any aspect the pvp fun (but slightly lag at some points) there is a nice selection of weapons, perks, veichals and other things the only thing i don't like is the limited amount of classes having on 3 (since last time i played) and its quite a bit of fun with some friends and you get to kill DINOSAURS, FREAKING HUGE BLOODY T-REX AND SPINOSAURS WHAT ELSE IS BETTER?!?!?!
1023	0	a	I dont know I played for a few minutes adn unless you KNOW what to do and your in multiplayer mode you'll be fine.
4711	1	a	great game so much to do. GET IT!!! worth the dollar
4713	1	a	many may look at the price and think the game is bad, but it's a fun game with wonderful graphics and solid game play over all 8.5/10 a hidden gem.
4715	1	a	I shot a dinosaur in the face and it threw a rock at me. 11/10 Would rock again.
4717	1	a	10/10 It's like Halo with dinosaurs PROS: -Always fun to play -Requires strategy and cooperation to take down large waves and large dinos -Large veriety of weapons and upgrades -Medeocre amount of vehicles -Small variety of special Dinosaurs -T-Rex underpowered -Spinosaurus extremely fun to fight (challenging because of speed, damage, health and size) -Interesting and original art choices and style -Missions are an interesting feature, not too challenging and premote moving around versus camping on a rock -This list can go on for a very long time  DOWNSIDES: -Needs more vehicle variety -Needs more special/boss Dinosaur variety -Needs more map variety
1024	0	a	This game is crap
4719	1	a	greatest game ive ever played 
4721	1	a	Far from perfect, but still incredibly fun. AI needs a little bit of fine-tuning and the whole game could use a coat of polish, but that doesn't detract from it being good fun.
4723	1	a	got eaten by a giant crocodile and a T-Rex in less than 5 minutes 12/10
4725	1	a	This game is dank m8, go full sanic on that purchase button. 10.5/10 Skyrim with lube.
4727	1	a	Awesome game. I wish i had more time to play it.
4729	1	a	ever since they added hats i would say that this is the best game NA.

4733	1	a	Very glad this developer stuck with their game, they have turned it into something unique and fun. Nothing like gathering some friends and taking on hordes of dinosaurs together. A solid FPS action, my heart still pumps when i see a T-Rex trying the bite my head off and the panic when a pterodactyl grabs and flys you high in the sky. Great price as well.
4735	1	a	Good game. Dinosaurs, Vehicles, FPS, Huge Maps, lots of game modes, Has a level up system similar to Killing Floor, very easy to find your friends and play with them (unlike 80% of the crap out there that advertises multiplayer then never actually being able to play with your buddies). And who doesn't like hunting dinosaurs? Also border line educational as you find yourself remembering lots of dinosaur names you previously thought you had forgotten or never even knew. Highly recommended. :)
4737	1	a	Crashed a vehicle into a T-Rex, vehicle exploded, died trying to fight off T-Rex with a pistol. 10/10 GOTY 
4739	1	a	What a real man should do before death: achieve triangle with two hot chicks, eat kebab and kill dino using futuristic weapon!!! Now I have 66% of life achievements! : D
4741	1	a	10/10 - Best game ever. Must buy, the gameplay is amazing, the mechanics are perfect. Everything right down to the core of the game has been refined for your pleasure by these loving indie developpers. Support these great people by buying this game.
4743	1	a	Got stuck between two rocks; had to amputate entire body with explosives to escape. 127/127
4745	1	a	Very fun. and at the moment only a dollar
4747	1	a	This game is proof that meta scores don't always tell you how good a game really is.   10/10
1025	0	a	Do NOT waste your time and/or money on this game.  To join a server, you have to wait until the current wave is over. If you die, you can't respawn until the current wave is over. What the ♥♥♥♥. You could be sitting there for over ten minutes waiting to respawn. That is basically unacceptable.  It's like it was designed by someone who has never played an online FPS.   Stick to TF2. Forget this piece of ♥♥♥♥.
4749	1	a	It has dinosaurs. And guns. And I got it for free.
4751	1	a	Jetpacks and dinosaurs, what more do you realy want?
4753	1	a	You get to shoot dinos with a mech and punch a T-rex in the face to death 9/10 would recomend Also did I mention HATS!!!
4755	1	a	I don't have much experience and I bought it later last year to play with some friends, but they decided it wasn't worth playing. However, I had a great time playing it and I would easily recommend it to anyone who likes or appreciates a good first person/third person shooter.
4757	1	a	THIS IS ♥♥♥♥ING AWESOME!!!!!!!!!   100/100
4759	1	a	So terrible, it's pure entertainment and fun with friends. Get it if you want a bad game with almost no redeeming qualities which can remain entertaining for how broken it can get.
4761	1	a	It's ok i guess
4763	1	a	Best game ever put cod,borderlands, and a little team fort 2 and you get this game for a $1 each or just buy four and give thme to your friends trust me you will have a good time
4765	1	a	This game is soooo much fun and very addicting! Best .99 I've ever spent. I bought this for a friend as well. As the waves get bigger, it just gets more and more fun. The hit points are similar to Borderlands, and its cool that you still get credit and XP based on the percent of damage you've done to a dino before it dies. So even if someone finishes off a dino you pumped a lot of rounds into, you still get a portion of the xp and credit.
4767	1	a	It's $0.99 for endless dinosaur kills :D, what more could you hope to ask for? Killing dinosaurs in real life isn't even close to the amount of fun you'll have in this game!
4769	1	a	a really really bad game. i regret every cent i spent in paying for this ♥♥♥♥ game. please do not buy it. let it die. let my shame die along with it.
4771	1	a	Nice, fighting dinosaur with an assortment of weapons and vehicles, team work and a lot of gamemodes, worth to try.
4773	1	a	I cant understand all the negative reviews! The gamemode are great, expecially survival and with 3-4 friends its incredibly fun. Multiplayer is a different thing. The servers are often filled with griefers and its just not fun.Anyway, 0,99 is a super cheap price for this great game and you wont regret buying it.
4775	1	a	You get to fight Trex' wearing big hats. What more could you want?
4777	1	a	It was decently amusing but in the end the limited animation and detail was just too unmoistening and I got bored. I'm sure very young children would enjoy it a lot though, as long as they aren't intelligent enough to of been spoiled by the more advanced FPS games out there.
4779	1	a	Very entertaining! quite addicting with the right team too!
4781	1	a	Great fun when playing with friends!
4783	1	a	brilliant game, love being the disosaurs, mecanics are very good, graphics almost perfect, controll pretty good,    could have more controll over server settings, and could have a storyline mode or carrer mode or something
4785	1	a	Not enough anime tities. 9/11 i would jihad for this game.
4787	1	a	Got firefighter hat then proceeded to flip people off in Multiplayer. 420/69 would flip them off again.  [UPDATE! 2/22/2015] So, I decided to play longer and make a better review.  Pros: + Nice looking eviroment and dinos + Nice players that never kick Low levels + Different classes with a few personal set of skills + Massive maps for Conquest (Base taking mode) + A Human vs. Human and Human vs. Dino PvP + Weather changes during game + AMAZING lighting (Not really a pro, but I love the lighting system. ;w;)  Cons: - Player models are... Not the greatest. - Some animations are a bit weird and stiff for players and dinos alike.  So, my over-all score for this would be...  8.5/10  I love this game. It's fun with friends and randoms.
4789	1	a	this feels like doing meth and then questioning all your life choices  but its only a dollar so lose yourself
4791	1	a	I'm still trying to figure out why I like this game. It's so awful but there's also something appealing about it besides the incredibly low price tag. It's a game that tricks you into thinking that it's good. You know for a fact that it's one of the worst things ever, but it's hard to deny that it's actually quite fun to play with friends.  What can I say? It's cheap as dirt so grab a friend or a couple friends and go kill some mindless dinosaurs. Defend your base, augment your abilities, buy some new guns, hop in a mech or tank, enjoy the diverse weather system, and then die at the very last round.  Final Verdict: (3.2 out of 5)
4793	1	a	fun for 2h, then, it Sucks a$$
4795	1	a	This is, im my opinion, the best game I have played, if I were to compare this game to any else, it would be impossible as it is the best experience you could possibly have. This game has never been beaten nor it will be beat in the coming generations as it has features that other games have not yet compared to.  ORION: Prelude is a wonderful and exciting game to play, it has graphics so good it could not be matched, personally whilst playing this masterpiece of a game, I felt like I was really experiencing the game IN REAL LIFE!!!  While playing with my many friends on this game, I have come to realise that the co-op/multiplayer is the best I have ever encountered!  Playing the new games in this generation seems to be too mainsteam and unrealistic but while playing this game with my buddies, the EXCITEMENT AND JOY can not be compared to other 'Boring and Laggy' Multiplayer games.  Overall I rate this Game 10/10, as features, connection to servers, co-op/multiplayer and fun you get out of this game could not be compared to other games in this generation.  ~Pingu~     
4797	1	a	Worth of it's price. this game is cheap at it's full price and on Steam sales it's even cheaper. I expected a game that is fun for couple of minutes and I got what i wanted. Although 4 pack was a waste in my case, since none of my friends that i gave it to wanted to play with me, but if you buy it for yourself, It's great!   The only problem i have with this game is that there are some small bugs and i think it could be optimalised just a bit better. I've met the recommended requirements and have to play on low quality to make sure it runs smoothly. But that's a minor complaint.
4799	1	a	You shoot Dinosaurs.... 10/10
4801	1	a	Just going to say DINO HORDE IS DINORIFI-Well Im ♥♥♥♥ing lame. IT's AMAZING
4803	1	a	Worth the money
4805	1	a	At first I was sceptical, then i decided ''Why not?'' And bought the game for 99cents... Best 99 cent spend ever!!! Really amazing graphics and dinosaur precision... Definiatly check it out! Awesome weapons and team work.. Also Sweet Vehicals for you to have fun with.. Running over Raptors is the best!!!!
4807	1	a	It's cheap, it's fun, why the hell not? Plus theres guns and dinos, GUNS AND DINOS.
4809	1	a	You literally run around slaughtering dinosaurs with your friends. It is my civil duty to recommend this game and yours to buy it.
4811	1	a	This is the most ♥♥♥♥ game I have ever played and I will never get my time and money back. This is the only game I have ever played that I actually regret playing and feel like my life was legitimately wasted.
4813	1	a	A round based dinosaur survival which can be team based or solo. I would recommend this game as it is good quality and fun for the price tag.
4815	1	a	I don't understand anything. But I shot a T-Rex in the eye, and it died.   10/10
4817	1	a	Dino Mayhem. It has it's flaws, it is very arcadey, but it is great fun with a team. Close to unplayable with randoms or by yourself.
4819	1	a	Dank M8  totally worth more than $1
1027	0	a	So Bad Game ! Fail in Graphic and Gameplay ! Problem in PING  BUG BUG BUG ..... WTF
4821	1	a	Clearly the developers were high while playing Halo and watching Jurassic Park at the same time.  11/10.
4823	1	a	its good buy now its only 1eu
4825	1	a	This game it's masively muliplayer and very nice price =&gt;&gt; Best dinosaur survive ever ! Ilove this game because this game it's awesome ! I don't say this , all people and me say this !
4827	1	a	This is a great game, cheaper then CSGO skins and its fun. the most fun you will have with $1!
4829	1	a	this game is the ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ mate play this game is sick as HELLL
4831	1	a	i realy like pony's so i recommend this game
4833	1	a	Pretty chill game. You slaughter hordes of dinos. It's a pretty typical survival, with wave after wave coming after you, though the number of waves is limited. It's worth it for the price (it's been having good sales) if you like the sort of thing. Also, brownie points for glorious dino-slaying!
1028	0	a	How the heck does a game get progressively worse with time? Somehow ORION: Dino Horde accomplished that. This game used to be a fun coop game in the same vein as Killing Floor, except with dinosaurs and vehicles. Now the community is dead and I can see why with the extreme lag that gets worse with every update.
4835	1	a	its a good game but i have a problem.My friend bought me a copy of this game but its not in my libary and when i try to play it ,it says that i have to buy it .can any ony help me D: 
4837	1	a	Orion: Prelude, more like Orion PreLUBE ME UP AND TOUCH MY ♥♥♥♥ THIS IS GOOD.  Not as catchy but I feel like the 2015 GOTY Edition Should be named that.  My Review- Ever wanted to be sent back in time and forced to shoot pixels at larger pixels making 18bit roars that you pretend you can hear so you dont instult the artistic immersion of this 2017 GOTY Blockbuster. Then this is the game for you. It has been designed with such pazaz that even Micheal Bay would be put to shame.   As for the graphics; they are so sharp and crisp I really believed I was sent back to 240p Jurrassic Era to slay Pixel mosters. The MMO elements work so well. You get all the satisfaction of playing WOW (staying a virgin for life, being fat and contemplating suicide) but it occurs even faster as the community is so polite. Honesty is the #1 Policy with these kind kiddos. They're all so honest as they're all 'banged my mum'.   The story is truely the most immersive experience since the holocaust. It's the most realistic story of any Pixel Dinosaur FPS Potato Teir PC Blockbuster in the history of this Klan.  The developers are a small team of PJ wearers from Tennessee. They have simple values, slaying blacks, white supremecy. The stuff us normies are too afraid to admit. They stand for whats right. AND OMG Their XMAS decorations are the best. They string up black folks on trees. So romantic. Regardless they're storming the white house soon to remove the ape who kidnapped Mr Bush. Y'all should join in. Unless y'alls some filthy ape lovers....  Regardless, 10/10 game with and amazing multiplayer, Potato Teir Graphics to make even the IRA proud, and last but not least a small indie team that has true murican beliefs. MURICA
4839	1	a	Jurassic Park on PCP.
4841	1	a	All time best purchase in the whole of today!

4849	1	a	plz get this game it is the best dino game ever
4851	1	a	I'm going to hesistantly say, yes I recommend Orion: Dino Horde.  It's definitely buggy. Animations seem a little stiff and unvaried. Graphics could use some... umph. I don't mean to say the graphics are bad and I see the style he has chosen, they just lack something.   I agree with some others that the weapons lack the variance and power they should. It often feels like I firing tiny lasers. Maybe the dinos need some sort of hit animation/ows***Ijustgothitbyabullet twitch? As much as I dislike Battlefield as a franchise, they do at least that much well.  The dino AI definitely needs some tweaking. And those f****** pterodactyls. F*** them.  Aside from that, the core elements are there, and can be very fun at times. I'm only afraid that this game will get tossed aside as the developer tries to promote his next game, 'The Orion Project'. To the Dev: It's going to be awful hard to make another game if you don't polish up the one you have now.  Summary: Fun, but unfinished.
4853	1	a	Not as bad as people say it is. Preety darnn good lol
1032	0	a	10/10 would recommend
1033	0	a	I think these devs only get money on this 'cause it's like a dollar to fifty cents at times and then someone thinks 'Oh, I can make a funny video about this game'. I assure you this title is not something you should play lightly. I have played most first person shooters of my era and this is nearly the worst one out of all of them that also tries to present itself as a finished game. 3/10 I made a video and wrote a review for it.
4855	1	a	I love this game, why? like they said 'The Metascore is misleading' is true, it is a fun ♥♥♥ game if you really try it. Beside, I bet you will enjoy this game without doubt.So, why should I explain it to you ? you should try it yourself and see for yourself. xD
4857	1	a	So i bought this game because it was a really cheap for a 4 pack during the summer sale. i can say i was not really expecting much, but i was pleasently surprised. i actually found this game to be very fun. There are some things like the match making, tutorial, and getting to the base between rounds. A lot of time you don't have time to get to the base to get the upgrades. Also a better single player would be nice, but i understand this was made to be a multiplayer game. i would give it an 8/10.
4859	1	a	This game brings back a lot of nostalgia from other games made in the past using the Unreal engine. It plays good, things work fine and there are some handy features to adjust some options.  There are plenty of modes; pvp and pve are a lot of fun, from killing dinosaurs, or suddenly finding Santa trying to kill you with presents.  This game is hilarious and fun. If you love FPS/TPS games or just for the fun you can have with this game, I would recommend this game to play alone, with random people or just with some friends. 
4861	1	a	cool game AAAAAAAAA+
4863	1	a	this game is so awsome 
4865	1	a	You paying only 99 cents, you can play the great game like paying 59 dollars 99 cents.  Very fun, many mode, good graphic, but you paying only 99 cents.  It's the best!!!
4867	1	a	I rode around and killed a T-rex on my jeep with a machine gun mounted on it, shortly after, a Triceratops came from around a rock and ambushed it, hurling it 50 feet up into the air. It then blew up and i nearly died but escaped. Once out I hid in a dead stegosaurus's hollow body to shelter from the hordes of raptors. 10/10 especially with friends

4871	1	a	Classic survival game,can be fun with a friend and there is a lots of achievements for hunters!Graphics are not that bad there is a day and night cycle and rainy weather.8/10
1038	0	a	Poor quality, redundent gameplay.
1039	0	a	If I didn't get it for only 99cents I might feel some serious buyer's remorse. Definitely not worth $15.00 let alone the 99cents. Clunky controls, unpolished game-modes, cookie-cutter builds, and shoddy environments.
1040	0	a	Crashes when i change mouse sensitivity or anything else in options. Not buggy anymore my perforated ♥♥♥♥.

4873	1	a	Don't believe the metacritic rating. Fantastic constantly updated co-op shooter in the style of L4D. Here's to hoping that dinosaurs are the new zombies.
4875	1	a	All time best purchase in the whole of today!
4877	1	a	This is game is really good and fun. There is not much to say I guess, just that it's pretty fun and LOTS OF DINOSAURS. GO GET IT NOW!
4879	1	a	Gripping the turret mounted on the back of a transport vehicle, You can hear the guns barrels spinning as a cloud of bullets rips into the head of Tyrannosaurus Rex himself. The ice covered Tundra of the games conquest mode seems fresh as our group of four sets out to claim the first generator. Wave One hasn't started yet, and I have already found more enjoyment in this game then I did with most other titles I play, and I'll let you know why. First of all, if you buy this game looking for the First Person Shooter aspect, where you roam killing Dinosaurs, you have the wrong game. Sadly this title isn't the best feeling shooter on the Market, although at the core it is a well rounded combat system. If you want max enjoyment from this game, get some of your PC gaming friends that 'Play well with others' start a Steam Chat Room, turn on your mics, and engage in what could be one of the most thrilling CO-OP Shooters you will ever play. There is just something gratifying about leading an armada of VTOL warships across the frozen earth only to reign death upon everything in your way. Or Emptying the magazine of an Assault Rifle into a horde of Raptors as your team struggles to regain supremacy over the swarm of Dinos. If you are looking for the most fun you can have with a group of friends, look no further. As soon the game finishes the install process you and your buddies will be cutting through the Prehistoric, one bullet at a time. 10/10
4881	1	a	wtf were those guys smoking when they made this
4883	1	a	alright so... i tired it for a few mins and i can say right away that:  -yes this game worth buying considering the price. -yes considering the price it is satisfaying. -'cute' with friends i guess... -nice costumization.  -Horibble game in my opinion  .. yes considering the price its awesome but let me tell u this:  the animations are misplaced (i ran with a gun and my hand and the gun ran diffrent timing and directions) graphics are kinda ok... sound is ok too  the game works fine but those things i said and in general... not rly fun so i would reccomand it just bcuz of the AMAZINGLY LOW PRICE! 
4885	1	a	Love it for everything about it 
1043	0	a	Free week? More like free waste of time! Not even worth 0.99.  It feels like a mashup of Primal Carnage &amp; Tribes: Ascend...  With loads of bugs, horrible animations &amp; lack of originality (it features Lightsabers, Dinosaurs, Jetpacks, and.... basically nothing new...).  Don't waste your time or money on this.
4887	1	a	great game.
4889	1	a	Orion: Prelude is a mixed bag, but definitely a lot of fun...and for the price you really can't go wrong. Co-op with friends is a total blast.  Also, dinosaurs!
4891	1	a	Great game so far!
4893	1	a	This is a game where you run around doin' I don't ♥♥♥♥ing know or care shooting pictures of dinosaurs ten outta ten hundred outta a hundred best game BEST GAME
4895	1	a	A good game to screw around in, if you fancy a coop game of driving around it a turrented jeep, while your friend uses the turrent to kill the bigguns, you simply run over the smaller one. Or if you fancy a minor challenge go to conquest and save up cash for a helicopter and then rain death and destruction on the ground. Not complicated, fun to play, and easier to adapt too i reccomend this game
4897	1	a	get eaten by big a$$ dino 10/10
4899	1	a	The game has its issues like the bug of when you host the server and when you use voice chat everyone can hear you but when they use voice chat you can't hear them.  The game is great and I've played a few matches with the developers and they are cool, fun to play with but they are mostly silent. Its fun if you like pvp or team based wave survival. Not to mention the two event maps with two hard boss battles that once you beat unlockd a special hat in your loadout, Which the developers should add more of those maps like an easter map, valentines day map, new years map. It would be cool, if you got 99 cents to spend i recommend you spend it on this game because this is the cheapest and most addicting game i have ever played! good going developers! keep up the good work and i hope you guys add more maps and secret unloackables to this game to keep us completionists busy!
4901	1	a	Great game. Metascore is dated from it's last name and title. Wait for another sale if you want it, but definitely get it.  Easily one of the best games for it's price, runs on unreal engine.    Maybe a little too much bloom though. lol.
4903	1	a	A fps with a planetary prehistoric feel. Co-op and pvp elements mixed with rpg and an interesting line of guns and augments. Face a unique line of dinos whom are not tooo happy with humans discovering and harvesting the resources of their planet.  11/24/13 First i'll personally apologise to the devs for such a late update to my review.... Over a year has passed and the devs were true to the word. Dino horde is at a state that i would recomend it to any gamer, casual or pro. Dino horde has also become much much more than a survival co-op. They have added pvp and over 5 more different pvp and co-op modes.
4905	1	a	This is seriously one of the most ♥♥♥♥ed up games I've ever played.......
4907	1	a	Great game, my recommendations!!!!!!!!
4909	1	a	If you're looking for a simple and fun shooter that you can easily jump into with some mates, this one is it. There are a few frustrating quirks (like not being able to join back into an active round once you die or if you leave) and you need a high tolerance for frustration -- those dinos can be ruthless. If you can stand that and want a game with a bit of a challenge, ORION: Dino Horde is a great choice.   Just don't try and play it on your own - the difficulty curve on the higher levels isn't something you want to tackle on your own.   The devs are very responsive in the forums and it's telling that you'll always find people dropping into your game between rounds if you're playing a 'Public' game.  
4911	1	a	You get to learn about some pre-historic dinosaurs! Your knowledge has improved 10 folds. 10/10
1050	0	a	This Game Suffers From Bad Frame Rates Graphics And Thrilling Fights I Mean Cmon They Could Of NAILED The Huge Dinosaur Boss Battles  But It Was Just Another Small Dinosaur With Bigger Mass So No I Dont Like The Game Final Verdict 5/10....Just Because I liked The Lazer Katana
4913	1	a	-SAMPLE TEXT-....AIR HORNS.....HIT MARKERS.......even if your pc can handle this game it may not be able TO HANDLE THIS GAME....10/9-IGN
1058	0	a	When i've played it, it was very crazy! But the problem for me was a bit laggy really because i'm using my laptop. I don't think it's recommended for the other steam users who has a poor condition on their computers because it's just a little lag problem really.
1059	0	a	Glitchy and unfinished. Elements taken out of flash games. No story and terrible voice acting. Horrible graphics. Perfect game 11/10.
1060	0	a	This game is absolute garbage, whoever wrote those quotes were either psychotic or a moron. I got this game fo 99 cents and I overpaid, if I could take this game and wipe my ♥♥♥ with it I wouldn't. Because it is to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ for even my ♥♥♥. 0.01/10
1061	0	a	This game is as if Satan and Hitler had a baby.
1062	0	a	It's bad.
1063	0	a	I honestly dont like it that much it just feels improper, the #1 thing that annoys me is the vocals, they sound like scottish people who dident put any effort into voice acting. This new update just makes the game look like for kids now, and the taunts are just .. Wow.    Still worth the price though.
1064	0	a	Just watch this, it explains it all the best I can:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCY_jaCFMdw 
4915	1	a	when you rub poop on the monitor the game looks a little better
4917	1	a	its halo....its turok....its awesome! love this game if you buy it let me know ill play!!
4919	1	a	super fun with friends
4921	1	a	Got it for £0.99. That's so good for the money. Probably will get something like 15-20 hrs out of it. Really fun MULTIPLAYER game. To compare it, I'd say it is exactly like killing floor... but in the style of Halo... but against dinosaurs, with big boss dinosaurs like T-rex's. Pretty fun. 8/10.
4923	1	a	i paid opne dollar for this and it has to be the best dam dollar ive ever spent if you have friends this is a freaking blast :D
1065	0	a	Fighting dinosaurs is boring, and the PvP is the worst I've ever seen. Aiming is unreliable, the game lags with 64 ping when 4 people are shooting, its terrible.  Dino D-Day is a much better game if you want to shoot dinosaurs.
4925	1	a	It's like Halo with Dinosaurs! ( º ͜ʖ º)
4927	1	a	Finally!! A survival dinasaur game! You need a good computer to run amazing graphics but other than that this is a really fun game.
4929	1	a	THIS GAME COST LESS THAN A PACK OF GUM, AND IT GAVE ME MORE FUN THAT A PACK OF GUM. YOU MAY BE ASKING WHAT I CAN DO WITH A PACK OF GUM THAT IS EQUALLY AS FUN AS ORION: DINO HORDE? SHOVING THAT GUM UP YOUR ♥♥♥ THEN BLOWING BUBBLES WITH YOUR GAS IS JUST AS FUN.
4931	1	a	In the famous words of george bush, 'i did 9/11' This single statement by our former president perfectly describes what you would do to get a copy of this game. This game, coded as a collaborative project between william shakespeare and God himself, is a masterpiece of modern society. People always say that games like ARMA and HOtoful Boyfriend are real simulators, but this game takes the simulation to an entirely new level. In no other game or simulator will you ever feel like you are actually killing hordes of dinosaurs, never will you feel like you are actually going to be eaten and digested by a T-rex. In my short time so far playing this game, i have already contracted severe PTSD and need to scream myself asleep every night in fear that the dinosaurs will come back and rule the world, but thanks to this game, i will be ready to fight them. This game is worth 80 times more than steam is currently listing it, and should be fixed, i bought 40 copies of this game to give to all my friends, just so they too could be graced with the elegance and beuaty that is this work of art. I already know of more than 17 individual people who have attempted to infiltrate fort knox just to get money to buy 9 million copies of this game for the entire country of Sweden to play. Overall the game is perfect and at this point addition to the game whould only degrade its quality. You should spend no less than $144,760 for this game for not just you but everyone you have ever met. (9.00*10^100)/10
4933	1	a	It's an OK game. Fun to be in the Jurassic Park guys' shoes. The dinos scare the ♥♥♥♥ out of me.
4935	1	a	Best $0.50 I've ever spent!!! This game is addicting!
4937	1	a	Better than crysis 2
4939	1	a	AHHHHH!  DINOSAURS!  Games goes F2P -&gt; salty players that paid for it rant -&gt; games goes P2P It's not like that stop TF2 from being F2P, although granted at least you got a hat! 
4941	1	a	What kind of game is this? A $0.99 Game. Can't argue with that logic.
1069	0	a	Don't buy this, I have a god computer and I can't run this on low setting, one level it went to night and started raining, and for the first time ever, I had to turn the gamma on my computer up. FPS was around 13 and I wanter to kill myself
4943	1	a	Ready for a little Joy-fun, Beautiful Family? ®™ ;)
4945	1	a	ORION: Prelude is really simple. Just get your damned weapons and shoot the damned dinosaur. Recommended weapon would be rocket launcher. P.S. I don't remember much of this game.
4947	1	a	I just spent money buying skins on ORION dino horde... i immediately regretted it. 10/10  Edit: Still regret it Keepo
1071	0	a	Wouldnt recommend, but for $1 it has some laughs
1072	0	a	im not gonna waste my time telling you how bad this game is, but its so poorly made I could not join or start a game.
1073	0	a	Crashes on startup
1074	0	a	Hands down one of the most boring games I have ever played. I suppose if you're interested in killing waves of dinosaurs in mundane locations you may enjoy this game, but the game is awfully boring hence the dollar price tag and constant sale for .50 cents. Plus you have the fact the developer is shady and probaly about to be sued.  'Just so people are aware, this game's name use to be Orion Dino Beat Down, and they changed the name and re released it multiple times as a new game just to keep people from seeing all of the negative feedback it was getting. This is the same game that utilizes stolen assets and the head of Trek Industries, formerly spiral game studios fired the real team working on it just before release without paying them. I'm writing this review now because they are attempting to get out of a DMCA and possible suit of their new game 'Orion' where they are literally doing the same exact thing and trying to play the victim. I bought this game before even knowing all of this, and felt so dirty for doing so, and im hoping and urging people away from buying into this mistake and scum of a company.' - ViziTronMan 
4949	1	a	This game reminds me of the older Halo multiplayer. This game is without a doubt worth $.49. I mean its not perfect. It has bugs and glitches but its only $.49 so you really cant complain. If I had to decribe this game, It would be Halo 2 +Dinosuars += Awesomeness
1076	0	a	Wouldnt recommend, but for $1 it has some laughs
4951	1	a	''The most fun I've had since watching a hippo with explosive diarrhea. 10/10''
4953	1	a	play at free week. I think it is well worth playing.   some may call it junk, says the textures are outdate or something ,but I do have some fun from it.  The game play is simple and easy, the open world environment , the foes,the gameplay remind me of the game --Earth Defense Force: Insect Armageddon, which few people know about ,but I think they are quite alike .  Lower you expectation. Buy it if you like to enjoy simple fun game , and you would have more fun from onlineplay. Good to see that the dev team is still updating the game ,adding some new map and feature.  I'll give it a 7 out of 10.
4955	1	a	A 'Sci-Fi FPS' is quite a mouthful. But let me tell you, it's a mouthfull well worth it!  First of all, the game is just 99 cents. That's honestly a great deal for a game like ORION: Prelude that offers so much. The game has a pretty simplistic storyline; you fight dinosaurs. I will tell you the storyline is kinda weak, but in all honesty, did you pay a dollar for the storyline, or to fight dinosaurs?  The gameplay runs pretty smooth. The graphics are pretty nice, but only real complaint is that the dinosaurs are kinda generic, but again, it was only a dollar.  The game is downright fun, especially with friends. I'd reccomend this game; all you really have to lose is a dollar if you don't like it.
4957	1	a	For a while, I was looking for a game that I could pick up and play without remorse. Orion takes everything that's fun about shooters and combines it into one package... with dinosaurs. You've got dinosaurs, laser-swords, jetpacks, tanks, mechs, and gorgeous level design.   The standard survival mode is a blast. Basically, you fight waves of dinosaurs that get harder each wave. Every now and then, you have to caputre an objective that's swarming with raptors. As the waves get harder, your access to powerful vehicles improves. But that doesn't mean you feel safe in a tank with a spinosaurus, t-rex, and triceratops around.   With the release of Orion: Prelude, there's a new game mode that lets two opposing teams kill waves and earn credits, which they can spend on upgrades for themselves or detriments for the other team. You can pay to increase the frequency of enemy hordes or even to send a t-rex at them. There are tons of other game modes, too, depending on what kinds of shooters you like to play. THere are 3 classes, all with different upgrades, and a bunch of different dinosaurs that are even playable in certain modes.   If this game isn't fun, I don't know what is. Orion gets 10 pouncing raptors out of 10 power-jumps.
1089	0	a	steam pls
1090	0	a	This is survival of the fittest. Or the sickest. In this case. Do you like Halo? Well, you'll at least get the interface of the old Halo: Combat Evolved. Even though this game is built with Unreal Engine 3, it looks like an old PS2 game. This game has an incredibly broken AI, bad graphics and looks like it was designed within a lunch break by two drunk students.  This is not even remotely funny. Until you add friends. Then it gets slightly better. Maybe a little more than 'slightly'. Don't have any friends? Don't pick it up. Got friends? Go play something else. Seriously.  If this sounds harsh, I'm sorry, it is meant to be. If you are looking for something positive, look at the price tag and the fact,  that it's still being updated and recieves improvements well after release.
4959	1	a	This game is gr8 would buy for my friends and i again.
4961	1	a	Holy crap! So much fun for such a low cost!   Pros:
4963	1	a	This game had a horrendous start. The developers; however, stuck with it. They are constantly working to fix issues, and add new content. They also crave community feedback. It's nice to be a part of a game like that. The game is immensely fun. The visuals aren't the best, but they are quite adequate. The animations (raptors) are laughable, but the solid gameplay, large variety of weapons, the different playstyles of the classes, map and mode variety, and the occasional hilarious bug (i.e. a Rex that flies threw the air upon death) make this game an incredible experience that I keep coming back to. Grab some friends or lone wolf it and frag some dinos!
1091	0	a	This game is so terrible! How do you mess up a game with dino's and jetpacks? idk but somehow they did. save your self the cash and just play litterally any other game
1092	0	a	This game rips off so many other games, and it does it poorly, the animations are horrible and the overall quality is bad. It tries very hard to mimic games like Halo, and it even has an in-game cash shop. It's not even F2P! This is one of the worst games I have ever played, there is so little content and there is almost no depth. I recommend this game if you are mentally unstable.
1093	0	a	It's not really that good, and even though I have only played it for a few minutes, I can tell already. It's mainly the controls, they feel pretty weird and don't work well. Good thing I played it on a free week instead of paying 15 bucks for it. 3.5/10 
4965	1	a	seriously one of the most fun games ive played in a long time!!!!!!!!!
4967	1	a	It's good. It's *really* good. But it's not $14.99 worth of good. Unless you have nothing else to spend $14.99 on. *Then* it's that good.
4969	1	a	Yes this game is awesome it might seem lame but it is totaly worth it.
4971	1	a	I got into my first game. I ran into my first dino to kill.  As soon as I started getting attacked, my xbox controller (which I wasn't using to play) started using the vibrators in it.  My whole desk started shaking, scaring my friend and 2 cats. The cats ran from the room like Satan was after their poop holes.  I will report back once I have played more.
4973	1	a	So good! Got it on sale for cheap and is very replay-able!
4975	1	a	Much better than when it was called 'Dino Beatdown' (that when the metacritic score got so low too), the developers have addressed most of the issues and added content.  However, its still not brilliant. You may find it worth it if you can find it on sale (like it is at the time of writing).  
4977	1	a	Makes my balls soft
4979	1	a	PERFECT GAME! lONG AS YOU DONT LAG ON IT YOU WILL HAVE LOTS OF FUN, much better than primal and dino d day.
4981	1	a	Want to play a 2nd first person shooter? Try this game out! Its like team fortress 2! 
4983	1	a	7/10
4985	1	a	This is an amazing game, i use an Intel core i7 laptop with 8GB RAM and this game plays beautifully :) i reccommend it to anyone who likes dinosaurs and guns.
4987	1	a	I got eaten by a Spinosaurus. If you don't know what that is, it's basically Godzilla before Godzilla. If you fps games, or dinosaurs, or both then buy this game. It's so fun. If you don't like dinosaurs.... then ♥♥♥♥ you.
4989	1	a	I Was Flying with my Jetpack and killed a TRex with a Sniper Rifle Headshot in Slowmo 10/10
4991	1	a	I played with a latency of 950, but still killed some dinos 10/10
4993	1	a	Pretty good fps co-op game but going on solo it is insanely hard to kill the biggest dinos while they try to kill you. I would say 8.9/10
1096	0	a	This game blows nuts
1097	0	a	DO NOT BUY THIS GAME  PIECE OF ♥♥♥♥  ♥♥♥♥ THIS GAME  Even though the game is $1 right now, dont buy it.
4995	1	a	Played singleplayer Got eaten by a T-REX  Played multiplayer pwnt everyone   10/10
4997	1	a	I actually bought this game and now it's free to play ? Lmao get it while it's free it's a cool game and nice graphics.
4999	1	a	Hey you! yeah you! do you have one dollar? if so buy this game! its cool
5001	1	a	Even though this game isn't perfect, it has a number of bugs and has gotten a lot of negative critique, I must say: it's fun. It really is! It isn't that fun to play alone, but with friends the game is super fun. If you're into dinosaurs and like FPS games, you should really give this game a try. I'm really enjoying it.  Also, the developers are really active and talk to the community, and they release patches often with more content to explore and bug fixes.
5003	1	a	This game is fantastic fun. Bought it on sale as joke but it surpassed my expections and the bad reveiws.   Explore detailed scenary filled with freaking dinosaurs then you're defending your base from waves fo the buggers. Easily to get to grips with, fanstic fun with friends, good interface and ballanced. All in all a great game, deserves more credit than it gets.   It feels like a work in progress but it gets better with each update, the artic update signifcant improvement. Weather works well and the buildings are good. The vehicles look and feel good, you can play as 3 classes or 10 dinosaurs. It's not a blockbuster game but it's fast becoming a favourite, easily up there with tf2 and l4d2 as a fun multiplier game. If you like those games with a bit of influence Halo and dinosaurs, you'll probably love this.
5005	1	a	Jesus, Everything i do needs to be Redone.  Dinosaurs, Guns, Jetpacks. Starwars. Jurassic Park. Do you people want MORE?!
1103	0	a	Completely and utterly awful.
5007	1	a	It's...actually pretty fun. There's a pseudo Killiing Floor aspect to it in that you level up each of the three classes, gaining new passive abilities for each one as you go, and those persist across games. Shooting dinosaurs with guns is dumb fun in the best way, and every aspect of the title has been significantly revisited since the last free weekend. I hated this game the last time I played it, but I can see myself playing this somewhat regularly now. For a dollar, there is no reason not to check out Dino Horde.  Quick update to mention something I forgot to earlier, the game has a 'cash shop' in it that seems really out of place in a paid title. It's all really rather ♥♥♥♥♥♥ looking cosmetic items, though if you have a dollar or two to spare in your Steam Wallet you may be tempted to purchase a camoflauge for your character so you aren't the standard blue. It's worth noting you can unlock a camo, a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ looking hat, and some other dumb thing just by earning achievements, so if cosmetics are a big deal to you, don't feel like you are being forced to spend more.
5009	1	a	ORION: Dino Horde is pretty damn good. Survival Gameplay has 10 Waves of increasingly stronger Dinosaurs to fight, and your experience is more rewarding the longer you survive; dieing has the consequences of losing all upgrades, augments, and weapons you purchased during that life. This usually turns away or dissuades people who aren't good at surviving from continuing to play.  Multiplayer is difficult when playing with random people, but I blame that on practically nobody having a mic or speaking english. Communication itself is also practically nil, and most players (That I've encountered) will be more focused on rushing through the game, wasting resources and vehicles, and often dieing a lot in the process. To better enjoy a Survival match, I suggest getting some friends to play one with you.  The other gamemodes have very few players playing them, but that's due to the currently attempting-to-rise popularity of the game, and Survival is also the most commonly played mode.  If you're gonna get ORION, and/or play it, I suggest having a Microphone ready, a comprehensive grasp and understanding of the concept of 'Survival', good aim, better situational awareness, and some friends to play it with you (Who hopefully also have all the qualities described).  Try not to die!
5011	1	a	10/10 Best Lag Simulator of 2012-2014
5013	1	a	Based on the Unreal 3 Engine, we've got Orion: Dino Horde, or a game i like to call Dino Killer Future Simulator.  The game is simply beautiful, the visuals are simply ridiculously pretty (if you crank the settings up, like with any and all other games).  The gameplay is fun, even on your own, though it is challenging, also depends on difficulty.  There's lots of game-modes, a maximum of 5 players at once, due to it being a wave-style game... atleast in survival.  There's small dinos, medium dinos, large dinos, and i think giant ones too. (not too sure on the giant ones though).  You can use automated turrets, pistols, magnums, sniper rifles, large and small machine guns, a cool-looking tank that seems very similar in look to the ion tank in UT2004.  Very fun altogether, I give this game an 8/10, because it's jsut that good other then the reasons above.
5015	1	a	Sure, it has a few rough edges, and some of the models' animations are lulzy/'incomplete' but that doesn't make the gameplay any less fun after you get through the initial setup's verifying of the game cache. Cause lets face it... Halo Reach + Dinosaurs = Fun.
5017	1	a	Take Killing Floor, replace the zombies with dinosaurs, add vehicles &amp; wide open areas &amp; you have the potential to be one of the best games released in 2012. The game does however have some bugs, although the majority of them are not major. The worst ones I have seen is where you fall through the ground when getting out of a jeep or the game attempting to continue onto another round when you have technically finished the game. There is however an extreme clipping issue where dinosaurs can actually attack you through the wall of a bunker you may be in, although this is easy enough to dodge in most cases if you stay away from the wall, provided a T-Rex doesn't throw a bolder at you that somehow gets through the wall of the bunker due to the clipping issue. Another interesting bug is when the healing pad may inadvertently be healing the dinosaur, which isn't a big problem with Raptors, but is a huge problem when the T-Rex had his head stuck through the wall just above the pad.  The developers insist that Dino Horde is not a re-release of Dino Beatdown &amp; is banning anybody who states it is on the Steam forums for the game, but let's be honest; the fact that it replaced the original game is proof enough that it is. What sets it apart from a straight re-release is the fact that it was improved on; further game modes/dinos were added, bugs were fixed, among other changes. I don't really care that it is a re-release, the people who previously owned the game got it for free (which is a $5 discount if you purchased Dino Beatdown). I still say it's a great game &amp; a great value for the price even with the bugs.
5019	1	a	This game is sort of like halo, BUT WITH DINOSAURS!!!!!! There are cool weapons, nice outfits, many game modes maps, and more. in my opinion, dinosaurs are awesome, and if you like halo (i dont personaly, but i still love this game) then you should get this game. (GET IT NOW, ITS CHEAP, i think)
5021	1	a	Give this game a chance, do not take it seriously at all, and you will have some good fun. Highly recommend getting the four-pack and playing with friends, nab while it's on sale for silly value. :D
5023	1	a	Awesome game the first time it came as a free thing i played it a ton and had tons of fun
5025	1	a	fun and challegning at the same time
5027	1	a	LOL nice and cool game ever seen in my whole life :D
5029	1	a	♥♥♥♥
5031	1	a	People are being to hard on the game, even in its early stage it was stupid fun. you dont dis oldschool games for having bad animations, graphics, and lack of story. you enjoy this game because its good killing floor dino killing fun
5033	1	a	YES ♥♥♥♥, it was only $0.99. Co-op, Dinosaurs, Guns, Sci-Fi. Combat is decent. Remember $0.99!
5035	1	a	Think of a zombie game where you have to survive waves. Now replace the zombies with dinosaurs!
5037	1	a	great game 
5039	1	a	It's retro.
1109	0	a	terriable game graphics are overrated when u cant even perform baisic mechanics like capping points  also didnt have fun with it either. i would rather play dino d-day at least i had fun with that. this game is a laugh to the original people who paid 15 dollars and yet i wouldent want to even pay 1 dollar. this game HAHA BAD. 0/10 go look into something else.
1110	0	a	Is it worth 50 cents on sale? maybe Is it worth the time invested to install, boot up load and play? Not really.
1111	0	a	Onion Dorito Hard is possibly the best FPS since Super Mario 64, no joke. I mean it has snow, hats, custom colours, DINOSAURS, guns and an 'Upgrade System' so it seems it was worth the 79p on sale. Seems to have more content than CoD and is cheaper than it.
1112	0	a	♥♥♥♥♥
5041	1	a	This is the most broken, cheap, unimaginative, and repetitive game ever made.  Download it for free, have a laugh, and forget about it.
5043	1	a	lovely game, especially if you love slaying dinosaurs. but turn down the graphics if you're computer is running slow.
5045	1	a	It's like Killing Floor...But with dinosaurs :D 10/10
5047	1	a	Still Better than Dayz. 0/10
5049	1	a	get the game ITS THE BEST 
5051	1	a	Awesome. You should play this.
5053	1	a	:^}
5055	1	a	This is a fun game for a while. but it gets boring quite fast.
1113	0	a	Dont let the price (or lack there of) fool you. This is a fairly bad game... like most games you can get a bit of enjoyment with friends, but literally find anything else; it's garabage.
1114	0	a	  i've been waiting for this game to be in my library for a long time... and then, one day, it was free to play! i downloaded it and... i was disappointed, even though i love dinosaurs and guns... im sorry... graphics = bad, gameplay = bad... im sorry...
5057	1	a	damn i want my refund because i paid 50 cents for this holy crap im freaking out about 50 cents ok its good game ok ok im done
1115	0	a	I don't like this game. 
5059	1	a	This game is incredibly fun for anyone who wants to play with their friends.
5061	1	a	Its a fun game and relatively simple shoot dinos, and capute outpost. Its better when you play with friends!
5063	1	a	Its a fun game and relatively simple shoot dinos, and capute outpost. Its better when you play with friends!
1116	0	a	Almost a carbon-copy of orion dino horde...
1117	0	a	What the F***K is this!?
5065	1	a	I love this game i love the bow i love the teamwork i give this a 100 out of 10 i also like the pvp aspects
5067	1	a	I enjoyed it very very very much.
1118	0	a	it used to be good, and i dont mind it being free to play although i bought it, BUT at least give us stuff for supporting the game?  ♥♥♥♥ you too developers
5069	1	a	One of the best dino games ever
5071	1	a	It's 1 ♥♥♥♥ing dollar.
1119	0	a	DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK.
1120	0	a	First of all I had to pay for this game, then it becomes free and then I couldn't get a refund for this game. After some couple of months they want you to pay for this.  These devs like to ♥♥♥♥ up alot, like they did when they released this game In the begining. It's the only thing they're good at. I used to like this game and It's cool to see that they supported It for so long when they got ♥♥♥♥ on by people whom bought at the begining. But now it's just a lost cause.

5073	1	a	its a awesome dino game i enjoy it but it lagged and deleted in the 3rd week 
5075	1	a	It's an OK game.Definately worth 0,99$.You will have fun for a couple of hours.
5077	1	a	Fun when playing with friends.
1125	0	a	Buy porn Dont waste money on this
1126	0	a	this game has changed names 3 times since i've owned it.  it hasn't gotten 3 times better yet.
1127	0	a	this game is not great. but its not bad. i do not suggest this to people who have already played primal carnage. the only problem in my opinion is the concept. and the way the dinos play out. what i do love is the vast amount of species to play as and the NPC/BOTS they work well as balancing the teams

5079	1	a	Once every lifetime or so, a game comes along that defines an entire generation of people. It may not be the most popular game or even the most well-made (though this one is). But it is a game whose vitality--whose culture and mission--is guided by the spirit of the times. A game that is of the same soul as its rapidly-evolving player-base.  This game is a leather-skinned, ten-tonne, befanged zeitgeist of the 2010s; it is filled to the brim with content, but as empty as the Dadaists who hurriedly cranked it out. A work of passion? Absolutely not. It was an accident. A beautiful, remarkable accident: Like life itself. It was a market-savvy cynical heap of a game, desperately trying to hitch a ride on the bandwagon of dino-themed entertainment. The game ressurected Michael Crichton--may he rest in peace--for the express purpose of tearing down everything that he could have been, in addition to everything he already was, and replace his memory with a plastic artifice and the lowest possible form of American consumerism.  This is why you need this game. Not because it's good, but because it's the most important game of this--of any--decade. This is the game that defines the 2010s better than any other; in all its flaws and successes. And it could not have come sooner.  In this game, you take on the role of Captain Henk Mercer, an intrepid planet-hopping paleontologist-slash-warlord with a heart of solid dino dung. You are tasked with killing every dinosaur that every existed, to protect future generations of hyperreligious Galactic Federal Citizens from the complexities of an increasingly secular, science-based culture which would become distracted from its faith by the presence of ancestral lizard bones. With a ragtag team of up to 17 other cyber soldiers (your fellow players), you must defeat hordes of enemy dinos (specifically, all pterodactyls) using four different unique guns. The guns depicted in this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game have essentially never been made before. They defy any description: But imagine a rocket launcher that has acquired sapience, knows its enemies' fears and hopes, and concludes to murder them anyway. That's generally how ♥♥♥♥ing sweet the guns are. But--again--only playing the game can imbue you with the visceral knowledge of how the guns work, because it's 100% feel and 0% logic. The game proves that there is no logic greater than raw emotion and, in proving this truth, the dinosaurs have finally killed Nietzsche; God is alive, and He is you. Read on.  The game is among the first FPS games to utilize a 'healer type' class: A player whose sole purpose is to increase the Hit Points (or HP) of the other players, should they suffer Dino Damage (or DD) during the game's progress. Keeping your healer class alive becomes essential and difficult, because there are T-rexes. Think about it: Prehistory's greatest fighting machine. And instead of having a gun, you've got a splint and some rubbing alcohol. But it's okay: Captain Mercer is--by the game creators' own admission--so overpowered that no dinosaur will stand a chance. The other 21-or-so players who are working alongside Captain Mercer are basically there to server his every perverse whim, while contributing little else. In many cases, these 'whims' are a rich tapestry of scatological sex acts that would make the Marquis de Sade blush. Make sure you are playing this game with a mature, open-minded party.  My one complaint with this game is that it deviates from Robert T. Bakker's important vision of the dinosaur. The dinosaur's cladistic roots indicate a shared ancestry among lizards, birds, and even early mammals. It's fair to say that all modern birds are, in fact, dinosaurs. Science has shown this time and again, however--to this day--anyone working in the burgeoning field of Dino-themed FPS games neglects to promote these new scientific discoveries. When you're standing on the shoulders of intellectual giants, and those giants are standing on the shoulders of sweet-as-hell stegosaurs and ♥♥♥♥, you need to learn how to ♥♥♥♥ing act like it. Show scientific progress a little respect, and maybe put some feathers and talons and beaks and ♥♥♥♥ in there. Is that so much to ask? Jesus.  It goes without saying that I've awarded this game the highest score achievable by an FPS: 1800 value points. If you've not yet played it, then gather up the requisite party of 4 humans and 2 dinosaurs and given it a proper go. You owe it to yourself and you owe it to the future of gaming to support such a monumentous project.  There will be no more important games this decade. Buy nothing. Play nothing else. Keep travel expenses to a minimum. Save your money for 2025, when all games will come with syringes and phone-jacks that you put into your forehead.
5081	1	a	This game is insanely fun and I mean who doesn't love killing dino's in a mech suit haha I definately recommend this game. Solo is crazy fun and it's even more fun with a group. Two thumps up and I hope ORION has more games to come like this.
5083	1	a	lots of fun. I paid $3.99 for this game and it's better than most of my $60.00 games and that makes me mad.
1134	0	a	no reason to play as dino when assault class can just sit on walls w/jetpack out of reach with infinite ammo pistols
1135	0	a	♥♥♥♥ing cancer... I have cancer
1136	0	a	this is the worst game i have ever played
5085	1	a	Year 2016 and we are hunting dinosaurs.
5087	1	a	You'll either love this game or hate it. I happen to really enjoy it; it's amazing fun with friends and is all-out chaos when you get a full server going on any game mode. Is it game of the year? No. Are there some obvious faults with it? Yes. But I definitely think it's worth a try, especailly for the relatively cheap price.
5089	1	a	The T rex is the best dinosaur in the game because it powerful
5091	1	a	There are very few co-op games that everyone in my family of four enjoys playing. Somehow, this title appeals to our (normally diverse) gaming genres/interests, and has been a complete blast to play.   Also, I'm glad I read somewhere here in the reviews that the metacritic rating was for a diff. (earlier I think) version of the game and went for it during the steam sale. I can confirm, this game rocks.
5093	1	a	the trex is loud so turn down your volume, actually everything is loud, but its a dumb game 9.1/10
5095	1	a	A very fun game, although quick paced and a (tiny) bit laggy. People will find it fun, provided you play it in a multiplayer server.
5097	1	a	played as a T-Rex, spent the whole match trying to eat my raptor teammates. 10 outta 10, best game ever
5099	1	a	Good game but has starting trouble and will get stuck always
5101	1	a	Play in a prehistoric wilderness with futuristic weapons! Pteranodons and Tyrannosaurs and Velociraptors, oh my!
5103	1	a	for 0.99 this game if perfect. And it is better than FPS games like COD for me. I can play it as much as i want with friends and never get bored
5105	1	a	Killed a triceratops by stabbing it in the legs multiple times with a futuristic kitchen knife. 10/10
5107	1	a	Actually this was surprisingly good. Pretty much Killing Floor meets Jurrasic Park. High intensity FPS.
5109	1	a	I just realised that when you are in a server, and if you click'invite friends' the game will crash for some reason
5111	1	a	its good :) just buggy/glitchy that doesnt effect gameplay.
5113	1	a	The Sharknado of games
5115	1	a	So bad that it's good. 10/10, would spend 99 cents on this again.
5117	1	a	This game is 1 Dollar. It's honestly not worth that dollar. You could get more substance out of a dollar store bag of chips. A STALE bag of chips that's been sitting there since 2009.  The potential for this game is pretty solid, but it blindsides you with awful animations, slow gameplay that makes you want to stab yourself in the eyes and so many bugs you'd think you were in a motel in detroit.   I played 34 minutes of this game, and I can honestly say I would undo every second of it. 2/10, go buy 'Mountain' at least then you have something mildly entertaining, and probably better designed.
5119	1	a	Good game to play with friends. Yes the game has some issues such as the other players character levitating the entire time but that creates some pretty hilarious moments. For .99 i would recommend this game. Very nice!
5121	1	a	The developers changed the name of the game and now my gifted copy disappeared! wtf! I JUST WANT TO PLAY!
5123	1	a	This game is great if you can get it on sale. Go check out the devs change logs. These guys are giving the game a ton of love. The meta critic for this game is in the dumpster, but I assume that has to do with the games rushed release back in 2012. I never played that version of the game, but it's clear they have done a lot to try and improve their standing.   also, F metacritic.  11/10 - you can back stab a t-rex with a knife
5125	1	a	it has been released ♥♥♥♥ing 500000000000000000 times
5127	1	a	a very nice game to play :D
5129	1	a	Good game, I'll say its better than most games I purchased, and for the price its great. Good fun with Dinos, Tanks, Mechs,Jetpacks, lightsabers, vtols flamethrowers and alot of other stuff that adds to the fun. Good updates aswell.
5131	1	a	Got into a tank and a Stegosaurus picked me up and threm me across the map. 11/10 best game ever. Best $.25 I have ever spent
5133	1	a	Stabbed a Velosoraptor in the face then promptlly got eaten whole by a T-rex 10/10 would stab again
5135	1	a	It has its momets,but I would not buy it for more then $10.
5137	1	a	I don't know how this game got 36/100 i love it, me and my friends play it daily!!!
5139	1	a	If you like call of duty zombies than youll love this. its just like it but with dinosaurs instead
5141	1	a	Pretty entertaining game, especially for the price. if you have friends this game is buggy enough to keep it unpredictable and fun.
5143	1	a	You get to be a soldier fighting angry alien dinosaurs.... It is badass and crazy fun at times and I would grab it if you like multiplayer horde as much as I do. I would say 7/10 Has a few tiny bugs and is kinda goofy but is really good fun.  Quick Update: I wrote this review when the game was still Orion: Dino Horde, I felt it was better back then. the new content and crappy new menus hurt it in my book but it is still a decent game. The fact that it is 99 cents now helps and it does still have great in-game horde. Hope they fix some of there mistakes soon but I will still play the crap out of it!
1142	0	a	spend my immortal dota item for this ♥♥♥♥ game its sucks
1143	0	a	this game sucks !!!!
5145	1	a	best game so far ive played thats that cheap
1144	0	a	This is seriously the worst game I ever played in my life. It is not a game that I didn't like, it is hard to like because of its many bugs and lack of content and balance. However, if you don't care too much about that kind of stuff, you can have tons of fun with friends. I don't recommend it though.
1145	0	a	The game had horrid performance issues despite looking terrible, the gameplay was VERY clunky and it felt like a chore just trying to take aim at something. The combat is boring, the weapons are bland, and the whole game feels like a gimmick.
5147	1	a	The Metacritic score is wrong, the 38 score is for the first game (Dino Beatdown), not this game This game is totally fun and have 10 game modes and it's more fun when playing multiplayer of 5 players instead of single player, and the map is huge Although the animation is kinda odd, example the dino animation and player running animation, but it's forgivable I think, as long as the gameplay is fun The graphic is cool, but in my computer is kinda lag when I maxed out the graphic option in 1080p  And, the dino is playable too  I recommended this game 85/100
5149	1	a	This game is so dumb that it is fun!
5151	1	a	The meta score lies. This game is definately better than the meta score.
1147	0	a	I don't quite understand this - If the dev is having so much difficulties making money, and looking where 'ORION' has gone, I must say that making this free was NOT a good move, on the authors or for the customers. I understand that making this free in order to lower the hate for this game and all it's glitches is a way to go, but at least give some regard to those who enjoy this, and spend their time playing it. 
5153	1	a	I shot a dinosaur and it flew 100 feet in the air. 11/10 would fly again
5155	1	a	When dinos be screeching, ears be popping
5157	1	a	This game is just wicked. Dinos and overpowerd wepons! Massive levels. Meca robots that you control. Tanks!  Just buy this game. Its so cheep and a good laugh with mates 
5159	1	a	This game may include Dinosaurs and ebola.
1150	0	a	This is seriously one of the worst games I've ever played.  Go get it on the next sale.
5161	1	a	I was playing with some friends, we found a trex kill it, and guess what we said, *looks around* ... GET REXED   ooooo ooooo  10/10 would make bad jokes again
5163	1	a	Dinos and guns       that is all you need to know
1151	0	a	Oh what to say...   This game was dropped unto steam as an early access before that term even existed. There was a few spare updates to the game after launch and then nothing happened. None of the promises that were made about the game on launch ever happened. A poor lackluster game from a poor lackluster dev.    But wait, there's more...    In an effort to avoid the absolutely terrible scores the game got, it was renamed and relaunched on Steam at full price. Twice. Apart from being borderline illegal, it's a ♥♥♥♥ move that usually only EA reserves themselves to.    But wait, there's more...    People weren't as dumb as expected. They complained about it on the game's Steam forum. Then they got banned from said forums, actively, by the dev trying to cover up that the exact same game with a new name was in fact, a new game. Which it wasn't.    But wait, there's more, apparently...    So this game got released twice under the pretention of being something new while in fact nothing has happened since a couple of weeks after launch in 2012, THREE YEARS AGO. And now there's a 'new' game up on kickstarter. Apart from the game itself being in a sorry decrepit state, the developer is one of the worst and greediest people I've ever had the bad fortune of encountering.   The game currently costs less than an icecream. Is it worth it then? Well, depends on wether or not you want to finance a person who treats people like livestock with wallets. (Buy an icecream instead.)
5165	1	a	Start the game: 200 ping. First dinosaur to fight. T-Rex Insta Death. Keep shooting every dino in the map. Lv 2. YAY!  Pros: It has dinosaurs. More dinosaurs, Dinosaurs.. And Dinosaurs.. or i forget something? Ah, yeah. Dinosaurs.  Cons: Where the f** is the Carnotaurus Sastrei.. C'mon..  Prehistoric/11.
5167	1	a	Fair.  Fair price = Fair content.  Why low content? well you do the same thing all over and over and over again. It gets boring quick, i see no character progression (jump in the game, buy stuff in that game, rinse and repeat). AI will charge the ♥♥♥♥ out of you, well as long as you're out reach you're fine. But hey! you get to crack dino skulls for a fair price.  I had fun especially when you knife a freakin T-rex and it goes down. This is a lot more fun with friends, but I have none(sobs a little). Kidding aside This is a lot more fun with friends that're into dino skull bashing. However I do not see the game as a daily staple rather an appetizer from time to time.
1152	0	a	It cost me less than the price of a Mars bar, Im pretty sure a Mars bar has more thought put in to its coding. It lags, it hangs, it crashes harder than a malasian airlines passenger jet. The Gameplay is dull and repetative, with no clear direction given on how to complete given tasks. In short, save your money, go buy a Mars Bar!
5169	1	a	Personally, I think this game is pretty stupid. Its not super interesting or well made. The graphics are mediocre, the gameplay is meh, and everything about it is not particularly creative or good. It is, however, $1. So far, I've played about 2 hours of it, and I'll probably get another hour or so out of it, and I think thats worth $1. It can be pretty fun to beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of a dinosaur for a little bit.
5171	1	a	One of the best game of this decade 10/10 This include a revolutionnary combat system with dinosaurs and amazing graphics Would recommand to anyone interested in Video Games
5173	1	a	I like dinosaurs! (previous review)  [NEW REVIEW] ORION: Prelude is still one of the best games I've played, far better than most of those $40-$60 games. For just $1 hundreds of hours could be made and especially with friends. Because the price is so low it's very easy to find or get people to play. I'd also recommend their newest game ORION (The ORION Project), it's brilliant and more fun than this and this is already exciting to play.  I rate 5/7 (if you all don't know it's reference, get off the internet) If I find you on a server, I will rek you by sniping your balls off (and v-a-g-i-n-a-s for those who have)  Have a pleasant day...
5175	1	a	Cool game with alot of different FPS genres mixed into it, but feels incomplete. Who cares though its a super fun game for just $1.
5177	1	a	Great game! :)
5179	1	a	Paid $0.98 for this game... now it's free... I want my refund.
5181	1	a	this game is amazing , it's so addicting , 'now you are looking at my playtime , hmh only 1.1h atm' ,  but I know I will be playing this game alot more ! , It's like halo , but with fckn DINOSAURS.... Like if you like Halo, and surprisingly Like Dinosaurs also , then this is the BEST game for you ! , like damn. this price for such an amazing game ... It's just MADNESS , MADNESS I TELL YOU!
1153	0	a	This is BS. I bought this game now its f2p microtransaction PoS
5183	1	a	Lag is horrible, but a good game in actual gameplay.
5185	1	a	This game just not have any T-Rex, but it got a T-Rocks 
5187	1	a	A Dinosaur kicked my car and I went flying 39million/10
1154	0	a	Applied for refund, uninstalled game. I do not want to support this:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WurLQ0XLf20   To those who want a refund, you can get one through steam directly.  Follow the instructions here:  https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=6695-QIKM-7966   Hope this helps!
5189	1	a	  Thsi is an amzing buy for just under adollar its worth it ive played five hours i feel thats definatley my moneys worth
1156	0	a	complete pile of ♥♥♥♥... sold some cs:go skins and bought this game for 0.99€... after 30mins, immediately requested refund... ABSOLUTE WASTE OF 3GB. much regret.  game is buggy and laggy, missing sounds, multiplayer doesn't always even work and bad texturing.
5191	1	a	I bought this game as a joke because I had 50 cents on my account left   It's actually a pretty ♥♥♥♥in good game
5193	1	a	More stolen content than a reaction channel. Unlike reaction channels tho, its actually enjoyable.
5195	1	a	Its a dollar.  Buy it.
5197	1	a	This game is great to play with friends. It's a combination of Halo and Dinosaurs and some other stuff. What more could you want from an FPS?
5199	1	a	I killed a T-rex with a knife. 11/10
1158	0	a	Free to play now. Seriously? -_-
5201	1	a	+Rep Gud Gaem and werry good dinoshooter fps gaem, werri god 10/10 would never play again
1159	0	a	omg i am buy this game and now free wtf
5203	1	a	Sniping from atop a vtol, that my friend is piloting, with a gatlin gun is how i spend most of my time playing......i have a 42% overall accuracy with said weapon.  I bought the game for a dollar.....totally worth full price just saying.
5205	1	a	Whoa. *Insert Whoa. face here*
5207	1	a	It's a cool game , pretty cheap , it's amazing.
1161	0	a	Deffinitely better than beatdown, but not by much. This is one of those games you play for one to two hours and then never again. I reccomend playing for the free weekend, and by the end of that you will probably not care about the game anymore.
5209	1	a	I dont really know what to say other than: ,   360 no scoping dinasaurs with rocket launchers and hovercrafts. 11/10 would no scope again.
1162	0	a	I got this game for .48 cents and I still feel like I paid too much.
5211	1	a	Get ready for some jet-packing, guns blazing, co-op game. The dinos only make it even better. This is the best game you can get for a dollar; Hands down. It is probably even better than some $5-$10 games.
5213	1	a	Great fun. Smiting dinosaurs with a rocket launcher while jetpacking across the battlefield is the meaning of life.
5215	1	a	my opinion if you can afford junk foods better to dump your dollar into this. ps, this is my first review of all time usually I never did.
5217	1	a	What could be better than shooting dinosaurs with awesome fun weapons? Although not highly polished, this game is great fun.
5219	1	a	needs optimization 
5221	1	a	This is ridiculously fun, Halo meets Turok, without the unnecessary theatratics, which is saying something because you don't ♥♥♥♥ about Turok.  10/10 would smash your girl again.
1163	0	a	This game is not up to standards. I am very dissapointed in Spiral game studios. I would like a refund, I would like 5 chocolate buscuits and some tomato juice asap. This is to feed my cupboard hobos as they are starving becasue of this game.
5223	1	a	Open Game for first time. Round 1, fight some dinosaurs, seems like a normal game. Round 2 fight thousands of tiny dinosaurs all wearing pirate hats. Round 3 fight against invisble raptors.  Realism: 10/10 Immersion: 10/10 best game 2k12
5225	1	a	Wonderful game, worth every penny. Got a 4-pack of it too play with friends and after logging 33 hours on record I can say that I will continue to play this game. There is just something about killing hoards of dinosaurs that just feels so relaxing. I saw it go free for a while, didn't care I had payed for it. This game is a game worth playing!
1164	0	a	This game seems like it can be very good, but right now it lags too much and my computer is pretty good so it shouldn't be lagging als there's no weapon flash or recoil so it just looks kind of stupid when you fire and all that happens is a gunshot sound and some blood appears when you hit your mark. This game has something going for it and I would be willing to pay a fair amount of cash for it once the lags get fixed but right now I just can't recomend it to anyone unless your willing to play a game that will probably be pretty laggy but still good overall or if you have a very good computer which may help with the lag but I don't know for sure.
1165	0	a	I got this game because I was expecting turok, what I got was a laggy blurry dino thing chase me around until I finally figured out the controls. THEN I was killed even faster than when I didn't know what I was doing, due in part by lag. I think this could be a great game, it just needs more work.
1166	0	a	Writing to just inform people of the shady background of the current developers of this game -    http://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1cefrz/orion_dino_beatdown_has_just_been_updated_to_the/   and   http://www.dualshockers.com/2011/03/14/update-project-director-of-orion-prelude-david-prassel-leaving-his-employees-high-and-dry/   Basically the developer (David Prassel) took the $20k received from the Kickstarter project, and promptly fired his team.  Also, the 15 minutes I played of the game was mediocre at best.
5227	1	a	This game is right up there with Borderlands and Payday 2 in terms of great co-op shooters.
5229	1	a	Some of the most fun I've ever had in a multiplayer game. You want this game.
5231	1	a	'only in the future do we fight our past'
5233	1	a	Gotta Admit that this game is kinda repetitive BUT There's something about this game that makes me wants to play more.Coop is fun with vehicle and stuff.Don't Worry about the low MetaScore because this games has been remade.
5235	1	a	Posibly the best game of all time, its unbalivably fun.
5237	1	a	Dinosaurs couldn't figure out how to go around mountain 10/10
5239	1	a	This is a beautiful game, Mechs, Dinos, Guns...'nuff said. On sale it's worth it, off sale it's worth it...please play this if nothing else in your life. One hasn't lived until you kill a t-rex with a mech, or a lightsabre.
1219	0	a	I GOT PICKED UP BY A ♥♥♥♥ING TERRYDACTYL. NO ONE PICKS ME UP EXCEPT MY MUM.
5241	1	a	Don't buy the vehicles. Only the dragonfly
5243	1	a	This Has to be the most fun ive ever had on a game its ♥♥♥♥ing amazing EVERYONE should have it Bloody 10000000/10!!!!!
5245	1	a	absolutely awful. all you do is shoot dinosaurs and jump.
5247	1	a	Uses credits to buy no fall damage upgrade. You're being bad and missing 360 noscopes on T-Rexs when suddenly you're flying upwards. WTF? That annoying pterodactyl who's been ♥♥♥♥ you up the whole game grabbed you and now it's taking you up in the sky for you know, 'reasons'. You shoot that dino 98438593458934589395043 times until you pistol whip it. Finally! You're free! You look down, you're 5000 feet from the ground. OH ♥♥♥♥! You close your eyes for the unavoidable demise about to come. You open your eyes 20 seconds later. I'm alive? OHHHH I bought that upgrade. Well thank Gaben I did! Well I better get back to 360 noscoping those T-Rexs... Here comes one now. GET READY NOW DI-. Eaten by the T-rex. DAMMIT I KNEW I SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT THE UNABLE TO BE CHOMPED UPGRADE! Lesson: Buy all the Upgrades. Also, get good at 360 noscoping you scurb.  11/10 Using 99 cents for this game= Logic Wait... Logic=Logitech Logitech is 8 letters long and Logic is 5. 8-5=3 The Illuminati Triangle has 3 sides. ILLUMINATI CONFIRMED!  Now stop reading this and just buy the game.
5249	1	a	Really nice game though, worth the money i would pay 10 dollars to play this game really really good (:
5251	1	a	Well worth the $0.99 its great fun
5253	1	a	It was a great game at first then i stopped playing then i played it again and i got addicted to again so its one of those games
5255	1	a	Worth every single cent of the dollar
5257	1	a	Got bored of killing guys with guns in TF2. Got bored of killing robots in Robocraft. Got bored of killing zombies in No More Room In Hell. This game is a perfect change of pace if you like killing different things. Killing dinosaurs was very fun, I killed a lot of them. 10/10, should play again.
5259	1	a	This game is somewhat unstable at random times but if you are patient, this game can be give you a good laugh. The Metascore is too low even with it updated. The online experience lacks trolls and it enforces people to stick together and communicate. The short time that it was on sale for $1 was the best time to get it. It is not worth the Store price but is worth more than $1. Very fun if you have friends. It is also a good experience by yourself. Very fun overall
5261	1	a	Cheap and good for a couple of hours with your friends. 6/10 Too many bugs and a lot of lagg
5263	1	a	The meta cretic score is a lie. Its a great game!
5265	1	a	I wouldn't exactly call this game 'good,' but it's 99 cents, and it's pretty fun to just ♥♥♥♥ around with the iron blade or fly around in a plane with a group of good friends and just have a good time.
5267	1	a	i approve of this game! 
5269	1	a	I guess there's dinosaurs or something.
5271	1	a	Chased across the map by a Trex. 10/10
5273	1	a	It's only a dollar. Most others would price this is a 15 dollar game. Think about that.
5275	1	a	Low graphics and stuff but if you like wave after wave of dinosaurs in Halo? It's pretty good.
5277	1	a	nice game for the price :)
5279	1	a	but... i ♥♥♥♥ing paid for this game!!! i want a refund this instant, not saying the game was horrible, but wtf steam, can we get refunds or what!? But in all seriousness, this game isnt that bad, and actually fun.  Game does require a pc with decent specs. my laptop is skat on the road so i cant play this game to the fullest. still fun tho
5281	1	a	Interesting game
5283	1	a	This is a good game, I only have 5 or so hours in it and in that time I found it a fun game to mess around in and not take serious. Didn't find any bugs or problems while playing.  Lot of content to keep you happy from a large selection of weapons, vehicles and dinos and classes.
5285	1	a	Awesome game for A buck.
5287	1	a	You kill Dinosaurs.......What more can one person ask for?
5289	1	a	My lunch costed more than this game and yet its a pretty fun game, Especially the co-op
1227	0	a	i should have listened to TB, this game is horrible, im running 2 titans and somehow this game still manages to drop below 30 fps on low settings, waste of time, horrible game. the mechanics are ok i guess, when they work right.
5291	1	a	this game is really FANTASTIC AND AMAZING !
5293	1	a	Good game lots of content and cant go wrong with the price
5295	1	a	First thing I'm going to say is that I'm not clear on who's stealing what from who, as I've heard that the creators of this game are in on a scandal. But I don't really care, because I'm here to review a game, not who made it. ~~~~~Pros~~~~~ - Cheap $0.99 or $0.49 during the summer sale. - Good combat system, not too repetitive. - The multiplayer is great IF you have one of your friends playing with you and you have voice chat. - The graphics are alright by normal standards. But Fantastic for 99 cents. - You can play as a ♥♥♥♥ING DINOSAUR (I don't know why you're still reading this after I said that.) ~~~~~Cons~~~~~ - I'll have to get back to you on that one.
1229	0	a	I have no idea what I just played, but then again, it's 0.99.
5297	1	a	Improved game. Honestly this is one of the better games for the buck I spent around $0.99 cents around the time and I actually enjoyed it I wasn't blown away by the graphics but by the gameplay it's seems as if the game alone should be worth around $10. If you want a couple hours of gameplay or even a hundred hours of gameplay this is by far one of best cheap games I have played in my entire life. Get this game if you want the best bang for your buck. Honest Rate: Graphics 8/10 Gameplay: 9/10 Concept: 10/10 Community: 10/10 (Very Friendly) Hackers: 0/10
5299	1	a	Awsome Game!! :D
5301	1	a	Everybody do the Dinosaur!   (you should also Walk the Dinosaur too, if you can... wouldnt want to get fatigued or anything,)  Really though, aside from the few imperfections, occasonal trolls, this game has VASTLY improved, and I highly reccomend it. Nothing is perfect.
5303	1	a	$.99 for lightsabers and dinosaurs. 10/10
5305	1	a	Great game and lots of fun. Jetpacks, Futuristic weapons, Augments, Stealth, objectives, tons of game modes, and giant Dinosaurs! It was worth the money and is fun enough that I'm still playing it off and on a month later. Not every game has staying power but I can see me revisiting this game again and again.
1234	0	a	Might aswell cut you leg off with a spoon, cause this game hurts your soul by simply being in the main menu
1235	0	a	The Metacritic score isn't lying.
5307	1	a	Simple, Fantastic, Classic! ~ ~ ~  CHEAP!!!    Hell Yes!
5309	1	a	for very few money this very much play i think i rate 7/10 good game yes ))
5311	1	a	in this game i've put 20 hours. that may not sound like much but for a 1 euro game. i don't know if i would recommend you the game at full price but for 1 euro. this game is worth 1 euro at least. 7/10
5313	1	a	It is worth f2p
5315	1	a	I feel like this game really taught me what it's like to be a paleontologist.
1246	0	a	wtf i purchased it and its telling me i didnt wtf,i hate this game thats not funny nor fair
5317	1	a	You Can kill T-Rex using Rifle and you can fly using jet pack what else do you need? It's Already Awsome
5319	1	a	Laserwords, Dinosaurs and ♥♥♥♥ing co-op. 10/10
5321	1	a	Beat a group of Raptors in the face with a Lightsaber and took a high-flying tour with my friend Jeffrey the Pterodactyl, which resulted in my bones shattering when he let my fatass go. 10/10. Would stab more dinosaurs.
5323	1	a	It has a smooth way of playing if your computer isnt to crappy. It can be either really easy or you can make it really hard on yourself if you put the difficulty higher! Also please note that leveling your class up is a must in this game. I don't think you will get far with a level 1 in your class on the highest difficulty. Mainly because if your a higher level you can start with a primary weapon instead of the pistol only! Still a fun game to play and a lot of fun to see your friends running from all the dinos while you laugh at them from afar!
5325	1	a	Worth a look when its on sale, lots of fun.
5327	1	a	this is a fun game, i really enjoyed it. its a great game for such a low price
5329	1	a	99 cents and more fun than some AAA games out now!
1247	0	a	Horrible
5331	1	a	Very first time playing just me and a friend, we spawn in have no clue what we are doing. We didnt even realize the round started and got swarmed, we composed ourselves and went on for 4 more rounds. Then a T-rex appears and picks my friend up a flings his lifeless body across the map, i died shortly after. 10/10 would bang
5333	1	a	Graphics aside, this game is great fun to play with. The survival mode is very similar to CoD: Zombies-but with dinosaurs; however there is a larger focus on protecting objectives. Great fun to play with friends
5335	1	a	Super Fun if you have friends to play with. You just shoot waves of dinosuars!
5337	1	a	From the first 5 minutes i enjoyed the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game ! worth playing with Friends Super Fun
1248	0	a	There are some server issues and not only that the game just keeps sending Dinos at you I love bears not Dinos
5339	1	a	Fell thru world and killed everything while being there. 5/5
5341	1	a	Imagine ark the new game for 25$ except entirely different except for the fact they have dinasours and you have this game. 10/10.5
5343	1	a	HOLY ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥, ITS A DINOSAUR. JESUS CHRIST. WHAT THE FUUUUCK.  That summarizes the game. 10/10
5345	1	a	killed dinosaurs with guns found out melee did 2000 dmg what is guns
1250	0	a	Half-Life 2 looks better than this game, which I can run on ultra with 60+ fps. My computer is fairly ♥♥♥♥♥♥, yet I can run a few games on ultra or even low and still get playable framerate. In this game I ran on low and got less then 10 fps, which is extremely unplayable. It may be bad because I have a terrible computer, but if I can run Far Cry 2 on ultra with 60+ fps, I should be able to run this on medium at least with 60+ fps.
5347	1	a	I remember getting this game when it was worth much more than 99 cents. Was fun while it lasted but for 99c, it is very much worth it even though I bought it at a much greater price. From killing dinosaurs to an all out pvp this game is worth a try.    5/10  
5349	1	a	This ♥♥♥♥ is a gem! Very entertaining. Not meny games that are going for one dollar are good at all. But this one is a steal. Yes there are bugs and yes the AI is kinda dull; However, the entertainment value is hard to beat. Halo, Star Wars, Call of Duty, and Jurassic Park in one game. Worth it.
5351	1	a	its literally killing floor but with dinosaurs  get this game you stupid idiot its only a FREAKING dollar
5353	1	a	You shoot guns, and kill things.
5355	1	a	I enjoyed the game thoroughly. In just an hour, I rode a plasma-laser Warthog, killed a Triceratops 20x my size, got thrown off of a cliff by a Pterodactyl, shot about 3x as many bullets as you can find in an armoury in Texas, and found myself lost in a winter-wonderland, forgetting that it wasn't an action-rpg, and that I had a base to defend.  7.5/10, would pay up to $20.00 for this game.
1256	0	a	I spent money for this game that did not even work for me and now its free. Wow i can't even get a refund for it.                                                                      WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5357	1	a	Bought this game as it was on offer and it was well worth buying. Anyone into mmo/fps games should buy this game.
5359	1	a	Perfect Game Ever!!!
5361	1	a	&gt;Be 23 year old gamer &gt;Surfing on lelelelele Steam for good deals and playing some games &gt;Hears a loud thud on the door. &gt;It's the Orion: Dino Horde Devs armed with a machete &gt;'My prices are killers' the devs said &gt;Then they forcefully command me to... &gt;To open the door, get on the floor, everybody walk the dinosaur
5363	1	a	Awesome game, very addictive, paid 0.99 Euros and I didn't regret one cent ;).
1262	0	a	Not worth $15 more like $.25 - $.99
5365	1	a	A great time-sink game.
5367	1	a	I've only played this game for a few hours but it's okay so far. Not great, but not that bad.  You can play alone, with bots, or with humans. Waves of dinosaurs spawn in and you have to defend your base whilst shooting them. Some fly, some run, and some are just big. You get credits for killing them, which you can spend between waves at the weapon bases.   There are vehicles you and your team mates can use to travel around the map, and some of them you can fire from by using co-op, one driving, and one shooting etc.  After a few waves, better vehicles are unlocked.   Tips:  + Revive team mates + If you die during the wave, you lose your guns when you respawn + Dead team mates drop their guns ;) (lol) + Headshots do more damage + Use the Augment shop to upgrade your player + Shoot everything, buy the best guns + Stay off the ground level unless you're feeling brave 
5369	1	a	Its very good game!!
5371	1	a	This game is the most fun I have had in ages. I was sceptical at first because it is so cheap but MAN was I wrong. This game combines everything you could want. FPS, upgrades, cool guns, dinosaurs, mechs, tanks, hovercrafts, jetpacks... Do I need to go on? It is MULTIPLAYER!!
5373	1	a	It's basically Bioshock 2 except there are Dinosaurs. 10/10
1265	0	a	It's buggy and rough around the edges, but it isn't completely terrible.  99 cents is a fair price for it. Anything more is a rip-off.
5375	1	a	really really kid loving game...... no details and anything
5377	1	a	Really, this game is truly amazing. There are no dinosaur games/simulators like it, also you can fight a T-Rex in a Mech Suit....   So really your decison has been made for you, buy it! -Totally worth it.
1266	0	a	Its fun at the very beginning of the game but gets boring at the end the fun will never last!!!!
5379	1	a	This game is cool !!! &lt;3
5381	1	a	Pretty Cool
5383	1	a	im going to be honest, this is the first f2p game i have ever payed for, seriously, you have to buy credits with real money . the only place ive ever seen that, is in free to plays, if your going to have people pay for your game, dont make it a free to play platform.  aside from that, the gameplay is really cool, the community is amazing, but hot diggidy dog man, turn down the damn blur effects, there's so much blur that i cant see ♥♥♥♥ when im spectating, or even playing for that matter.
5385	1	a	You can kill a T-Rex in a tank - or punch his feet.  This game would be worth it even at 5€, but it's only 1, so go out buy it and have some stupid fun!
5387	1	a	This game is so much fun to play with a partner. WATCH OUT FOR THE FLYING BEASTS!

5389	1	a	Orion prelude updated review*  Orion prelude is a trully wonderful game. I still cant believe how awesome it feels even after a week playing the beta. The developers of this title did an extraordinary work to present us all with the new content update and lemme tell u, u wont regret it.  The graphics have been updated and overhauled to the best possible way. The gameplay has become really smooth and more fun. The addition of bots has made even single player more addictive. With endless mods that allow u to customize your characters/ pvp each other/play as dinos/test your abilities to the maximum/survive in open world maps, orion prelude has become what it was meant to be from the beginning. And that my friend is one of the best indie fps out there.  Although it has some minor flaws that need to be fixed, for 1$ on steam its maybe one of the best deals u will find in a game. If that is not a win deal, i dont know what is. Like i said in my previous review this game is better than alot AAA titles and damn more fun.  9/10
5391	1	a	The game has been released over 4 years ago. Since then it was constatly being developed, and worked on.   Game has received MAJOR overhauls over the years, all of which to appeal to players who still disliked the game. After the huge graphical overhaul the price was ever reduced to 1 dollar, and all people who purchased the game before that, received their money back in form of ingame currency.   TREK Industries is one of the most reliable game developers. From the time this game was first released, major companies have all released a few games. A good part of which were exactly the same games with different names, and charged 60 bucks for each of them.   Orion : Prelude in the meantime, has changed it's name 3 times, after the game changed so much, it was the same game only on the grounds of the basic mechanics used. All of which was done completely for free. No DLC's, no paid content, no reselling the same game (There is a cash shop in game for visuals. But there is no benefit to using it, it's just different skins.).  If you want to be sure the game you buy will not be abandoned : TREK.  Now, the game is being massively hated on, because of the activity of the drama lords. Seriously, the DMCA claim, has been proven to have grounds, surprisingly the person resonsilble, decided to admit it to the CO and even listed other things that nobody noticed, and thus agreed to take responsiblity.   However everything outside the DMCA claim, all of the things you can read on this game from the ones hating it, are mostly pulled out of context, or straight on misunderstood (Like the name changes).  If you have already read a lot of them, you probalby will not believe anything that I am writing, whatever, however if you have even a tiny bit of open mind, you should ask yoursefl, why do so many people stand strongly for this game, even though there is so many 'proofs' against them.   And the answer to it is : because these are the players who have seen all the love and work this game got over the years. The stolen models, which were already removed from the game, didn't influence the game in any way, nor they didn't harm Activision. Let's be honest the selling point of Orion is not that one gun, it's not the guns at all. It's not even the graphics, though I have to admit, that graphical overhaul update coming with Orion : Prelude was so good, my old PC actually stoped being able to run the game.   So really, it's a great game that is a lot of fun to play, especially with friends, features many gamemodes, and mixes the mechanics like no other game I know of. It's a perfect mix of sillyness, gameplay, replayablitiy and ideas.   You should definetely get this game if you have whom to play it with. And if you are hating on the game without knowing anything outside of the drama lords posts, please don't. Even if the models were knowlingly taken (which, again were not, case is solved already), TREK at least doesn't steal from you, the player. Which I can't say about some AAA titles out there.
5393	1	a	very fun if played with friends
5395	1	a	I can absolutely recommend this awesome game. I only tried the survival mode yet but it is much more fun than the other coop zombie survival games like l4d2 or killing floor.
5397	1	a	It sucks. There you go. Everything about it sucks. I bought is for a dollar on a sale. It was hardly worth that dollar. I've only gotten around and hour or so on it, and that was when me and my friend felt like getting angry at a game. Just don't bother yourself to buy it. Please, don't. Don't let the developer sucker you into this crap. It's so repetitive. Please don't.
5399	1	a	Cutting edge. Regular updates hourly, and its only a pre alpha! Its like the best early access its going to change the gaming industry. Why dino you go get it now, even at full price of 59 dollars a steal!!!!!!  Five stars - and that aint the safety rating!
5401	1	a	This is the cheapest fun game I've ever played. I don't think I've ever spent so little on a game that offered so much fun. I mean, even for only 14 hours played, that's about $0.07 per hour. I plan to play more, as my son loves the game and we played together last time.  Guns, dinosaurs, vehicles, and co-op action - what could be more fun than that?  As to the politics behind Activision - you filthy console fanboys need to take a good hard look at your precious CoD games. Every single CoD game is a blatant rip-off of a game that was released prior. Not to mention that they recycle their own assets every year to release yet another garbage game for a whopping $60, AND it gets released on both PC and consoles. Talk about greed and thievery. They're picking your pockets, and you have the gall to accuse others of stealing?!? Shame on you.  You people deserve Infinite Warfare. Enjoy that.
5403	1	a	I punched Spinosaurus to death. 10/10
1279	0	a	Bought this game game for 99p and it feels like a waste of money. Incredibly linear, unloved and unoriginal.
1280	0	a	I can only politely describe this game as a waste of hard drive space. The issues are as follows. 1. Weapon names can be misleading, an LMG is a 3 round burst rifle, and a light machien fun with the LMG tag is further along. 2. Enemies will still spawn, and attack you, when it displays wave clear. 3. spawn and upgrade room defense turrets start the game broken and don't fix themselves. 4. player character models look hideous. 5. the multiplayer lobby system is unintitive, with as far as I could see, no start game or ready up functions.
1281	0	a	This game is not worth 99 cents. This game is not worth the time it takes to download, even on a fiber connection. This game is a finely glazed sewageloaf.
1282	0	a	This game blows goat ♥♥♥♥♥. It was originally Orion Dino Beatdown, and I thought it had promise with jetpacks and dinosaurs...however only one class got the jetpack and it just had the biggest amount of bugs, crap ai, crap graphics, sounds and just about everything. Anyone who has ever played this warns anyone they can to not play and generally that its a waste of money....yes even at $0.99.
1283	0	a	I love how hard you're trying to make it seem like this game made a comeback! No one is playing on the servers that have nearly 900 ping...... Stop trying move on. I intalled then uninstalled 4mins later. This game still sucks people....
1284	0	a	it sucks!
1285	0	a	Wtf, it's not even worth a dollar
1286	0	a	This game has great potential; I've never though of a dinosaur based survival game. On the other hand, there are some things that need tiny tweaks and major improvements. First of all, I'll be talking about things that need to drastically be changed.  1. The AI for the dinosaurs need some changes. All that the ground dinosaurs do is, if you're on the ground, bolt after you with no strategy and try to eat you. If you're somewhere they can't reach you, they'll either start randomly running around not knowing which path to take to get to you, or they'll go and destroy the generator. Also, if you shoot a dinosaur it does not affect its movement; it will keep in charging at you until you finally kill it. 2. Very frequently I've been kicked out of a match for no reason. The game doesn't tell me why I've been kicked which is a major drawback. Those are two things that need major improvements on. Now I will list things that could slightly be improved on. 1. Animations for dinosaurs could be made more natural. Going along with the first thing I listed, If you shoot a dinosaur, they could flinch and/or stagger a little before continuing on with what they were doing. 2. Animations for the player have been a little buggy for me. If I reload my weapon, sometimes the magazine will fly into its place before the hand can move the mag into its place. If I equip a pistol, the pistol will be in its ready position without my hands and then my hands will come to hold the pistol. I think all of these things should be changed, and I hope the developer of this game sees this and takes action. I've heard this game has made improvements, but once these are changed, I will be able to recommend this game.
5405	1	a	this game is worth so much more than the asking price, i have been playing it about a year now and still love playing it today.... i have had hours of fun playing it and u will too.....    so stop reading feedback and buy it haha (joke)
1291	0	a	This...game....is...♥♥♥♥! Do not buy it! It used to be called ORION: Dino Beatdown. Terra-bad game. Bought it when it was said title..
5407	1	a	Dino farm simulator is the more action packed version of farming simulator. Instead of farming crops, dinosaurs breed and spawn all throughout your farm. You then have the luxury of choosing which vehicle to farm their carcasses with.   10/10 would bake again.
5409	1	a	Good game if its on sale.
1294	0	a	This is not Jurassic Park. 0/10
5411	1	a	Don't look at the rating. Just buy it at discount when possible. Nice Replayability, cool game type options, generelly friendly community and hey...Dinos to kill.
5413	1	a	why dont i get the game????
5415	1	a	This game originally released as orion dino beatdown and honestly it was pretty damn awful. but spiral is devoted to this game and the concept. I feel this game is in good hands and will blossom into an A plus game. This game is incredibly fun and can be tough at times but for its cheap price it is 100% worth every penny. And around the fourth quarter of 2014 they are updating the game with Orion:prelude which offers siginificant graphical updates to this stellar game. Do i reccomened this game? Hell yeah
5417	1	a	you no the dino attack t-rex kill the gay at the game
5419	1	a	This game is buggy but it is really fun.Its a really good time especially if you get it for a dollar.
5421	1	a	Welp....if it is 99% off go for it.Worth 10 hours but not any more.Ill just recommend the game but Im actually neutral on this one...
5423	1	a	fun game need decent harware to run not 100% friendly to new players but a great game in general thanks for the huge sale guys 99 cents awesome
5425	1	a	at $1 a copy, why the ♥♥♥♥ not
5427	1	a	Killing dinosaurs in waves, while purchasing weapon upgrades and augmentations in between. With friends, this is GREAT.  HOW is it GREAT?  Well, I was playing with two other friends. We spotted a vehicle that reminds me of the warthog from the Halo series, with driver, passenger, and gunner seats. I drove. What's great about the vehicles is that you can hold right-click and enter first-person mode. Reminds me of Halo: Combat Evolved.  Anyways, I was running over any dino in front of me, the gunner focused on the big dino near the area, and the passenger keeping the flying dinos away from us.  I had the brilliant idea of running into the giant dino. As I did, we flipped out into the air and nearly died. But we lived.  GREAT GAME.
1299	0	a	Crashes on starting/joining, also in-game store is dull. Also it is not on Early Access. Money well spent.
5429	1	a	Idk how this game got a bad score!!!! It's like badass but there has been allot of updates since then...
5431	1	a	First off, that metacritic score is not legit it's for a different game, This game is a really great action dino game that will have you hooked for hours. There's one problem other then some buggs not big ones only minor, It isn't as fun by yourself , get a friend. Just get the game! 6.5/10
1300	0	a	Well in my video  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqNG5YizcE  near the end you can see the overall qualiy of this game. The graphics are kinda bad and glitches run rampant.
5433	1	a	10/10 would snap dinosaur's neck irl thx m0m i luve yuh happy birfday breh got fade catch it in orion dino horde breh the last of the real dino stompers irl and in game breh got fade lets catch it breh i dont even care im trying to write a g00b review and you talking smack breh 1v1 me in rust gotr problem brew
1301	0	a	Don't buy it even for a dollar. This game is bad and it doesn't improve at all. Occasionally game title changes; what will the fourth one, i wonder?  I'd like to make summarized cons and pros section for this review like most of my reviews but unfortunately i can't. Don't waste your time and money. Buy a cosmetic DLC, TF2/CSGO weapons, $1 valued bundle or just buy a snack for yourself. Just avoid this abomination.
1302	0	a	Should've been free. To many bugs and lag if you ask me
1303	0	a	You can customize characters in lots of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ways, but due to high techs armors it's not really funny and you need to buy these.. The game has nothing innovative. I didnt find it interesting although it's only 0.99 euro.
5435	1	a	Look at nice dinosaur models. Then barbecue them!
5437	1	a	Takedown : Red Sabre, but with dinosaurs.  Only fun when you play it with friends and with a casual attitude.   Get it while its a dollar and have some fun.   (the dinosaurs have REALLY loud roars, I mean like deafening if you play with headphones)
5439	1	a	Halo + Turok + Killing Floor. MUST BUY AT THIS 93% OFF DEAL!!!!! 
5441	1	a	Played once during a free-weekend had a blast, would definitely recommend it the metascore to my knowledge is from before a massive overhaul/update?  I liked the gun selection and customization, it was also very easy to get into gameplay wise.
5443	1	a	Its like the shootiest dino blasting adventure ever!!
5445	1	a	This is a extremly fun game that has an amazing replay value, SO much fun.
5447	1	a	Good fun game MUST play with friends and DO NOT pay full price.
1305	0	a	Steam seriously needs to get its quality control in order. This is an unplayably buggy piece of trash.
5449	1	a	This is a super game for the price! It's like Halo with dinosaurs, You fight off waves of dinos in a multiplay, multigun, multi vehicle setting. I really like it for the full submersion being surrounded by attacking dinos really giving you great combat training. If your into first or third person shooters and want to sharpen your close quarters combat skills - This game is for you. 
5451	1	a	really fun
5453	1	a	Okay, listen up. Back when this was released, it was quite the mess, game didn't really work, wasn't fun to play and i just felt like i wasted my money. They later released more patches that supposedly would fix the game, they did not fix it, they gave away free Limited-Edition skins to Early Buyers, i still was not satisfied.  I ignored the game for about a year, it just wasn't fun anymore, it felt like i was just wasting my time playing this bug-riddled mess, i tried to enjoy it beacuse it looked stunning on the trailer, sadly the game wasn't the same.  However, during Christmas 2013, Spiral Studios released a Christmas Update, along with a huge new Map called The Arctic. This was when i decided to take another look at the game, and i noticed how they added a Levelling system, kind of like Killing Floor's (This was heavily requested by the game's community) some new Maps, and fixed tons of the bugs that had been plaguing the game since release.  While still being a quite flawed game (as you can notice while playing the game for a bit, ESPECIALLY those third-person player character movement animations, they look beyond terrible, sorry it had to be said!) i can finally say that i had fun with this game, and at the current 93% Sale price, it is WORTH IT.  The game is even free right now, all week, so why not give it a shot? 
5455	1	a	This is LITERALLY The best game I have ever played. Buy it immediately.
5457	1	a	This game is does not deserve a 36 from Metacritic. This game is fun, fast, and sometimes stupidly hilarious. Sure, the textures and models aren't amazing, but the enjoyment and playability of this game is quite high. The dinos will sneak up on you and sometimes you'll wonder what the hell is happening, but you will ALWAYS have a fun time playing this game.  I played this game when it was free about 6 months before writing this review and I loved the game. It has been on my wishlist ever since, and I picked it up when it was only one dollar. It's a steal for a dollar, pick it up NOW.
5459	1	a	FUGIN great a bit like CoD Zombies with DINOS
5461	1	a	This game is nothing like I have seen before. I thought you were dinosaurs and you have to kill humans but it's the totall opposite. I really like this game and i would recommend it
5463	1	a	Pretty cool game, if your into dinosaurs and biting peoples asses off. Or, if your into killing animals to extinction and trying to get eaten. WELL! THIS IS DA GAME FOR U!
5465	1	a	I think this game has a bad first impression. Especially if you're not into 'horde' games. The learning curb is pretty small if you've been introduced to games like this before. Just kill everything and upgrade as much as possible. It can be somewhat easy once you know what you're doing and can kite a bit. Making it into late game can be very satisfying because there's so many smaller dinos and several bigger ones running around all trying to get you and you can single-handedly take them all out if you're a good enough pilot. The clash of futuristic weapons and armor with ancient extinct reptiles is nice. The mode I've been playing is survival, basically Killing Floor with bigger maps, vehicles, and upgrades. There's many more modes to try out though. If anything I'd say it's a least worth trying out. It's also pretty cheap so that's nice too. Of course there are some bad things about this as well. The good outweighs the bad, but still. One of the biggest things I've noticed is that the skies usually aren't that great compared to the landscape. Could just be a texture bug, but I dunno. If anything they're just boring. Another big problem is getting stuck in rocky places of the map. Can be very problematic if you're trying to get an object last minute. This game is great and I do look forward to future updates to help with some of the issues it has.
1306	0	a	I have one word to describe it:lag
5467	1	a	This game is quite buggy and I feel like I'm shooting rubber bullets but when your playing with friends, this game is actually pretty fun :D
5469	1	a	great game for that price
5471	1	a	Game most definitely deserves a better metascore.
5473	1	a	Grab a knife. Slice for your Life!
5475	1	a	Punched out a velociraptor. 10/10
5477	1	a	$0.99, Why not??
5479	1	a	0/10 Dinosaurs are extinct SOO UNREALISTIC!!  But no seriously its pretty fun
5481	1	a	I bought this game for a dollar I think. As far as games go it's ok I guess, but when I read how long it's been in development and how hard the team has been working on it, I get the urge to stand up and flip my desk over, and walk out of the room muttering about syrup and potatos.  This game is fun for a dollar, but don't try and tell me it's been in development for 3 years when I could have made this in my sleep with the help of a couple pet seals dry humping my keyboard.  I have no problem with indy developers, but these guys sound like they are so full of crap. This game could run on a school science caculator. It's just garbage, it would be really fun if they would fix the mechanics and animates. The textures and graphics aren't so bad but yea it's crap.  But it only costs a dollar or something so you might as well buy it.
5483	1	a	This is a fun game, but what has ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off is that I paid for it and now it's F2P. I'm quite annoyed. Is there a way I can request a refund? Hahah. But non-the-less it is a fun game and great gfx. 5/5 if I get a refund
5485	1	a	The game is fantastic. It's come a long way from Dino Beatdown and as a lot of other reviews will say: do not trust the metacritic score. I've gotten more hours of fun than I have from games I've paid four times as much for. You can kill T-Rex's with flame throwers, rocket launchers, miniguns, bows, snipers, machine guns, a knife, a jedi sword, and grenades.
1309	0	a	Really really not worth your time due to bugs, bad game design and almost nothing to do. It makes the tutorals of MOBA's look good as you find out what kills you as you die again to no apparent souse.  This game is for when your drunk and want to rip the @£$ out of a game while making bad T-Rex jokes.
5487	1	a	You take a FPS, put on a hard mechanic, combined with HALO's engine and add Dinosaur AI and Skin, mixed with OP Guns and hard system requirements. Overall: 5/10, game has a huge lack of players and servers.
5489	1	a	Fantastic.
5491	1	a	Hey your qoute 'We released the worst game ever' Day one garrys incident is IMO
5493	1	a	awsome/cod/halo/tf2/juassic park/
5495	1	a	I really enjoyed and i strongly recommend it :D
5497	1	a	Better than any of the COD, BF, or Halo games. Worth the money if you like good FPS.
5499	1	a	This game is verry glitchy, But its a verry fun game still. Buy it, its cheep why not?  8.6/10
1312	0	a	'If you don't have anything good to say, don't say anything'. That about sums this game up for me.
5501	1	a	Not the best but very very far from the worst. This is like halo, and bit of borderlands and a dose of coop mixed in.  A great way to waaste time.
5503	1	a	Still better than COD 10/10 
5505	1	a	my friend got eaten alive bij a T-rex. :D 10/10
1314	0	a	The factor is that this game is simply terrible. When I first picked up this game, it seemed like it was going to be something fun to play with friends. Boy was I wrong, first off lets take a look at graphics. Listen, I know that graphics are not everything but this game looks like it was thrown together in a day. The animations are so very basic and so crappy that it truly does take away from any positive gameplay expierence. But perhaps your the person that could care less about any type of graphical fidelity and instead are content with a good gameplay expierence. Too bad it doesn't provide good gameplay either. The game is full of glitches, such as during a wave of dinosuars, the dinosaurs remaining count doesn't change at all, leaving you with a never ending wave. Or perhaps the factor that only certain dinosaurs bring down the counter, despite the factor that there is not a singal indicator as to which dinosaurs to kill. Then lets look at the factor that this game has so many elements from other titles. Now, there is nothing wrong with utilizing previously exsisting features in games to improve your own (Borderlands 2 driving mechanic, fight to revive etc.), that's what helps push the industry forward. Sadley this game does not have an original bone in it's body, and the features it does take from others, it does incredibly poorly. Overall this is a pass, I would NOT recommend buying this game.
5507	1	a	it is quite fun, and it seems like developers are really committed. I would recommend this game as it is continuously improving. With that being said it is certainly worth the discounted price and will soon be worth its normal price. They should however list it as early access so people know it will get better.
5509	1	a	FORGET THE METASCORE RATING. FORGET IT RIGHT NOW! Have you always wanted to fight dinosaurs with your fists? That's a weird thing to hope for! This game's for you then! It's weird just like you! But I bet you also have friends, right? No? Well then... IT'S STILL A FUN GAME TO PLAY ALONE. Although not as fun as with friends. PLAY WITH YOUR FRIENDS. If you don't have friends MAKE SOME ONLINE ONES. And if you don't have those THEN MAY NEPTUNE HAVE MERCY ON YOUR SOUL. 10/10 WOULD PLAY AGAIN IF I WAS IN A DARK ROOM WITH NOTHING ELSE TO PLAY.
1315	0	a	Alt+F4 does not work... it really should because i wanted to stop playing AFAP 2/10 would not bang
5511	1	a	This is just my first impresions,  It's avesome, gun play fun, dinos fun, movement easy, grafics pasable, sound effect a litle dull, but still fun  It's that rule it's so mediocore thats its fun... standard
5513	1	a	heard it was bad
5515	1	a	Very cool fun game. Bad that it doesn't hav an complex developer console like the valve games to make it work on pc from 1998.
5517	1	a	Great game! But hard to run.
5519	1	a	This game is so awesome. Think firefight mode on Halo: Reach, but ten times more awesome. Tons of content, lots of fun, and the community is also pretty great. Don't think i've ever had more fun in a multiplayer game before this. There are a lot of guns to choose from, the maps are absolutely huge, and the vehicles are pretty great. Everything handles well and runs smoothly. My only complaint is that there are only three human classes but apparently, there is a major update coming to this game in august which includes both a name change for the game itself and a bunch of new classes.
5521	1	a	T-Rex grabbed my tank, throws me away. Flipped over. Dead. Raged hard, but funny. Spinosaurus brutally murders me just eating me str8 of the bat. 10/10 I mean it may seem ♥♥♥♥ed up but hey it's really fun.  MAIN REVIEW:  Do you like dinosaurs? YEAH! Do you like getting like ♥♥♥♥ing devoured by them? DOUBLE YEAH! Do you like the Jurassic Parks and Jurassic World? YEAH!  Well, lets do Jurassic Park/World / chomping which probably turns out to be this game. This game has very outstanding graphics and possible real impressions of what dinosaurs were probably and has many cool features such as being in the future and many cool gadgets.  GAMEPLAY: When I first got the game around a year after it's release for $0.99 on a sale when it was originally $15USD, I liked it even though around that time it was ONE of the worst games but I thought it was amazing. Even though it had many bugs and other things I didn't seem to notice those bugs (Maybe a bit but not a mountain full of them) and I knew the game one day would become much more popular. Currently the gameplay is amazing as your objective in the dino survival is to survive for 10 rounds without getting the generator destroyed by the dinos. It might've not seen much but it was very entertaining. Although you probably raged hard when the Spinosaurus ate you, you were still enjoying the game.  Pro's and Cons (Past and Present)  PROS: -The Devs were very supportive and tried really hard to revive the game and suceeded. -Certain maps have a weather system and on cold maps your vizor could freeze -Unique weapons to choose from like Adrenaline weapons -Unique upgrades/augmentations to choose from to help win the game -Well textured graphics -Many different sounds -Well done impressions of the dinosaurs -It only costs $0.99USD  CONS: -Can get bored of it for a while and not play it for a prolonged time -Needs maybe some more classes -Couple more weapons  CONCLUSION: Overall, it is a very well crafted game and very cool and unique features and I would very highly recommend this game and really, it's $0.99USD. Try their game! they are just trying to make a good game and it is so just go ahead and try it.
5523	1	a	ORION:DH is like discount Halo with dinosaurs. I spent hours slashing dinosaurs and it was a good experience. The game is very cheap and also come with 5 trading card (each around 0.1~0.12 $ on market) thus profit. If you by chance saw this game on discount 75% or more, make sure to buy it. You won't regret it !
5525	1	a	Pretty fun game. It got very low metascore ratings due to it being released VERY early on when it was very glitchy with little content.  Its had a lot of improvements, though and it quite fun now. Good if you like slaying things with your friends.
5527	1	a	This game actually kind of rules. The metacritic score is outdated and wrong. This game has quite a few bugs and general lack of polish, but there are no game-breaking or even game-delaying bugs. If you can see past the shoddy UI and overall presentation, you'll find that co-op dino killin' is really fun. The core gameplay is actually done quite well. It could use some more dino types and better balance, but aside from that everything is spot-on and highly entertaining.
5529	1	a	Rode a vehicle full of teammates into a dino and it blew up. Won an achivment 10/10 id suicide bomb again.
5531	1	a	Better than before '-')b~~~~
5533	1	a	Awsome value for money.this game is better than some $20 games. Dont doubt my playtime, this game is meant to be played in short bursts.
5535	1	a	While its an extremley fun game on the outside of its dino like body, its a buggy mess on the inside. Some thinks its horrible, others think its awesome, Im in the middle somewhere, it looks amazing on full settings and you need a beefy computer to do that, gameplay wise, its really fun , but some bugs downright BREAK the game, like when my friend accidently drove off a cliff and he couldnt get out of the car even when it was upright, story, it has none, now to the dinosaurs you can fight, the Tyrannosaurus, Spinosaurus, Trike, Stegosaurus, Deinasuchus, Raptor, Compy, Pteradactyl, and a few more. The modes you will play most are the Rampage, Survival, and Dinosurvival, I will go over these. Rampage, you become the dinosaurs against other players as the humans. Survival is where you go through 10 waves and fight off hordes of dinosaurs, over time the objective will change simotaneasly. Dinosurvival is where its basically survival, but you can kill your teamates, which is weird, my overall rating has to be......... 7/10, like I said, its the glitches
5537	1	a	My friend could buy 260 copies of ORION Prelude by selling his csgo knife. 10/10 IGN
5539	1	a	METAscore was sooooo wrong this game is very fun and takes some stratgy or teamwork in some game modes and i love how u can play as the Dinosaurs.  78/100
1320	0	a	Don't waste your time.
5541	1	a	The Metacritic score is indeed misleading. It may not be as polished as some AAA titles but its not as bad as its metacritic score makes you believe. Its a fun unique game with tons of content, lots of game modes, a 50 level leveling system, 3 classes and tons of weapons and upgrades that its meant to be played with other people. The devs keep releasing updates adding and fixing stuff and there are many people playing atm.  I'd say that its worth a try, you'll enjoy it.
5543	1	a	I first saw this game when it was on sale, and when I watched the videos and read the reviews, I thought it was a joke. So I bought it. When I started playing it at first, I had no clue what was going on. After trying different gamemodes, I finally understood the joke and began enjoying the lighthearted and jesting atmosphere. To be honest, this game is a joke. But not a bad joke that gets told over and over again and makes you want to punch whoever is telling it. No, this game is a joke that pulls you in, chews you up, spits you out, and makes you want to start all over again. And I like it.
1322	0	a	don't work on windows 8.1 64bit, nvidia gtx 780 x 2 sli with 32gb ddr3
1323	0	a	Great idea for gameplay, horrible execution. The game environments look alright, but the character, weapon, vehicle, and building textures look like they were made by members of the Unreal Tournament community over a decade ago. I don't understand how a game engine can have the kind of performance issues that this game suffers from, even when all the settings are turned low, despite the fact that it doesn't look as good as other titles I've played (that perform better). The gameplay leaves me asking questions like: Why is the generator so far away from the other buildings? Why don't I have enough time to get back and buy weapons and upgrades between rounds? I also find myself asking questions about the originality of the game, such as: why does the tank look like a ripoff of the scorpion from Halo? Why are we fighting dinosaurs of different time periods, millions of years apart? Why aren't these like, primordial alien monsters that resemble dinosaurs (we are futuristic soldiers)? Why does the menu music sound like a cross between Battlefield games and the action score of Pirates of the Carribean (which already sound similar)?  I read a review last time I tried a free preview that stated the game still feels like it's in alpha. I agreed with it. I read a recent (community) review that said they've improved the game since then. My recent experience proves that to be mostly false and I still agree, it needs a ton of work because it still feels like it's in alpha.  Biggest problem: how is this not a free-to-play game if it has its own store?
1324	0	a	There's a good game in here.. somewhere.  The gun and vehicle play are solid and there are sparse moments of real squad camaraderie‎.  However, they're the exception and not the rule as lousy UI, poor squad communication (someone just hit the 'Follow me!' voice bind. Who did it? Not displayed.) and incredibly frustrating player death (wait 10+ minutes for the round to be over, and all your stuff is now gone.)  The item loss on death can be mitigated by unlocking permenant character gear through levelling, but the players who need this boost the most -- the newbies -- are completely left out. As a result, it's not uncommon for a new player to join up on wave 6 with nothing but a pistol and be completely slaughtered before he can earn the credits to get anything else. It's kind of heartbreaking watching a dozen of these players join your game, get murdered, and leave, one and two at a time.
5545	1	a	I drove a jeep. Ran over triceratops. Went flying and hit the skybox. 11/10 would do again
1325	0	a	This Game even on sale is a real dissapointment, but because of the marketing strategies used by the dev's they make this game look like game of the decade so dont get suckered in and bight the bait. All and all there isnt much to enjoy playing this game even with friends because the whole game is as the title sais; you are killing hordes of dinos and nothing else ever sure there is fancy guns mechanics and vehicles but it doesnt take away the fact that its only killing A.I dino's. It would be the same thing if tetris threw in mechanics to send blocks backwards and get upgrades its still just ♥♥♥♥ing blocks
5547	1	a	It's like killing floor  but its not
5549	1	a	A strangely fun FPS game enjoyed best with friends. The assets look like they were taken off of a Halo knock-off, but the gameplay of wave-based dino shooting and vehicle driving has a simple satisfaction that other AAA games don't always seem to provide.   That, and for less than a McChicken!
5551	1	a	For one dollar, it's definitely worth it. Think of it as an arena-styled game with some Halo-like vehicles and Borderlands-esque graphics. Though its not the most engaging game ever, its very fun at times and has rewarding gameplay. Mowing down hordes of dinos is always fun as you continue to gain credits in order to get better weapons and even vehicles. Great value and good fun for a dollar and you'll definitely get some enjoyment out of this for its price.
5553	1	a	If a dinosaur, killing floor, and halo had a love child this would be it. 
5555	1	a	It's actually pretty damn fun you can play as the spy with the amby knife and invis watch never buy any primary or secondaries the amby has infinite ammo and 1 hits everything anyway just get 100000 monies for backstabbing dinosaurs on halo maps.
5557	1	a	This game is a really fun multiplayer 'shoot-some-dinos' fps for one dollar.  +Graphics +Variety of equipment/guns/upgrades +Leveling plus permanent bonuses for leveling +Get to shoot dinos for fun +1$ -Could add more types of dinos and maybe a HUGE horde mode :D  Seriously, no cons really. Especially at 1$ no point in not buying it. Seriously a really fun game. Happy hunting.
5559	1	a	i dont have this game.
5561	1	a	Amazing game, pretty addicting and fun to play with your friends, at the price of 0.49$. Awesome! oops, forgot to mention. Open the door, get on the floor, everybody do the dinosaur!
5563	1	a	Worst game that I've ever played and I like it for that! The glitches in this game make it a hilarious game to play with your friends, especially if you like derping around and breaking the games. Obviously, it's not going to be a masterpiece as you only pay 0,99€ for it, but I think it's definetily worth trying at least!
5565	1	a	For 79p, Tony Hawks Pro Dino Buggy 2004 is the perfect addition to your library. Marvel as the mighty Stegasaurus aids you in flipping your dune buggy into a crazy 2160 degree trick, which nets you the one thing gamers love more than anything else: points.  Highly recommended, never before has the Unreal Engine looks so lush; comparable to the mighty potato mentioned so oft in the archives of the venerable fountain of knowledge that is youtube.  Punched a T-Rex in the face: 13/7
5567	1	a	11/10 would hear me roar oar oar oar oar ooarr
5569	1	a	More better then 'EVOLVE'.
5571	1	a	Got 2 achievments and a card while jetpacking into t-rex balls.  11/10 would play again.
5573	1	a	ORION: Dino Horde is one of those fun games that me and my friends have a great time in. There are many gamemodes and maps and most which involve the fun dino killing the game is based around. What adds on to the fun is their system of vehicles and the Rampage mode, which puts you onto the side of the humans AND the dinos. This is all around a very fun game to play and I recommend it.
5575	1	a	Bought it for a dollar. You shoot dinosaurs. Pretty fun for LAN parties, but not the best for single-player, in my opinion.
5577	1	a	Doesn't suck.
1331	0	a	Where my dogs at man? Where my medic dogs at man?
5579	1	a	Don't bother with the metascore.
1332	0	a	probably the worst game on steam
5581	1	a	I still have trouble accepting the fact that I paid $0.99 for this game. Even if you don't particularly love this game, you will still feel like you got your money's worth just because of how complete and all around solid the whole experience is. This is an A+ title in this gamer's opinion.
5583	1	a	this game very good 
5585	1	a	DUDE ! its like Boarderlands , Halo , Killing floor and Jurassic Park all in one game
1335	0	a	I saw a lot of reviews said that this game offers a lot of fun for a cheap price.Well,that's not entirely true.It's just too boring for me.The graphic is mediocre,the animation is dreadful,the guns have 0 recoil and it's pretty hard for me to find someone playing online since I play from Indonesia.I can't feel the survival thrill like in other wave survival games.It's just too unrealistic and illogical.It's not worth your money,unless you'll want to pay for boredom in a couple of hours.
5587	1	a	It´s like Left4Dead but with dinosaurs, and i love it
5589	1	a	Better than Bioshock Infinite, maybe.
5591	1	a	I recommend this game for those who played L4D and L4D2 as this is an awesome survival game !
5593	1	a	First Impressions: Not a great game, but the only multiplayer dinosaur attack pc fps I've ever played I thinkk. Loosely similar to **Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter**. Mildly entertaining, it's not awful if you've ever wanted to mindlessly shoot at dinosaurs for a few minutes. Pretty simple setup, and still people playing online so it's not hard to find a game  Cons: - lots of glitchy jumpy laggy physics (being picked up by the pterodactyl).  - weapon store in separate building from perk upgrades?  Pros: - large weapon variety (snipers, pistols, a bow??) - many many hungry dinosaurs - snow map is quite large - giant fat dinosaurs that take a whole team to wrangle  Kinda cool, like a 3 out of 5 ish  Check our other reviews!  www.KittiesAndBacon.com 
5595	1	a	Why the ♥♥♥♥ does this game keep changing names? Nah I don't care whatever it's ok, I got it for free so ♥♥♥♥ it, have a recommendation.
5597	1	a	this is cactus :D :3  IM DONG so a;caguash man
5599	1	a	I was really surprised how much fun this game actually is, and for only $1. I had little expectations for it, but was so surprised, I spent the first whole weekend playing the game non stop, I even reguarly host my own server there too. There are many modes in the game too Iprefer survival, and conquest the most, but also they have 1v1 duel, and FFA, and CTF. you should stop reading this review and just buy it already.
1342	0	a	Nice world. Great Trailers. But sense of accomplishment? Nah.  Single player (solo) in 'noob mode' should be removed from the gameplay options for the maps in this game. There is no noob mode as it suggests. You arrive on the map with a timer to find everything you'd need to be wearing before the waves of dinos start, but you can't look for those things until you turn on the generator which is how you start the first wave, a generator which, for some amazing reason, is located far from the base where your weapons and augments are located. If the premise is that we're establishing ourselves on some alien planet we know is habitated by dinosaurs then why would we put the generator some 150 yards from our main base? One could say it'd be because it'll explode if it gets too severly damaged, okay, then it would also injure badly and/or kill whatever made it explode too. None of this appears to have been happening.  -The dino flyers that attack enroute to the next base we're supposed to capture disappear too quickly or take a flight path that makes hitting them extremely difficult for the new player (differnet flight paths, aggression, etc., in noob mode would have been a great consideration).  -The vehicles were destroyed rather quickly as well.  -There's nothing but a sign over a building that gives any direction, nothing inside to show what station or location in the building of your base you're supposed to use to get weapons or an augment. No tutorial walking you through your toon's options either.  -When the triceritops (I think it was) had killed me and the game went into fight to survive mode, the dino walks away and I am moving at a crawl, unable to carry out that fight, though it said I have 3 lives left, apparently there is no actual rez, just a fight in almost dead mode where you can't even follow the assaulting AI let alone fire at it.  One might think I am asking for a finished game (as I see this has a kickstarter). No, I am asking for the game to be thoughtful of the new player they decided to have a free weekend for (February 20th-27th). If they're trying to sell the game through that free weekend (and thereby also sell kickstarter contributors) then this was their opportunity and though the executable code seems pretty clean and well done, which I do greatly appreciate, the chance for a new player to appreciate the actual game, to have the fun seen in the videos is just not there in the first run experience.  When we compose from a letter to a written story, maybe better said as author a letter or story, to communicate something we are to write to the reader or we'll have failed to communicate to those we want to express something to. Games, and the industry as a whole, are communicating a story and are always looking for new players, yet, their considerations of game design in relation to telling their story seems to follow whatever path the experienced and elitist gamers say is good. These are given preferential treatment in influencing the game design and often of closed alpha and beta relationships. Their input is great for those areas of the game such experience would lend itself to aiding in the design of, but for the new player and selling a game to the vast audience it has potential to reach, the gaming company listening to the entrenched 'professional' game tester, as with this game, finds the game has a very narrow appeal, and that the gaming company ended up designing their game to a player 'first time experience' in an elitist vacuum of these types of gamers whose playing of the game alone will not afford to keep the servers open. Thus the free game play weekend is wasted if its intended purpose was to elicit a large enthusiastic interest of new and highly energized players.  And remember that this free weekend isn't just to sell a game but is also an opportunity to sell it well enough to gain those new players as kickstarter contributors. This will be very difficult to do when the first impression, that first time one plays the game it seems to have entirely ignored that first game play experience, to have failed to give that first time player an overwhelming positive emotional response that brings them to want to continue the game to see what's next, and, to help develop the game further by contributing to the development -- a desire to have a direct connection to whatever comes next in that development.  I can't recommend the game or say it's a good game, I didn't get to go that far and only know how my first experience was worthless in regard to feeling exhilarated, feeling good about the game, and having any sense of accomplishment -- all of these were lacking.   For what I played, however, Spiral gets an A+ for code that's clean and well written, that had no graphic or other odd issues and for creating a visually appealing world that through videos sold me to try Orion: Dino Horde.  I hope they keep at it but know that they can only rewrite the first experience by assuring the one they offer is well scripted to achieve as broad an appeal as they can while well informing the player of how to play, so the learning and achievement are mutually occurring and help give every new player an incredibly positive player experience where their sensation from this experience creates an obvious knowledge that the game designers thought of the player first and their need for newe players to assure the game's longevity. This will also aid in making sure noob mode is easily identifiable for the new player (meaning we know that we can try harder modes and thus want to experiment, the first step in gaining our desire to play and become immersed in the game and its world).  In summary, what I am saying is that if Spiral doesn't design to achieve a large and enthusiastic player base (that will naturally come from new players) then the future of the game is dim, and to take the time to play a game that has a short life span is only good if you're sure you weren't going to play this that long anyway, but if Spiral's design and idea is to have a long standing game then the first consideration should be the new player and making sure these are plentiful and will, over time, not require a free-to-play weekend to gain. It'll be a great game if the same integrity that went into the coding of the game goes into the game's design considerations and map option characteristics.
5601	1	a	literally the best game ever made. totally not a halo rip off with dinosaurs. 10/10
5603	1	a	Totally worth the price (especially when on sale). It is an entertaining game where you shoot dinosaurs with your Sci-Fi friends while equipped with cool guns and grenades and jetpacks. Seriously why would you not play this game.
5605	1	a	Fantastic, perfectly created for our enjoyment! No glitches or anything!
1343	0	a	June 2014 I've noticed massive improvements since launch, but it's still a terrible game. The narritive voices are a joke, and are only there to hide the fact they don't have proper dinosaur sounds. Every dinosaur pretty much behaves the same way, they just rush at you when you get within a certain distance, and some have ranged attacks, or fly, but they are otherwise the same enemy. The game has a choppy and unpolished feel to it. It's cool that they are adding new things to the game, but the game really needs some polish rather than new game modes and items.
5607	1	a	this game is awesome, we can shoot the dino until turn to chicken
5609	1	a	Okay, this is the only review I've ever done for Steam. The Metacritic score is not justifiable. This game is AT LEAST worth the price. Get it if it's on sale. It gets really fun sometimes.
5611	1	a	Don't know why it has a 36 metascore, it's a fun relaxing game where you get to blow off dinosaurs heads and have an objective to complete with a team
5613	1	a	Really nice and good game 10/10
5615	1	a	I'm mainly a coop gamer and this game has a fun coop gameplay, pitting humans against dinosaurs in huge world maps with weather effects. Kill dinosaurs to earn XP, upgrade your abilities, buy new weapons, vehicles and survive the waves! Anxiously waiting for the august 2014 update.
5617	1	a	Halo and dinosaurs?! This game is sort of like Halo but with waves of dinosaur killing. Its a pretty cheap game and fun with friends. When it is on sale get it!
5619	1	a	Its got dino's and guns, nuff said!
5621	1	a	A very addictive game and fun as hell!! ^_^
5623	1	a	got picked up by a T-rex, used a rocket launcher to explode its head. 10/10
5625	1	a	The game is fun with your friends but it can become very annoying to play with all the glitches
5627	1	a	Got it for $1.50 with a bunch of friends on the Steam Sale and we all had a blast tonight. Don't let the metacritic score fool you. This was really fun.
1344	0	a	I just bought and played Orion: Dino Horde because it was on sale for a buck. I immediately regret this purchase. I knew the game was under development hell but it’s just so bad. And the community is worse than the game itself. It’s just filled with kids who think the game is better Call of Duty but even Call of Duty has some polish. It’s just so bad. The controls are so clunky even after changing the terrible default key bindings. Movement and aiming feel so stiff. There are so many missing animations. Guns sound and feel like peashooters. Even rocket launchers look, sound and feel weak. The art design looks like your generic scifi shooter. The music is bland. There is just no redeeming quality about this game. Holy ♥♥♥♥ I can’t believe something like this is even on Steam. It feels like an alpha build but it isn't. It’s a full game that has been officially released for 2 years now. And the sad thing is that was a kickstarter project. I almost feel sorry for the poor shmucks that funded this now obvious cashgrab.
5629	1	a	best fps yet
5631	1	a	It is a really awesome game :)
5633	1	a	It was worth the 59 cents I spent on it
5635	1	a	The game plays like Killing Floor, but with dinosaurs and Halo-style gear. I'm writing this based on the second major iteration of the game. I played it when it was still ORION: Dino Beatdown - back when it got the low Metascore that still, unfortunately, weighs heavily on it. It wasn't polished, and I think people expected more from it. This was in the days before Early Access was a thing; the game was buggy, and felt more like a late alpha or beta build than a complete game. That being said, the dev team's work to completely revamp and tweak the game shows. They added a mode to play as dinosaurs, more maps, and I hear they have mechs and stuff now - but I have yet to play with those. Point is, the game has come a long way, and if it sounds like a game you'd like, watch a few videos, and take the Metascore with a grain of salt. It's forever going on sale, so just wait for one if you still have your doubts.
5637	1	a	Literally don't know wtf this game is but I bought it and kept it cuz it had dinos. So worth it. (Idk if it is cuz I don't understand this game).
5639	1	a	Halo meets Turok! This game is all about survival and it does a good job of challenging you. This game is a BLAST with friends, it is still fun solo, but amplified many times over with more people. It has an addicting gameplay that rewards progress. All DLC is free and will be free, customization is simple yet fun. Where else can you punch a Trex in the face, get rewarded wtih 750 credits AND unlock an achievement?   Breakdown 8.5/10 (In it's current state an 8.5, but IMMENSELY strong potential to be a perfect 10!)  *High replayability *Tons of achievements to unlock *co-op or adversarial multiplayer *DINOSAURS!!
5641	1	a	Cheap, but very entertaining game. Hopefully they could make an upgrade about campaign though, like what are your objectives, why are you killing dinosaurs, and such, I think that we're alien visitors and just mining some power for our own planets or technology, should add details about such things. anyway, great game 8/10
5643	1	a	Fun game, good deal for the price.
5645	1	a	The best things in life arent free. But a damn good game can be $1
5647	1	a	This. Is a great game for those who like first person shooters  If you ever get broad play this
5649	1	a	Another dino game, I know, but this one is more of a survival shooter. Plus, you can get some stuff to look good and to impress. Overall, this game is brilliant and it was worth the 1 euro I gave for it.  -10/10 was not disappointed
5651	1	a	Fun Game Would get old fast but make sure you put silly Waves on ! Makes the Game Last a bit longer
5653	1	a	Its buggy in a funny way. It's definatly worth it, and better than most games with this concept.  PS: I hir a T-Rex in the ♥♥♥♥ with a knife, so thats a big plus.
5655	1	a	I remember when i bought this game when it came out, and i must say it was horrible. Like there was so many bugs that everyone was just mad at the devs for releasing such a bad game. But now i see they have improved and i wanna give it a try again. And based on other reviews, it seems like a good try (its also a buck)
5657	1	a	think of halo, and raids of dinosours atacking. that is EXACTLY what this game is. there is replicas of ghosts, banshes, and those tanks... its a rip off halo 3 - reach
5659	1	a	It's so bad it's good. Get it on sale.
5661	1	a	This game is literally sex
5663	1	a	3
1347	0	a	The unistall button works.
1348	0	a	there is a horde of dions that eat your face. play on the halloween map if you (dont) want to preserve your sanity. why do the t rex throw rocks from its face? no backstory whatsoever and this game sucks.
5665	1	a	I had a knife fight with a Pterodactyl. So much awesome.
5667	1	a	according to amazon dot com, this game is six times cheaper than buying a baseball bat to beat your own head in
5669	1	a	The Sharknado of video games.
5671	1	a	Just buy it play for 1 hour and never touch it again. 'Still better than FNAF' 10/10 ~Everybody
1350	0	a	it ran like crap in 2013, still runs like crap
5673	1	a	This game is really awsome and if you have friends to play with,it'll be even more awsome. I just wish this game was more popular.  Also,you can    Noscope a T Rex and kill him in one shot     11/9    Because only America puts months before days    -IGN
5675	1	a	Despite the many criticisms surrounding this game and its history, it's actually not bad, especially after all the free updates that the dev team has been rolling out, an unprecedentedly generous feature compared to the larger, corporate imperiums that dominate game design today, who not only disregard bugs and their player base, but would have them pay extra for such to be fixed in the way of expansions and DLC.  The game itself isn't exactly a revolutionary genre, but it incorporates popular aspects from several games and melds them together to form a unique and generally enjoyable experience. If anything, I'd say jetpacking above the reach of hordes of raptors and blasting them to smithereens with a rocket launcher is my idea of a good time, but take it or leave it: It's only a buck, yet worth quite a bit more in replayability.
1352	0	a	 Unless You Have Friends To Play With... Really Only Worth It For The Trading Cards
1353	0	a	i want my money back.
5677	1	a	This game cured my autism. But gave me astigmatism instead.
5679	1	a	Bad optimized.. freezes on i7 4712MQ + Geforce 940M, where GTA V works on high settings.. But it's fun to play! :)
1354	0	a	this game is garbage tried playing several matches and the game performs so poorly, yet it keeps going up on sales, it's not even worth a dollar  
1355	0	a	This game might be cool. If me and my friends could actually play together without 'cannot connect' ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.   Not worth 15 bucks at full price or 3 dollars on sale.  This game is st00pid.
1356	0	a	So I am going to be rather honest with this short verdict, if you are expecting miracles or top-notch gameplay or graphics, stop reading and avoid this game like the plague.  This is essentially a multiplayer game, one with co-op and versus options. You have your stereotypical bore options such as capture the flag, or we can actually explore the aspect of the game which is any different, the co-op mode versus those pesky dinosaurs.  The menu is rather broken, click refresh too many times and you need to reboot the game. It is essentially a bad version of Natural Selection 2's. You can tell why the game got a metacritic of 30, and after a year of updates, it is probably in the range of 50 now.  Getting in the game has its own issues, there doesn't seem to be good/dedicated server support, so you would end up joining some random guys game, most of these are stuck on the lobby with the host inconviently afk browsing x-rated sites, so I recommend perhaps starting your own game like I did. Wait for a few people to join, which tend to come like buses after waiting 5 minutes, then the game starts.  There are three classes, assualt, support and recon. I haven't played support, so I won't comment on that, but out of the other two options, I found Assualt to be the best. Recon has a really good cloaking ability, with some upgrades you are essentially invisible to the dinos and with a stealth weapon, it doesn't break, when getting attacked, cloak makes the dinos run after someone else too, making you totally vanish to them. However, energy is limited and it will take a while to get to that point, which leaves assualt. You might go 'Cloak versus a Jetpack, cloak sounds better..' but the thing is, most dinosaurs cannot jump, so even with the beginning, you can clinb upon a big rock and be untouched (save for spitters and rock throwing t-rex, and flying dinos). So it is consistently good from the start, and with upgrades, you can fly around almost carefree out of trouble.  You basically start in an augment building, the 2nd is a weapons building. If you set 5k as the beginners amount, you can go over to the weapons building to buy an assualt rifle, If not, you will need to do waves, which will get you money quickly since popping a dino is an easy 100-200 credits. weapons range from rockets, rifles, lasers, snipers, bow(!) and others.  You will get access to vehicles depending on the mode, with survival being unlockable after taking bases. You have swoopers (like out of starwars), jeeps (think warthog), a mech, a tank, and a helicopter.  The enemy AI is rather simple, it is a combination of mindless running around until they spot you, trying to take you like a female dino. Most of your time will be spend running around backwards and shooting them, unless you are on a big rock, then you shoot them from that as they cry foul of lack of long arms to climb after you.  Despite a lot of negative comments and feedback from the above, I actually ended my first couple of games. I audibly expressed 'aaagh..!' as I was getting chased down a slope by a t-rex, trying to jetpack away with no energy, firing wildly at it to try to kill it (we did! i survived). It is definitely one where you enjoy the novelty of the concept, plus, I really love co-op games opposed to single/competitive.  The game does have good controller support whilst in the game (not for menus). You would want to make some keymapping adjustments so it fits the typical console fps setup, but it works rather well and it is playable. Only downside is the slow aim-moving, since petradycals attack you in a frenzy like a moth to a lightbulb, which I found a lot easier to handle with m/kb.  Overall, the game is 5/10. It look and feels low-budget and it definitely does not have any polish on it.  However, if you got a few friends who are interested, pick one with a good rig/connection to host, talk on skype/ventrilo/mumble, get a drink and have a laugh. If you don't have any friends, you will probably play a couple of games and not bother more.
5681	1	a	Theres Dinosaurs :D that is all
5683	1	a	♥♥♥♥ game 1337/10 would ♥♥♥♥ a game again
5685	1	a	It's so sad to see people from reddit just buy this game to give it a negative review when it is a pretty good game, had some pretty decent times in here with friends, and more to come!
5687	1	a	The best game you can get for 99 cents. Imagine Killing Floor but with dinosaurs, its 99 cents... buy it.
1362	0	a	A truly horrible game, don't even consider buying this.
5689	1	a	rawr this is the best game evar &lt;3333333333 xD
1367	0	a	Where to start....  I played this game when it was a disgusting cluster♥♥♥♥ of bugs. It was as horrible as their trailer depicts it to be. I played for maybe 30 minutes before I had enough.  It has come a VERY long way. However, it is still astonihing to me that action propmpts are still missing (it took me about 3 waves to figure out how to purchase weapons, and an aditional 3 to figure out how to get reloads). Granted, most of the game breaking bugs are gone, but don't expect your gameplay experience to be close to what the trailer sells. YES there are high intensity moments...every few waves.  The controls are ok. Except when you are trying to hit flying enemies...that feel closer to puppets following a rail. Then you have to have very precise aim, else they will smack you and fly away. Or, play it risky, get the shotgun, and wait up until they are about 90% in your face before you take your shot.  The game, to me, is not worth $1. This game feels like a F2P that would beneffit from a microtransactions scheme. Seriously, not for me.
5691	1	a	Orion feels to be one of those games that has a few differences to how you play, but all together the game is quite fun playing with other people.
5693	1	a	this game is like COD zombie but it is dinosaurs
5695	1	a	The halo man fights dinosaurs in space, then uses dino-bones to buy upgrades and level up.  It's pretty much dark souls meets megaman.  Megaman and halo are the same person, right?   10/10  I mean, one is blue, the other is green, alter ego. I'm a cat and I know things.
5697	1	a	By far the best coin I've spent in a game...  Go get it.   You won't find better shooter at this price. Fun, massive killing, coop or versus, lot of stuff to do.  7/10.
5699	1	a	Lax a little in the content area. But at $0.99 its worth every penny.
5701	1	a	This game is absolutely hilarious at times, yes it's buggy still, but playing it with friends makes it all good to be honest. Especially now that it's only 99 cents, get it, you won't regret it!  The in game sound pack is horrible though, vehicles sound really bad, and so do weapons. On the other hand, the lightning and weather looks amazing for a game like this. So Dev's fix your sound!  10/10 would cape again.
5703	1	a	Dinosaurs+Weapons+Vehicles+PVP+Much more=Great game :3
5705	1	a	best 1 dollar purchase ever
5707	1	a	:) Yes, for a dollar, yes. :)  few servers but that could change in the begining few years back it was not all that but now i reinstalled and man i had fun, remainds me of small planetside2 with DINOS, with killing floor layout kinda. its a bit clunky on a few areas but if u like the above games im sure you'll find this to be fun for a while.   
5709	1	a	This Game is incredibly fun Flying around and shooting dinosaurs Just Fun   pros:   Good gameplay  Graphics are pretty great for a game thats a dollar  level design great  Taunts  Customisable heads   cons:        I give this game a 9.5 out of 10
5711	1	a	Never in my life before I had the chance to kill a dinosaur with a lightsaber. Thanks Obama
5713	1	a	Overall, I would recommend to anyone who is a fan of FPS; it is a dollar you will not regret spending.  +DINOSAURS +Great for co-ops with friends +Variety of customization options for players +Plenty of gun types +Vehicles are fun to use +Several game modes, including one where you can play as dinosaurs  -No singleplayer campaign/story -Limited number of types of dinosaurs (see a lot of the same)
5715	1	a	I hit a pterodactyl with a stick and it died. 10/10
5717	1	a	I got the game for like 1 buck. Really worth it when it was on sale, gave my friends and I a couple hours of fun. Though I don't think it's worth the 15. It's really the same thing over and over. Other than that it was fun for a bit.
5719	1	a	It's so sad to see people from reddit just buy this game to give it a negative review when it is a pretty good game, had some pretty decent times in here with friends, and more to come!
5721	1	a	Tiss a fun game famo
5723	1	a	ORION: Prelude is a very great game for a very cheap price, simple as that.
5725	1	a	spent 99c to buy this game.    it goes free 1 month later, rip asian cheap life
5727	1	a	Why do I love this game so much!? Idk, but it's a lot of fun, that's for sure! &lt;3
5729	1	a	good game to play if you have good teammates
1374	0	a	This is absolutely terrible, the PVP is awful the Horde mode is okay but the animations and sounds are beyond awful, But I guess thats what you can expect from an indie developer pfft.
1375	0	a	Literally the worst thing I've ever played.
1376	0	a	What can I say? This is it. This is the game we have been wating for. This game accomplishes so much and gives us gamers a truly next-gen experience. With all the content bundled in this game, for just a dollar you would be crazy to miss out on such a wonderful deal. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to playing.
5731	1	a	I really like this game...its retro and fun and i can play with or without friends...good game just to have a change of scenery
5733	1	a	surprisingly good fun this game. if you have a bunch of friend to play with then you can have hours of fun with it. wouldnt recommend just for singleplayer
1377	0	a	this game was NOT a good game. even if you have a awesome graphic card it still lags. played it for an hour and I was done with it. i dont recomend this game please DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!
5735	1	a	Did a future-helicopter barrel roll backflip into rocket propelled T-rex murder. 
5737	1	a	I gave a weird review, so now here is a more specific review on why you should buy this game. Now when I saw the game, I wasn't expecting a lot from it. That was because of the price. But I was truly wrong.  So first pro; Price. The game is very cheap. Next pro is the combat. You can fight (obviously, DUH) dinosaurs or players in the game with futuristic weapons, like various guns, melee weapons, turrets, and grenades. You can roll to avoid attacks. The combat is fast kind of like today's DOOM 4. Next pro is gonna be the shop. Get some credits and get spending on skins for your armor, weapons, swords (for their color or beam), and dinosaurs. Get new taunts and fancy capes, too. Now a cool feature that I like is the vehicles. You get a wide variety of vehicles from your standard car but with a machinegun, helicopters, tanks, even a robotic thing straight out of CoD AW. So that'll be it. Sad part is just the fact that there are still some annoying bugs since 2012, but I can ignore them. Normally THOSE bugs are, glitching inside big dinos, which is annoying.
5739	1	a	Pro's- Its cheap Lots of game modes Character progression PVP PVE Decent amout of maps interesting AI Plenty to shoot Easy to play Interesting game mechanics asortment of Vehicles Addictive Violence :) -Developers participate in the forums Lots of room hosting setup options Nice UI Achievments Leader boards  Cons- -Bad graphics optimization for duel cards (not the text script glitch just optimization) Big lag problems with Depth of Field and all particle systems they can be disabled but I like my tracers and enemt tracers ect.. -People are not notified to open ports for room hosting lots of bad ping and resrticted nat rooms -Dedicated server setup is terrible- lack of usefull detailed instruction and infact still havent got it working -Hosts have no server control options in game- can't kick idle when idle is disabled -Ai textures are not solid to the camera so when a dino head is in your fasce you can see he is hollow - Some Ai path finding issues can slow the game down like hunting for a mob/ group of mobs on maps to advance game can cost 5-15 mins of search time pointlessly to find a guy caught on a rock or a teridactle thats not allowed to leave a certain area.  Game and Gameplay 7/10 overall (graphical lag -1, Host control and port info -1 Dedicated server problems -1)  Dedicated server 5/10 overall (Lack of true instruction-2 Currently woring correctly -2 Lack of useful Information-1)  Host Server 8/10 Overall ( port promt needed -1, User control in game -1)  Game details: All of the perks from Unreal Tournament, Turok and Halo3- Toss em in a blender click puree and pour yourself a cup of Orion: Prelude (AKA Dino Horde).       
1379	0	a	this game was NOT a good game. even if you have a awesome graphic card it still lags. played it for an hour and I was done with it. i dont recomend this game please DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!
5741	1	a	虽然自己是FPS苦手，过这游对我说是那么困难，挺好的游，大家一起玩~ Even thought I'm a fool of FPS games, this game is easy to play. Welcome to play together, such a good game.
5743	1	a	It's a very enjoyable dinosaur survival game, but it does have microtransactions and that is not what i was expecting from a game 9/10
1380	0	a	yuck, tis game is a ruined game the trailers look nothing compared to the game and it's looks quite blocky just yuck. when i saw this game i thought hmm this game could be cool i looked at the reviews and there was alot of critisim but i though nah ill give it a try, once it was downlaoded i started playying then i said NO NO not again a ♥♥♥♥ game. The game looks nothing to the gameplay trailers i said well a waste of space. I dont recommend it
5745	1	a	ridiculous fun and only a dollar how have you NOT bought this
5747	1	a	'Let's see... Two quarters... Four dimes... A nickel... One, two, three... Four pennies! Guess I got somethin' to do for an hour after all.'
1381	0	a	its just cod zombies with dinosaurs -_-
5749	1	a	its reely fum soo pla its
1382	0	a	ok for its $0.99 deal but not very fun, quite repeatable
5751	1	a	Don't listen to the star ratings. This game is one of my favorite games on steam. This game is awsome!!!!!!
5753	1	a	Its a really fun and awesome game, great fun with hordes and hordes of dinosaurs, do get it its great. check out thegamingbeaver on it
1383	0	a	So my freinds, i have played 20 hours of this, more than i have played bioshock infinite, and here is my reveiw. Its not even open workd you're consrtantly defending a power genarator against din osaurs, but if you have a freind and two space helicopters it's extremely easy, or just get two rocket launchers, you get the choice of a knife or a gun that can provide you with infinite ammo and repair cars. Dinosaurs A.I is just suicidal, the multi-player is just 20 t-rex's standing outside the humans spawn, The audio is garbage, oh and the thing that makes every game worse, MICRO TRANSACTIONS! is there potential? If they re-did the audio worked on the dinosaurs and made it actully open world, meh. I dont know how this isnt listed aas early acess, it looks and feels like one. Unless it goes on sale for a dollar again, NEVER BUY IT! i've been told killing floor is better, which at some point ill get and look at, this reveiw of hitting a terrible game with a stick starts my writing reveiws
1384	0	a	This game is so freaking bad. I'd be hardpressed recommending this game for $1, don't be fooled by the interesting looking screen shots. This game is extremely 1 dimentional and quite unrewarding.
5755	1	a	The best thing since buttered bread.
5757	1	a	HOW DO I GIFT THIS GAME TO MY FRIENDS WHEN THEY GOT IT ON FREE WEEK AND THEN THEY UNINSTALLED IT BUT IT STILL SAYS THEY OWN IT
5759	1	a	Its a really fun and awesome game, great fun with hordes and hordes of dinosaurs, do get it its great. check out thegamingbeaver on it
5761	1	a	I would recommend this game 1000000000000000000000000000000000000/10 (and I even have some ideas that could make it a lot more fun)
5763	1	a	I can see my legs 10/10
5765	1	a	good game to play if you have good teammates
1385	0	a	This is absolutely terrible, the PVP is awful the Horde mode is okay but the animations and sounds are beyond awful, But I guess thats what you can expect from an indie developer pfft.

5767	1	a	I liked this game better when it first came out and I still think they shouldve stuck with what it was but its still fun to this day and now you can switch back to the old way of playing the game!
5769	1	a	lol, this was fun. much better than what they are doing with the orion project.
1388	0	a	This game was a waste of $0.99 It's that bad.
5771	1	a	still better than cod ghosts
1389	0	a	Not only is the controller so horribly optimised that you can't use your controler in any menu, but the game literally crashes every 5-8 minutes... and I have a $2,200 PC.  .2/1 Morgan Freeman's :(
1390	0	a	A good game for being only 0.99 cent , it has some issues like poorly optimized and also high ping , fps is not good sufficient , it freeze sometimes and my opinion for this game is 'I just wasted my 0.99 cent'
5773	1	a	Definitely worth a try!
1392	0	a	yuck, tis game is a ruined game the trailers look nothing compared to the game and it's looks quite blocky just yuck. when i saw this game i thought hmm this game could be cool i looked at the reviews and there was alot of critisim but i though nah ill give it a try, once it was downlaoded i started playying then i said NO NO not again a ♥♥♥♥ game.

1393	0	a	ok for its $0.99 deal but not very fun, quite repeatable
1394	0	a	I couldn't even get into a game with my friend.
1395	0	a	No tutorial, play/pay to win mechanic, choppy effects when using jetpack, odd UI, spectator mode can't move through walls and is slow as molasses, and buggy weapon issue (with primary not reloading).
5775	1	a	well... this game is just STUPIDLY AMAZING!!!
5777	1	a	ORION: Prelude is an awesome game that you can play with your friends that is both cheap and fun, it has many weapons, perks, and vehicles, as well as many dinosaurs that you can shoot and beat up, the graphics may be meh, but if you base a game of off just that, then you wouldn't know a good game when you saw it, becuase most games that have amazing graphics tend to have an awful story and/or gameplay, and you have to pay like $60, ORION: Prlude is a cheap $1 dollar game, there is a $59 difference, so even if you didn't enjoy, it's not like you lost money or something, so go ahead and stop reading this review and buy the damn game already, what are ya waiting for, go do it!
5779	1	a	This game is so bad you can't stop playing it.
1398	0	a	I don't get it. This game went through so many name changes, trying to shed away the bad opinions of the game because the developers are supposedly working so hard on it. I bought Dino Horde because it was cheap, played a little, and clearly saw the flaws right away : Missing animations, general slowness for no reasons, dumb menus, dumb map design. Apparently though, so many reviews of people begging players to give the game another chance because it was much better now than it used to be. So I downloaded it again...   First game : I load a map, I shoot, the gun is immobile. The hands/arms animate, but not the gun... Fine, it must be because the game isn't started, right? I need to find a generator, maybe it will animate after? I find a generator, walking very slowly because everything is sluggish, the game start, the gun still doesn't animate, but now it doesn't animate while a dinosaur is seemingly stuck in a circle in front of me.  Maybe the map didn't load right? I exit the game, start a new one, choose a new map... It's the *same map* as before, but with pumpkins, cell shading and a laughter track added. I play around a little, I die, next map loads. They ask me to choose my class, I don't, I press escape, I am brought to a Spectate other players screen. Weird, it was a solo game. I press escape, I am brought to the main menu, but the map is clearly still loaded in the background.  So in 5 minutes I am faced with the same issues as with Dino Horde : Missing animations, general slowness for no reasons, dumb menus, dumb map design.   Why are reviews saying that this game changed for the better? It did not. Adding cel shading to a map doesn't make a game better. The player's animation and movements are all ♥♥♥♥ed up. When we jump and touch ground, we get a foot smaller and then pop back to full height. Guns don't animate. Gun's impact particles are oriented with the walls, not with where bullets come from  I have a download cap when I live, no ISP offer unlimited bundles, and yet I re-downloaded it based on all the 'This Game Got Better' posts. I feel like I was robbed of my bytes here. This game is *not* better than it was. I'm deleting this game and I will *not* fall in the Orion trap a 3rd time.
1399	0	a	rubbish even for a free game!!
1400	0	a	I imagine that HIV would offer me a more enjoyable experience.  Weapon handling is utterly boring. Sound design is atrocious. Animations are stiff. Horrible usage of post processing to cover up low-res textures.  It's a game you buy and there's also a cash shop. It was crappy with Guns of Icarus Online did it, too. But, GoI Online was fun. This isn't.  Pass on it.
1401	0	a	Steam should be ashamed to have this in the marketplace.  Worst game that has ever been made.
1402	0	a	OK, I did not mind the game, heck I am astonished by how it had improved since I last saw it when it was Orion Dino Horde *Watch that video by Total Biscuit by the way, I'm not being paid for it but he's just fantastic.* However it has problems which turned me away from it, or at least 2 problems.  Littlest one: The game is not very well optimized, I play this on a laptop but given I can run some high speed stuff with no problem, this is a problem....Though it is one that CAN be fixed so I will not hold it against the deveolopers.  However our biggest problem: The Community, sure the games can be fast but honestly, no one helps you either because the game doesn't do a good enough job of telling you 'Oh your teammate is down', and even if they did, there's a number that would let you die just out of SPITE, often killing any dinos you shot so that you would NOT get up.  Overall its an OK game but the community...just the community is all.
5781	1	a	Very addictive.
1403	0	a	Traditional score - 4/10 Recommendation - Avoid. There are much better alternatives.  I found this to be intensely generic.   The gun physics are a joke, the weapons themselves are entirely too expensive for how much use they are, the enemies have intensely stupid AI, and the player skills are almost entirely useless.  The graphics are pretty, but the sounds and music are utterly forgettable, the level design is generic and repetitive, and the waypoints the game sets for you are way too far away. Especially given how the game allows you 60 seconds between waves (even if pterodactyls attack you continuously).  It quite possibly may get much better later, but you know so does Killing Floor, and it's fun from the get-go.  But hey, give it a try, you might love it. I have 2 free passes if this review didn't scare you off.
5783	1	a	  Nutshell Review:  
5785	1	a	This game is absolutely hilarious at times, yes it's buggy still, but playing it with friends makes it all good to be honest. Especially now that it's only 99 cents, get it, you won't regret it!  The in game sound pack is horrible though, vehicles sound really bad, and so do weapons. On the other hand, the lightning and weather looks amazing for a game like this. So Dev's fix your sound!  10/10 would cape again.
5787	1	a	Dinosaurs+Weapons+Vehicles+PVP+Much more=Great game :3
5789	1	a	for a one dollar game, this is really fun and has pretty good graphics it may not be perfect but its really cheap and i would pick it up if you like kiling dinosars or like jarasik pakr 
1404	0	a	Couldn't play it. Shooting didn't feel sharp or even responsive. Also I paid a buck just to watch it go free, but whatever. Also, the devs are children.    No but seriously, they only use reviews written anonymously by some kids online in all their game trailers. Has anyone else noticed that?
5791	1	a	First off, to everyone compaining about the game going Free to play and not getting anything, you did get something, the 20K spiral credits for in game cosmitics, about a 16$ value, those just starting without having bught before going F2P won't have that, and apparently you also got something in the seqeal too, if you buy it, but i don't know about that, as i haven't done so.  Now onto the actuall review...I'd be hard pressed to recommend this game if it wasn't free, and there has been questionable history around the game, but, overall, for a game that is as old as it is, it is a deceint co-op to sink a few hours into every now and then with a friend, or level grinding.  Plus, free, so you don't have much to lose.
5793	1	a	I've played it in demo period and i really enjoyed it playing with my friend,its cheap too so why not try to play this game? 
5795	1	a	Nice game
1405	0	a	I wuz lok oooh dinisore big and it lok kilt meh and i wuz raelly maad
5797	1	a	Would vote for biggest improvent of a game I've seen.
5799	1	a	very nice shooter, fun to play, graphics are ok, cool dinosaurs so what else ?
1410	0	a	Some terrible game. Have no idea why it has such good ratings.
1411	0	a	I forgot I even owned this game.
1412	0	a	the only thing I liked about this game was the price.
5801	1	a	you know what ??  This is actually a good game, it's just lack of development. and, maybe can you add the low resolution ? like the 800 x 600 and so seriously.
1413	0	a	Just... wow.  I regret the decision to even download and play this title.  I came into the fray with optimistic thoughts screaming loudly 'THIS IS GONNA BE GOOD'.  'Cause 'Turok mixed with Halo'? I love both titles? Damn right I'm going to play this, I have to. I didn't even know the history to Orion: Dino Horde, or what Dino Beatdown even WAS. They weren't even on my f**king radar, at ALL! Now I completely see why.  But god damn what a f**king lie that was because the entire game is executed so badly, the high expectations that it set itself begin to smolder into a pile of broken Alpha-testing nonsense, yet this is DEVELOPED and RELEASED at that. Going to mesh two good games together is aiming to pull alot of fans of both types of genres and when you invoke such f**king power words like that, you need aim well and aim high to appease both audiences because the bar has been as such by those previous titles. But oh man, you guys pulled a number on me good, man.  (You might as well sub out the 'Halo' bulls**t and replace that with 'Tribes', because that is the only thing that screams to me besides halo. A bad Tribes clone with dinosaurs.  Every gun in the game has around a 100ms delay for firing and for hitting a target, so you have to probably calculate the Coriolis effect before you hit anything thats more than 50 f**king meters away from you and it's worse if it's in the sky.   Everything feels like its clunky and runs like its just an amalgamation of crap, and the fact that when youre playing and you die from...oh lets see.. a f**king pterodactyl immediately lifting you off with no regard or warning, or a couple of small dinosaurs that you cant even see because the grass texture is so tall and its dispersion is not very good whilst the dinosaurs in question are hidden in plain sight until you're on your back pockets bleeding out attempting to shoot at them to revive.  Theres another thing, the dinosaurs. The pinnacle of this game is the dinosaurs, right? Wrong. That couldnt be more far off from the truth. Because you might as well be fighting newborn babies in the form of giant lizards that are radioactive to the touch. You wont know that youre getting hit because the animations for your foes are so terrible that when they do them its literally NOT what theyre actually doing. ------ Example: Dinosaur walks up and is right in front of your face and you just hurt terribly for some reason, no animation, no nothing its just a roomba moving at you with dinosaur legs attached. You move away and eventually it begins to do an animation for a bite in your face that does nothing, until you stop then you begin hurting because the vacuum is back on again.  Example 2: Be me and my friend, on a boulder next to a cliff with a tree on it, stegosaurus walks towards us and looks at us and and a floor stomping animation sends us up into the air out of nowhere but the dinosaur did nothing but look at us. It could have farted and I'd believe it at this point. Then it raises its front legs to stomp us because im right infront of its face it would definitely hit me again. It lands and nothing even happens, we didn't even move. What?   Man I'm already tired of thinking about everything in this game that I encountered that im not going to continue much on this anymore. In the THIRTY SIX MINUTES that I played I encountered so many things that would put me off of it I wouldnt even consider replaying this until they redo it entirely. (OH WAIT YOU DID THAT?) Well too ♥♥♥♥ing bad, make it again. Or dont. Either way until you do better this game WILL NEVER CEASE TO EXIST. IT WILL NEVER GO AWAY. IT CANNOT BE UN-DONE. ARE YOU PROUD? IS THIS A CONSPIRACY TO TARNISH SPIRAL GAME STUDIOS?  This game tells me nope.
1414	0	a	I only have this game because I bought a four pack so I could taint my friends' libraries.
5803	1	a	Incredible game, only because it found a way to make Instagib completely uninteresting
5805	1	a	Great game if you love Jurassic park and first person shooters!
1416	0	a	Complete waste of money. You can never connect to any servers. So you wont be able to play the stupid game. Boring gunplay
1417	0	a	poorly optimized and also high ping
5807	1	a	4 pack it ASAP!  Dinos..... Sci-fi weapons..... co op...... laughs..... onsale for a dollar at times..... It is a no brainer. If you are scared to lose a dollar on a game then your loss....
5809	1	a	you know what ??  This is actually a good game, it's just lack of development. and, maybe can you add the low resolution ? like the 800 x 600 and so seriously.

1419	0	a	this game is a peace of $h!)  sorry but it is and i want my money back
1420	0	a	Not good, shady practices, but ♥♥♥♥, it was only 49 cents!
5811	1	a	If you hate this game, your mother didn't love you.  T-rex killed me over 50 times, and a stagosaurus splooged on me. 11/10
1421	0	a	WTF, THIS SUCKS, NOW IS F2P, WASTED. I QUIT THIS GAME CUZ IT'S ♥♥♥♥♥ LAGGY. HAVE TO WAIT FOR WHOLE GAME TO SPAWN BACK. SUCK LIKE ♥♥♥♥
5813	1	a	This game only for 1€ totally worth it  10/10 would buy again!
5815	1	a	Its fun but for me lagish
5817	1	a	This game is amazing. I LOVE it when my games have ps2 graphics yet still lag. The lasers the dinosaurs shoot out of their mouths is beautiful, and the texturing is so good it makes me want to vomit and cry in the bathtub for about 3 hours.   If you like being depressed, I highly reccommend this game.
5819	1	a	Well just like a ton of players I also bought this game for around 1 dollar and now its free, well ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥...In spite all that game isnt that bad, you like dinos, you like FPS games, you're gonna like the game...
1430	0	a	This game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥.
1431	0	a	They made it free to play, but I don't think they can save it in the long run, it's just not worth it...  A lot was promised, little given, but that's my own fault for buying early access, so I shouldn't complain too much. I only post this review so that others are aware of the way the devs/publishers of this game operate, for when they release their next game.
1432	0	a	The Co-op in this game is quite fun to play with some friends, but i wouldn't recommend buying this game as it is increbile buggy if your are going to play solo. Also the developers appear to be rather nasty people. D:&lt;
1433	0	a	Steam should be ashamed to have this in the marketplace.  Worst game that has ever been made.
1434	0	a	After getting into the game I said 'It looks like the entire graphics design budget was 2 cans of Mountain Dew'. After playing for a while and seeing all the bugs and glitches I said 'Nevermind, the budget for the entire game was one can. I was in the process of figuring out how to refund when I noticed the option to write a review. I'll continue after this. If you want to waste the (fortunately very low) price of the game, go for it. But don't expect a well made game, or even a decently made one.
1435	0	a	poorly optimized and also high ping
5821	1	a	ORION: Prelude is an awesome game that you can play with your friends that is both cheap and fun, it has many weapons, perks, and vehicles, as well as many dinosaurs that you can shoot and beat up, the graphics may be meh, but if you base a game of off just that, then you wouldn't know a good game when you saw it, becuase most games that have amazing graphics tend to have an awful story and/or gameplay, and you have to pay like $60, ORION: Prlude is a cheap $1 dollar game, there is a $59 difference, so even if you didn't enjoy, it's not like you lost money or something, so go ahead and stop reading this review and buy the damn game already, what are ya waiting for, go do it!
5823	1	a	The only game servers I can find are ones where I have a ping of 150+  Otherwise its a good game
5825	1	a	A good game for being only 79p.
5827	1	a	I got this game on sale for 50cents. Definitly not the best game ever, there are some issuses with it. But the game is fun easy to play and great for you and your friends. its cheap too. I boughtit for some of my friends.
1440	0	a	A game that cost 0.99 cents, is worth 0.99 cents. Dont expect much much from it.
5829	1	a	Nice game
1441	0	a	ENG:  It's change into F2P -model what was absolute 'NO' -for me so, i don't recomented that a game any more.    FIN:  Muuttivat pelin F2P -malliseksi mikä on ehdottomasti 'EI' -minulle joten, en voi suosittella tätä peliä enään.
5831	1	a	(UPDATE) i cannot belive how much i downplayed this game. since they devs began to update this game it has become one of the most unique and fun fps games out there. THE METACRITIC SCORE IS A LIE. THAT WAS A REVIEW FOR DINO BEATDOWN WHICH WAS THE BIGGEST CLUSTER ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ STORM OF A GAME. BUT NOW IT HAS BEEN UPDATED AND REVAMPED AND YOUR MAKING A MISTAKE NOT TO PLAY IT.  This game is actually not that bad. the graphics are pretty decent and everything else is pretty good. too. the reason why metacridict is so low is because it is the review for dino beatdown, which is a game that was a sin towards humanity. but after all the patching and updating this game is pretty good. reminds me when i played turok on the n64......
1442	0	a	Its not bad, but definitely not good  graphics are really not impressive, but considering i got this game for less then a dollar you get what you pay for.  gameplay is pretty poorely done in my opinion with so many other clones out there that have done it so much better even for free.   Connections for gameplay are just bad in the best case senarios and when you have to rely on fast twitch movement and need smooth gameplay to make good shots. Without that a FPS is nearly worhtless.  3/10
1443	0	a	this game is so bad, it's so laggy and you can shoot dinosaurs through the wall like the good old early 2000s counter strike. Such a bad game. Not even worth my 1 dollar. Dont buy it.
1444	0	a	This game is pretty much Halo with enless waves of dinosaurs but with terrible graphics and terrible physics. Even if it is on sale I would not buy it. And if you do get it, make sure you look up a tutorial first, it does not tell you how to play the game. The maps are HUGE, which is good and bad. Good because you can roam around and get away from the dinos easily. Bad because it sometimes spawns you on the OPPOSITE of the map you are supposed to be and with no vehicle. Overall do not buy this, it is a waste of money, I have no idea how this has so many good reviews.
5833	1	a	If you hate this game, your mother didn't love you.  T-rex killed me over 50 times, and a stagosaurus splooged on me. 11/10
5835	1	a	Fun game really like it. Really can't stop playin'!!! :D
5837	1	a	Good weapons, good graphics, good textures.
5839	1	a	couldn't figure out how to attack 10/10
1450	0	a	This game is like a cheap ♥♥♥♥♥, fun for 20 minutes but it gives you a disease after you play with it. Would not recommend.
1451	0	a	When I played this game back during one of its myriad of free weekends, it was a half-baked piece of garbage that wasn't all that well put together.  When I played this game during this current free week, it definitely showed some improvements and the horde mode is OK but it's still not all that well put together. It also has one of the worst Instagib modes I've ever seen, the kind of Instagib where it is just easier to run up to the guy you're trying to shoot and kill him with the butt of your rifle.  Frankly, this game was more entertaining when it was a complete ♥♥♥♥ing mess.
1452	0	a	I tried to like this game, I really did. While my friends were calling it garbage, I defended it. The truth is, however, that they were right. I never played Dino Beatdown, and I didn't bother with the Metacritic score; going off of some brief gameplay videos I figured that while the animations looked clunky it could at least be one of those games that is fun to play with friends. Those videos don't quite prepare you for Dino Horde, and I can safely say that even at the price of $1.00, I would not recommend buying this game.  The animations are bad, and in fact very laughable. Running looks like you've got a stick up your ♥♥♥ and when you're in first person in a car you can often watch in horror as your weapons wiggle around. However, these animations are typically situational - no, most of what you'll see of the animaiton quality is in the dinosaurs themselves who often come off as cartoonish, rigid or downright broken in their movements.  The gunplay is very unsatisfying. Everything kind of just haphazardly squirts blood when you shoot them. You'd expect such a loud game to at least have some great, satisfying sounds to accompany each shot, but they don't. Every enemy is a bullet sponge and each weapon is unpleasant to use.   However, the most frustrating failings of Dino Horde is in the fact that when buying upgrades in Survival, dying will cause you to lose them. Additionally, despite boasting a large number of game modes, many are just not fun. The worst was where you're forced to play Support and just stand around as raptors spawn out of the air on top of you, trying to last as long as possible.   The only positive points I can truthfully give this game was that the vehicles were at first very fun and interesting. If you're forced or tempted to play this game, jump into a vehicle as soon as possible. The only difficulty you'll really find with vehicles is how their tires are somehow incapable of running over small dinosaurs. However, even they were not enough to save Dino Horde for me. I will not be reinstalling this. If you want a dinosaur game get Natural Selection 2 or Primal Carnage, a lot of ORION's assets were ripped off from those games, anyways.
1453	0	a	ORION: Black Ops 3 is a highly original game.
1454	0	a	Even after the update and name change, it's still the same bad game as it's always been. Buy DIno D-Day and/or Primal Carnage instead. Both are much better dinosaur games. 
1455	0	a	I've only put a half hour into this game but..  What the hell is this game?  No, seriously, look at actual reviews on it. It feels like a game made in Unity engine using 3D assets you'd buy in a pack to use (but the reality is they just fired the workers that created them after they handed them over). The idea that this game could ever get a 10/10 (as shown under reviews) is ridiculous. This entire $1 sale is just a con to squeeze the last bit of money they can out of this turd of a game.  Do your research before buying it, you'll see a trail of unpaid workers, crowdfunding scams and general distrust over this developer with only a little bit of googling. No reputable person or gaming website would ever give this game a rating over 10.  Bugs, bugs everywhere, assets that clearly weren't made for this game.. the list goes on.  Stay far, far away from this.
1456	0	a	What the actual ♥♥♥♥ is this mess? Honestly, this is the worst game I've ever played on steam.
5841	1	a	I buy it once.... ask for refund and steam refund my money.  but now i buy it again and enjoy the game.....  thanks for not abandoning this game and made it works.... love it.
1458	0	a	Paid for this game get nothing extra when it goes free2play. ♥♥♥♥ off
5843	1	a	 So what is ORION: Prelude?
1462	0	a	They changed the name of this thing three times, now.  and, now, it costs only 79 cents. They probably don't know any other way to grab cash and go.
1463	0	a	Don't even bother. Even if it remained F2P forever, it's terrible. SWTOR tier.
5845	1	a	Was a good Game to troll your friends with by just gifting it to them.... Aaah the good ol' times...  11/10 would spend 15€ again!
1476	0	a	Let me just start off by saying this game looked cool at first, but then i actually played it and boy was i wrong. First off all the weapon variation is absolutely abysmal, its either assault rifle that shoots chocolate covered marshmallows or a flamethrower that will give the dinos a slight tan equivalent to a nice day on the beach. The dinos look and behave like pidgeons that have been fed bread crumbs laced with weed. This game is absolute trash and writing this review was a huge waste of time as was downloading and playing this game. Having this game in my library disgusts me. Please remove this game from steam so that nobody has to go through playing this pathetic excuse for a game. If i were to sum up this game in one word, that word would be Pathetic.
1477	0	a	First off, The devs of this game, Absolutley ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Everytime this game gets too many Negative reviews on steam or Metacritic they 'Update' The game (Breaking it even more) and give it a new name. The HUD? Absolute ♥♥♥♥. They were too lazy to change the Menu icons to keys instead of xbox buttons. Even when you have this game at the highest settings it still looks like it was made in 2006. The lack of difficulty is baffling also. After killing a few of the easiest dinos you can go and grab yourself An lmg, SMG and upgrades to your ability that is determined by one of the 3 classes.  TL;DR: Its a terrible port from the 360. Barely even worth $1. I Got it for $0.27 and i would gladley take it back.  Update: Many people cannot gandle the truth
1478	0	a	Baaaaad game.. Stay away. Horrid sound effects where they exist at all. Feels and moves cheap. The animation is amateur. The lighting is horrible. Menus are clunky. When you die the game just instantly goes to a loading screen.. no idea even what just happened. I could go on but it's worth more effort than the game is worth.
1479	0	a	Where do I start with this game? I don't even know HOW to describe it. Its like dinosaurs, future tech, and master chief all jumped into a blender and was then consumed by the game developer. Time passed, and so did the product through the developer's intestines, leaving us with this 'game'.

1486	0	a	Look how many hours I have spent on this game. Look. Just look. Probably 110 of those were on Orion: Dino Horde.  Since the upgrade to Orion: Prelude the game is just an utter mess. Sure, it looks 'better' but al the 'fun' has been sapped from it. I've tried to play this game several times since the 'upgrade' and don't think I've finished a single game on it.  They added *more* stupid flying dinosaurs and made them harder to shoot. They made the 'Compy' dinos harder to kill. They made it so that when a big dino 'stomps' the ground you go flying further in a car than if you're on foot. They made it so you can be flying with your jet pack and still be affected by a stomp on the ground. Honestly.  Add to that the fact that when they said they had ironed out loads of bugs and made it better when in reality what they really meant was they made the best gun on the game less powerful than a hand gun that you start with and introduced bugs that weren't even in the previous version then you start to get a great view of the actual 'upgrade'.  Is this game worth 79 British Earth Pence? Sure. I would have paid more than that for Dino Horde. Probably more like a few quid. But it's now just sat there, dejectedly, in my Steam library. So sad.
1487	0	a	This game is so ♥♥♥♥ing bad, I wouldn't give it to my one year old neice to play. Everything about this game is absolutely terrible and is broken to ♥♥♥♥. How the hell did they charge $20 for this game when it came out, This isn't even worth it being free; it's just a peice of garbage on my computer. But as for the game play driving a car sucks ♥♥♥♥ and is laggy as ♥♥♥♥, every gun is absolutely useless and doesn't work, many of the animations are broken; and they're making another one! That's a ♥♥♥♥ing joke. Please nobody buy this game, don't even consider looking at it at all; it's not even worth the space on your hard drive. I played almost an hour of this and I regret every second of looking at it.
5849	1	a	Have you ever felt like you wanted to play CS but also dinosaurs? Have you ever wanted to be overwhelmed by the sheer amount of holy ♥♥♥♥? Have you ever craved that sweet sense of pleasure you get from committing genocide on an extinct species? Then this game is for you!  There's almost 65 billion things to do! -ride cars -shoot dinosaurs -fall off of towers -ride cars -get upgrades -ride cars -ride cars  With so much stuff, this game feels like an unlimited amount of awesome! Just think of something, anything, and statistically you probably can't do it in this game. But out of the things you can do in this game, you can do all of them in this game! (Including leading those terrifying flying dudes into your friend's heli!)       420/10 3dank5me -ride cars

1502	0	a	This game is a scam. Valve is backing up scumbag developers and allowing false advertisement on this Steam page and not allowing refunds. These developers fired their dev team and took money for themselves using a KickStarter campaign. They have stolen props from major video game companies and small dev teams. They released this game in a pre-beta state. They are using false advertising tactics to get people to purchase this game.   I've supported Steam since 2006, and this is the first time I've been disappointed with Valve for allowing devs like these onto their store, and then fiercely defending them on the Steam forums and on Steam Support. I cannot be issued a refund of the four-pack I purchased because of the Steam Subscriber Agreement. However, they falsely advertised this game as a complete build, and they are using the agreement as a way to prevent having to take a publishing loss.
5851	1	a	definitly a awesome game  like killing floor with dinosaurs
1503	0	a	I can tell you before it got its makeover it was pretty ♥♥♥♥, I played the makeover for a few minutes and that was pretty ♥♥♥♥ as well but it looks like they updated so i might reinstall it
1504	0	a	I remember when i bought this game for $16.00 what a rip.
5853	1	a	very good and cheap game, but i dont understood some parts :D
5855	1	a	I want to be the very best, Like no one ever was. To kill them is my real test, To end them is my cause.  I will travel across the land, Searching far and wide. Each Dino Horde to understand The power that's inside  Dino HORDE!!!, (gotta kill them all) its you and me I know its my destiny Dino Horde, oh, you're my best friend In a world we must defend  Dino Horde, (gotta kill them all) a heart so true Our courage will pull us through You teach me and I'll teach you Di-No-Horde, gotta kill 'em all 
5857	1	a	The game has seen radical changes since it's original release and has finally become a rather solid and enjoyable game. There is still room for improvement (some people complain about the Bots). Personally I enjoy it. I like the leveling system, buying perks ingame, buying weapons in game to suit your playstyle and the pure JOY of running down dinosaurs with a jeep.  Upsides: Fast paced action, lots of maps, lots of weapons, lots of perks, easy to get started, epic Tyranosaur fights. Downsides: the Bots in single player are...dull, could benefit from more 'visceral' dinosaur related fatalities.  Overall an excellent value for less than the cost of a chocolate bar.
5859	1	a	you need to buy this.... you wont find a game with this much content, customization and polish for 10 euros....devs fullfilled everything they promised after a bad start, and vent even the extra mile.
5861	1	a	Way better than anything Activision ever put out, THERE I SAID IT!!!
1518	0	a	Terrible game.
1519	0	a	Did they make it horrible on purpose? After how many years and this is what you came up with? How does one make unreal engine look so horrible... if not on purpose.. There are a ton of built in smooth animations for free in the engine that apparently they didnt use. And those textures??? wth.. are we still in the days of quake? and physics are horrible.. you get stuck walking next to a wall.. If this was a school project.. id say Nice work! you're def going to make a great game after you graduate.. but .. its not , its a full release of a 'completed' game that from what I hear the devs take pride in.. I know I wouldnt.. at least make the textures and models look a little better that would be a good start. Oh and the sounds... ugh.. am I firing a cap gun? anywho..
1520	0	a	Even thought this game is free on Steam right now.Do not play it.It is competely unfinished and is unplayable.The game constanly lags(even in the menus) and isnt even gpu or cpu demanding.Please spare yourself and avoid it at all costs.

5863	1	a	Sorry fellow reviewers, but you're supposed to rate this game, and not whatever scandals can be happening with the studio behind it.  Simply put, for its price, Orion Prelude can be hours of fun with your friends, and can thus be considered a great game if your point in gaming is having fun.  There you go. Trek 9 might have done some shady/♥♥♥♥♥♥ things, in the past and even currently, but this game is still the same game it was a year ago, and I recommend it.  1) Stay away 2) Only recommended when on sale 3) Recommended  4) Highly recommended  5) This is a must play
1527	0	a	this could be fun if i could connect to a server...
1528	0	a	The trailer for the game made the game sound so good and so hyped but in the end result there was just no action.It turned into more of a hunt down dinosaures the size of a skittle.Even for a dollar felt like a rip off.
5865	1	a	Killing Floor, But much bigger wolds, pvp, and Dinosaurs. A lot of time and effort has been put into the game to make it really smooth. Good game, and super cheap. (At the time of writing this it was 99cents)

5871	1	a	Best played in Co-op...
1538	0	a	Honestly...this is my opinion, and mine alone...but this game isn't as fun as I was led to believe it was. Granted, my frame rate issues didn't help much at all...but either way, my interest in the game quickly faded after about...maybe half an hour into my first match. Sure, I love the fact that it's basically a zombie horde game but with dinosaurs, but...it was just far too repetitive to keep my interest for long. The dinosaurs were...in all honesty, they don't have great AI. Sure, they're good at surrounding you and tearing you to pieces; sure, they're good at charging you and running you through; sure, they're good at taking you out before you have time to react...but their attacks were far too predicatable and you could easily skirt them without receiveing any damage. The weapons were a bit...iffy, in my opinion. The pistols just sound like the automatic rifles, just in single bursts. Oh, and don't get me started on the fact that some of the sound effects for two or three particular weapons are taken straight out of Command and Conquer: Red Alert 2. I'll likely go on a tangent about that. But the rifles just felt...unbalanced to me. It was far too easy to get kills with them since they have next to no recoil from what I was able to see through my low frames. And the accuracy wasn't all that great, IMO. The last thing that really irked me was the fact that objectives were so damn far away from the bases. I mean, 500 meters is fine and dandy, but 1000 meters away from the main base? And you have to get there before dino's overrun the objective. What annoyed me was that you find out about the objective right at the start of a wave, so you have about 3-4 minutes of running to do in order to get to the objective while dino's are spawning already halfway to the objective and overruning it. You have no time to get to the objective before the raptors and ptera's are all over it. Granted, my frame rate issues were a large factor in me not enjoying my time playing the game. But I couldn't fix it for the life of me. But regardless, it was about fun for the first five minutes while I was fighting off raptors and compy's on my first wave. I mean, let's face it, anything with dinosaurs in it is going to be fun. I can overlook most of what I stated above simply because I can understand just how this game might be entertaining for the majority of players. But for me...there's no fun in repetition. For meticulous players like myself, I would not recommend this game However, if you're one to not be bothered by what I stated above, then this is a $0.99 game worth getting if you're simply looking for a fun time blowing the heads off of raptors. In that case, I would recommend this game to those players.
1539	0	a	theres like only 15 servers with no one in them. Honstly don't know how this game can still be this bad looking after 3 years of support. The trailer over hypes the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game. Not even worth $1.

This game is SO ♥♥♥♥ing buggy, the AI are dumb as real dinosaurs and you might as well be handling a payload of nukes at the rate which dinosaurs die to your hand...OH GOD!

5879	1	a	'Halo with Dinosaurs' My friend said to me. I find it to be pretty accurate.
1552	0	a	I really believe its a good game even as arcadish as it is now, but I just cant reccommend this to any of my friends. There are not decent servers with playable pings for me and my pals. Nowhere in my region are there any servers...I bought it simply because I found it cheap. Gameplay animations, etc could really use some polish...but for the low price I wont complaint much there.
5881	1	a	This is the dumbest ♥♥♥♥ing game I have ever played. Rather than researching and studying the dinosaurs you just kill them. This game would be much better if it included the PETA helpline so I could report it. 0/10 and I have crippling depression. Also as a side note, I noticed the guns look a lot like the ones from Call of Duty, not sure what that's about.
1557	0	a	sucks
5883	1	a	There are games that get pumped up with so much hype whipping people into a frenzy, parting with their hard earned cash, only to then leave the gamer wishing they had not wasted their money, and then there are games that truly deserve the hype and actually end up exceeding the gamers expectations. Bioshock without any shadow of a doubt is in the class that should DEMAND you play the game. This game has the ability to suck you in, leaves you marvelling at just how much there is to do and the fun you can have doing it and… well… quite frankly for the last four days certainly left me with severe lack of sleep as I just could not put the game down. In short this game rocks and must be played!  Bioshock the latest first person shooter from 2K Games and considered “spiritually to be the successor to their previous System Shock 2 title, is set in 1960 starting with our hero Jack surviving a plane crash in the ocean and making his way in a bathysphere (mini submarine) travels to the underwater City that is Rapture. On his journey in the bathysphere Jack is painted a picture by a man named Ryan that Rapture is a beautiful and wonderful place to live, only to leave Jack bearing witness to a completely different picture arriving at Rapture and to a City that looks to be in ruin and with Jack quickly being attacked by a rather grim looking creature that is a Splicer. Armed with a two-way radio Jack is befriended by Atlas and starts his journey through Rapture for what will become the fight of his life. Welcome to Rapture, this is Bioshock and make sure you have a good stock of clean pants, because you are in for one Hell of a ride.  Control wise Bioshock is played from the first person perspective and the buttons are mapped very neatly. Your right shoulder button cycles through all your collected weapons with the right trigger controller the fire on each weapon. Holding the RB button brings up all your weapons and makes it a lot easier to quickly change to any weapon when the heat is on. The left shoulder button cycles through all your available plasmids (more on that later) with the left trigger activating your chosen plasmid. Again holding the LB button brings up all of your active plasmid choices and lets you switch quickly when needed. That leaves the face buttons to be assigned to the likes of using a med kit, reloading a weapon or topping up on your plasmid eve, interacting with objects and jumping. Finally the thumbsticks are then left to control movement and panning the camera and clicking in the thumbsticks will activate crouching (left) and also zoom control (right) if a weapon allows it.  The first thing you will notice in Bioshock apart from the fact you are deep underwater is that your surroundings are rather dark and as a hint for the people that have yet to play the game, before you even start playing you are asked to agree the lighting levels and if you feel the need, then whack it up slightly to help you… That said I never touched any settings as the mood is perfect and fitting for a destroyed city and getting leapt on by a Splicer out of the darkness is all part of the fun really.  Now while I leap into the gameplay aspect I don’t want to give too much of the game away as the plot has more twists and turns than a roller coaster so I will leave the gameplay to what you have in front of you rather than what you are doing for who and who said what. But in saying that, and just to get the ball rolling… you have arrived in Rapture with Atlas talking you through where you need to go and with Ryan the creator of Rapture watching you on the CCTV system and seeming to think you are CIA or KGB decides to set his army of Splicers and bots on you… “Well nobody ever said life was easy – eh.  Surviving in Rapture will come down to a few things. Firstly there will be the choice of weapons from wrench through to pistol ending in a rather awesome flamethrower. The neat touch here is that these weapons seem to have been created after the city was in ruins with people fighting to survive so have a rather home feel DIY look to them bolted together with empty tins and what not rather than being all futuristic (well after all this is 1960). You will find weapons scattered throughout Rapture but your best bet is to look to prise them from the dead hands of a Splicer you just killed. You will also find two types of vending machines throughout every level of Rapture that will allow you to keep topping up on your supplies of ammo should you be running low – that said ammo can also be collected from fallen enemies and you should never struggle to be without. You will also later in the game have the ability to create your own ammo from bits and pieces you find scattered throughout Rapture with the U-Invent machines and you will also find weapon upgrade machines that can only be used once, but will change how your weapon operates improving it in certain categories.  Your second piece of survival comes down to plasmids, and plasmids genetically modify your bodies’ structure allowing you to attack people in a whole new way. These plasmids include being able to shock someone, stunning them so you can move in for the kill, freezing someone allowing you to explode them into shards of ice and through to setting people on fire to name a few. Plasmids can be found throughout Rapture but later in the game pretty much becomes purchased with ADAM (will cover that little bit later). Just like you have a Health bar, you also have an Eve bar, and it is Eve that is the substance needed to sustain your use of plasmids. Top ups to Eve can be found in syringe form throughout Rapture or again by purchase from a vending machine/finding the syringes on dead bodies. Without doubt plasmids make the game what it is and are damn fun to use, and you will end up on the look out for bigger and better plasmids so you can experiment over and over again with new and stronger attacks. Having a Splicer run at you only for you to freeze them, whip out your shogun to watch them explode into tiny shards of ice never stopped being funny, amazing to see in action and damn cool to do. Aside from plasmids you also find and can purchase tonics, which are designed to enhance you in a number of ways from both physical attributes to mental. These cover the likes of being able to disappear if you stand still, through to being able to move faster all the way through to being able to hack objects easier. Tonics are not to be confused with plasmids, which in effect are weapons… tonics are there to make your life a bit easier but are not physical weapons you can see in action – just think of them as enhanced abilities.  I referred to ADAM which essentially is the substance needed to enhance your abilities but gathering ADAM in itself presents you a constant two prong problem. Little girls in the game which are referred to as ‘Little Sisters’ carry ADAM in their body, but your first problem is finding them with your second problem is having to get past their personal body guards that are the ‘Big Daddies’. Big Daddies are genetically modified and walk around in huge diving suits and carry enough armour and weaponry to scare the living daylights out of anyone. To get the ADAM you have to defeat the Big Daddy and then should you manage to do that the game then switches you to a moral choice to make in order to obtain your prize. When you move up to a Little Sister that has just lost her body guard by your hand you are given two choices. Harvest the ADAM which will give you the max amount but basically means killing the child, or rescue the girl which gives you less ADAM but with another character in the game (no spoilers as to who) promising you future rewards for having done so. Your moral choices will also ultimately give you two distinctive endings to the game… I was the good guy and rescued them all, so I am yet to see my evil side ending, but having seen pieces wrote on it
1558	0	a	holy ♥♥♥♥ the graphics on this thing is as bad as those hentai movies that are out of snyc
1559	0	a	Game is a horrible mess, on top of that, Dev has had a past of stealing textures from other games, Don't be suprised if he changes the games name again to escape all the critisim,
1560	0	a	even for a 1$ is a ♥♥♥♥ing waste of money.
1561	0	a	This game feels like an alpha. Fun for the first 2 games of survival. No explanations of game mechanics (so you end up wasting a lot of ingame credits). Needs far more work to be a functional, complete game.
5885	1	a	Way too laggy here in Central America....
1563	0	a	Game is nothing but rip offs and poorly coded boring gameplay
1564	0	a	y u put money on the game im mad &lt;:( 
1565	0	a	So much about this game is wrong... The first thing you notice is that you have no guns. Instead, you have a textured object in your hand, that supossedly does damage as the ammo counter in the bottom of your screen counts down. You have no way of knowing however, as not only is there no data on your enemy, but the gun does not move; there is no recoil, there is no muzzle flash, and there are no bullet decals. This just begins to describe the potentially fatal experience of Orion Dino Horde, including hills that you walk through, no explanation to the gameplay, overly large maps with no navigation, game ruining glitches, a dedicated fan base of 11 year olds, and T-Rexs that throw rocks from their mouths. You read that last bit right. The T-Rex throws rocks from their mouths.  However, with all of the faults the game has, it makes for a hilarious experience, especially with a friend by your side as you smash into dozens of dinosaurs in overpowered vehicles, trolling the serious players into rage quitting. Only buy it if you have a friend(s) to play it with. That is when it holds any value.
1566	0	a	   The old metacritic score was 36.  
1567	0	a	there is too much llag and the game crashes alot 10/10 would stick a shovel in their ♥♥♥
1568	0	a	Quite frankly, this game is awful. Simply put, it's bland, boring, and the videos make it look like a completely different game. I bought this while it was 99 cents, and you shouldn't.
1569	0	a	Stephen Hawking Runs Better Than This Game
1570	0	a	Gabe newell should pay us to play this piece of garbage
1571	0	a	This game is ♥♥♥♥ing cancer. Don't buy it. All the maps are the same. The dinosaurs ice skate jet li quick style.
1572	0	a	The game uses stolen assets. Negative reviews are being swept under the carpet to keep the game from looking bad. They are currently suffering from a DMCA because of stolen assets, again. Just stay the fudge away from this game and don't ever support this developer or publisher, they have dishonest morals.
5887	1	a	You can turn invisible and knife raptors, 10/10
1579	0	a	99 cents for a game! Yes please!  Oh wait, no. This game sucks.
5889	1	a	The Best Game I Have Played In A Long Time! Keep Doing The Great Work! :)
1581	0	a	It doesn't cooperate with my controller which is compatible for pc gaming. It is very irritating when holding down the shooting button nothing happens. There have been times in the game where I'd try moving forward and my character would just stand there. Not enough time to get a new weapon and when spawning my character would automatically die. If that were fixed then I'd totally recommend it.
1582	0	a	Literally Don't Buy This Horrible ♥♥♥♥!
1583	0	a	Terrible. I got it on sale, and it was the worst waste of a dollar ever.
5891	1	a	So bad it's good and somehow gets worse the better it gets
1588	0	a	For some reason, this game crashed my brand new computer twice...  Aside from that, I almost feel that there's a few things in the game that would make a world of difference in the game. The biggest thing is the music, because the music almost ruins the moment (that's just me though). Also, the controls I wish would have been universal with all the vehicles, but maybe I didn't play long enough to check.
1589	0	a	... Where do I start? It was horrible short experience. The game doesn't grant you any information whatsoever. There is not even a tutorial to bring at least an introduction of what to do and what the controls etc are...
1590	0	a	It is ♥♥♥♥
1591	0	a	I have a question for the developers, and I have some positive feedback. Question: Is this seriously all you managed to do with three YEARS of trying to improve it? Did you SERIOUSLY think any of these changes were improvements? Positive feedback: Great job with lowering the price. $0.99 is still a bit too much given the quality, but it's better than &gt;$20/
1592	0	a	A dull FPS with the elements of others and dinsosaurs instead of whatever generic game you want to compare it to.  The graphics aren't great and the framerate will drop randomly for no reason.  The gameplay itself is fine, there are no bugs and the controls are reactive. It's just you get to do the same thing over and over again, nothing really exciting.
5893	1	a	havent played much, but so far, it wasnt the best but it was decent, great game seeing as i got it for 99 cents but i wouldnt pay 15 dollars for it
5895	1	a	Great game with loads of fun and par graphics,good to have it! Cheers!
1593	0	a	Absolute garbage optimization, so much that the game is unplayable. I would describe more, but i can't cause i cant play the game. You'll probably have more enjoyment out of bad rats then this piece of trash.
1594	0	a	This game is not ready to be released to the public.
5897	1	a	1000 HOURS INCOMING  PLASE PLAY THIS WITH YOUR FRIENDS  I LOVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
5899	1	a	This game should be part of 'Steam's early access' Program it needs a lot more work, came out year ago and they revamped this game for the better but more effort is needed to be done to call this a 'completed game'
5901	1	a	Hundreds times better than Primal Carnage ! Very well optimized ! You can purchase equipment like in Just Cause 2 (weapons, tanks, helicopters). Best 0,49 cents I've ever spent ! 9/10
5903	1	a	Games can't fail, only developers can. This game is by far the greatest bang per buck value. It plays a lot like Unreal Tournament 2004, combined with a bit of HALO all mixed in with dinosaurs.  Grab a couple of friends and go nuts in this game. You'll have a blast and I don't think you could spend that little bit of cash anyway better. This developer should get way more praise, they are like the indie CDProjectRed.
1598	0	a	I am disapointed with where my money went.
5905	1	a	Ignore the negative reviews. They were all written before the game was so beautifuly updated. I would play it more if my laptop would handle it better but the devs are amazing and really put effort into theirs games. Recommending it unless you have a laptop not suited for gaming (are laptop generally suited for gaming?).
5907	1	a	its fun with friends xdd, plus its one dollar    ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t time xddd    U SHOOT ♥♥♥♥ING DINOSAUR STHAT TRY TO ♥♥♥♥IN ♥♥♥♥ U AND THEIR IS A SANTA BOSS THAT ♥♥♥♥ING RAPS UR ♥♥♥ WITH ♥♥♥♥♥ MISSILES
1600	0	a	Unless you want an overwhelming urge to kill yourself after 10 min of gameplay then i dont think this game is for you...
5909	1	a	  NOW THE GAME IS FREE??? GIVE MY 40 CENTS BACK!!    JK, the game is good, so its nice more people can enjoy it and probably this means more players to play with so i gess it is a win for all
1601	0	a	Graphics of 90s, gameplay of 90s, bugs of 90s. I could recomend it if it will be 98 year, but now it is a trash. Not worth disk space usage.
5911	1	a	i dont havev this ga mw si yeahghgh itsa very gooods
1602	0	a	its nice but the controls are very crazy wierd and the attacks of the dinos are not very well made when u attack it feels as if ur not even doing any damage to the enemy humans players can win easily needs moore very crucial updates will change review if changes are made correctly.
1603	0	a	A-W-F-U-L GAME don't waste $1 on this crap.
1604	0	a	After several attempts of playing this game, like for real. I didn't manage to shot a DAMN THING. I've spend over 20 minutes waiting , searching , sprinting... but I couldn't play it.  Why I couldn't play it? Because this game has tons of random crashes that random things causes them. Just no.
1605	0	a	It's just plain bad.,,, Don't buy it, not worth the 40 cents.
1606	0	a	I don't know why I didn't like this game. so...   - I feel boring when I playing this game  - I don't know why I write this review I only played this game like a ♥♥♥♥in' 0.2 hrs  yeah!! I'll rate this game 99/100 what?
5913	1	a	Finally, a christian game developer that knows dinosaurs lived alongside humans.
5915	1	a	This game is has a few rough edges, but it's really fun.   If you enjoy Killing Floor, Sanctum or Team Fortress 2 in Mann Up mode you should give ORION:Prelude a try. It's like playing Sanctum with bots instead of a maze, but on the island from Ark and with special abilities and hats.   I suppose every game has hats now, but still.  Give the zombies a break and mow down dinosaurs for a change.
1613	0	a	'Mostly Postive'  This statement is obviously manipulated. Yeah for a $1 sure, buy it.  ***There are TONS of reviews claiming the game is bad, but give a thumbs up anyway...hmmm***  Quite possibly the worst game ever created, or offered via Steam.  I am sure to be burned at the stake for this from the devs/marketers.  1. Horde Survival - Dinosaurs come at the players on a STRAIGHT PATH in groups riding choppy animations and an absolute lack of AI. 'B-Line to you and chomp.'  2. Art design is crap. Objects look painted like Supreme Commander up close, nothing seems to have a cohesive theme with any other items within game, everything LOOKS like someone plopped down objects in Garry's Mod and went 'Yep thats Half-Life 3.'  3. Terrible movement, maps are MASSIVE to the point of not fun. Games go on forever. Vehicles are cheap and clunky. It honestly looks like bad engine demo.  Can anyone tell me why it's trying to look like Halo?

5917	1	a	I do recommend this game although it does get a bit laggy...
5919	1	a	Very Plain and simple: Just paid €0,99 for this game, We've found it due to the free weekend on steam, but it is just to epic to forget for only €0,99 cents.  We decided to support the developer and bought the game with the entire team and we're still pushing other members/employees to buy this game.  We've made a full video review on this game, make sure to check it out if you want to see more of this game before buying it.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71GfZhJzWdU   (Make sure to watch the video on youtube itself for full HD (1080P) video)  For 99Cents you just CAN'T complain about this game and her 251!!!! achievements :D 
5921	1	a	♥♥♥♥ 
5923	1	a	best game in the entire world must buy please buy join based gaming
5925	1	a	Love the game, good graphics and nice bots, but id like to have more colors and able to change them for free. Still, u cant get a better game for 1euro.
5927	1	a	Ever wanted to play as a dinosaur and eat people? Check! Ever wanted to kill dinosaurs? Check! Want to customize your weapon loadout and persk/abilities? Check! Want to face off against increasing odds against hordes of dinos? Check! Like faster action? Check! Like teamwork and teamplay? Check! Like driving tanks with your buddy as a gunner? Check! Like flying aircraft and decimating the field from above? Check! Enough reasons to like the game? Check! Check!  TL:DR Its a game that you can jump in to play 15 minutes or 4 hours. Its simple to learn, yet difficult to master. Offers the ability to customize to your play style. Annnnnnd it has Dinos!!   Super duper important facto: You can melee headshot a T-rex with a lightsaber. &lt;- Need I say more???

1634	0	a	Since I was young, I have always had a raging passion for dinosaurs. My room was covered in dinosaur posters, and while my friends were playing with their action figures, I'd be cuddling with my Stegosaurus stuffed animal. Boy, those were the days. Now, back to my review of Orion: Prelude. Upon first glance on Steam, I was befuddled. My heart began to pound. A game for only 99 cents... and it has dinosaurs! Purchasing this game was nearly a no-brainer, the only problem I encountered was giving up 1/10 of my hourly wage from McDonalds to pay for a game. But hey, for some childhood nostalgia, it had to be worth it. I couldn't be more wrong. This game wanted me to kill the ones I loved. My enthusiasm for these creatures was one of endearment, and Orion: Prelude was telling me to hurt the animal I idolized. How could I agree? After completing a round of this mindless horde against cute little raptors and a righteous Tricerotops, I had enough. I immediately quit the game, and spent the rest of my Friday evening crying to myself about how the world is so morally evil, like most Friday nights... well most nights in general. But thats besides the point. This game attempted to ruin my zeal toward dinosaurs, and I couldn't take such a harsh hit to my life. I will be forced to use the Steam refund policy and spend my money somewhere else.

1657	0	a	STAY AWAY! Spend your money elsewhere, even if it's just a buck.  Clunky, unresonposive controls. Sluggish movement. Terrible mechanics. A.I. is next to non-existent.  I like to think I have a fairly high tolerance for bugs and and patience when it comes to quirks, especially for indie games. However, not only is this 'game' amateurish, it is outright unplayable.  The only consolation is that I spent a mere $0.99 for it. Then again, in hindsight, if I had put a dollar towards a lottery ticket instead, I probably would have a higher chance of winning a jackpot than buying anything developed by ORION ever again. This is by far the most intolerably unpolished game I have ever had the misfortune of having on my computer.

1659	0	a	Eh. If you like the site of dinosaurs, this might be for you. Otherwise eh.
5951	1	a	ORION: Dino Horde is a Indie Game Shooter, that is amazing! The Graphics are standard from what you'll find from a Nintendo Wii or a Play Station 3 and this game is alright. Why people hate is soo much is because they hate it. HATERS GONNA HATE. Overall The Game is Amazing 7/10 Co-Op Your Main Objectives are surviving the Dinosaur Horde or Get the Generators Active.  Deathmatch Free for All whoever survives wins. Its a every man for himself.  Survival Survive the Horde and win the game  This Game has alot of potential and many of them survived but others failed. 7/10 from VivaTheGamer

Not just that, this Publisher just re-release the same game (but with diferent name like Orion: bla-bla-blah) and make people spending their money to buy the another series of this game.  I suggest you, not to buy product with name 'Orion' anymore. didnt trust what i said ? you can visit here:  Look at this proof 
5955	1	a	Cool game  cool Devs  the game is insane lol is like Star Wars Vs Jurasic Park  pls you can use a light saber  and is free like come one is worth it to download
1668	0	a	The Orion Prelude was one of the worst games of all time-Once Now it is a bad graphic, first person, dinosaur hunting, survival game. Servers only Costs money too buy items and there is no Steam trading inventory for it. Pros- 99 Cents Cons- Bad Graphics Lagging... Slow Costs money too buy in game items No trading As IGN said 'Please don't waste your hard-earned dogh' I rate this game- 3.1/10
5957	1	a	so this game is for kids like 7-12 years old l thought wow something like borderlands NO lts just epic guns wow but shoting is totaly lagged and the island is too bugged this game is hard 2 cuz you must kill flying dinosaur wtf lts really good to gift for you frind 7 years he gonna be happy and you will pay 0.50 euro so good gift 6/10

1673	0	a	  The game is running really slow for no reason, all settings on low, not too many people playing it and some dinos take lots of time to die.
1674	0	a	Argueably one of the worst games I've ever played. Guns without sounds, lack of decals and general polish, horrible UI and awful animations.  The little amount of voice acting present is low quality and repeated over and over. That this game has sold as many copies as it has makes me very sad.  Steer clear of this game.
5963	1	a	Got lots of hours killing dino basterds great price, and playablity buy the four pack.
5965	1	a	Jetpacks, tanks, dinosaurs that the game calls 'dinos,' this game has it all. Jurassic Park meets Deus Ex meets your birthday; 2/5 for some decent co-op, dino destruction. Recommended if a dino fan and on sale
5967	1	a	Fun. Horde. Survival. Simple. Exciting. The graphics aren't amazing but it's 99 cents. GG. 7/10

1683	0	a	From the bowels of some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ developer that had absolutely NO clue what they were doing, they bring you ORION: Dino Horde, a ♥♥♥♥ game for ♥♥♥♥♥.  This is 100% objective. The leveling system is bad. Collision detection is awful. Mapping is bad, but not as bad as i'd think from basically a glorified Source Engine mod. You know, games that are free. I bought this game when it was £0.01 and it's not even worth that.  0 stars.
1684	0	a	This was a waste of 99 Cents

1691	0	a	Allthough I did not buy this (My freind gifted it to me) I highly regret installing this broken shell of a game. The port is terrible, even on ultra high graphics the game looks like crap, The team based mechanic is non existant and this is the 'Fixed' version of the game.  PROS: It is 99 cents. CONS: to many to count.
5977	1	a	A very cheap -er- good game.
5979	1	a	Great Game! Would recommend. IMO its a mix of oldschool tribes plus some new ark style gameplay. Definatly worth tume and money! Some bugs ive found but what game doesnt have them.
5981	1	a	i vault the fence, crash down into a pile of dead leaves, and pick up my father from the fallen. inside the constant hum of insects, i breed into eternity. where was god in all of this   the answer is that i awoke naked and alone inside of a cave, the lights were flanging and I felt the crushing hollowness of a century. the voices boomed around me, and I felt fear for the very first time. minutes like bullets intersected by screams, i slip into the skin of a new tyrant, and firmly grasp the rat's neck
5983	1	a	this game is insane. love it, ten outa ten would recommend to anyone
1692	0	a	This game sucks so f**king bad, like holy sh*t. Don't buy this if you have any right of mind.
1693	0	a	I cannot explain how terrible this game is. I have played this game for a total of 7 minutes and 45 seconds and honestly I hated every second that my eyes burned on these playstation 1 visuals. I have seen better looking videos and games on my iPod Nano. However I am told that the developers were ging through a tough time being blind. At least thats what I am hoping because this game is worse than that one time a small unloved child from a third world country choked on his own sadness. I wish I could refund my time and life wasted on this pittiful 17th century game that was funded by small children haters foundation. I am truely sorry if you bought this game, for you have been sucked in by the steam sales and the crappy games they put up for less than 5 dollars. FarmVile in my opinion would get my seconds of my life then this sorry excuse for a videogame.
5985	1	a	Halo meets Dinos. Graphics: 10/10 Gameplay: 10/10 I was playing with a friend and suddenly he began to get arrows stuck on me, finished with a selfie. Now i can go out and say: I hunted dinos like you but then i took an arrow to the knee.
5987	1	a	i like this game a lot however there is some lag issues i recomend checking out the steam guild to fix it but overall AMAZING!! i love shootin them dinos:)
5989	1	a	Way better than the game it's meant to be preluding
5991	1	a	WTF Valve? Where is my game what i got for free? Return me back!!
5993	1	a	New, quick-review is as follows: The game has definitely improved in almost every area since launch. Some textures on buildings and the general vehicle design might be amateurish, but I recommend you look beyond these minor issues and find at least one friend to get the game, (perhaps on sale, or if you're an indie supporter buy at full price) as getting together to mow down scores of prehistoric beasts is great fun!   OLD REVIEW BELOW I recommend AVOIDING this game, unless it is: A) On Sale; like it is today for less than 4 USD (August 19, 2013) B) Something you and your friends would enjoy playing together for some stupid fun
1699	0	a	This game kinda sucks. idk how else to put it. Very weak overall.   Repetitive and boring. With very low production value. honestly way better Horde mode co-op games to be played than this one.  Would not recommend
1700	0	a	Well what to say about this game...great premise. Execution is...well not so good. Tried it,but after 5minutes of playing i had no idea what was i doing, what should i do etc. Good game,but needs a lot of polishes. When its in sale and you have nothing to spend your money on, i say go buy this game just for lulz.
5995	1	a	Well, i have played fora couple hours now, and i must say... ITS AWESOME. yes there are glitches, i came across 2 in my playtime but it was not to bad. i really enjoyed this game i mean what other game lets you fight dinos in a mech suit?
5997	1	a	Don't trust the rating! This is one of the best fps's I've ever played. I recommend it if you like Halo and Jurrassic Park.
5999	1	a	Underrated but incredibly fun
1702	0	a	I spent 0.99 cents on this game. THIS IS ♥♥♥♥♥♥, GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK
6001	1	a	This is my current stress buster. Do-op dinosaur shooting. Nothing else needs to be said really.
1703	0	a	lame all around. bad graphics, bad game play, hardly have time to grab new weapons even. does not allow you to level up//no story line or campain mode.
6003	1	a	Fun shooter Dino slayer who wouldnt enjoy????!!!!!!!
6005	1	a	cheap and fun 
1708	0	a	Like masturbating with razor blades.
1709	0	a	My only gripe with this is that it's UNREALISTIC. Humans and dinosaurs weren't around at the same time. hell, T Rex and Stegosaurus didn't even live together. YOU NEED TO CHECK YOUR FACTS BEFORE YOU RELEASE GAMES
1710	0	a	I lost R$ 2,19 buying this game
6007	1	a	Orion: Prelude is one of the best games ever! Looking at the price of it might make you think that it has DLC or overpowered weapons but no! You buy the game and that is it! It has some cosmetic items that you can buy with real money but it is more like a donation and it gives you no advantage! Overall the game is great! Graphics are not the best but it fixes it on gameplay!  This game has a 'single-player' mode that is basicly same thing as offline but with bots!  Also when I tested the server creating it worked perfectly. It doesn't have the same problem as Valve games (so in Orion: Prelude you don't need to make dedicated servers to play with friends)!  Totally worth of your money :)
6009	1	a	Just a simple fun game. I'm not going to give this game a bad rating just because the company that made it is having some problems. As for the real question, is the game any good ? I have to say it is. To me that is all that matters.  The Good I went into an easy survival server for my first time playing. It is a simple set up go into the building that has what you want to buy, and get it. The more dinosaurs you kill the better stuff you can buy. The gameplay fells relaxed, no rush just fun. The bosses are large dinosaurs which are fun to kill.  The Bad The Pterodactyls are what killed teammates more then the T-rex. The Jeep turns by moving the mouse, while the tank turns with the 'A' &amp; 'S' keys.  The Ugly The only ugly thing is if you want to play this with a controller. I like to use a conroller when I can, because keyboard, 7 mouse kills my wrist. But this game doesn't feel right.   With that said using keyboard, and mouse was easy this game. You just find a good spot, wait for the next wave, and mow them down. Alot easier on your wrist when you're mostly using just the mouse.
1712	0	a	STAY AWAY FROM THIS MESS!   Orion Dino Horde is nothing but a rebrand of the god awful Orion Dino Beatdown,however with more content and SOME bug fixes,the most notably one being the better optimization. BUT all of the issues are back full force:  -God Awful Dinosaur attack animations -Horrid Gunplay -TERRIBLE Sound Design -TERRIBLE firearm sound design -TERRIBLE Voice Acting -Sub-Par Graphics for a 2013 release,this looks like an early UE 3 game  there are other games that execute this ``Wave Survival`` mechanic much better than this travesty of a game,instead of buying this save up some cash and buy Killing Floor,this game was supposed to be a mod but SOMEHOW it got funded and now its asking for your hard earned cash,by the time im typing this review this game is on sale for 1 $,in my opinion its not even worth a dime throwing your money away is much more fun than buying this piece of crap.
1713	0	a	♥♥♥♥ game, funny for half an hour but doesn't excuse it for sucking. Bought it out of curiosity, wasted my money.
1714	0	a	This game is worst game i ever played ! Lag , Hard to new players and it is not fun game !! Hate that game !!!
6011	1	a	Great game, bit glitchy but for those money, must have
6013	1	a	one of the best games i have ever played its right up there with elder scrolls and battlefield
6015	1	a	The Best Game I have played For ever!
6017	1	a	If Bungee saw this, they would sue. 10/10
1717	0	a	I noticed a lot of other people said they were prompted with controller buttons on screen instead of keyboard when playing. I got the exact opposite. I had my controller plugged in and was prompted with keyboard options. So it sounds to me like this game is ♥♥♥ backwards and i'm not surprised because it sucks. A lot. Don't waste your time.
6019	1	a	Pretty fun game to play, especially since it is extremely cheap.   Pros:  Simple gameplay Good to play with friends Very cheap, literally the price of a can of Pepsi Dinosaurs   Cons:  Players don't seem to communicate much, which can make it pretty boring if you're not playing with friends AI can be a bit buggy at times Pterodactyls are annoying asf  Definitly recommend if you're looking for game to play with atleast one other friend, not as fun on your own
6021	1	a	Shoot, run, shoot, run , laugh as the dinosaurs ragdoll on the floor like lifeless insects.
1720	0	a	could have been improved
6023	1	a	literally the best game i have ever played. puts tripple A titles to shame.
6025	1	a	....................../´¯/)  ....................,/¯../  .................../..../  ............./´¯/'...'/´¯¯`·¸  ........../'/.../..../......./¨¯\  ........('(...´...´.... ¯~/'...')  .........\.................'...../  ..........''...\.......... _.·´  ............\..............(  ..............\.............\... i hit the uninstall button, and it didnt ragdoll! 11/10
1723	0	a	Just terrible.
6027	1	a	I punched a pterodactyl with a pistol, I stabbed a Stegosaurus with a sword, I tackled a Tyrannosaur with a tank... It's an okay game.
1724	0	a	Its alright
1725	0	a	Every time I try to start the game it just crashes and i unintalled and reinstalled it and it still instantly crashes
1726	0	a	It's 1 dollar for a reason.
6029	1	a	better than Call of Duty Ghost
6031	1	a	This is probably the best game I've ever played. Stunning graphics, next gen engine, haven't encountered any bugs yet. If you really love your friend, gift this to him/her.  Actual quote from IGN: 'The next Bioshock: Infinite' 11/10 -IGN
6033	1	a	Gave me motion sickness and an headache within an hour of playtime 10/10
6035	1	a	This is a perfect example of a game steam shouldn't be selling. It's more than disappointing. It's downright terrible. The idea that this could be sold for actual money is insane.
6037	1	a	GRAAAAHR! RAWWWR! *Fwomph!*
1727	0	a	The only game i wish i could delete from my library.
1728	0	a	What ever you do. Dont you ever buy this Game. It was the worst Game I ever bought and I even bought a 4 Pack because I though wow Dinosaurs must be fun. The Release Version was unplayable. I mean the dinosaur killsound was a Civilian HL2 Death sound. The Game was in such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ state that they released the Game again 1 year later under another name? HOW BAD CAN YOU BE THAT YOU HAVE TO CHANGE YOUR NAME. The Original started a meer riot in the Steam forums for refund. So dont buy this. just dont!
6039	1	a	Really a Great FUN game. I paid for it when it was on special but it is deffiently worth 14.99USD. I love the game. Everyone should buy it!!! :) :) :) Hours of fun
6041	1	a	why do i have to buy the game two times!!!!!!
1729	0	a	Don't believe their lies. It's a third-rate Unreal Tournament 3 mod, with tons of jank and like, one looping music track. It's worth 99c, but not a penny more.
1730	0	a	....... really.......
1731	0	a	bad fps treatment
1732	0	a	This game is the worst piece of ♥♥♥♥ I have ver seen. The creators should literally take the computers they made this with and shove it up their asses. 10/10
1733	0	a	This game is advertised as an amazing reboot. To be honest, its rubbish. Its laggy for all the 4 people i know who have this game even though we all have very good computers, Its confusing to play and a waste of 79p !
1734	0	a	This game is ♥♥♥♥. It runs horribly and its a killing floor with dinosaurs. Its a one euro pound or whatewer its not waste of money but it doesnt last long. Buy killing floor instead or buy dino-d when its on steam sale.
1735	0	a	@InternetBeaver Why did you make me buy this?
1736	0	a	Terrible. 5 dollar budget. wasnt play tested. If there are more words to describe it, I dont think they exist.
6043	1	a	very funny and doesnt need a strong pc
6045	1	a	I SHOT A LITTLE FOOT IN THE FACE! WHAT MORE COULD I ASK FOR FROM A GAME!!!!
1742	0	a	game doesn't start. 10/10 would play again
6047	1	a	Amazing game. Ambient arena with your friends and weather and EVERYTHING YOU COULD WANT. Btw, who cares if anything is stolen from the game. Games always steal sounds, textures, etc. And that doesnt make the game any less great.
6049	1	a	  game is 1$ why write a bad review also its rly fun with friends
6051	1	a	gg steam votes for sale when game was already 99 cents on sale instead of a real game. wp steam community
6053	1	a	what is life
1748	0	a	Its prettyyyyyy bad.
1749	0	a	awfull is a kind word
6055	1	a	i bought the game when it was 5 or 10 EURO :(
6057	1	a	scammed me from my dollar. WHY IS IT FREE.
1752	0	a	If you didn't think you could waste 50 cents, look no further.  
1753	0	a	What about people who play when it's not F2P ?? no ♥♥♥♥ing refund for this ?? i feel disapointment so much :&lt;
1754	0	a	They make jokes that in 2012, they made the worst game ever, but now theyve turned it around.... NO.. The gaame is still pretty bland. i may have found this game interesting back in 2005, but here we are 10 years later and their gfx still look 10+ years old. the community seems pretty dead... there is barely a choice of server/game mode to choose from, i still cant get past the fact that this game looks like it would be ok back in 2000-2005. I wouldnt recommend playing this game unless its the very first game you play in history, that way you cant compare it to anything else.
1755	0	a	Welp now that it's free I feel stung by the developers. Real insult to anyone who bought this scum for money. Hopefully I shove my 99 cents so far up my ♥♥♥ to simulate being ♥♥♥♥ed by the developers.
1756	0	a	Trash. graphics are mediocre, performance is horrible, and dont even want to hear the audio, which sounds like a game from 1995, actually, worse. cons: poor quality, no singleplayer, bad multiplayer, overpriced dlcs, and not optimized.  pros: workshop.
1757	0	a	  THIS ♥♥♥♥ING GAME BLOWED MY EYES AND CAUSES TO ME A MENTAL PROBLEM
6059	1	a	this is the best game
6061	1	a	it is the best 49 sents ive spent
6063	1	a	Amazing game, not even $1. It's like a mix of Halo &amp; Planetside 2, but with DINOSOWERS!
1758	0	a	  The game costs a dollar and is always on sale for a reason.      cuz its bad         It's a good game if you're 8 years old I guess.
6065	1	a	Jetpacks and dinosaurs. What more do you want in a game?
6067	1	a	nice but i cant run it on may pc :( but its ok this game is good :D
6069	1	a	Slightly badly optimized, with netcode that could do with a LITTLE smoothing, but the true fun of the game is in the brokenness of some of the weapons. Cloaking and backstabbing (never breaking cloak) to your hearts content never gets old. Revolver shooting everything never gets old. Getting enough upgrades that you're basically a walking tank never gets old. It invokes memories of good old COD Zombies, but ten times more broken. Absolutely fun.
1766	0	a	Its an ok game but SEVERELY BROKEN did you have to dip down in quality after you almost got sued Step up guys seriously
6071	1	a	All of the reviews are steam ones.  10/whydoesthisnumberevenmatter.
6073	1	a	This game is beyond amazing. This is a cross between Halo and Ark. This game is worth the money also very fun with friends and it wastes sometime are you hands and its just a very good game overall.
6075	1	a	Halo and Borderlands had a lovechild with Turok. It has lots of flaws but its fun with friends, and its only a buck.
6077	1	a	'well I mean its 99 cents so i guess its goood if you like being castrated by a raptor as you are humped to death by a horny t-rex at a million miles an hour until you ♥♥♥♥ing die' - anonymyus
1777	0	a	Ugly. Awful. Bad gameplay. Waste of time. Sorry I gave this game a shot and it's just bad. Looks cool and fun at first however it's not.
6079	1	a	Absolutely worth every penny, CDN$ 1.09 spent well THANK YOU DEVELOPERS FOR MAKING MY LIFE. THIS GAME IS COMPLETELY NEXT GEN QUALITY AND IS ABSOLUTELY GAME OF THE CENTURY
1778	0	a	Sure am glad the specs keep changing
1779	0	a	All I can say is, thank goodness for the free week.   After about 10 minutes of playing, all I want to do is uninstall this crap. I honestly would have been ♥♥♥♥♥♥ had I even wasted the measly $0.99 on this.
1780	0	a	  ♥♥♥♥ just ♥♥♥♥♥. it's a waste of download space boring repetitive and servers are extremely laggy, if you shoot anything 1 ft in front of you it's gonna die 4 years later.
1781	0	a	Pretty terrible game, looks like it's from 2005 and plays like it too. Good then, but not now.
6081	1	a	ORION sucks. ORION Prelude is pretty darn good. Fin. Its like $0.04 and you get 3 free copies to give to your friends. Imagine Borderlands Co-OP but youre fighting Dino's. Yeah I know, its hard to imagine. So rather than waste brain power trying to picture it, spend the 0.00005 pesos and get it. Just dont get ORION. That totally blows. Oh, and the devs are total dipsticks. I cant believe the people that made ORION also made this. Its like they were drinking while making one of them. Obviously they were drinking while making Prelude because its so much better.
1785	0	a	very ugly, very boring game...looks like it is from 2009 so ugly. The gameplay is very boring too. Looks like Dinosaur meets killing floor.
1786	0	a	this game is really good but the massive lag spoils what could be an amazing game
6083	1	a	This game is awesome AND very cheap,in fact too cheap for being this awesome~! :D (not that i am complaining~ xP) In the beginning i was 'Meh,this games is hard and not that good,but after a while,when i got the hang of it and started to have fun,i thought,hey it's not bad,actually it's very fun~!' xD
6085	1	a	This game is beyond amazing. This is a cross between Halo and Ark. This game is worth the money also very fun with friends and it wastes sometime are you hands and its just a very good game overall.
1790	0	a	They ♥♥♥♥ing ruined it with prelude, the game's preformance sucks ♥♥♥ now, lowest resolution gets 15 frames on a decent gaming laptop.  It was GOOD ENOUGH 3 MONTHS AGO, STOP TRYING TO MAKE IT BETTER.  holy ♥♥♥♥
6087	1	a	Im gonna ram a rusty nail through my spinal and eat my ♥♥♥♥♥
1792	0	a	THE GAME IS FULL WITH BUGS AND I WENT MY MONEYS BACK
6089	1	a	Full Review: Orion  dino horde  Prelude might have rough animations, (Not only the derpy animations of players and Dinosaurs, Try doing a melee attack with the CV-10 Pistol. I dare you.) and I have no idea what the heck the story is (I ASSUME it's about humans going back in time to the period of dinosaurs because earth in the future is all ruined and stuff. It might be another planet with dinosaurs on it. No clue)  Game Play: 8/10 As for gameplay, well, Orion is quite fun, and plays quite like one of my favorite games: Killing Floor. The addition of Jetpacks and Cloaking is great, and while it's twitchy like the ORIGINAL Killing Floor (2.5 for UT2004), it's still a blast to play with friends when you get bored of (Insert party game here. Probably CS:GO)  It also has deathmatch, which i don't really play, and PvPvE mode (Deathmatch WITH Dinosaurs!)   Graphics: 9/10 Orion: Prelude has some pretty graphics. While my laptop can't fully handle them, the game looks great on my buddy Damieok's Battle station.  Hats: Hat/Hats This game has hats. Hats are fun. Not a lot of Hats like TF2, but a nice little selection.  Music: 9/10 The Music is pretty damn epic. Nuff Said.  Price: 10/10 BUT ♥♥♥♥, IT WAS 99 CENTS.  SERIOUSLY. IT IS A DOLLAR. LIKE, LESS THAN A CHICKEN SANDWICH. AS MUCH AS 4 TWINKIES. THIS GAME IS WORTH 4 TWINKIES IN MY BOOK.   TL:DR Review:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoHFWd1qi0c 
1795	0	a	This game... Just no... No... Not worth your time... Just don't bother.
1796	0	a	Still not worth it.
1797	0	a	Litterly not worth the trading cards i sold to get the .99 cents to buy this..... soo glitchy, very little ingame instructions and the animations are terrible. THE worst game i have played  
1798	0	a	This game suxx BALLS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1799	0	a	No thanks.
6091	1	a	addicted with this game :)

6093	1	a	Nice one :)
6095	1	a	so much fun for 1$! It is very awesome get it worth its worth the money
6097	1	a	Metascore needs to rate this game again.
6099	1	a	Approved by the goat!
6101	1	a	Please nominate this for game of the year 2017, This is seriously one of the best most innovative games on the market. It is wuite a shame that people are missing out on this gem, if you have $1 and a friend who doesnt have this game, buy them this game and they will love you forever. Basically this is the best game ever made and will easily win Game of the Year if nominated.
1807	0	a	its not smooth, dinamycs are not very good, if you want to buy, buy it with a good discount.
1808	0	a	A total piece of crap to me. I hate the game play, but you can enjoy it. I would rate it 3.5 out of 10
1809	0	a	Pathing AI is hilarious.
6103	1	a	I loved the look of the game. in game storyline or the concept is very good. I wish i had a better computer to actually play the game....
6105	1	a	Got drop kicked by a velociraptor.  I r8 8/8 m8
1810	0	a	Nope.
6107	1	a	dino horde is a great game filled with futuristic weapons but i often get big lag spikes that last for about 2 min. but exept for that its great
1811	0	a	I was foolish enough to buy this game because I thought it would be a laugh. I was wrong. Take the objective. Take the objective. Take the objective. Take the objective. Take the objective.

6109	1	a	I love this.
6111	1	a	Great game, awesome 3D tower defense game. Like Left 4 Dead with dinosaurs. There isn't much bad about this game but the one thing that has me sad is the serious lack of different Dino's. Only 3 or 4 in the game. If you have to play that over and over, what's the fun?
6113	1	a	What happen at the servers? I cant see any server at refresh except 1 Insane dinosurvival. HELP
6115	1	a	Its fun. Get some friends to buy it (or get the 4-pack) and play. Some people have had some trouble with connecting, but I've never had this issue.
6117	1	a	Dinosaurs can blow up the power plant 10/10
1816	0	a	This game has so much potential, but it sucks so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bad. everything looks like ♥♥♥, buggy, and controls like running through knee deep mud. 2/10
1817	0	a	This game is TaRASH i wouldn't recommend this game to my child if his life depended on my ex paying child support. This game is a -1/10 wouldn''t play it if my friend's life depended on it.
6119	1	a	this game is really fun i would reccomend it to anyone but there are some good things to it and some bad things to it soo im gonna tell you whats good and whats bad about it.  good things:  it has great graphics  it has alot of servers to play on it has mulitple gamemodes to choose from (my favorites are vital rampage and survial) it has a alot of weapons to choose from. it has a alot of different dinos.  it's only 1$ it has alot of maps to play on.   bad things: there are only 3 classes. you need a good computer or else it will lag insanely (i got rid of the lag by changeing my settings) it takes a long time to download bots are a little dumb. not too many but still has a few bugs.  besides all the bad stuff this game is amazing.
1818	0	a	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCMRpia6K_o  just watch that video, and YES this game is ORION: DINO HORDE NOT Prelude.... the only reason I own this game is because it was a gift from a friend over steam.I joined a game, IN THE LOBBY, and when the match started, I was prompted with wait for next round to respawn.Round timer: 45:00 minutes left, so I left.
6121	1	a	I know I haven't played it for very long, I had put off buying it because of negative reviews, but those reviews are garbage. This game is fun.
1820	0	a	Orion: Prelude caters to the zero demand in first/third person sci-fi dinosaur shooters, it's continued existence and updates is one of the great mysteries of life
6123	1	a	Really feels like a beta of an upcoming free to play game, and has a lot of issues, but if you look past that and realise it's just a 1$ (or less) game and realise how much fun you can have killing dinosaurs with your friends, then you'll def. like this game.
6125	1	a	It's a dinosaur hunting game...Online...with GUNS !! 10/10
6127	1	a	I dont remember buying this, Is that bad?
1824	0	a	when i first played this game it was very laggy and the graphics are bad so i avoided this game for about a year and now im posting a review
6129	1	a	It's a dollar don't be cheap, lightsabers, dinosaurs, and jetpacks, lower video settings to low if you're middle class citizens
6131	1	a	so cool and you can fly
1828	0	a	you should just let this game be free because all your doing is anoying a lot of peoplee by putting out for only a week free and its not that good any way so just make free !!!!!!!!!!!!!
6133	1	a	This Is Just TOO AWESOME GAME!!!!!  +Plenty Of Weapons +You Can Play With friends +Vehicles +Many Difrend Maps +Too Much dinosaurs +Good Graphics +It's Only 0,99$ Game  -Soldiers -Soldiers Riding On Dinosaurs -Some Tiny Glitches -You Must To Pay Real Money For Hats  Questions:  Does It Have Voice Chat?    Something Else To Say:  Don't Look Comments JUST BUY IT Its An Epic Game  10/10
1829	0	a	4 Million copyies sold isn't a selling point for a $0.99 game.
1830	0	a	I tried to like this game... I really did, but it is sooooo boring. The first few minutes where like meh this game is ight. but in a few more boy my opinion would change. Just in the first 5 minutes it was so repetitive the dinosaurs aren't even that hard and multiplayer isn't that fun either... the game would be a great idea if they remade the graphics and added a story mode to it i wouldn't regret buying the game but sadly i do... 3/10 would kill raptors that don't even hurt me probably not again
6135	1	a	What the?
6137	1	a	More addicting than sex on cocaine. 69/10
6139	1	a	Finally I just started playing this game after the 1.3 update.   It sat on my library for almost a year, you know, it was $1, why wouldn't I buy a 1 buck 3D relatively decent graphics game that was accepted by more than a 50% of it's owners?  Well, to me, this game actually deserves a try, and definitely, it is worth the $1 I paid for it, would pay 2 or 3 times that price.  It pretty simple (learnt how to play it in 1 hour), it's fun to play, 3 classes, many weapons to choose from, many upgrades, good graphics, nice maps, good Dino's AI, good multiplayer system, and the best part, you do this all in a relatively short period of time. There is a game mode where you play 5 matches in 35 minutes or less, by then you already upgraded all your skills, bought the best weapons, and killed 150 dinos... =D  You can think of this title, like the best mobile 3D FPS with Dinos game you have ever seen, but running at 1080p on your PC screen, with a mouse and keyboard attached to it.
1840	0	a	Worse than socialism.
1841	0	a	Uh, what? No explanation or anything, game just throws you into a clunky lobby and even clunkier gameplay with no explanation. Lame.
6141	1	a	Right, this game never really caught my eye before for a number of reasons, primarily because they didnt really sell the gameplay well. It went dont to like 70 p and me and a few mates thought screw it, lets buy and it is actually such an amazing game. Yeh the graphics are nother special and there arent alot of guns to chose from, but the gameplay is so much fun. Thus far we have only played survival, there are only 4 of us and I gotta say its a really relaxing jokey game that can range from easy run arounds to extreme difficulty. I would pay 10 pound for this game id say, under a pound is ridiculous, its such an amazing game to have as an option to play with ur mates.  PLEASE BE AWARE this game is no fun without having someone to play it on, community isnt exact big or active anymore and you cant really joke around with urself..
6143	1	a	Orion, Onion.   Game - Awesome  Graphics - Makes the game not that awesome
6145	1	a	10/10
1845	0	a	What a waste of money. I will never play it again.
1846	0	a	This game is very unstable  -10/10 wouldnt rate again
1847	0	a	a dollar is practically worthless and i still feel like i wasted money on this simplistic, boring, barely-a-game.
6147	1	a	To be frank, propbably the best 99 cents you will every spend, regardless if you constantly play the game or not
6149	1	a	coop multiplayer with tons of guns and jetpacks and dinosaurs. Whats not to love?
1850	0	a	bought this game to play with my friends and was disappointed to discover that the game will not launch on my pc. instead i get a white screen and the task manager says its not responding. i hope this problem is fixed soon 
6151	1	a	I don't own this game, but I was allowed to write a review for it, which is nice. 10/10
6153	1	a	Pretty cool!  A lot of content/game modes.
6155	1	a	8/8 this game is great 
6157	1	a	Jurassic Park + Borderlands 2 for 60 cents. 10/10
6159	1	a	only problem is it doesnt have good fps on my computer
6161	1	a	This is one of the best dino games ever!!! please work on the bugs and grapichs... BUT ITS SO GOOD
1858	0	a	Not worth the money
6163	1	a	This game for the low, low, low price of the lint in your pocket is one of the most fun games I've ever played. Especially if you play with friends. It's survuval mode is really fun but the PvP is where things get interesting. The game is also surprisingly alive so you will run into players occasionally and they are all pretty cool guys.
1859	0	a	this is a horrible game, the trailer makes the game look really cool, but looks can be desiving. when i started playing i got an instant headace and this game is not worth the 99 cents.
6165	1	a	i have bougt 8 games and given to my friend´s and all all of them liked it super good game!!
6167	1	a	Played it when it was free probably going to buy it again. One of the games I actually felt like reviewing. You can have many weapons and it can be an endless amount of fun. This game is one of the fun ones.
1860	0	a	all hail the lag king of all my games with no lag love u counter strike as for u prelude 1st place for lag and terrible quality and great lag u done it this time guys
6169	1	a	THE GRAPHICS ARE TOO BEAUTIFUL FOR MY AYES.  10/0,1
6171	1	a	its alright i guess
6173	1	a	good nice dinosaur mabey ark try to get stuff like this!
1862	0	a	I save my video options and the game crash dont buy this
6175	1	a	Great game but no servers still buy and play cant beat 50 cents thats like the price of a potato chip bag but chips taste better then Orion.
1863	0	a	waste of a dollar, too laggy to play, stupid concept. overall rating- 2/10
1864	0	a	horrible
1865	0	a	I meet the maximum requirements of the game and more...   yet on lowest settings i get 20fps what is this
6177	1	a	it's ok, but an awkward mix of Counter-Strike,(the voice commands)Dirty Bomb,(the accent)and Halo(the graphics) I can see why it's only 99 cents now, but it's pretty good, I guess
6179	1	a	its ok for a dollar
6181	1	a	Ignore the meta critic this game is actually pretty good.
6183	1	a	it sucks so much id rather play cod
1869	0	a	only baught cause 49 cents and i got bored after 3 minutes of playing it. to sum things up this game eats ♥♥♥
6185	1	a	This is a good game, but ive had lots of problems with it, it lags out so much that i cant even play it. fraps says i get about 6 fps in this game. yes the ideas good but the execution is poor. but i would still say its a game worth getting as long as its on sale.
1870	0	a	dont lose mony on the sh'/'/t
6187	1	a	Amazing game! Cant wait to play with friends!
6189	1	a	Orion prelude is a great game and it has it's ups and it's downs but I think it has way more pros than cons lets look at that. Pros.  -1$!! How can you pass that up and sales are just amazing. (or so I have been told I have not know'n this game long enough to see one.) -Five player co-op and quite a few other game modes. -A lot of perks and weapons. -Being able to play as dinos. -Awesome vehicles. -Unlockables like starting weapons wehicle upgrades and starting perks and a few other things. I think I have gotten most of the things that are good now lets transition to the bad. Neutral. Stuff that is in between. -Trading cards they are nice but some people may dissagree. -Graphics im fine with them but they aren't the best. I think I have covered these too. Cons. Stuff that is not really of the liking of most -There are too many orion games to give this one too much attention to adding stuff and fixing bugs. -It is a bit grindy but this is not ussually a big problem. I dont know if I got all the cons but I can edit this later.  Final rating 8.5/10 I would get it.       Tl;dr This was my first review so I don't think it is perfect and I might view it differentally later.
6191	1	a	This game rocks. The graphics aren't top notch, but who cares? Battles are fun and addictive and it's awesome to kill a T-Rex by yourself :) For 1$ this is a super bargain!
1872	0	a	Waste of a dollar. Cheap ♥♥♥♥s.
6193	1	a	For less than £1, it's a good game to play co-op.
6195	1	a	I love this freaking game bought a 4 pack for my sister
6197	1	a	Great game bought it when it was called orion dino horde but nvm dinos could have more intelligence though
1873	0	a	An F U to people that bought the game
6199	1	a	What every dev should do instead of ditching their games
6201	1	a	This game is Gr8, buy 4 pack for a m8 and use him for b8 this game is under8ed m8... BUY IT
6203	1	a	Oi m8 we thinkin about getin Orion:Prelude eh? Would giv a 4/20 m8 rele noice. Dont play on that ♥♥♥♥in potato though m8
6205	1	a	gr8 b8 m8 i r8 it 8/8 no h8 cuz im l8 but w8 im only 8
6207	1	a	after 2400 hours+ i have to say that this is the best videogame to ever exist.
6209	1	a	ITS VERY GOOD!!!!!!!!!1  but please its too slow and laggy no servers ... kind of, its really badass to quickscope sum dinos in the head  i really recomend it btw its cheap
6211	1	a	Cheap/10
6213	1	a	This game......THIS GAME doesnt need a frickin review. its got thousands of those. THIS GAME doesnt need fixing, or a story, or just about dang anything. THIS GAME IS BADASS. you will play it. you will play it some more. you play it for 9 hours in a single sitting. but most of all...you will play it, and YOU. WILL. LOVE. IT.
6215	1	a	not worth the dollar unless yourcanadian then your dollar isnt worth ♥♥♥♥
6217	1	a	An exquisite, meticulously-crafted dinosaur survival game that surpasses the quality of gameplay of ARK: Survival Evolved. Also conveniently has a diluted price and can run on a mediocre graphics card.
1878	0	a	It was said to be a bad game, and it improved over the time. Better graphics and such. But i still think the graphics suck( I have it at max everthing for graphics) FPS sucks ( Turned everything to the minimum for this, and I have a very good pc) So, I belive in my perspective that this game still sucks.
6219	1	a	&gt;gets T-rex egg &gt;Chased by T-rex and spinosaurus &gt;Hides in bike shed &gt;They try to lure me out with promise of friendship &gt;Fall for it &gt;gets eaten &gt;respawns &gt;grabs egg &gt;wins game &gt;T-rex ragequits
6221	1	a	You have a gun. You shoot Dinosaurs. Why? Because you have a gun. And there are Dinosaurs. Dinosaurs. That's all that really needs saying.
1879	0	a	I fell for the trailer and the reviews. I thought it was a really good game. Then when I started playing it, I had the worst lagg (probably bc of the lack of servers) altough there where like, 20 people playing this game worldwide. I didnt know what to do, there was no information anywhere, and the graphics sucked, so no I dont recommend this game.
6223	1	a	the framereate is jumpy and you cant tell whats going on half the time. its a good idea but it needs work i only recomend because i want others to see this games potential.
6225	1	a	Super fun for the money and lots of content.
6227	1	a	Knifed a T-Rex in the ♥♥♥ Would reccomend
6229	1	a	This game was totally worth the $0.99 when it was on sale. This game brought in future technology and mixed it in with dinosaurs. Its very cool becuase you get to fly around in a jetpack shooting dinosaurs in the face. I would rate this 7/10.
6231	1	a	is cool has big dinosaurs has flying dinosaurs has robos pew pew and lazer gunz pew
1881	0	a	no..... you still failed IT IS STILL A PRETTY BAD GAME Its not bad in graphic support but... THE DINOSAURS FTW????!!!! they glitch like s**t! and when the velociraptors stand still... the head is showing up 90° looks just like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ guy who saw an airplane for the first time but its not very bad... fix the glitches plz... then its 10/10
1882	0	a	DO NOT LISTEN TO THE LATEST PUBLICITY CAMPAIGN STATING THAT THIS IS A FIXED GAME. THIS IS POSSIBLY THE WORST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED. IT TAKES AGES TO GET INTO A GAME AND WHEN YOU DO YOU MAY AS WELL BE TRYING TO STICK LEGO TO CAT TURD. AWFUL
6233	1	a	Logged in didnt know what to expect so i just played a solo survival start mowing through dinos then all sudden trex appears and eats me 10/10 would become trex crap again
6235	1	a	Jesus christ ! Only a dollar ?! You guys need to increase the price :\
6237	1	a	Jetpacked to a mountain and watched them die    11/10 Would be a Traitor again
1884	0	a	You got caught stealing but instead of manning up and admitting you tried to play the victim.   You have managed to get a large majority of gamers to side with Activision, one of the most hated publishers...  BRAVO!  I hate activision as much the next guy, probably more, but you sir, is truly despicable and I am ashamed to have this bag of stolen assets in my game library.
1885	0	a	i would rather have my virtebrae remouved to suck my own ♥♥♥♥ then to pay $0.56 for this peice of ♥♥♥♥
6239	1	a	11/10
6241	1	a	*F+3* 'Where my dogs at man? Where my medic dogs at man?!'  10/10
6243	1	a	my honest review:  + the price! it's only 0,99€ if you like FPS by 1% u should 100% buy! + fun, fun, fun + just good ol' FPS Action - no story + basically the multiplayer game u wanted after Turok came out + a lot of upgrades to buy from credits you earn by shooting dinos (weapons, class upgrades, various gear, etc...) + Coop + lots of players play all the time + you can kill and play dinosaurs and also a T-Rex, and it's for a buck (in sale under a half buck!) SO WHAT THE F ARE U WAITING FO? TUROK?! + jetpacks + dinos + jetpacks &amp; dinos + jetpacks &amp; dinos for under a buck   - with graphics all on High the game doesn't look like in the videos - graphic is more than outdated - ingame communications?! (only a text chat, which looks worse than worse) - microtransactions for better gear not only cosmetics - not only the graphic also the gameplay mechanics are kinda outdated, for example the dino 'physics' are just 'not there' ^^ - basically no atmosphere -&gt; just action (i hoped for a little 'crouching-in-the-bushes-hunting-t-rex-creepy-atmosphere')
6245	1	a	♥♥♥♥♥♥ Optimization(for my pc anyway) but decent game.
1886	0	a	I spent 10$ gifting this to all my friends and it turns out to be free. 0/10 wouldnt gift again
6247	1	a	this game is good
1887	0	a	was fun till i ran into the halloween and christmass map and yelled 'NO!! I BOUGHT A KIDS GAME!!!'
1888	0	a	It runs like s@it it's boaring  and grapfics arend even that good
1889	0	a	Well..It's a cool game and very cheap tho,but i found alot of bugs like kicking me out of the game at the end of the match and loosing the xp i got. FIX IT PLEASE ! ALSO I SPENT A ♥♥♥♥ING DOLLAR ON IT NOW ITS FREE -.-
6249	1	a	Rolled away from a raptor and right into the T-Rex's mouth. Got eaten immediately and thrown across the map.   10/10
6251	1	a	this has been the best sence d dino day 
6253	1	a	Metacritic is wrong. Now with all the updates this game is a very cool horde game. It's very fun to play with friends.
1895	0	a	My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.' I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.
6255	1	a	For $0.89 this game is a solid choice for anyone looking for a game that is good to kill time also not P2W so thats a plus.
6257	1	a	I played this game so much that it didnt even start.
6259	1	a	I don't have this game and i can write a review for it so horray.
6261	1	a	If they could just smooth out some of the gameplay the way it is, the game itself would be fun. RIght now it's too clunky, gets very frustraiting in the higher level waves when you can't move appropriatly. Otherwise I'm looking forward to seeing how this game shapes up!
1901	0	a	Bad overall
1902	0	a	This game could've been amazing. It's not.
6263	1	a	Nice game me and my friends love it, good job developers!!!!
6265	1	a	If you don't have one or more buddys to play with, this may not be worth your dollar. But if you have people to play with, this game is actually really damn fun. I mean, yeah it's kind of trashy and after a while it will probably get too repetitive to play kind of 'actively' but it costs just a dollar. So if you have one or more co-op buddy/s, grab a dollar and enjoy the best game on Steam that you can get for this price.
6267	1	a	Got it about a year ago. Looked cool but never played it. Played this week because why not. Spent 31 minutes solo. Had more fun than playing fallout 4 last week.  10/10 would buy again.  #MakeDinosaursGreatAgain
1904	0	a	'Still Garbage'-Chrisg16  “Orion: Dino Horde, in it's current form, is one of the best co-operative games to play with your friends around. I strongly recommend you try this game at the next f2p session that is offered.  10 – Community Review   “It wasn't until recently that I bothered to try the revamped expansion/remake that is the current incarnation of the game and I have to say it has improved from what I would consider a 3.5 to an 8.  8 – Community Review   “The developers stuck with their first game. 14 months after the game's initial release, I played Orion. I love the game. I will probably put more hours into this game than I typically do with AAA games.  10 – Community Review
6269	1	a	This is one of the greatest multiplayer games to play on steam. I've been playing with my friends through skype for a few days now and it just keeps getting more addictive. It's made with the Unreal Engine so it's perfect :D. I will always love this game ;-;
6271	1	a	blew dinosaur bits everywhere with helicopter rockets, 9/10
6273	1	a	This is a really good game. Hitler approves.
6275	1	a	Went in with honestly not high hopes, totally blew my mind it was actually quite enjoyable, definetly gonna buy it
1906	0	a	i really gave this game a try.. expecially due to the high amount of positive reviews. But in the end.. i couldnt get a single game to actually work.  Its lagging that much, that the game is simply unplayable. The maps are poorly designed. The AI is ultra stupid. There is in ingame shop. The game feels unfinished in pretty much every aspect (engine, AI, maps, HUD, controls etc etc). Nothing is actually 'smooth'.  IMO the game is not even worth the 1$ it costs right now.
6277	1	a	No game is bad for a dollar
6279	1	a	This game is pretty underrated. I enjoyed this a lot more then I thought I would have with my friends. Best to play with friends so you can scream at each other when a TREX comes out of no where.
1908	0	a	really bad game
1909	0	a	I would not recommend you waste $1 on this game lol
6281	1	a	ok dude so the game is all like badly made lagy glitchy man but its a cool game like take on dinosours like call of duty but with dinosours and fels like planetside 2 lots of game modes nice laidback communty not to many kids but i gota diss this man cuase my pc specs arnt makeing this lag but im dissing it not cuse the lag just cuase despite the fact i came into this game and never once failed to kick ♥♥♥ therse one major drawback in this game i cant overlook in this review   POTHEADS VS DINOSOURS nothing aobut that should ever happen  it about a  7/10 due to poor quailty codeing and genral game build  for demonknight gameing and potheads everwhere this is X_Dk_Green_Jesus_  Note: Would Buy Again If It Becomes A Series Possably   * STONER APPROVED GAME *  REVIEW IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE DURING FURTHER GAMEPLAY
1912	0	a	Don't get I already had it, but its making me pay because of the update. DONT GET IT ITS BS
1913	0	a	Hahaha, this is hilariously bad. I mean for a game it's lacking so much. It feels more like a mod that is still deep in beta. The ratings are pretty accurate here. I won't say that you'd be hurting too much getting this for $1.00 but I don't recommend getting this for it's full $15 price. It was atleast humurous to play but I don't think I'd be getting in it again anytime soon.   Revelations 2012/ Bioshock infinite
1914	0	a	This game is worth the 99 cents I paid for it. The graphics are alright not great but not crappy either but the gameplay is really laggy, slow and feels overall not good. The game really isn't even that fun you just walk around and shoot at things that run at you and its not even hard. Overall I would not reccomend this game I only bought it because it was 99 cents.
6283	1	a	If you think that there are dinosaurs in battlefield then this game is for you
1916	0	a	I bought this game on a whim. That and it was 1 dollar. I managed to play enough to fulfill that 1 dollar but at face value it would not be worth it.  Why? For a game that is supposed to gone from a 3 to an 8 it feels like there are still numerous issues that have yet to be dealt with. For one, the issue with trying to join in a server and it doesn't work. There are times when joining a server crashes the game altogether.  Gameplay-wise I find that being eaten by a large dinosaur is a bit redundant due to the fact that you have a gun. Seriously, get eaten, blow the dinosaur's insides out with bullets or go kamikazi with a grenade and BAM! dead dinosaur. But the game says that's impossible.  Music is okay, can't complain about that.  Announcer voice seems to be a bit funky here and there when trying to announce things but otherwise not worth adding or removing points.  Overall, it's an okay game if you buy it bargain-bin(Around $0.99) but as a full game there are better games out there. 7/10.
6285	1	a	Great game, don't be put off by the metacritic score. It's fast-paced, loads of fun and does a good job of tying RPG-style progression into a sandbox FPS shooter. Vehicles were fun too. Absolute carnage with sci-fi and dinosaurs, you can't go wrong.
6287	1	a	best 99 cents i have spent :)  good game! love how u can customise your character. when you play solo maybe 2 or 3 bots to help out could be good. but whateves. fun game ! awesome idea for a game hehe !
6289	1	a	This game is really cool and it is being updated constantly and soon they will be making a whole new better version of these game in replacement of this which will be cool. It is totally worth the price and expecially now since it is $1. Only problem i see in this game is the lack of open servers and some weird animations with taunts and walking, having your torso move and not your uper body, but that doesnt impact the game at all.
1920	0	a	This Is The Worst Co-Op Game I've Ever Played.
6291	1	a	Halo totally ripped off of this masterpiece of a game, sad to see sell outs these days. Play the original FPS Orion: Dino Horde today 10/10 must buy
1921	0	a	No manual, no tutorial. Even a mouse-like dinosuar could take you down, (before you find it).
1922	0	a	This is an unfinished game. The animations for characters, player view models, and dinosaurs are lazily done. For instance, the pistol equip animation doesn't sync with the pistol itself; the pistol will be in idle position a good half-second before the hands are fully out there. The gameplay is shallow, since it's basically 'kill dinosaurs with no real impact with their attacks' then 'buy one upgrade' and rinse, repeat.
6293	1	a	This game is fun if you like killing dinosaurs and the game kinda reminds me of halo with dinosaurs the metascore is off.
6295	1	a	this is rellay cool
1924	0	a	So i recently come upon this game think 'Holy crap im going to be able to like rpe some fckin dinosaurs. So I had to make a choice to rather get food for my family, or play as motherfckin dinosaurs and let my family play a couple times. So I decided to buy Orion Dino Horde. At first I was like, holy fricken jesus look at the small dinosaurs that just horde the generator, screw orion dino horde, it should be dinosaurs like to orion the generator with a horde. While I play, I let my friend Anne Frank play for a while, she said 'lulz i gve it 0/7, bt il be bck, im goin to gt baked' so i assumed she ment going to the sauna because that game was amazingly optimized but instead she climbed in the oven and left me a note saying 'lulz, il nver be an mlg orion dino horde player lik u'. I said aw, you really think im that good? Of course she didn't respond because the game was sooo good it made her kill herself. So then I thought, if im really that good, ill need other people to tell me that. So I got a buddy of mine named Lorenzo who was healthy and young. After he was done he said 'lulz hld on polp, i ned to seee mi parnts bcuse lulz' I was so confused so I waited and a week later I go to his house and hes all 'U DID DIS TOO ME' and I ran and talked to Lorenzos dad and he said, 'lulz dat fagot got ALD from somedinhg clled Dino Beatdown'. I got really scared and left. 2 years later i go back to his house and he is now hooked to a respirator and a suculant incubator. Thats when I realized something, that game gave him ALD. So I let him play it one more time for good old times and he said '.-.. ..- .-.. --.. / ..-. .- --. --- - / ---.. -..-. ---..' thats in morse code, so that means 'lulz fagot 8/8'. I really couldn't believe how Mlg I was at this game. But then that made me think, one person who played this game killed herself, and the other onee got ALD from it and only enjoyed it when he was paralyzed, blind, deaf, and could only move his hands. So finally, my review on this game is that you rather have to be MLG like me John Motherphockin Sorcerer Polp, or you die and get ALD from it. It was worth buying this game then giving my family food. Lulz i give this game 1/8, would not get noscoped by dinosaurs again.
6297	1	a	One of the best multiplayer experience I've ever had.
6299	1	a	Great game for only $0.99
6301	1	a	For $ .99 This is Worth the Buy!
6303	1	a	Great game, but a bit pricy
1926	0	a	.
6305	1	a	cheap but verry good
6307	1	a	It is the coolest games. It is like a advanced version of Primal Carnage although I still like Primal Carnage
6309	1	a	this game gave me the biggest dino boner must have
6311	1	a	Me and this game; #Besties.
1927	0	a	Sucks... Fun but gets boring
6313	1	a	Got headbutted by a T-Rex so hard that my Tank exploded. As I flew through the air dead I picked off another Dino, came back to life, and jetpacked up shotgunning Pterodactyls as I flew up. I then got mauled to death by a pack of Tiny Dinos that I couldn't hit. My only hope is that Jurrassic Park 4 is as good as this game.  TLDR;  10/10 would cause Extinction again
6315	1	a	Dont listen to anyone who thinks this game is garbage, this is the best indie game out there
6317	1	a	THIS GAME IS THE SHIIIIIIT  GO BUY IT NOW ITS WORTH YOUR MONEY, IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME GO PLAY THE FREE TRIAL
6319	1	a	Amazing, amazing, totally worth it! Great graphics ( I dont think the critics like shooters anyways!) Lots of weapons, intense, and lots of combat action. With the control of 10 dinosaurs and 3 humans with hundreds of skins and dressups. It makes it even better, it's a pure action game.   'Crushing thriller, action game!'
6321	1	a	This game is awesome relatively fun while disregarding it's initial Metascore. It's very simple as in repairing your power generator and securing an objective but hell you get to kill dinosaurs with Mech's and air ships that can literally kill anything at a moderate speed.  Although it can be repetitive more often than not but it's well worth the $.99 buy.  7/10
6323	1	a	Great game. It's alot of fun, and it looks great. The combat is fluent, and overall the animations hold up, though some are a bt wonky. A bit of warning ahead of time: It runs like ♥♥♥ on lower-end computers, so you might have to sacrafice some graphical settings it you don't have the best P.C.
6325	1	a	much improved dont read into older scores, the game was redone.
6327	1	a	Great fun for fps/sci-fi game lovers, very addictive, lots of stuff to it :) and giant triceratops :D To sum it all up its basically killing floor with dinosaurs
6329	1	a	You can pistol-whip a Stegosaurus, would recommend.
1928	0	a	It's killing floor, with dinosaurs.
1929	0	a	i bought the game and now i don't have it anymore WTF
6331	1	a	its fun but it keep's crashing when i try to get on a sever but i love this game reyminds me of a game i played whith my dad a long time ago  
6333	1	a	Fun with friends
6335	1	a	This game is so bad its good... but only when the sale is 90% or better.
6337	1	a	Totally worth $1.50 Developers really polished up this game well.
6339	1	a	Great game with friends, 10/10 would recommend, it never gets old shooting velociraptors and triceratops' into oblivion.
6341	1	a	Does everyone own this game or something?
6343	1	a	Nice game with low price :)  8/10, I like mp mode cause it funny if play with friends. Using bazooka and K-Boom xD
6345	1	a	sooo worth it if u have a friend to play whit its just rly awsome game i strongly recomend it :D
6347	1	a	This is a really fun game. Its a wave based FPS that has you and other players shooting Dinosaurs. You don't really get to see that in a game formated like this. The weapon selection is good and the controls work fine, however if you are on a lower end or dying PC you may have to turn the graphics down by a significant ammount. Not to meantion that no one really plays this game! Its only $0.99. This game is well worth your time and could use support for servers. This game gets an 8/10
6349	1	a	When ever those ♥♥♥♥ing gigantic titan Dinos are like right on you and suddently in your face it juts makes me freak the ♥♥♥♥ out and i start shaking and ♥♥♥♥ O_O
6351	1	a	If you like dinosaurs, you will love this game. With a few friends this game is a blast!   AND YOU CAN PLAY AS A MEGASUPERAWESOME DINOSAUR!!    
6353	1	a	never played it but it let me do this
1931	0	a	its sad that ppl are acutally create this games  bad Graphics No alot of guns  I aucttaly think that its no worth 1 $ its should be Free to play dont waste 1 $ for it i no like it!
6355	1	a	It's like Skyrim without dragons plus dino's and guns! 8/8 m8
1933	0	a	You could actually have more fun just going to the restroom
1934	0	a	played the game fo about 2 hours get bored cant get my money back tried to refund cant get the refund cuz of 20 minutes to much damn this game my money real good
1935	0	a	I bought this game on my laptop and it ran fine on the lowest settings and now I have a pc, And putting the game on low to med settings it will still lag, I dont understand this, on my laptop I have a gefirce 610m 2GB and on my pc I have a GTX 750ti which is far supirior, I would like to recomend this game but it runs like ♥♥♥♥, well the way it is optimized.] Apart from the graphics the gameplay is alot of fun, no servers but solo is alot of fun with bots. I can tell it is sort of like halo and dinosausrs together.  The controller mapping works great, not sure about keyboard. (didnt try) Overall I would not recomend as it runs very porly so unless this is fixed I cant recomend.
1936	0	a	Is there any way I can refund this game? It's WAY too laggy
6357	1	a	I have had more fun with this game than I have most budget titles, highly reccomend
1937	0	a	I bought the game for my 'team' ( 3 very close people), and we heavy relly on coop, but this was like a time-travel; this is was a a great game, for a game dated about 20 years ago.  I know, it cost like a bus ticket, but it was an awfull hipster trip.
1938	0	a	I'm sorry.   I know it's only a buck.   But it is not very enjoyable.   Especially when there are free games that are more fun. Seriously.   I gave it a shot.   Cost me a buck.   But I don't think this was worth the download.   Sorry.
1939	0	a	I could have spent the one euro on a coke or something. I knew this was bad, but this game puts the word bad in a new dimension of bad. Like shaving your beard with a kitchenknife kinda bad. This game hurts right in my feels. But I was stupid enough to even buy it to begin with.
6359	1	a	One of the absolute worst game I have ever played. Missing animations all over the place, and those that aren't are stiff as hell. Taht being said, I payed $0.99 for this, and I have had so much fun making fun of it and laughing with my friend. Great concept, horrible execution.
1940	0	a	I didn't want to buy this game...  ...but hey it was 99 cents!
6361	1	a	for a 1$ its worth it , i have fun with this as much as i do with killing floor. 'which is a time waster game when your bored' this isnt a game you play for 4 hour straight , but a hour of fun once and a while is fine, just like killing floor
6363	1	a	ORION: Prelude in one word is Nazi Zombies (from Call of Duty) with Dinosaurs! What could get more awesome than that! The game builds off the (slightly overused) you are doomed! Make a last stand and survive as long as you can kind of thing. You start with nothing but a pistol and your class ability and as you kill dinosaurs you earn credits which can be used to purchase weapons and augments which upgrade your character! (Sounds familiar, right?)   The game also features versus modes but because of how few people play versus I was never able to find a game to join which means I am therefore unable to review the versus and will not be including it in my final score.  A major thing to point out is that the game is full of bugs, I often found myself being headbutted by a dinosaur before being sent flying over half a kilometre, then face first into a rocky cliff and I would penetrate the wall and be stuck inside the cliff. Another common bug for me was driving through any sort of water in a a vehicle, and I would fall under the map, unable to move and forever falling I had to quit out of several matches because of this.   Final Score = 7.5/10 
6365	1	a	Experts have suggested that staying home and playing Orion:Prelude keeps you safe from the two contained Americans with Ebola in the United States. It's also proven to keep you away from actual threats, like the flu, ad Mormons.  Stay safe, play games, and only go outside when there are hardly any people around, because human contact is the major killer.
1942	0	a	this gamne is terrible it has a bugg that makes it unplayable where you spin uncotrolably
1943	0	a	There is only one time when you play a game for the first time. This game seems to not understand that.
1944	0	a	Tried for a solid 20 minutes to join a game. Got jack ♥♥♥♥.  Broken game, don't buy.
1945	0	a	Don't be misled by the other reviews, this game is an unfinished piece of garbage. This 'game' is exactly the same as Dino Beatdown, and makes no attempt to hide it, as it still goes under the same name in the game files. The game itself looks absolutely nothing like a 2012 release, with shoddy textures, extremely low-polycount models and very natural selection type gameplay. As if it couldn't get any worse, the game also features a cosmetics shop, stocked with low-effort reskins and glaringly bright armour colours.  Overall verdict: This game is ♥♥♥♥. If you want giant monsters, strategy and sci-fi themes, go play Natural Selection 2. I'm glad I saved myself 99p by playing it free.
6367	1	a	It's really fun with friends, but pretty boring alone. Lots of stuff you have to pay for but overall great game for $1.
1947	0	a	6/10 I'll play it only when friends are playing and I'm glad I only paid 99 cents. Really weird collision detection, hitboxes, dinos can do a zero G turn like a snapper lawn mower, game crashed on my first launch, and I've encountered several bugs during my first few hours. One bug being people were freely able to join into my 'Friends Only' game. Still fun to play with friends.
1948	0	a	It is pretty funny, I'll give it that.
6369	1	a	EDIT:  So far, Orion: Prelude has not been that laggy. The menu is still a little sluggish, but the game seems to run fine. I will probably re-start playing this now.  Old review: It's a fun game. It can get kinda laggy for me sometimes, but it's not that bad and you get used to it.
6371	1	a	Hey, this is a really good game.
6373	1	a	Looking Forward to more Improvments. Cool Game. Good cheap fun, best with friends.
6375	1	a	This game is fun to play with friends, and in summary I give it a 7.5/10. The only game-breaking thing I've encountered are the two most annoying enemies in video game history. Spitting dinosaurs that take forever to kill, and pterodactyls similar to rakks in Borderlands, but can grab you and 1-hit KO you. Buy this on a sale, not for full price.  ==============EDIT 4/1/15============== They fixed the annoying enemies (birds are still annoying when in the helicopter, but that's understandable), and generally made the game much better! They give you $20 of credit to customize your character at the start, which is great. The game looks and feels much better since I've last played it. Servers are a tiny bit glitchy but not too glitchy to become annoying.  9/10 great fun with friends.
6377	1	a	meh. It isnt the most fun game I have ever played but it defently wasnt the worst. The gameplay is pretty straight forward (shoot anything that moves) but that isnt a bad thing. Its simple easy gameplay that can be picked up in a second. Thats what I like about this game....Now for the bad....not much I can find so far except the combat (even though I do like the simplicity) gets dull and boreing to me atleats after a while. Aim, click and shoot and thats the game. Id give it a solid 7.9 out of 10
1950	0	a	I've got it 2012 for 10€... Yeah, I'd like a hug right now. :'(  Oh? My hours played? Yea. my steam bugged all the day, and back in 2012 the game didn't wanted to be closed. I mean, steam thought the game was open and counted the hours.  If you ever wanted to buy this game, do not. Spend that 1,00 for whatever you like. Some candys whatever. Get something food or water for it, idc, BUT, do something usefull with it.  You can thank me later. Cya
1951	0	a	Not worth a dollar Gameplay is boring Guns don't recoil properly all around a pretty lame game
1952	0	a	{This is for mac players} Its fun i tried it but it aint mac supported....
1953	0	a	A good try at a game but it falls short in most areas. The combat is iffy and the controls feel weird. The concepts are all there but it is just missing something. It has many multiplayer aspects which can be fun but all fall short of amazing.  Personal Rating: 4/10
1954	0	a	This game is absolute ♥♥♥♥. The sounds, AI, and overall the total game is really bad. The AI just runs in circles, along the main route, or just straight at you until it kills you.  I've asked so many times for a refund, and been ignored every time. When I bought this, I noticed that none of my friends have played longer than ~1 hour. Now I see why.  Please, just don't buy it. It's really awful.
1955	0	a	Got a weapon, dinosaur ate my brains out. I thought my life over for a few hours after that.
6379	1	a	A fun game to play with friends!
6381	1	a	How to play this game: 1:Start the game. 2:Try to join an online lobby 3:Fail 4:Start single player 5:Shoot Dinosaurs 6:Buy new ♥♥♥♥ 7:Get bored after 3-4 games 8:Pick it up again when you're bored just to have some quick fun, and waste some time 9:Repeat Did I mention it only costs a dollar?
6383	1	a	Its Halo and Borderlands in a nutshell
1957	0	a	jumped on a car and got launched across the map
6385	1	a	FIrst spawn, run to a chopper looking thingy and proceed to shoot a T-Rex with missles while everyone on the ground gets eaten... my $1 was well spent in the first 2 minutes alone!
6387	1	a	this cost me 99cents i bought ark for thirty bucks this one for a buck minus a cent is more fun i love people because Jesus loves me
6389	1	a	Its Awesome primal rampage
1959	0	a	Did not really dig this game as much as I thought I would. Did not play well, bad clips all over and not very visually pleasing either.
1960	0	a	No dont get this game this is a wast of time and money this game will not let you play it and worst game ever in history and never should have been invented in the first place screw this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1961	0	a	Quite stupid. It could have had much more variety.
6391	1	a	not bad game but i dont know why its little lagy for me maybe my pc suck,dunno. 3 words- BUY THE GAME (if you are nolifer)
6393	1	a	- Every map is the same except for different tree placements - There is no variety in weapons - Night maps ARENT AT NIGHT - Enemies spawn in between waves - The UI is painfully bad  11/10 Would reccomend.
6395	1	a	Only played for a few seconds, already better than Ark Survivor 10/10 ;)
1962	0	a	runs badly on windows 7 (i got windows 8 still laggy)
6397	1	a	Easily one of the best games ever made, hands down
6399	1	a	not bad at all.
1963	0	a	Intersting concept, but not very polished.
1964	0	a	its super slow to connect to servers, even EA's servers are way better tha this game's servers. (i have good internet)
6401	1	a	Truly stunning. Great game I deffentaly suggest it. Worth the money
1965	0	a	Really bad attempt to make a decent 'horde' mode game which is all this game has to offer with graphics from the 90's.
1966	0	a	Buggs And Bad Graphics !
1967	0	a	garbage game, not worth 99cents
6403	1	a	But ♥♥♥♥, it was 99 cents.
1970	0	a	I played it for 30 minutes it was okay glitchy but okay, later I turned the game off and now as soon as I start the game it won't boot it just stays running and now I can't get my refund :)
6405	1	a	Yes it's worth 1 dollar.
1971	0	a	
6407	1	a	Lot of fun with friends 8.5/10
6409	1	a	really good game. it helps alot of people. it helped amanda todd find bleach. (the anime)
6411	1	a	A fun game to play. Doesn't need crazy skills but teamwork is indeed needed sometimes. Has interesting game modes with most of the games on the edge. Plus is not expensive and can run on every pc.
1974	0	a	is a bs game was tricked into buying the game. it was on sale for a dollar when the main price was 15.99 so i was like cool what a deal bought the four pack and the next day it was 1.99 all the time, would never have bought this game if it would have been a dollar all the time was looking forward it being 15.99 so i could trade it on cs lounge or use it to my advantagfe at a later date but the game bombed and was a scam as soon as it was put to 1.99.
6413	1	a	Oh come on a stupid dollar game probably pixel is taunting me to play it. Dang just had to buy it not even knowing what it was. ok lets boot it up ok and BOOOOMMMM thats when it changed my mind! Epic Game for a dollar get it and you will have fun!
1975	0	a	i cant open lobby why help pleas 
1976	0	a	Yeah 0,99€ Is still to much for this shity game!
1977	0	a	To be honest this game is good when it is known as ORION: DINO ( open beta ) but now after its open beta , the graphics of the game is totally like ♥♥♥♥ and lag much more worst if you are connecting to europe server
6415	1	a	BUY THIS GAME! Its always cheap enough that you always get your moneys worth and more! i had 13 hours of fun in 2 days and kind of got bored. BUT! Its a great game!
1979	0	a	1. Pull up options, cuz my computer's a potato. 2. Disable a majority of video settings 3. Set quality to low. 4. Try to play. 5. All I see is white 6. Reset settings. 7. Click Save 8. Crashed.  1.69/10
1980	0	a	uhhh. dafuq is this halo/cod zombie remake?
6417	1	a	Buy it now for Free 99
6419	1	a	Get 30 fps with a gaming laptop, kden
1981	0	a	Yellow its me    So pretty much this game is so bad its good. I had wanted to purchase it before when it wasnt f2p but when it came out i was psyched. I played this for 40 mins and had to stop because it couldnt connect to server. Its addicting in a weird type of way. Its pretty good besides the fact that it lags when i have an i7 and nvidia gtx 960 so yeah...        bai      r8 5/8
1982	0	a	Audio clips for the guns and everything sound terrible or sound like they've been ripped from another game, graphics look like dog ♥♥♥♥. Glad I didnt pay 99 cents because it wasnt worth it. 0.1/10
6421	1	a	still 10/10 for 50 cents
1983	0	a	Give me my euro back!
1984	0	a	TL;DR: Fun for the first hour or two, but was controversial, and is unoptimized, even after more than 3 years of development.  So this game has been the subject of plenty of controversy for over 3 years. Released multiple times with different names such as Orion: Dino Beatdown and Orion: Dino Horde. Then it was also part of another controversy as far as theft of assets. But let's get off that and into the actual game.  You basically survive wave after wave of killing dinosaurs, while completing the occasional objective or two as the match goes on. You can do this on your own, but it's usually more fun to play with people. It's rather fun, if you like having no challenge, as dinosaurs can easily be unable to get to spots on many of the maps, making it easy to exploit them. This is because of how easy it is to get to some places with the Assault's jetpack, but even then, you wouldn't have too many issues with the normal dinos if you were another class, due to how horrid the AI is. The flying dinosaurs are hardly any issue either, as they don't take too much to kill. This effectively drives any fun in the game extinct unless you like potshotting giant reptiles.  I had some fun with this game, worth the 1 dollar I spent on it, but to be quite honest, I have no faith in the devs at this point, and I doubt this game is going to become much better at all, as much of an unoptimized mess that it is.  But hey, now you can kill derp dinos for free.  You'll get some fun out of it, but don't expect too much more than what you get in perhaps the first hour or two of playing.
6423	1	a	WOW. Value for money is an understatement for this game. This game is worth about £12/$15 or maybe more but you can get it for £0.79/$1 or less (during sales) Also 15 DIFFERENT gamemodes !!!!!! What!!!!!!! For $1 !!!!! Oh my!!!!!!! Bottom line is definitely worth it. Trust me.  UPDATE: Now free to play, where's my money
6425	1	a	Very good game, I bought it years ago, it went Free to Play, I don't mind, really, if it didn't I would never have played it again with friends, so here's a summary of good and bad things about it.   The good :  + Lots of skills + Lots of different weapons to choose from + Really fun and all +   MOTHERF*CKING DINOSAURS   + The addition of PvP with playable dinosaur was a god damn great idea + Different classes with very different styles available + Runs greatly on every PC ever, really, if it doesn't work blame your PC and moreover what you installed on it   The bad : - I do not understand Melee :C - What the actual ♥♥♥♥ is going on ? - OH MY GOD IT'S A ♥♥♥♥ING T-REX !  Welp, that's it, I don't have much to say about it, see you later on Orion ! :3
6427	1	a	I play this game is not to good but funn if i bored that i is when i don t' do. and i say this too hunk da trunk and right this for da good! so that you see this and tink that this game is good-becus it are fgood for the price it has on the game you buy for little price and when i say that i meen this game and not otehr game becaus i tell yo u its good forr only its price not more because it need mor to doo. i am not scuuby so me dont solv this case easy like them crew that he in so i only say this from my heart and brain not from sience or other sorcec like math, and otter stuff like cemistry and other that i think not of now that. i only whant to say this for not longningn this review forr too lon....
6429	1	a	Great F2P Game.
6431	1	a	It's free now so cool but i spent like $0.75 a few months ago.  Good game, but yeah like i need money (that bad i know) so i refunded it yeah cool
6433	1	a	Dragons and cool ♥♥♥♥. Never played tho
6435	1	a	I enjoyed it when it was a free game for a while then it ran out of its freeness and i realy want it so if someone would be generous to gift me this game then that would be amazing! I do understand its only one dollar but steam is being glitchy and wont let me get it.
6437	1	a	I never wanted to kill dinosaurs with a bow and arrow. Until now.
6439	1	a	At time of writing this i only have 2.7 hrs of gameplay, but that was with my friends, i bought it for all of them and we had an awesome session. the graphics are good, the gameplay is daft but fun, and quite frankly unlike almost every other recent review, i dont care if some of the assets were stolen or not, it looks good, plays good!  Well done DEV, keep up the good work!  Try it, its cheap, in fact get the 4 pack, and have fun with your mates, you wont regret it!
6441	1	a	This game is amazing fun. If you enjoy action games and dinosaurs. Then this game is for you! The fighting is just non stop and although the re-spawn times are quite long the game is still really enjoyable!  I recommend this game!
6443	1	a	Prelude sounds like Pre-lube, hilarious and brilliant. 10/10
6445	1	a	It's like being a kid in the 90's that's playing with thier toys. Cheap plastic figures that are a blast to play with. And online is still alive.  dinosaurs remain......dinosaurs remain........  good times.  I understand that a game can't be for everyone, and if you feel like you wasted a dollar so be it (waah-waah). But those that got this for free and complain about it, stfu....make a better game....and send it to me for free. Then you can show the obvious imperfections of this game and how to make them better while still being a fun game. K? thnx ;)
6447	1	a	Not bad of a game. I actually had a ton of fun playing this with my friends. Hopefully some nice updates come out fixing a few bugs, and updating some sounds and effects to make it look even better.
6449	1	a	Omyyygawwshhhh! Super Duper Omega addictive! It's fun, Kewlll, worth the price considering it only cost 3 bucks!
6451	1	a	This game is stupid fun, lots of maps, gamemodes, etc. Driving in a buggy running from a T-Rex while your buddy shoots at it with a turret? Nuff said Definitely worth the asking price of $14.99
1990	0	a	Cancer.
6453	1	a	Good/Bad All I can say. There are pros and cons. Mechanics are ok. Graphics could use some work. Game needs to include a better chat system as well as an in game speach system. Overall it is fun. I recommend the lightsaber duels. :)
6455	1	a	did you guys take down all the multiplayer? i cant find any servers, and i cant host my own
1993	0	a	  Is this game 0,99 cents? This game should have been free, or even better you should be paid 0,99 cents for each minute you play in this mind numbing game. I played for 50 minutes and i feel like throwing up. The driving is awful and the weapons seem to go right through your hand. The only positive aspect of this game is that it made me rethink my life choices. I rate it a solid 2/10.
1994	0	a	very boring dont buy it
6457	1	a	The game is, ok. Its cool for about 5-10 hours then it gets old. If you like short, cheesey, repetitive games then u will love this game.
6459	1	a	Sell some crappy CSGO skins and get this game already. Super fun for the cost!
6461	1	a	So, I beat suvival mode by myself with out the useless bots with the starting pistol... this game is broken but worth the 99 cents because it is hours of laughter. GLITCHY DINO MURDER FEST!
6463	1	a	true aids, but good for $1.00
1997	0	a	played again after a year break. game is still empty of players.
6465	1	a	Length of Time Played: 26 minutes Distance Played: Not even 1 game Achievements: None Personal Grade: B+  Opinion of each aspect  Grading System - Based on a five-point rating system (5 = Outstanding, 4 = Good, 3 = Average, 2 = Poor, 1 = Awful)  Gameplay: 4/5 Stability: 5/5 Story: 3/5 Controls: 5/5 Graphics: 5/5 Music: 5/5 Sounds: 5/5 Difficulty: 4/5  Probably would have been an epic first-person shooter, IF my computer wasn't so laggy. I could hardly run it on LOW settings. I recommend this game if you have a beefy computer.
1998	0	a	I paid 1$ for this game. Actual money.  Its being updated pretty frequently but in its current state, I should have bought some ice cream instead.
6467	1	a	I want this game to be free to play pay to win. Then I would play and eventually buy stuff espially if you only start with one class and can level to get new ones or by them with real money.
6469	1	a	SO glad I bought the 4 pack... It is simple, which is all the better for just getting some battle in. However, it is tons of unpretentious fun, none of the blah, blah bits that I usually just want to click through as fast as possible to PLAY (could use some tutorial snippets, though, still haven't figured out what the hack/decker looking thing is about). It's all about the action.   I didn't get into the Halo types of games much, could play for a bit, but, don't need or even really want the big drama story, and it is pretty much the same thing over and over - we're getting attacked, kill the funk out of all attackers, and try not to die too much in the process. This one, we played for 7 hours straight right after buying, and will do again with more friends. The achievements are amusing also, although I am apprehensive about actually acquiring all... it certainly feels like an accomplishment when you kill a T-Rex without assist.   I do wish that the 360 style controller had the mic button (maybe if it was among the programmable options?), that's what I use because I'm used to it, and taking a hand off to press left ALT is not really feasible... But, as the only real complaint in a $1 game, that's pretty impressive.
6471	1	a	This game has a ton of poetential. Its cool, Great physics, easy-to-handle guns, and a good concept, there are bugs and glitches, but what game doesn't have those. Give the game time, and it will grow more and more like it has in the past couple years.
6473	1	a	This is a great underrated fps you should definitely buy it and play it woth friends!
2000	0	a	I'd like to say I recommend the game because I used to love it. But it won't launch for me, this is an issue I also have with Smite so I think it's my graphics card, for the 2 it says it launched as 32bit dx9. That's all I know about the issue. I'd love if this could get fixed because it's a really fun game but I can't actually play it! Edit - Game works on new computer, still a bit boring, gameplay is limited.
6475	1	a	Best nonsensical game of all time?
6477	1	a	  This game is better then the 2end game  and it's fun with friends!!!
2002	0	a	This is literally the worst game I have ever played. Not even worth the download time for its free weekend.
2003	0	a	This game has poor gunplay ,the dinosaurs take almost random amounts of damage, the characters dont start with anything more then a pistol and you have to buy all other guns,When you die you go into a second wind style mode which would be good save for the fact that when you go into this mode ALL OF THE DINOSAURS RUN AWAY FROM YOU makeing it nearly imposable to respawn unless its the start of a new wave. If you wanted m to play a horde shooter i recomend killing floor or if you want a game where you can kill dinosaur-like creatures borderlands 2 also has better gunplay
6479	1	a	I paid 1 $ for it and i still wish i hadnt. It looks fun but when you play it it just sucks. One good thing is its not as bad as COD Ghosts. Get a game like Dark Souls, CS:GO, Borderlands 2 , or even the Stanley Parable is better. 4.5/10
6481	1	a	PLAY FOR TREX ♥♥♥
2004	0	a	Ai is awful, the dinosaurs get stuck on walls. the graphics are on par with an xbox game (no, not a 360, before that) circa red faction 2 era. for all its supposed to tout, the videos make the game look 10 times better. save your dollar. this simply is NOT worth it. even if they give it away for free, still not worth it. so many other interesting games you could play, even free ones. this game is flat, boring and brings NOTHING new to an FPS genre. this game will make you think of what a freshman high school student would show as a computer science project. if you think i feel hurt, i am. i didnt even buy this crap. my friend gave it to me and asked me to play with him. so we did. controls are clunky, and every gun and aspect of this game is nothing but regurgitated crap you have already played many times. this should have just been an extra piece of content in a real game. sort of like how they added 'Zombies' to Call of Duty. dont get me wrong though, CoD sucks too.
2005	0	a	Worst game ever it's a wasting of money. Don't buy it.
2006	0	a	it mite be my pc but the gaem is 2 laggy
6483	1	a	this is a fun addictive shooter with a call of duty zombies and a halo feel. It is definately a must buy because it is only 75p
6485	1	a	This is a great game for dino lovers or people who just want a new kind of FPS.
2008	0	a	I wanted it to be good, but it's clunky, awful looking, cheaply made and not very fun.
6487	1	a	Charming
6489	1	a	Still better than GMod.
2012	0	a	I tried it, I didn't like it. It has... it's... ... I DIDN'T LIKE IT, BUT IT WAS NOT BAD. Just not my cup of tea. Maybe it just didn't make sense to me... or not creative at all? Whatever it is... I'll pass.
6491	1	a	Good for a laugh, and some FUNNY DINOSAURS, that aside, running things over is VERY fun....erm,Yeah, just...there is no ingame selfie option, big minus, and workshop support :() OH NO, NO WORKSHOP! LOL. its very fun sometimes though, very fun.Extremely fun, Duper Super fun. oh, wait, HOW CAN A PTERODACTYLS TEETH EVEN SCRATCH A FUTURISTIC HUGE MASSIVE HELICOPTER!?!?!?
6493	1	a	BEST GAME EVER!Graphics are very good,you can even play the game with an older computer,it works just fine! It's worth the 2 euro i paid for it! And ooh,be carefull it is highly addictive! :DDD
6495	1	a	The best game, I love it. It has it all, 10/10!! Get it, it is worth it.
2017	0	a	this game always crashes
2018	0	a	Biggest pile of.....  Yeah its a cheap game, but ive played played much better free to play games than this trollip. 6 attempts to try and connect to a game, when i finally did game was laggy as anything, internet connection is fine, and running a gtx960 which is more than enough to play this game.  Dont waste your money on this, only worth it for the 6 free badge cards, which if you sell will pay for the game itself.
6497	1	a	this game is the sh*t, buy it now
6499	1	a	This game's amazing. The graphics are good and the style as well. Love it.
6501	1	a	this game suck balls
6503	1	a	I agree with basically everything everyone has saying, the game started out shaky, albeit i still had fun playing it, but Much added content and updates its unreal how much has been added. I vote 7-8 game play, 10/10 for developer, basically showing they care.
2019	0	a	Its free now...thats how ♥♥♥♥ it is
6505	1	a	Bought it on sale for 1 dollar basically. I think this game deserves more credit but...BUT that constant running back and forth between the point you have to protect and the weapon station is a hugeeee pain. Even if you use the teleporter or use vehicle. It's still a hugeeee pain. There's no incenditive for people to play medics because they don't have rocket boost jet, their medic gun needs charge every now and then, and on top of that, the dino seem to be programmed to go after medics. Plus medic doesn't get as much credit as these other units so what the heck, who wants to play medic -.-  anyways, despite that, for 1 dollar, definitely get it. The server system are unstable and there are still bugs that freeze the screen but for 1 dollar, you can't complain. :)
6507	1	a	IT'S NICE GAME
6509	1	a	The blood, sweat and tears put into the creation of this BRAND NEW sequel is true dedication from the best of the best developers...   But the fact it's so ♥♥♥♥ makes it fun!
6511	1	a	I would recommend this game for anyone on a budget whom needs a fun game to last them a while. It's really just a fun, relaxing kill'em all type of game.  Can't go wrong for a Dollar!
6513	1	a	I've never seen such a complete failure of a game turn out to be such a great gameplay treat. It may have taken a near complete rebuild, and it still needs more weapons and such, but damn it's a lot of fun......now anyway.
6515	1	a	I'm Not seen the System Requirements of this 1 dollar game Goddammit,.. I never thought this game Will be like Call of duty System Requirements
6517	1	a	this game is totally awesome i reccomend it for true gamers!!!!!
6519	1	a	I WANT IT
2032	0	a	I thinkt the fact that the creator had to use Imovie to make the trailer says alot about this games budget
6521	1	a	The dino's creep out of no where and just destroy you...  What a game...  Got the four pack for 0.79...  8.5/10 IGM
2033	0	a	This is how you steal assets from another game and claim that assets as yours.  Good way to reduce production money and time.
6523	1	a	Kill Dinos HAHA but overal I really enjoy this game
2034	0	a	I couldn't get the game to work. My beast machine couldn't handle Orion Dino horde.
6525	1	a	Be a Espinosaur and eat your friends     10/10
6527	1	a	I think that ORION: Dino Horde is a pretty decent game with a lot of awesome features. There are a plethora (huge variety) of weapons that can only be found here. The graphics are awesome, though it slows down my computer a bit, but that all changes in the options which make the ORION experience worth every cent.
6529	1	a	Love this game. Buyed it like an year ago, idk why i write this now, but it's just amazing.If you hate dinos and love Halo, this is the game for you.
6531	1	a	This game Good but I want more Vehicles  
6533	1	a	I do recommend this NOW. But I do feel bad for the people dat pay for this since many of em really wasted their money and on other games even tho its .99 the devs really just want ur money and then make it F2P to rip em off. I recommend this game just for fun nothing else nothing more. since this game is actually pretty fun and I enjoyed it. I would NEVER pay for any of their games tho since i saw many MANY negative reviews to not make me pay for ANY of em. If u play with friends u will have fun other then dat its just a game for fun and its not perfect which makes it more fun. And since its free try it wont hurt to try but I suggest people to not use money for this since the devs are after ur money and basically ripping u off.
6535	1	a	It's a good game , i recomandet
6537	1	a	I got this ame in Early Access through my friend's dad. Back then, this game ran choppily and was called 'ORION: Dino Horde.' I have not played this game as it is now, but it looked promising. Now that is in full release, the servers will likely be full. Also you get Steam Trading Cards, which you can sell. They fetch a good price too.
6539	1	a	Its... cool...
6541	1	a	It`s Ok, the store aint working doe but gameplay is chill
6543	1	a	This game is pretty cool.
6545	1	a	Easily the best game for $1,it is just a buck..... buy it already.......
6547	1	a	But shieeet- it was 99 cents  For real, best spent dollar ever
6549	1	a	Very fun and enjoyable game. A very cheap game that you can play with your friends.
6551	1	a	1 Opened game  2 Joined a single player survival game  3 turned the generator on  4 Bought a Trek-9  5 the first wave started  6 Murdered some raptor babys  7 wave ended  8 bought a bow and arrow  9 T-rex comes thew a wall and kills me instantly   1000000000000/10 would be eaten by a drunken T-rex
6553	1	a	Solid upvote! I played the Free Trial about a year back and had loads of fun blasting dinosaurs and opponents in halo-styled fights. If you like halo or turok, welcome to the game-child. Worth the try!
6555	1	a	Its neato burrito :)
6557	1	a	No Screenshots, no Let's play video are going to tell you how fun it's this game, you really need to play it to discover it, I had been playing this game since Dino Beatdown, which really was the version I enjoyed the most, yes this game was nerft and yes this game has some bugs but nothing that stop you from playing it.
6559	1	a	Interesting concept. Very buggy but still fun. I had the most fun after turning the graphics down as far as I could. Was worth the 4 player sale price!
6561	1	a	This nice game to play with your friends, also you can play multiplayer to it's fun,and you can have fun from this game i love this game buy it if you like! :) Good Day
6563	1	a	awesome game definentally worth the 99 cents (on sale) perfect for a relaxing time! 
6565	1	a	I am this game this game is me 
6567	1	a	Got it when it was on sale for $1. GREAT game for only $1. Idk if i'd give it a ten or anything...but for $1, it doesn't get much better. If full price (I can't see because I already own) is $25 or less, then I'd recommend it!
6569	1	a	This game is pretty fun. Especially worth it when it goes on sale for a dollar.
6571	1	a	I r8 8/8 no h8 plz no calls after 8 call me at 888-888-8888, plz sk8 to r8 n' don't b l8.
6573	1	a	I only have to say one thIng, AWESOME
2037	0	a	The server connections and server browser are horrible.
2038	0	a	UPDATE: Spiral changed name, and the game changed name- it is now orion:prelude- and it does not change anything that is written in this review- so make your own conclusions on how bad this game that is now on its third name is.  Bad. Do not buy.  Killing Floor is a hordemode shooter that focuses on one thing and does it damn well- only objective is to shoot well-designed enemies with well-designed weapons, and the sounds, music and feel are all tehre to make that fun. Weapons are powerful and feel powerful yet balanced between eachother, enemies are dangerous yet 'fair' and react to shots.  ORION DINO HORDE however, does the exact opposite: it give a player tons of guns and vehicles and makes all of them very bland. it gives billion game modes out of which 1 or 2 are worth playing and rest are dinosaur carp. Enemies feel plastic, hitboxes are wonky and movement is hideous. all animations are f-grade be it enemy, friendly or vehicle. The entire sound design is hideous: the loudest weapon in game are dual pistols, which deafen out tank gun and dual gatlings 100 to 1. weapons are laughably underpowered and imbalanced, only this enemies do is rush you like kamikaze planes.  Most of the flaws in the game are obvious to anyone who stops to sit for 5 seconds on 'what should good gameplay include', but Spiral is content on pumping out 'more is better' without a single thought on quality of the game.
6575	1	a	As silly as this game is, it's addicting and awesome :D You slay out dinosaurs in many different game modes, purchasing weapons and upgrades as you advance, as well as vehicles
2040	0	a	I regret spending 74 cents on this game that is developed by amateurs. Don't be fooled by their game trailers. Why do you think this game costs 74 cents?
6577	1	a	I like it. dont know why, but i do. I find myself playing this way more than expected.
6579	1	a	Can't hate the game even if I was told to (I have played 200+ hrs with multi accounts). Fun Co-op game with great difficulty settings, as well as 4 class to choice from. Overall its an incredible game  8/10
2041	0	a	It's broken. Maybe a good laugh with your friends, but not really worth picking up, even for a dollar.
6581	1	a	Buy it I mean its freaking 99 cents! 
6583	1	a	Just about the best game that I've ever played. Graphics are on par with Assassin's Creed Unity and overall gameplay is above and beyond anything I've seen in the last decade.   I did play it under a different name. Dino Hoard. And it was great. I recommeneded it too all of my friends and they all played it for 2 hours each.  If I had a dollar to buy this game. I would.
2042	0	a	Orion: Dino Horde is a fun game even solo I enjoyed the gameplay and the wave after wave of dinosaurs heading toward me with killer intent BUT then it started crashing. After about 2 hours or so after playing I took a break and started up my steam account and launched the game only too have it freeze on me every 5 or so minutes. One of my friend's computer started doing the same thing later on. My computer can run most games on their highest settings but even turning down the graphic to a lower setting did not help. The developers need too fix these bugs if so they'll have a enjoyable multiplayer game on there hands
6585	1	a	shot dinos on the lowest settings fun was had it was pretty cheap to so I aint even mad.
6587	1	a	BEST GAME WHAT I EVER PLAYED BEFORE! REALLY, THANKS!
6589	1	a	Only played a little bit, at first I played alone and it got boring pretty fast, but when you play with friends this game mixes together a great feeling of excitement, hilarity, and suspense (after all that T rex could be right around the corner). So much you can do and the maps are a fairly good size as well leaving literally hundreds of different ways to get to where you need to go. not to mention the various vehicles and even a mech suit. Plus who hasnt dreamed of bow hunting for Dinos! 9/10
2046	0	a	a junk game, a dumbed down version of halo with much less
6591	1	a	This game is really nice .. Thanks for making it free for 5 days . I really appreciated it ..
6593	1	a	Ignore the not recommended stuff, although the game is slightly, ONLY SLIGHTLY buggy its still the best game ive ever played, I mean someone who did not buy the game when they saw 'dinosaurs and Jetpacks' the games itself is exiting with huge boss fights with t-racks and other HUGE dinosaurs, lots of weapons easy controls oh and TANKS AND MECHS because we thought it couldn't get better, with all that said I definitely recommend this MORE than the beautiful game
2049	0	a	pretty bad, glad I spent $1 on it.  The problems are the map is too big for walking and too small for the slow vehicles. Combat is boring, AIs are boring, graphics are too simplistic.
2050	0	a	This game is unplayable. I streamed this @  www.twitch.tv/sirspoony  and frapsed it for first impressions youtube.   I was unable to create a solo game.  I was unable to join any online games because they were all locked.  I was unable to play with friends and viewers because none of us could team up for games.  Games would just not launch.  This game is not even worth the $0.99 because it did not work for me or the many people trying it out in my stream as well. So guessing it's either broken or so unstable server-wise that it makes it unplayable.  On a side note. They trolled gamers everwhere and won. They actually fooled the many idiots into thinking this is a recommendable game? Sorry for your obvious loss of some humanity based on trickery.
2051	0	a	I hate this game cuz every time I die I lose all my money that I've saved for weapons and have to start over again :(
6595	1	a	I dont know why, but it wont let me even update it. It said clear up the hard drive a bit, and i did. That appearantly did not work...... Any help?
2052	0	a	This game is awfully buggy and quite crappy. I guess one could like it in a 'so bad it's good' kind of way but honestly it isn't worth it. Good for one fun night with friends but after that you'll never go back
6597	1	a	I adore this game its a ton of fun I highly suggest it its like killing floor with dinos.   (also random tip you can ride on the wings of the Vtols and the backs of the dragonflies and its very very hard to fall off even if they start going in circles.)

6599	1	a	Thrift shop style
2057	0	a	Don't trust their newest propaganda people! This game still sucks! 1/10 Don't buy this. Please.
2058	0	a	Very very bad game...
6601	1	a	i like to play orion prelude
6603	1	a	Those Dinosaurs don't have ♥♥♥♥♥
6605	1	a	dont buy it
6607	1	a	WOW That discount 
6609	1	a	Buy when on sale its a good game but not worth the 15 bucks i got it for 99 cents so yea i would give it a 7 out of 10 because it is a little to pricy anyway it is an overall good game with a little feel of tf2 because hats
6611	1	a	I recommend it for kids.
6613	1	a	Well if you like shooting dinosaurs, this one is for you. The metacritic label is wrong of course, because it isn't even for this game. I think it's worth a buy, especially if you have friends playing.
6615	1	a	If you are into ever spinning dinosaur, dinosaurs launching themselves into the air while mulipling themselves (yeah.) or being unable to move for certain reasons while dinosaurs come at you, you might enjoy this thing.  Oh, remenber to press 'V'(melee button) while reloading. It cancels reloading animation, like completely.  4/10 7/10 for lolz
6617	1	a	BUY IT!!!IT'S SO FUNONE OF THE BEST GAMES I HAVE EVER PLAYED!!!(especially with friends)
2061	0	a	What sort of ♥♥♥♥ing computer do you need to run this game, i mean i got 12 FPS ON THE MENU. You know you have screwed up somewhere if your menu runs at 12 ♥♥♥♥ing frames. 2/12 thanks alot Valve. Oh and say i have a bad computer bad it says i have over the recommended
2062	0	a	♥♥♥♥
6619	1	a	its a really good game
6621	1	a	This game is worth more then 99 cents.
2063	0	a	This is the biggest piece of ♥♥♥♥ i've played since sonic 06! It lags constantly even though i have a computer with system requirements AND i even uninstalled all my games to make sure that it would run and it even managed to crash my computer multiple times!
2064	0	a	I purchased a four pack for around $3. After installing it and playing for a little short of an hour, I can report that it has poor graphics, subpar gameplay, and is more than a little repititious. Spend your time elsewhere. To those I start to send copies out to, I owe you apologies.
6623	1	a	You have to buy this game! It's just so much fun. I played with my friend for 2 hours in a match against a robotic santa that flew overhead and dropped bombs on us. It took us over an hour to kill him!
6625	1	a	A must have for fans of thr Zoo Tycoon series.
6627	1	a	It needs to be on mac
6629	1	a	At this point they might as well be paying me to play this. How many times has this game been free again? 10? 20? Anyway, you get your money's worth, which isn't much of a feat for 99 cents.
6631	1	a	shot a pterodactyl with a tank shell, then tank got flipped by stegosaurus and fell of cliff with my tank..... true story 11/10 
6633	1	a	Played for 5 mins got bored. ^^ Whoops left my comp on  I I I  I I I  I I I
6635	1	a	Awesome game here is all you need to know 1. you shoot dinosaurs as space marines. 2. you can eat space marines as dinosaurs. 3. there is no real plot but I guarantee that you will not care once you aim down your sights at a velociraptor. 4. There are Jet packs. 5. It is a first person shooter and third person dino. 6. The ion blade is basically a lightsaber so you can kill dinosaurs with a lightsaber. 7. The game plays like a dream. 8.There are tanks. 9.There are mechs. 10. For the uninformed all of these things are awesome and completely cool. That is all 9/10
6637	1	a	I Think it's a good game to have in your steam library. It looks good.   Rating: 8/10
2067	0	a	its HARD to say if i recommend it or not, its not a total waste of 0.99 cents  its fun in the begining, but the gameplay its buggy, the Dinos MAIN PURPOSE is just to rush you....RUSH you until you kill it... i would rather suggest to save the $$ for a better game like killing floor or something better than this :D ~~~~~~~UPDATE~~~~~~ I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME AT ALL  The gameplay isnt smooth always buggy/shaky/etc the Bots are weak and terrible in solo play i say the bugs RUINS THE GAMEPLAY
6639	1	a	its ok for a cheap game but does get boring the graphics could of been better bit like halo with dinosars lol Recommended:  OS:Win 7 / Win 8 (64-Bit)  Processor:AMD 6-Core / Intel 4-Core  Memory:6 GB RAM  Graphics:1 GB Graphics Memory (SM 3)  i bet this could run on a mobile
6641	1	a	People say mean things about me, and that makes me mad. Shooting dinosaurs in the face with giant robots makes me less mad. Metacritic don't know crap. Highly recommended if you want the true sensation of childlike wonder.
6643	1	a	awesome game to be fair :D fun everytime you play
6645	1	a	This is a amazing game , the developers have had a lot of hardship but they have persevered and made a very successful game , my only complaint is that it is $1 it should be more :)
6647	1	a	This game is horrible. Incredibly bad. I love it.
6649	1	a	That's a good game but it need more improvements like  1. There should be different character models like : a) Male b) Female in all classes  2. Dinos must have slam system so players can't avoid them by going on rocks
6651	1	a	Amazing game just cant wait till prelude 'Offically launches'
6653	1	a	Best name-changing simulator I've ever played! 9.4/10
6655	1	a	Like Skyrim, with guns!- 1gn
6657	1	a	For those of yougoing by the Metacritic score, I ask you not to. While I have only played this game for eight minutes, I can recomend it IF and only if you have three buddies that also own it, I have only played solo and it is near impossible, but it can be done, definitly pick it up on a steam sale, I got my copy for a dollar. I haven't encountered glitches or bugs as of yet, but I can tell a lot of work has been done since release.
6659	1	a	Ma turf foo' dino
6661	1	a	I have to say , this is a nice game , the vehicules are good and there a good choice of weapons but if you want to make this into a better game you need to fix the colision system and lag issues . There also a imbalance in the classes , everybody use the jetpack .
6663	1	a	For years (er, 2001 actually); the only game I played was Halo: Combat Evolved..  If you liked/loved Halo, you owe it to yourself to try this game..  It costs a dollar dammit- buy it just for the hell of it.
6665	1	a	stupid fun, and the people who made it seem to have put a lot of work into it. I kinda feel bad paying $1 for it, since it's so much fun with friends
6667	1	a	This game is the meaning of fun i got this game for 1 doller adn i got payday 2 for 10 still cant decide which one is better this gaing is slowing becomeing a must own
6669	1	a	Paying $0.99c to hunt dinos? Nuff said. Take my dolla now!
6671	1	a	Started off as dino beatdown which was filler at best but i did spend a couple hours on that. Then it turned into its 2nd form Dino Horde and it was a lot better and I spent more hours playing that. And now its it's in its 3rd form and it has vastly improved since the very beginning. So say what you want about the game but when you sell it for $1 and STILL consistently upgrade the game on this level, then you have to give the develpers mad props.
6673	1	a	Pros:  - References to Jurasic Park - Cool weapons - Interesting Objectives  Cons: - boring sound and ambient, not inmersive at all. - it seems it get stuck in some development state, alpha maybe? - Achievement 'Manly Man' (boys club) - the same dinosaurs that we've seen in other games, over and over again.  It's a cool game in alpha release, if that's the case. Recomended for boys 
6675	1	a	Best not even a whole dollar you can spend on a game. #BringMeSomePizza
6677	1	a	What a cool game
6679	1	a	Its a strange, buggy, incomplete, unreasnable game.  Buy it.
6681	1	a	Assault rifles, shotguns, laser guns, flamethrowers, tanks, mechs, airships, and dinosaurs. This game really is pretty awesome. Great for LAN's or teaming up with friends for some mindless fun.
6683	1	a	Awesome dino fps Hard to go wrong
2070	0	a	Started off ♥♥♥♥, became good after some love and craft, now it's gone to ♥♥♥♥ once again. The weather effects alone ruined everything.
2071	0	a	The systems at play here just did not grab my attention. I thought it might be interesting to hunt dinosaurs in these large and open arenas, but I continually felt pestered by the smaller enemies, and the large enemies could be quite spongy. However, at this point, the online servers may not be as populated as they once were. More players and teamwork might make the title more enjoyable.
6685	1	a	Not a bad game,but defenitely needs some optimizing in the next patches.You got dinosaurs,vehicles,a nice amount of weapons,some customization.It's a good game,not the best,but you can surely enjoy it with a couple friends if you have the time.And it's cheap :D
6687	1	a	ORION: Prelude, killing dinasours with lightsabers and futuristic weapons seems legit right?
6689	1	a	The video says to ignore the Metacritic score. I agree with this statement! Well worth the dollar paid for it, and I dare say it's worth the regular $14.99 price. It's not perfect by any means, but it provides a good bit of entertainment with friends.
2075	0	a	This game is god awful. right from the start you know its bad, because the game doen't even have a tutorial! so the first 10 minutes you are running not knowing what your doing, and have no idea how to get any weapons so you can actuall do anything. The textures are terrible, they are so low resoulution, that they look like games from the n64! the only good thing about the graphics are your player model, and even that is only decent at best. The voice acting is decent, but not up to par with todays standards, heck even the legend of zelda from the phillips cdi was better. The only good thing about this game is menu, ant that's because it has artwork, that is kinda cool to look at. And the net code for this game is terrible, not worse then brink's but that's not saying much. All in all i would give this game a 3/10. It has got to be one of the worst game i've ever played, I urge you not to buy it, even if it is only a dollar, it is that bad.
6691	1	a	This game is lovely, killing with your team mates surviving endless hordes of dinosaur's perfect :) a bit laggy tho sometimes.
6693	1	a	EPIC. worth definetly more than 1 dollah...it has some small bugs in the movement of dinosaurs but the game its still improving so...ive seen bigger games with serious bugs so i dont see why so much hate the game actually has good graphics(unreal engine),fun gameplay(coop againts the dinosaurs and deathmatch are the two main types),and nice soundtrack...sometimes it reminds a bit of borderlands...so if u wanna have fun with your friends other than homo-pillow figthing u have to buy this one...its 1 dollah..seriously now...1..
2076	0	a	the graphics are bad alot of lags the ingame skins cost actual money to purchase and this game is just boring it has no plot and no consept except playing with friends and if you dont have at least 3 more friends that play this game this game is just boring
2077	0	a	If you want to play a good dino game, dont try this. Very low budget game, but this isnt a problem. The models are low resolution, servers are laggy, and much more.
6695	1	a	*sets large dino spawn rate to 500%* *has to fight 5 triceratops, 5 stegosaurus, 5 t-rex, 5 deinosuchus, and 5 spinosaurus all at once* *wins after a grueling 30 minute long fight* *realizes I have 5 more rounds to go before securing the base* 10/10 would fight 25 large dinos again
6697	1	a	You like flying motorcycles? You like killing dinos with futuristic weapons? This is Killing Floor, Halo and Borderlands in one game. And you get all that for one ♥♥♥♥ing dolar. Totaly worth it. 10/10
2083	0	a	The concept is nice but the controls are crap. Sometimes you're able to move normally, sometimes you can't strafe for some reason, and sometimes you just can't move at all. It wasn't worth the dollar I spent on it.
6699	1	a	Very VERY fun to play.
6701	1	a	its a very fun game
6703	1	a	THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER IF YOU DONT BUY THIS GAME THAN U R A IDIOT PLZ BUY IT IS RLY WORTH 300,000$ BUT THE DEVS R KNICE AND LET YOU GET IT 4 THIS!!!!!1  jk it sucks
6705	1	a	This game surprised me. If you like guns and dinosaurs, this is the game for you. 10/10 would do.
6707	1	a	Kill dinosaurs. Buy guns. Kill more dinosaurs. Buy more guns. Kill more dinosaurs. 10/8 what more could you want.
2085	0	a	needs better optimization
6709	1	a	good as far as i can tell. but i have issues with performance even though i have a good pc
6711	1	a	Fun game! Graphics are like Team Fortress 2! It's really worth the 99 cents. I would recommend this game to anybody who's interested in first person shooters. Its a well build game, and I love it. 
6713	1	a	i cant really rate this bad or good but for the price of £0.79 its a decent game
6715	1	a	U shoot Dinos Nuff Said 10/10
6717	1	a	ITS A ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ DINOSAUR LASER FIGHT!!! IN SPACE, WITH SHARKS! ITS A BALLS OUT DINOSAUR LASER FIGHT!!!  ITS ♥♥♥♥ING SCIENCE, JUST ASK ALBERT EINSTEIN! (HE INVENTED SPACE)
6719	1	a	This is a great game. It's very fun to play and it's even more fun to play with friends. It's a very cheap choice but i recommend to wait because the 4-pack costs only 0,99 in the sales. Then you can play with your friends. Recently TREK Industries released 'Guardians Of Orion'. You can try that. But if you don't have the money or the computer for that, i recommend you to get this one.    Final verdict - 8/10
6721	1	a	PLEASE READ  -------------- I would reccomend it in the future when I get some better PC. But for now my computer can't handle it and it even skips frames. I love this game truely and got it for a wonderful deal of 99 cents but be warned, your computer may not process this game well. 10/10 It's just my PC that makes the fault.
6723	1	a	This is a really great co-op game to play with friends!
6725	1	a	this game is awsome haha,love to play this over and over xD
6727	1	a	Hey guys it's me, Ben Affleck. When I was filming Argo (maybe you've seen it lol) I would pass the time between filming scenes to play this video game. Orion: Prelude has a story that puts Good Will Hunting (another film I starred in with my best friend Matt Damon) to shame. All of the proceeds from this game go to relief efforts in Israel. I am a HUGE supporter of the Israeli plight and wish to see prosperity in the Middle East. I give this video game 357 Afflecks out of 5 Afflecks. Not buying this game would cause another Shoa goyim, oi vey!
6729	1	a	thE NEW UPDATE IS AMAZING AWSOME LOOKING GAME recomend to ALL who love shooters,fps,DINOSAURS
6731	1	a	There's ♥♥♥♥ing dinosaurs in it. Don't think, just buy it.
6733	1	a	addicting game if you like borderlands you will LOVE this
6735	1	a	Yes THA ♥♥♥♥♥♥ BEST GAME EEEEVVVVVVVVEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRR NOT but its fun
6737	1	a	Good game to play alone or with some friends.
6739	1	a	best 10 minutes of my life
6741	1	a	Everybody on the entire planet should get this game. Especially all my Steam friends.   STOP READING AND BUY IT!!!
6743	1	a	♥♥♥♥♥
6745	1	a	So, i just downloaded the game and actualy payed the money to keep it in my library. If you are obsessed with polished graphics, effect, animation etc. Get out of here right now, this is not your game. While having some decent graphics, they actually look very dated and the animation are very sloppy and baddly done.  But the thing is, if you don't look very much into those aspects, it's a pretty decent game to have fun for a while.  The modes are pretty fun and killing waves and waves of dinos keeps you playing for a good while. It's kind of addicting! It remembers me Killing Floor but with dinos. Kill waves, after the waves arm up, repeat.  Is it worth it? maybe. For me it's worth it. i really like the game!   Pros: Addicting Tons of fun DINOS! MORE DINOS! vehicles (actualy this would go in the 'meh' section)  cons: Animations are crap Graphics look like from a 2008/2010 game, not a modern game.  Veredict: A nice game if you want to play something different since most games like this are just about zombies etc. It's a nice alternative! and as i said, if you don't put importance to the graphics and the animations, try it out! And more now because it's just 0.99$!  6.5/10 
6747	1	a	good but I now have to pay for it. I did have it free and I am a steam user
6749	1	a	I joined my first game. I asked someone how do I switch weopons. I got kicked. gg no re this is a game you would find on the App Store. but +1 because I don't want to seem like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥
6751	1	a	Aside from all the bugs and blemishes throughout i found the game actually rather entertaining.I myself would certainly purchase this game.With its budget price and rather surprising graphics while supplying both competitive and co-operative game modes its great.however i will admit this game needs some tender love and attention yet.the bugs can be irritating and you never know when your host will leave and so far there is no way to migrate host instead it favors removing the match alltogether booting you out leaving you with little more than the experience and a sense of unfinished business.if you have some patience i recommend at least trying it out when it is free.
6753	1	a	so game, very cheap,     such dino, many hours    wow
6755	1	a	Played it for a couple minutes its alright.
2093	0	a	This game honestly isn't that good, I am glad I got it on sale when it was a dollar. All the game is, is to reactivate reactors over and over while killing dinosours. There are vehicles to get to the reactors faster, but honestly I left the game minutes after I realized it lags when I shoot. I would rate this game 2/10
6757	1	a	A lot of people ♥♥♥♥ on this game. A lot of critics apparently too; that metascore is the lowest I've seen.  Graphics wise it's nothing special, but nothing worth complaining about either. It looks like an unreal engine title from about 2008.  Which it is.  It needs an ingame tutorial. The level system, just like in EVERY shooter that has EVER had a level system or XP, is out of place and in the way.  The animations are a bit wonky and even the big dinos, if you get them one on one their AI is rather lacking. The game has a bunch of bugs. The difficulty curve is a bit too steep- you may find yourself at a point where your current difficulty level is no longer any challenge, but the next one up is nearly impossible.  That said, none of this got in the way of enjoying the game for me, because this game has the great advantage of being one of the extremely limited number of titles in which a person can utter the phrase 'I just shot a T-Rex in the face with a tank cannon' in earnest. If you like cooperative shooters, get this. If you want a PVP experience, this game has pvp modes but they are NOT a focus of the game. Perhaps its novelty will wear off faster than a more polished game like killing floor, but I still reccomend it.
6759	1	a	IT WAS $.99!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
6761	1	a	i have the game and my game is lagy and the mous and the keybord is really werde and thats it 
6763	1	a	dinosaurs and stuff. would recommend
6765	1	a	Halarious game. The ragdoll physics are especially funny. Nothing better than punching a dead t-rex into a tree with a car.
6767	1	a	Great deal for a $1. Standard FPS game, fun with your friends.
6769	1	a	I have really enjoyed all of the time I have put into the game so far. There are tons of different game modes and ways to play the game which gives it even more playthrough value. Although there are a few issues with laggy servers and lost connections, overrall it hasnt greatly affected my expirience. For $1 the game is totally worth it. Grab some buds and go take down some Dinos!
6771	1	a	It sucks, but for a buck it's worth the buck.
2094	0	a	WTF IS THIS ♥♥♥♥! DONT BUY THIS CRAP!!!!
2095	0	a	Wow even for 50 cents I feel robbed. Takes a lot for me to make a comment and being a Steam user for many years this is my first review. DON'T BUY it!!!!!!
2096	0	a	Why did I actually pay money for this piece of crap?
6773	1	a	This game brought the dino's back to life!
6775	1	a	I generally don't leave reviews but I feel inclined to show this game some support due to all the negative feedback. I don't understand all the hate on it. While it may not be the most sophisticated game by any stretch, Dino horde is good casual mindless fun. You shoot progressing waves of dinosaurs in a futuristic setting and upgrade your gear inbetween rounds.. What's not to love?  It gives a sort of old school type of fun before games were more complex. Given I can already tell this is a game I can fall back to at any time to just kill some time, it's current price is a complete bargain. In all reality I'd probably be comfortable paying 10$ or so for the game as it gives fun multiplayer but lacks any depth.  Any how... It's a fun game. If you can get it on sale do it, at the very least you'll put an hour or so into it and for a buck i'd say its worth it.
2097	0	a	This game is ♥♥♥♥ do not buy it it sucks vagazle for money
6777	1	a	This game is like butter Soft when you put it in the microwave But cold when you put it in the fridge I burned my orion prelude copy and i can't play it Recomandation: Don't let your Orion Prelude Copy in the microwave for 20 minutes on High
6779	1	a	11/1 would lightsaber a trex again
2101	0	a	Laggs sooooooooooo much other wise id play it!
2102	0	a	I bought this game for a dollar. I wasted that dollar. When it says in the trailer that the metascore is misleading, it is correct: this game should get a much lower rating than 34.
6781	1	a	I was once a lonely man, with nothing buy my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥ laptop that can barely handle more than 5 tabs open in google chrome. This game changed my life. The graphics are good enough that my eyeballs dont fall out of my head, and bad enough that my computer can actually run it without ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ it's self. There are tons of bugs in this game, some fun, some annoying, but I love all of it's perfect imperfections. This game made me literally cut my self in excitement when i first played it. I am a new man now. I've only killed 6 people, and that was because they were standing inbetween me and my game. I dream about this game. This game not only changed my insignificant life, but this game became my life. This game and I are one.  In conclusion...  6.45/10 It's ok I guess

2113	0	a	♥♥♥♥
2114	0	a	This game poopy.
6823	1	a	cut a t-rex in the ankles with a knife until he die
6825	1	a	Not as bad a game as everyone says, buy it with some friends and enjoy shooting dinossaurs, its fun and with the new updates its playable and enjoyable.
6827	1	a	Punch Dinosaurs. Nuff said. But in all seriousness, this is a very fun game. But it's better if you have friends to play with. if not, it's still great to play.
6829	1	a	some may say that killing dinosaurs with lasers and rockets isnt fun, these people are missing out on something really cool. you can shoot them alone or knife them with friends, build up strategies or just leeroy jenkins straight through with only a knife. all in one, its a good game and i picked it up for 1 buck, look out for sales dudes ;)
6831	1	a	This game is great in my perspectives...  A little bit laggy but very good game play, this game is good for friends you like to play with this 5 player coop game makes you and your friends very enjoyable with different unlocks, weapons, taunts, hats, cosmetics and etc this game makes you look so cool. Orion prelude is a game which you slay dinos and unlock alot of things, Orion prelude is one of the funnest games i had, also the single player is very fun, if you are a single player guy get this game and play single player solo or bots, this game is very fun in my perspectives.. worth the 99 cents! this game might be worth 2 dollars.. this is a must buy game all the fun for .99 cents!!  
6833	1	a	A game in which 4 or 5 players hold out against a horde of Dinosaurs and the occasional giant crocodile in maps ranging from forests to even an icy hell landscape. Dinosaurs range from the classic T.rex to the Stegosaurus . If you liked Left 4 dead then you will love ORION (The T.rex throws giant rocks just like the tank)
6835	1	a	Honestly this isnt my favorite game. but its actually quite fun If you have friends to play it with its way better, but what would I know seeing as all my friends are playing DOTA or TF2 playing with bots is fun. but the game feels somewhat 'dead' without other player If you manage to increase your FPS above 20 and play you'll have a good time Enemies are pretty fair. easily killable in the early rounds and harder enemies as the match progresses There are some thing I feel should change however -The maps are buggy -servers are hard to get into -most servers are empty Its free so I cant complain about it in that department. its fun so thats another good thing And its buggy which leads to some hilarious gameplay like floating players or headless dinosaurs chasing you around the map probably a 7/10 (taken 3 away because of the things I listed before) If this Isnt helpful to you then keep scrolling until you find one that is
6837	1	a	it is realy fun!! :) 
6839	1	a	Halo with Dinos.
2118	0	a	The best thing about this game is its quick uninstall time!
6841	1	a	Fun to play enjoyable to alot of people.I think its one of the best games better then call of duty and tons more. Favorite game ;D 
6843	1	a	FANTASTIC GAME!. 100% worth the 1$ cost!
6845	1	a	what up with single player 
6847	1	a	I LOVE THIS GAME
6849	1	a	pretty fun game, now that its free i definitely recommend giving this one a try, the major downside is the way the hitbox works. it's great when your playing alone or are hosting, but the bullets register on the host side (which is dumb, hitboxes should always register on player side and have that info sent to the host) so you could be shooting a dinosaur in the face on your screen and not actually hit it at all, so the ping time has to be extremely (impossibly?) low for this game to really be enjoyable with friends
6851	1	a	wow. this game wanted me to do cocaine off my car windshield. pterodactyl is best in show. tru art with the copters and killing teamates 10/10 will pee pants again out of excitement
2121	0	a	the music is really laggy aswell as gameplay
6853	1	a	this game was amazing. it was everything you want in a dino fighting survival game.
6855	1	a	So bad its funny.  Best .99$ game i ever bought.
6857	1	a	I paid a frickin dollar for this and its more fun than any 60 dollar game I have played. 
6859	1	a	But sh!t, it was ninety-nine cents! (Bag it) Coppin' it, washin' it, 'bout to go and get some compliments Passin' up on those moccasins someone else's been walkin' in Bummy and grungy, fu*k it, man I am stuntin' and flossin' and Savin' my money and I'm hella happy that's a bargain, b!tch I'ma take your grandpa's style, I'ma take your grandpa's style,
6861	1	a	Pretty good for getting rare achievements so, i think for 1 key (that's what i've paid for) its ok. But wouldn't play again.  5 non existing ragdolls out of 10
6863	1	a	My friend gifted this game to me.  10/10 would accept gifts again
6865	1	a	Blows up car with grenade Car doesnt blow up Car bounces straight up I lose it out of my sight I miss my car.  10/10 would miss again.  Edit: After 40 years i still could not find car. I am thinking of starting a campaign to find my car again, please help me on this quest. Possibly in orion prelude 2.
6867	1	a	Fun to watch your friends get eaten by dinosaurs, 10/10 would watch/play again.
6869	1	a	its a nice game
2126	0	a	Well you watch new vids, you see the price and look for reviews. You can imagine this game would be nice to play. Even for just few mins of fun... but no.  Fighting dinosaurs is funny one time. 5 sci-fi soldiers per map against waves of A.I controled dinos. Between waves , you have to purchase gear, each kill give you cash you can spend in your base (starting point). But devs didnt though i would be nice to bring the 2 damm buildings needed to buy weapons and upgrades close each other... Indeed when you have 50 secs after each waves, you loose nearly 20 secs to reach thoses two buildings... annoying.  Some weapons are nice, but others are just useless, in general weapons doesn't have this 'feeling' of power you can have in most shooters.   Vehicles are dispached on the map, the interresting thing is the ability of support class (3 classes at the end) to repair vehicles. The unlimited amount of vehicles wich is quite annoying in games today was replaced here by the need to spare them. Good idea ! The problem is that vehicles are horrible to handle. One guy told me 'this is halo's driving style'. Here this is worst ! You will scream against dinos who will knock back your vehicle especially the mech wich is a scam. Vehicles weapons overheat. The Hud overheat indicator is not appropirate and will stuck you many times during battles.  For foot fighting; you will hate this game when a big dino will chase you and, in an act of courage, you will take him down by yourself and die like a ♥♥♥♥ because one minor dino blocked you on the way of your retreat. Because you can't go trough them. In this game, movements are not realistics like third person view where your torso is stuck as if you had a rake in the ... hum... you got the idea.  But he most annoying: crashes. For many years i never had a game such impossible to stop ! After 100 mins of playing the game crashed. It it was just impossible to stop the executable ! Amazing... especially when you succeed by closing your session, again you launch the game and... nothing. The game launched apparently steam recognize it but... nothing. No executable, no icon, nothing.  When you enter the game you see a banner where devs are planning to launch a kickstarter for a new game with AGAIN sci-fi soldiers vs dinos BUT this time in an open world. Hey Devs ! If you wanted some cash for your kickstarter you got 1 buck but you won't get anything else from me !  Note they dared to add some kind of item shop in the game (with their scandalous promoting vids !) . I didn't really browse it but francly they've boasted a bit too much of their game to think people will buy more than this title.  If you wan't to slaughter dinos (and humans) go on primal carnage wich much more interresting.
6871	1	a	36 out of 100 Yes thats not acutire this game is no master AAA game but its fun enjoyable and id request it also good with friends My only complain is the AI itsw a bit buggy but i mean its worth a go so get a group and hunt some dimos my friend
2127	0	a	ok i know i dont have a mega super £10000 pc but i can generally run most games with about 20fps on mid graphics, but this this game. i dont know where to start. i dont know what the gameplay is like because it runs too badly for me to play. i put it on lowest graphics and i get about 4fps if im lucky. when i tried to play it on mid graphics it froze and what i could tell by the screen where horrid graphics. luckly my friend paid for it not me.
6873	1	a	Not bad for a 2$ game
6875	1	a	♥♥♥♥IN' LOVE RAPTORS.
6877	1	a	Such a stupidly glorious game. Played with a group of guys at magfest and we just tried to kill triceratops with buggies  10/10 would allahu akbar into dinosaurs again.
6879	1	a	36 out of 100 Yes thats not acutire this game is no master AAA game but its fun enjoyable and id request it also good with friends My only complain is the AI itsw a bit buggy but i mean its worth a go so get a group and hunt some dimos my friend
6881	1	a	So I decided to go ahead, disregard the Metacritic score for the old version and give this game a try. And after trying the free demo, I had to buy the actual game - the whole setting is so over-the-top hilarious - shooting down hordes of dinosaurs in coop mode - and the actual gameplay is a lot of fun!  There is no tutorial of any sort, so you'll have to give yourself a bit of time to figure out how stuff works and what you are actually supposed to do - but once you jetpack on top of a rock, thinking you are safe from the hordes of dinos running below and planning to snipe them off one after another - and then some flying dino dives down, picks you up and pulls you high up in the air, only to then drop you once you start shooting at the critty - then you're hooked ;)  Super fun, and a developer with tons of humour and a huge commitment to this game.
6883	1	a	It is an average game, its cool to play with other people.
2131	0	a	Not that fun and there are barrely any in game sounds
2132	0	a	Haha, it's even funny. It's REALLY bad! I don't think i have words to describe it.  Good thing it was only $1.
6885	1	a	This game is OK, but its not someting you HAVE to have. It has a lot of bugs, but it is playable. Though, IF you consider getting this game, do not pay more then $2-$3 for it. I played it during the FREE week when it was $3, but it did nothing for me. A week is more then enough of that game to get bored of it. The META score is a bit harsh, but it justified.
6887	1	a	this game is actually quite fun despite what the metascore says, I decided to look into it, and they're reviewing what came before when it was Dino Beatdown and not Dino Horde. It's a decent game, great fun with friends, I'd give it a shot for 99 cents.
6889	1	a	Good game overall, but i wouldnt had bought it if it wasnt in sale.
2133	0	a	Purchased this game long ago and asked for a refund as it was THAT bad.   There are so many bad things to say about it:  1) Gameplay feels weightless and unsatisfying  2) Multiplayer is lifeless and unabsorbing  3) It feels pointless, unrewarding and repetitive 4) There is no demo, which means people waste their money buying the full version, which is dreadful
6891	1	a	PLEASE NOTE: IF YOU CAN'T RESPECT THE OPINIONS OF OTHERS, THEN DON'T READ THIS. THIS IS PURELY BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE WITH THE GAME, IF YOU DON'T AGREE, THEN GO WRITE A HATE SONG ABOUT ME AND UPLOAD IT ON YOUTUBE.  This game was not worth your time, and you shouldn't buy it Although this game advertizes for having immersive co-op, co-op is barely present. The only 'co-op' this game has to offer is swarming the larger groups with dinosaurs stiff as wooden boards, while your team shoots all the dinosaurs down, except the pterodactyls, which are so small that they're impossible to hit, while some random guy is screaming at people over voicechat to come repair his vehicle. The AI in this game is not that great either. Enemies often circle around in the tall grass a couple of times and then charge straight at whoever is closest, regardless of wether a wall, a tree or even another dinosaur is in the way, not to say it matters, since most dinosaurs clip through each other. If you play as a dinosaur, the game then gets even worse. you spawn somewhere close to the players, half of the time, without a map, arrow or anything else to guide you to the so called 'survivors' forcing you to search for them. It doesn't help that the maps are HUGE, and everyone is mashed into a claustrophobic mass of crudely animated violence. If you don't have a somewhat beefy computer, this game will run with less than 15 fps, even on the lowest graphics, so take note of that, especially with the motion blur, where you won't be able to see 5 feet in front of yourself.  pros: -has some weapon variety. -better optimized for pc than Toukiden Kiwami.  cons: -awful co-op. -does not run that well on slower computers. -although it does offer multiple gamemodes, they all feel the same. -Developers went as far as to change the name once, just to get it to the steam frontpage.    final words: if you really REALLY don't have any other games to play, and have a lot of free time at your hands, then go outside and get a life.  I certainly hope this review helped you save your money, if not, then come back and write a review like I did, to help others see what lies beyond the wall  This is what i would have said back at Orion: dino horde. these people completely turned the game around, and is now enjoyable, and fun to play. they fixed many of the bugs, most of the stiffness, and did a ton of tweaks to the performance.  true final words: Buy, but don't wait for a sale. these guys who made the game spent a LOT of time improving the game little by little, until it finally became good, plus they made co-op a lot better too. If you bought this game previously, I say give it a second chance.  That's all, praise the sun.
6893	1	a	Good game overall, but i wouldnt had bought it if it wasnt in sale.
6895	1	a	It's a fun game, The graphics are alright, it's super fun to play with friends.
2135	0	a	In short, this game is Killing Floor with dinosaurs, but subpar. You survive waves of  zombies  dinos, earn money for killing them and buy progressively bigger and nastier guns with them. Sounds pretty straightforward, and it is. The problems with this game are that it's unbalanced, looks worse than Unreal Tournament 2004 (but still runs horribly) and feels very amateurish for a comercially sold game.  For starters, there's only one class out of the 3 you are offered that is actually worth anything, and that is the Assault class (the guy with the jetpack). The other ones have a cloaking mode and a healing gun, but they aren't worth giving up the ability to NOT DIE when you are picked up by a pterodactyl, stop yourself from being mobbed or casually fly around the triceratops that you are pumping full of lead.  There are a bunch of purchaseable guns on offer when you finish a wave, but most of them are either too weak or have horrible accuracy/recoil, so expect to use the same guns on every match. Or you could drive around in a warthog-ish buggy and have some guy man the turret (or man it yourself) to become almost invincible to the dinosaurs.  There are some things that Dino Horde does right, though. It mixes it up by having you defend generators, fight boss dinosaurs, and move around to different bases, which breaks up the monotony quite a bit, and it is rather satisfying once you get a hold of one of those badass turrets, admittedly.  I feel a bit bad for bashing an indie game, and honestly, if you're the forgiving sort, you may get a good amount of fun out of this game, but there are better games you can play about surviving waves of enemies. There are better games about blowing dinosaurs up. There are none to my knowledge about surviving waves of dinosaurs, though, so if you have a fixation for surviving a horde of prehistoric reptiles (perhaps it's the only way you can get it up, i'm not judging you :-D) then pick it up in a sale or something.
6897	1	a	I was gonna buy an m4a4 zirka and then i figured out this beast was 1 dollar. addicted probably
6899	1	a	Its a good game, you kill dinosaurs and stuff. You can use a shotgun to literally blow the head off of a dinosaur. :P
2137	0	a	BACK WHEN THE GAME WAS CALLED ORION HORDE i liked this game, its was defo worth the money,team work was the key.was fun with friends and these people who say its crap they have not played enough to warrent calling it crap.a must buy for 99p/ $0.99 i retract this statment ^^ its utter garbage ...chagend the game so much its not even the same game and as for the stealling content thing well GG orion GG  DONT BUY THIS GAME NOT EVEN FOR 1P /$0.01  DONT SUPPORT THIS GAME IN ANYWAY SHAPE OR FORM  DONT LISTEN TOO ME I'M ONLY A PANDAWW I RAN OUT OF BAMBOO THIS MORNING AND I'M HUNGRY  lol   WORST VIDEO GAME EVERRRRR!!!! (the simpsons)
6901	1	a	I highly recomend this game for thoose who have some good friends and they want to do something not too serous their weekends. Otherwise I recomend you to go away
6903	1	a	perfectly gives u the exxprienz of whet $|-|itting in a bottle feels like, including how u feel after
6905	1	a	if you like dinosouars this game is for you 
6907	1	a	DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY LOL!
2139	0	a	Honestly, after a second ''remake'' and content update...it is still as buggy, cheap and boring as before. Seriously dissapointing and a waste of money.  I highly respect the devs for their devotion and the love they put in the game...but it is not enough.
2140	0	a	What can I say? I only bought this for my friends and myself as a joke and paid 0,50€ when it was on sale.. and that was way too much.   Let's list some 'features': No actual gameplay (except for running and shooting), UI is from the early 2000's and is horrible to use, artstyle (if you can speak of art in the same sentence) is mostly just mimiced from big sci-fi titles, the soundscape is just plain wrong...  Oh, and did I mention that the game is full of bugs? Ah, sorry no, it isn't full of bugs IT IS a fricking bug. The bright side is that the bugs are mostly hilarious (try driving a car head on to a dino).   That doesn't make the game entertaining or anything though. Let's just say it aloud: It's rubbish. And what I've heard, the devs (if you dare call them game developers) have been selling the game under different titles for ages. So basically, they're frauds and should not be allowed to publish anything in the first place.   I hope someone reads this. If I manage to save a single euro, dollar, yen or whatever from being spent on sh*t like this, I can die in peace.
6909	1	a	For only $1 you can't go wrong if you don't enjoy it you havn't realy lost anything but I love it best to buy it for all your friends to play along aswell makes the game even better. So much potential still to come!
6911	1	a	Someone get that sniper.
2151	0	a	ok i know i dont have a mega super £10000 pc but i can generally run most games with about 20fps on mid graphics, but this this game. i dont know where to start. i dont know what the gameplay is like because it runs too badly for me to play. i put it on lowest graphics and i get about 4fps if im lucky. when i tried to play it on mid graphics it froze and what i could tell by the screen where horrid graphics. luckly my friend paid for it not me.
6913	1	a	Maybe its not so bad if you turn all your graphics to low so you can't see the garbage you're playing.
6915	1	a	support for this fantastic and it so fun espically assult JETPACKS FTW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
6917	1	a	It was like an arcade game. I put in 50 cents and got a little entertainment.
6919	1	a	Lasersword fight with T-rex
6921	1	a	it's like monster hunter with guns    10/10 would start generator while getting thrown by rocks again

6939	1	a	its a nice game
6941	1	a	♥♥♥♥♥♥ copy-paste game that has been released x times on steam. Even for 1 dollar feels like a scam to me
2159	0	a	This is by far the worst game I have ever bought. I only paid $0.99 for it and feel I was ripped off. There is nothing about this game that is original, the gameplay is horrible and the developers should be ashamed for releasing such garbage. I would not recommend this game to my worst enemy as it would be to cruel.
6943	1	a	Probably one of my favorite games, love every aspect
6945	1	a	cool and good co-op 
6947	1	a	This game is worth 100 times more than it cost. Best player: Assault Best gun: AWP for 15k Upgrade gun in weapon shop for 20k Upgrade urself for more than 30k EASY MATCH!
6949	1	a	Meh, it's a game made for kids. You can shoot dinasaurs for a little bit but not much depth or polish to the game.
6951	1	a	Shoot dinosaurs in the face for $.99.    What? Buy the ♥♥♥♥ing game!

6955	1	a	Running with a knife looks like you are the duck from the swiggity swooty gif. Double jump makes your screen glitch. Dying crashes your game Its like Halo if Halo was not fun and had dinosaurs.  Overall a fun time for the price, buy it now before price increases. 7.8/10 Too much rain animation on my visor.
6957	1	a	Good gameplay. Wish graphics looked a bit more realistic. 7/10
6959	1	a	i bought this game in 2012 when it first came out and ive loved it ever since. its a great game to play with freinds
2164	0	a	While I would recommend the game if you could get it for around two dollars like I did, I couldn't recommend a full purchase. The game runs horribly on even outstanding systems. The idea is at least interesting. I give the game that it has one of the more unique ideas out there, but its charm dimms a little after extended play. The gameplay is fun throughout with good upgrades, and challenging enemies, but it also containes some annoying bugs. If you do get it, get it on sale. Be prepared for extreme temperatures too.
6961	1	a	SOOOOOOOOO.... CHEAP :D this game is awsome

6969	1	a	Your Honor, haven't these ridiculous bugs    taken up enough of this court's valuable time?    How much longer will we allow these absurd shenanigans to go on?    They have presented no compelling evidence to support their charges    against my clients, who run legitimate businesses.    I move for a complete dismissal of this entire case!    Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going    to have to consider Mr. Montgomery's motion.    But you can't! We have a terrific case.    Where is your proof? Where is the evidence?    Show me the smoking gun!    Hold it, Your Honor! You want a smoking gun?    Here is your smoking gun.    What is that?    It's a bee smoker!    What, this? This harmless little contraption?    This couldn't hurt a fly, let alone a bee.    Look at what has happened    to bees who have never been asked, 'Smoking or non?'    Is this what nature intended for us?    To be forcibly addicted to smoke machines    and man-made wooden slat work camps?    Living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man?    - What are we gonna do? - He's playing the species card.    Ladies and gentlemen, please, free these bees!    Free the bees! Free the bees!    Free the bees!    Free the bees! Free the bees!    The court finds in favor of the bees!    Vanessa, we won!    I knew you could do it! High-five!    Sorry.    I'm OK! You know what this means?    All the honey will finally belong to the bees.    Now we won't have to work so hard all the time.    This is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature, Benson.    You'll regret this.    Barry, how much honey is out there?    All right. One at a time.    Barry, who are you wearing?    My sweater is Ralph Lauren, and I have no pants.    - What if Montgomery's right? - What do you mean?    We've been living the bee way a long time, 27 million years.    Oongratulations on your victory. What will you demand as a settlement?    First, we'll demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps.    Then we want back the honey that was ours to begin with,    every last drop.    We demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more    than a filthy, smelly, bad-breath stink machine.    We're all aware of what they do in the woods.    Wait for my signal.    Take him out.    He'll have nauseous for a few hours, then he'll be fine.    And we will no longer tolerate bee-negative nicknames...    But it's just a prance-about stage name!    ...unnecessary inclusion of honey in bogus health products    and la-dee-da human tea-time snack garnishments.    Oan't breathe.    Bring it in, boys!    Hold it right there! Good.    Tap it.    Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups, and there's gallons more coming!    - I think we need to shut down! - Shut down? We've never shut down.    Shut down honey production!    Stop making honey!    Turn your key, sir!    What do we do now?    Oannonball!    We're shutting honey production!    Mission abort.    Aborting pollination and nectar detail. Returning to base.    Adam, you wouldn't believe how much honey was out there.    Oh, yeah?    What's going on? Where is everybody?    - Are they out celebrating? - They're home.    They don't know what to do. Laying out, sleeping in.    I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way to San Antonio with a cricket.    At least we got our honey back.    Sometimes I think, so what if humans liked our honey? Who wouldn't?    It's the greatest thing in the world! I was excited to be part of making it.    This was my new desk. This was my new job. I wanted to do it really well.    And now...    Now I can't.    I don't understand why they're not happy.    I thought their lives would be better!    They're doing nothing. It's amazing. Honey really changes people.    You don't have any idea what's going on, do you?    - What did you want to show me? - This.    What happened here?    That is not the half of it.    Oh, no. Oh, my.    They're all wilting.    Doesn't look very good, does it?    No.    And whose fault do you think that is?    You know, I'm gonna guess bees.    Bees?    Specifically, me.    I didn't think bees not needing to make honey would affect all these things.    It's notjust flowers. Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.    That's our whole SAT test right there.    Take away produce, that affects the entire animal kingdom.    And then, of course...    The human species?    So if there's no more pollination,    it could all just go south here, couldn't it?    I know this is also partly my fault.    How about a suicide pact?    How do we do it?    - I'll sting you, you step on me. - Thatjust kills you twice.    Right, right.    Listen, Barry... sorry, but I gotta get going.    I had to open my mouth and talk.    Vanessa?    Vanessa? Why are you leaving? Where are you going?    To the final Tournament of Roses parade in Pasadena.    They've moved it to this weekend because all the flowers are dying.    It's the last chance I'll ever have to see it.    Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry. I never meant it to turn out like this.    I know. Me neither.    Tournament of Roses. Roses can't do sports.    Wait a minute. Roses. Roses?    Roses!    Vanessa!    Roses?!    Barry?    - Roses are flowers! - Yes, they are.    Flowers, bees, pollen!    I know. That's why this is the last parade.    Maybe not. Oould you ask him to slow down?    Oould you slow down?    Barry!    OK, I made a huge mistake. This is a total disaster, all my fault.    Yes, it kind of is.    I've ruined the planet. I wanted to help you    with the flower shop. I've made it worse.    Actually, it's completely closed down.    I thought maybe you were remodeling.    But I have another idea, and it's greater than my previous ideas combined.    I don't want to hear it!    All right, they have the roses, the roses have the pollen.    I know every bee, plant and flower bud in this park.    All we gotta do is get what they've got back here with what we've got.    - Bees. - Park.    - Pollen! - Flowers.    - Repollination! - Across the nation!    Tournament of Roses, Pasadena, Oalifornia.    They've got nothing but flowers, floats and cotton candy.    Security will be tight.    I have an idea.    Vanessa Bloome, FTD.    Official floral business. It's real.    Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.    Thank you. It was a gift.    Once inside, we just pick the right float.    How about The Princess and the Pea?    I could be the princess, and you could be the pea!    Yes, I got it.    - Where should I sit? - What are you?    - I believe I'm the pea. - The pea?    It goes under the mattresses.    - Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart. - I'm getting the marshal.    You do that! This whole parade is a fiasco!    Let's see what this baby'll do.    Hey, what are you doing?!    Then all we do is blend in with traffic...    ...without arousing suspicion.    Once at the airport, there's no stopping us.    Stop! Security.    - You and your insect pack your float? - Yes.    Has it been in your possession the entire time?    Would you remove your shoes?    - Remove your stinger. - It's part of me.    I know. Just having some fun. Enjoy your flight.    Then if we're lucky, we'll have just enough pollen to do the job.    Oan you believe how lucky we are? We have just enough pollen to do the job!    I think this is gonna work.    It's got to work.    Attention, passengers, this is Oaptain Scott.    We have a bit of bad weather in New York.    It looks like we'll experience a couple hours delay.    Barry, these are cut flowers with no water. They'll never make it.    I gotta get up there and talk to them.    Be careful.    Oan I get help with the Sky Mall magazine?    I'd like to order the talking inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.    Oaptain, I'm in a real situation.    - What'd you say, Hal? - Nothing.    Bee!    Don't freak
6971	1	a	it was fun
6973	1	a	10/10 like work  thanks :yay: good! all Rush buy  all -off summer sale
2169	0	a	there is a reason this masterpiece is only a dollar.
2170	0	a	This game sucks. You're probably here because 'Hey it's a dinosaur shooting game! Let's try it', trust me I felt the same way too but when I started playing, it's not how it is in trailers and videos. It's really boring, weapons are really dull and the environment is bland. The dinosaurs sometime looks like they're floating and chasing after you. You know, i've tried the other dinosaur games like Dino D-Day and Primal Carnage and have both. They are much more worth than this! You're only gonna buy it if it's free or under a dollar, other than that don't get this.
6975	1	a	Great, challenging game.
6977	1	a	this is the best game if ever played 
6979	1	a	I LOVE THIS GAME AND THIS CO-OP OMG! CATCH A GAMERA OMG LOVE THIS GAME ^~^ ^3^ ;-; ===================================================================
6981	1	a	This game is definitly worth your dollar. I just can't stop playing it!
2171	0	a	LAME, uninstalled this turd soon after playing it for a bit.
6983	1	a	Fun. That's all I can say. Fun.
6985	1	a	it's A pretty addicting game! it is still a really rough diamond,but it has potential! Just needs a little more optimizing and better voice acting and this will be an outstanding game Hope it gets more updates!
6987	1	a	is good game, but is not quality game
6989	1	a	Jurassic, futuristic FPS multiplayer. Plus, its free (now.. those dang developers). Could disappoint but again, its free. Just stop reading reviews ad give it a go. Oh and by the way, you can get a jetpack.
6991	1	a	At first sight, this game appears to be lackluster and unpolished. Do not be fooled by the games subpar visual treatment. It is jam-packed with multiple gamemodes,player customization, and a plethora of weapons to annihilate the dino fiends! The content in this game is what games today are lacking and should focus on rather than the eye candy made to appease the mass of 'seeing is believing' gamers that exist more today than ever in the gaming world! This game is a combination of Halo,Dead space,Borderlands 2, as well as league of legends, and I have never seen a better mash-up than ever before!
6993	1	a	this is the best game if ever played 
6995	1	a	One does not simply club a T-rex to death.  But yeah, it happens here. IS THAT NOT ENOUGH? ARE YOU NOT YET PERSUADED TO BUY TIS GAME?!

6999	1	a	I cried, I laughed, I shot a dinosaur in the bum. 11/10 best accounting software Ive ever used! Makes my taxes fun to do every year! Rawr!
7001	1	a	This game has awesome co-op! They seriously have improved so much since last time when I played! Go and get it, It has beautiful environments, and has Multiplayer go fight against players and friends  I. Am. Now. A. Huge. Fan. Of. This. Game. You. Should. Be. Too. :)
7003	1	a	Great game, many great, fun, and scary times. first time i played. i cried, spinosauros are scary. played with friends. we all cried because T-Rex is much harder than spinosaurus. playing more than N00B difficulty makes it very boring tho. overall great game 8.7/10  My metascore would be 87/100
7005	1	a	First Person Mode and Dinosaurs well made ORION: Prelude specially with our guns and special power per character type.
7007	1	a	The game is not perfect, it has a couple of buggs but it is very fun so its worth the money.
2176	0	a	wad the hell am i doing with my life
2177	0	a	the optimization is awefull
2178	0	a	I have no idea, a long long time ago this had a free weekend and i played it and it was actually kinda fun. i bought they game now cause its dirt cheap so why not and it is awful. Performance is extremely bad and poor optimization. games that look better even on lowest setting i can run them on higher settings anyways. this game looks awful and even on lowest settings im getting all sorts of frame drops and stutters. Theres not many servers, and rarely any fun servers with fun people. I don't see big dinos as much as i nearly used to back on that free weekend. the guns are nearly unusable, having no recoil and it feels like im shooting a pea shooter, yet dinos die extremely easy, and even on the hardest difficulty, i found it really easy. the vehicles feel stiff and also nearly unusable. not a good game, not even worth 99 cents
7009	1	a	contrary to what people believe on metacritic  its not a bad game anymore. ANYMORE. but this game needs alot more players to really become one of the scene. which I believe it has the potential to.
7011	1	a	I cried, I laughed, I shot a dinosaur in the bum. 11/10 best accounting software Ive ever used! Makes my taxes fun to do every year! Rawr!
7013	1	a	GAME IS INACCURATE WITH ITS ACHIEVEMENT NAMES, CAVEMEN DIDN'T EXIST WITH THE DINOSAURS...   -1 point game ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
7015	1	a	Wtf i payed 1 Euro for this game and now it's free???? Give me my M4A4 Griffin back plz  (still a good game)
7017	1	a	TFW game you bought for cheap price becomes free.
7019	1	a	36 out of 100 Yes thats not acutire this game is no master AAA game but its fun enjoyable and id request it also good with friends My only complain is the AI itsw a bit buggy but i mean its worth a go so get a group and hunt some dimos my friend
7021	1	a	Abselutely worth it
7023	1	a	contrary to what people believe on metacritic  its not a bad game anymore. ANYMORE. but this game needs alot more players to really become one of the scene. which I believe it has the potential to.
7025	1	a	Simple pickup and play fun, I do like punching Dinosaurs too.
7027	1	a	This is a fun game and for 1 dollar you can't beat it.
7029	1	a	The game is not perfect, it has a couple of buggs but it is very fun so its worth the money.
2183	0	a	i forgot what it was about but it has a nice name
7031	1	a	its all about the gameplay. Graphics arent the best, but arent bad. What brings me in is the unique stlye of play that is lacking in so many FPS's today.
7033	1	a	Fifty-fifty
7035	1	a	the game crashed... 10/10
2188	0	a	'60+' updates. Well 60+ updates later its still a very buggy, laggy, broken game. Its good for a laugh in the first 5 minutes but its really really not that good. within my first game i was knocked under the map and couldn't do anything about it. It is only 1 dollar and thats what its worth 1 dollar because its not a good game and frankly not worth playing.
2189	0	a	Not even worth $0.99. Horrible.
7037	1	a	This game is fun, little old kind graphics but worth giving try, specially its just 1$ , for sure NOT waist of money !
2200	0	a	The metascore is real. Don't believe what they say about fixing the game.
2201	0	a	Do not spend money on this game.  This game seems interesting in premise, and as it may be fun at first, if you spend a few hours with this game you realize that it isn't open world like it says it is. It is also grotesquely repetitive and there isn't enough in this game to warrant a buy. I bought this game when it was ORION Dino Beatdown and was excited for an update, and it came in the form of hats and microtransactions. I am disappointed with the quality of this game and the potential that was lost with the greedy transition into a microtransaction game.
2202	0	a	Horrible
2203	0	a	No. Just no. 0/10  Cons: - Bad graphics - Boring gameplay - Ridiculous voice lines  Pros: - I removed this game from my library
2204	0	a	Got killed by a dinosaur and still had 3 lifes left, 15/10, would uninstall at sight.
2205	0	a	Has to be the worst game i have ever played. I am shocked and appalled that this has a rating of 'very positive'  I could plug my controller into a log of my ♥♥♥♥ and be more entertained.  
2206	0	a	Plagiarism is no joke. Do not buy this game. The developers stole art from many other studios and do not deserve your money.
7039	1	a	To be totally honest, this game isn't that bad. It has very good and fun gameplay, but the developers gave up on the project a long time ago. It's still relatively enjoyable, and it's worth the small price tag. If you ever have a small bit of cash, throw it at ORION: Prelude. It's pretty fun with friends (although a little buggy), and the ragdolls are hilarious!  I've had this game since the day it came out, and I still think it's pretty good in terms of gameplay - acompanied by stunning graphics.
2207	0	a	When you paid $0.99 And Now It's free...

2210	0	a	Just don't buy ....don't... istant regret.  -low texture -bugged physics -Ai ?! 
2211	0	a	Forgive me lord for I have sinned  Seriously though, this game is incredibly bland and comes off as very ametureish. The UI looks terrible, the game still has lots of bugs, the environments are crazy bland (And WAY too big IMO,) the music is generic as hell, enemies are as dumb as they come and the gunplay just isn't that great. Sure, the game is usually $1 when it's on sale, and I've definitely gotten some great games for just $1 but here, it's not worth it. If you want a horde-mode style game that badly, just get Killing Floor. If you want a competitive shooter, get Counter Strike. If you really want to play a dinosaur shooter, I highly recommend the much more enjoyable Primal Carnage. Orion just isn't worth your time or money.
2212	0	a	Completely unfinished and broken. DO NOT BUY.
2213	0	a	its ♥♥♥♥
2214	0	a	it does not work on my screen so i cant play it
2215	0	a	This is the most worst. The gameplay isn't as fun as other dinosaur games I've played. Who the hell manages to make being a freaking dinosaur not fun?! Movement is glitchy and slow, leaving you open to be gunned down by the human players EASILY, even as the tankiest of dinos. The sounds are horrible - either loud and screeching to punish headphone users, or bland and forgettable. Never, EVER press the roar button if you wear headphones. YOU WILL REGRET EVERYTHING.  When the game makes even walking around the map a tricky chore, LET ALONE COMBAT, you know something's horribly wrong.   Play Primal Carange instead if you want some fun dino vs human action. PC isn't perfect by any means, but it gets you what you want: violent, chaotic combat mixed with some stealthy hunting in between. Also silly cheesy dialogue, if that's your thing. And while the t-rex is loud in that game, at least it doesn't attempt to rupture your eardrum like Orion does - and roaring as the T-rex does something useful! In PC, roars trigger different abilities for the dinosaurs. Neat. Also you can make the T-Rex headbang to music and that counts for a lot in my book. 
2216	0	a	basically a poor mans evolve
2217	0	a	Aside from the dev being super shady, this game is just as ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as it's price suggests.
2218	0	a	Worst 12 minutes of my life.
2219	0	a	No. Not a horrible game, *ahem* REVALATIONS 2012 *ahem* but still not good. It's trying to be Borderlands, but it's failing. Meh graphics, meh gunplay, meh fun. Good way to describe it: Meh. I'd give it maybe a 2/10 or a 3/10.
2220	0	a	THIS GAME...... no, this THING is awful  The Ai is completely broken, just jetpack to the nearest ♥♥♥♥ing rock and they will sit there thinking '♥♥♥♥! I wish I evolved to jump instead of choosing to inhabit a world full of deadly cliffs, eternal rain and trees that look like they exist, but don't'  At least the devs and dinos have a few things in common, like brains the size of wall nuts and trying to sell anything so they can buy a slab of dry meat.
2221	0	a	Terrible game. You know it's kind of red flag-ish when it's one dollar, so you should stop there, but if you're like me and get this game, you'll see what I mean. Introduced immediately with really shoddy-looking menus, and overall terrible interface, you see microtransactions everywhere so you can level up too. Then, once finally joining a decent game that doesn't kick you out after the first minute, you just see really, really, really ugly gameplay that's like a bad version of Killing Floor, but even worse. It's an open map with waves of dinosaurs that progressively get harder after waves where you get better too, but the dinosaurs just have a weird way of fighting that's so awkward and clunky it isn't fun. I could rant on for hours about how lacking this game is, but I think this summarizes it. Verdict: Awful game and should be never played by anyone.
7043	1	a	[EN/FR] So... A lot of people say ''That game is Poo'', but that not real. At the begin, its was a empty bugged game, but the game get a lot of update, and completely change. Now the game is really nice, that not the best game ever, but for something make indie, and with a price down to 0.99¥, no reason to reject that game....  Il faut savoir que si Orion est aussi mal jugé, c'est tous simplement que avant, ce n'etait rien d'autre qu'un jeu catastrophique. mais a l'heure actuelle, le jeu a énormément changé, en un tres bon jeu, surtout pour un petit indie, avec un prix reduit a 0.99￥. A essayer, difficile de ce plaindre pour ce prix la....
7045	1	a	Never played x3
2234	0	a	i payed for this useless thing and now its free its not even a real game
2235	0	a	I'm quite annoyed that I keep getting this game re-gifted to me by my friends. First, it was Dino: Beatdown, which was totally ordinary and mod-like in presentation (and not a good one at that), second I was gifted Dino: Horde, and I wasn't even sure if it was a different game. Finally, I was gifted this version, and while better than the other two, I'd hardly call a new engine a few more features a new game. It feels like there is always a new attempt at getting this game finished, it gets some updates, and then promptly disappears under a new title.   Would like to see some sort of 'finality' (and I mean real finality, not just stop updating it or re-releasing it as something else). The concept is great, but the delivery is constantly flawed, which is a real shame.   
7047	1	a	I wasted 99 cents

2250	0	a	game is bad sad game with a music copied by a famous game..
2251	0	a	This game makes practically no sense You're dropped into a world and told to shoot dinosuars A bunch of weird ♥♥♥♥ has happened to me in my playtime. I have;  -Been butt♥♥♥♥ed by pterodactyls -Been eaten by a T-Rex, in which I sat in its stomach while in the first person view as it boomed around, stomping on my teamates while it was having a temper tantrum -Recieved enough credits to start buying stuff I actually needed and gotten kicked from the game due to a supposed 'Error with my internet' -Met a lot of friendly people who shared their knowledge of the game openly and honestly (I'm not joking, the community is really friendly) -Played games that never ended -Played games that ended quickly -Gotten negative credits (my record was -12) -Been pushed off of a cliff to my doom by a stegosaurus -Revived a team mate while I was incapacitated -Been blinded by the stupid HUD freezing mechanic -Lagged to the point where everyone was still playing the game and ♥♥♥♥ but I couldn't damage the dinos or even use any ammo in my gun  Overall, it's a ♥♥♥♥ game. But the potential it has is amazing... It just needs polish. Then it won't be ♥♥♥♥.   Oh yeah, and ♥♥♥♥ pterodactyls. Most overpowered ♥♥♥♥ since ACR/noobtube/scavenger combo.

2269	0	a	this is a horrible game
2270	0	a	ORION: Prelude is a game about people fighting dinosuars in multiple game modes with weapon upgrades and player buffs as well as having the ability to play as a Dinosaur from Raptors to the giant Spinosuarus. On the surface, it seems really fun and a LOT like Primal Carnage, but this game is VERY buggy, which probably explains why it's regularly 99 cents. (I got it for 40 cents on sale.) There are very bad camera glitches as a dinosuar that make playing correctly impossible with the only solutions being either dying or re-joining the game. It's also isn't very balanced with players on the dinosuar side being able to pick boss dinosuars like the T-rex and Spinosuarus from the get-go, which are dinosuars that are VERY hard to kill with starter weapons. The textures aren't that great, the controls, especially for the Dinosuars, are very bad, the animations will kill you on the inside, and it gets very boring after a short ammount of time. This game may be cheaper, but I'd save for Primal Carnage or The Isle if you want to play a Dinosuar survival game. This game DOES give you lots of easy awards, though. So, there's that.

7063	1	a	This game is like Bubbliscious Bubble gum. You really think its the best investment for a dollar, so you buy it. At first, the sweet, blueberry flavour caresses your tounge, then it becomes bland after a half hour, so you begin stuffing more pieces into your mouth. After about 20 pieces, you realize that you've made a big mistake, and just shoved multiple chewy, corn starch-like objects in your mouth that provided no actual nourishment. Lesson: buy trident. Best game of all time. 11/10. Would recommend
2282	0	a	I bought this game when it was $9.99. I regret that decision.    3.6/10  
2283	0	a	other than it being ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ it's still pretty bad. models are janky as and it's badly optimized
7065	1	a	I bought this game and now it's free? Why? And do i get some bonus game items or what? Pls tell me I want to know.
2288	0	a	At first, i thought the game looked cool, you know, dinosaurs, guns, eplosions, Michael Bae, etc When i first started the game was on high graphics so i wasnt too fussed, turned it to low and i still got 20 fps when i can run dino d-day (much better dino game) at 60 fps on ultra!  i bought this game for my friends and believe me..........don't get this piece of ♥♥♥♥
2289	0	a	Personally, I hate it. I mean really not worth even 99 cents. The graphics are mediocre at best and the level objectives are compleatly confusing.not to mention that i don't even think you can play as a dinosaur in a game that revolves around them. It's like the developers said, 'Hey, you know what would be cool? If we had 'Call of Duty' and 'Jurassic Park' and put em' together!' Honestly, it looks like the game was made on a toaster. ---&gt;DO NOT BUY&lt;---
2290	0	a	One of the worst games iv ever played in my life.
7067	1	a	this game is absolute ♥♥♥♥ and i love it
2295	0	a	It's terrible.

7069	1	a	Better than Aliens™: Colonial Marines.
2297	0	a	i have this game now its charging me to play it
2298	0	a	ORION: Prelude  Oh dear this game ... I do not reccoment this game ! This game is so bad optimized that it will run 40 fps if you have an nvidea geforce gtx 980. But there is even more ! The animations are wierd. Your opjective in the game is hard to know because you do not really now what you have to defend...  1 cool thing: There are HALO cars in this game !  Overall Rating: 2/10

2302	0	a	This game is mad budget and really boring. Go play a game with a real horde mode like ME3 MP.
2303	0	a	Not that Good.
2304	0	a	No, I do not recommend this game.  I played a few minutes of it and already knew it was just another crappy shooter game, if you enjoy shooter games, then yeah give it a go, I enjoy shooter games but not awfuly made ones.  0/10
2305	0	a	To sum up my experience: it's a crappy left 4 dead with dinosaurs with blur that'd make you think your eyesight is going bad. 'but it's only 1 dollar kappa' CHILDREN IN AFRICA COULD'VE EATEN YOUR DOLLAR! YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED.
2306	0	a	Good concept... but the game needs a major optimization overhaul. I don't mind sub-par graphics.... but this game has been around for a few years and boasts about the constant updates and improvements made during this time. That being the case, there is no reason why I should get ok-ish to somewhat bad FPS on this game with minimal video settings, when other games like Skyrim and Call of Duty run smoothly on MAX settings.... If you're into not-so-great visuals coupled with not-so-great FPS, then this game is for you if you're willing to throw away a dollar... As for me, I'm going back to my 'real' games that at least function well enough that problems are hardly observed....
2307	0	a	While the gameplay itself could be very entertaining, something is terribly off with this game. While I am aware my laptop isnt a powerhouse, that is no reason for the game to have such low fps. We have come to the conclusion of terrible optimization. Sadly, 2/10 for me, but I really wish it would work.
2308	0	a	Bought this one when it was on sale. Provided a bit of entertainment but then found the game a bit pointless. Maybe I'm missing something and maybe some updates have made it a bit better, but probably better off spending your money elsewhere.
2309	0	a	Fun idea, looked fun, was fun for one round. After figuring out how to play the fun really drops off.
2310	0	a	For 99 cents this isn't a bad game at all. Certainly it is much better than it used to be, and what it used to be was quite literally a broken piece of ♥♥♥♥. but now its become a somewhat fun game for about five minutes, then I got bored and confused and gave up. So, there's that.
2311	0	a	Don't.
2312	0	a	I BOUGHT 4 PACK FOR 2 GAP!!! READ THIS ONLY IF YOU GET SIMILAR OFFER!!! I was not going to buy this game... Ever really. It first came to me when I saw WTF is... W/e this was named back then(considering it has changed name in my own inventory by now as well who can blame me for forgetting) Devs claim game now is better than it was. I don't really have a line of my own to compare it to. However I can compare it to my impression from what I saw years ago on WTF is... .  IT'S F|_|CKIN SAME!  Yup, it looks same. Anything with a wheel controls like ♥♥♥♥. I saw nobody even try to use vehicles. Now guns.... Guns don't know what recoil is. I do... It took me a while to understand that they don't.   Ok, so no recoil, shity weapons,shity driving...  Shity... Dinos... Yes dinos ... I wont go in to AI ,or lack of it because there is some, I think it is borrowed from zombie/alien shooter. Dinos look terrible even for years ago they look terrible. Maybe my texture settings are not on high maybe res isn't that good (who knows? Oh right I and 3 of my friends cozz I bought 4 pack), but dinos and not only dinos, all visuals look like CRAP-♥♥♥♥ BUNCH OF OF IT SMEARED OVER EVERYTHING... Game looks grey even when it is not grey... If that was meant to be well then... Why do I say though that dinos look like crap? Well reason is simple: I played Dino Crisis on PS1 long ago. Those looked better. Heck I replayed it on epsxe couple years ago it still looked good. 15-20 years later (aprox.) this comes out and it looks worse. Something is wrong there.  Now I did say 2 things here First that I bought 4 pack of this so one game cost me 0.5 gap... About 0.8 suds each. Currently it is priced at 0.79gbp per 1 and 1.99 per 4 At this price you might as well buy it because: it is fun TEAM shooter where you and your team of friends will have fun. Co-op mode is the only viable mode here(do note however there are plenty of good coop games out there but this one is OK for a weekend or two)   HOWEVER that said  Second thing I said was that alien or zombie shooter has similar AI... As in it always goes towards you... IT IS HORDE SHOOTER SAME AS THIS. With many big significantly important things to keep in mind: Singleplayer, Story, Survival, Turret modes, upgrades, drop upgrades, perm upgrades, progression system shall I even continue?(no) so I'd suggest if you aim for single player or lone wolf experience... Spend 10.99 on zombie or alien shooter and play that...  Or hell better yet...  http://store.steampowered.com/app/630/  it is free And due to this I do not recommend this game
2313	0	a	Totally ♥♥♥♥ing booring game, spent 5 mins in spawn while wawe completed... I don´t recommend this game.

2322	0	a	The game is ♥♥♥♥♥ly optimized and the graphics are complete garbage. Even for under a dollar (what I got it for) it isn't worth it.

2325	0	a	Cheap and boring shooter about dinosaurs.
2326	0	a	You know what this game reminds me of? Left 4 dead. But then replace Zombies with Dinosaurs. Then make the controls built SPECIFICALLY around a controller. Then make half your targets airborne. Then make them impossible to hit. Then replace the other half with chargers and tanks. Then ♥♥♥♥ it sideways, call it Orion Prelude, and release it half ♥♥♥♥♥ on Steam with compelling looking art that does NOT look like the game in ANY way, then make it $0.99! 3/10!
2327	0	a	this game would be better if it werent just a plain wave survival game. theres no storyline ive found and it makes it boring fast
7077	1	a	best game na  bet plot best boobies best story best graphics best movement animations game or the year by ign-1965
7079	1	a	This game is so terrible, and steam should be ashamed for allowing this to be even released in the state it is in. I hope steam will honor a refund for the first time ever. Game is so buggy and crashes. Worst $9 spent.
2328	0	a	This game is a mindless, boring shooter. You are just shooting on Dinosaurs, wchich don't even pose a threat to you. Maybe the bosses are more fun, but i quit after half an hour because the rest of the game is just boring. It's not even worth 10 cents. It's just a waste of time.
2329	0	a	Well, Its almost FREE, But sad to say Its just a time of waste if you feel like killing dinos all day with no story Progress, No well drawn people, And dont forget the Gameplay. Overall-1/10
2330	0	a	dino are too hard to kill buggy menu server button wont refresh repeats itself 2/10 would not bang
7081	1	a	Candy crush &gt; farmville &gt; ORION: Dino Horde
2334	0	a	Saw the devs begging people to give the game another try, reinstalled. Game crashes constantly on startup  0/10 Free is to expensive for this game, they'd have to pay to play it, and even then it would have to be a lot
7083	1	a	OK so the previous review was about how buggy this game could be, and i ♥♥♥♥ you not, for some non sensical reason, restarting your computer has fixed it... IDK. it shouldn't have made a difference, but it did. I beat 10 rounds solo, no crashes.... On the PLUS side, i get to play co-op with my new friends *YAY*  Someone needs to find out why a COMPUTER restart fixed this, that's like unplugging a toilet by flushing the one across the street....  So...  AWESOME GRAPHICS, FUN AS HELL CO-OP, Able to solo on easy or lower, PvP matches for the psychos out there who refuse to murder IRL. Unlocks, LEVELING, oh and weapons... It's Turok Co-Op meets Halo Reach... ♥♥♥♥ing awesome   *FORMER REVIEW BELOW*Formerly the Brutaly Dissapointing Review    I want to love this game so badly, the graphics are great, the co-op survival is gorgeous, the controls are intuitive,it's beautiful, simple and fun.  So why the downvote? BUGGY AS ALL HELL! For 2 day playing it I've been getting freezing and CRASH TO DESKTOPS non stop, like NON STOP! There's only 1 solutions they say, Verify Integrity (done that more then a dozen times, no change) I reinstalled, i changed graphics settings which is BS becaue my rig can run BF4 on max with SSAX16 at 40 fps But it CONSTANTLY CRASHES TO DESKTOP What about solution 2? Send them the Dump File? guess what.. CTD don't make a dump file, i checked....  So what does the all glorious dev say to do? Verify The Integrity....again...and I pass.....again.  If it works for you, this is better then TF2. If it doesn't work it's the most frustrating thing because it's so damn good and you get a huge game 'bock clock'. It's almost as bad as getting friend zoned.  Don't expect them to fix the bugs, if it's broke for you it stays broke, don't expect help or patches. At least it was only 1 dollar. If it works though, you're are one lucky SOB   Derisat the Air Pirate
2340	0	a	So if you kinda have a old computer do not get this. If you have a realy old computer definetly dont get this. I dont know if you have a brand new computer maby get this  but its probely not worth the mony
2341	0	a	The worst FPS game I have ever played.
2342	0	a	Very fun trailer. All negative critic comes from famous game observers and positive comments from some random guys, I just glad i didn't see what it was before, because after 3 YEARS OF SUPPORTING it's just terrible.

7087	1	a	I've been having so much fun playing Dino Horde that I forgot to eat and died!
7089	1	a	I had some nice survival rounds with a bunch of people over the course of multiple maps. Sort of Killing Floor with dinos. Roaming some canyons with a four- or five-man party - on foot, inside tanks, mechs or other vehicles - killing a big T-Rex and seeing his ragdoll-body fall down in slow-motion was a pretty epic and satisfying feeling. The general gameplay looks and feels a bit awkward at times, animations and gunplay aren't as 'tight' and polished as one may know from AAA shooters, but it's decent enough, the Unreal engine keeps it together and gives it an alright look.   People say there are day-1-bugs still left, only obvious bug I've seen so far was a teammate getting stuck in a tree by flying dino tossing him in there. You can surely get some fun hours out if it - for 1,00 EUR a steal, basically. I still need to try the other co-op and PvP modes. Open world with day/night cycle and loot sounds interesting, just as beating up humans with playable dinos. And it seems the game is still being actively developed/enhanced.   The very bad metacritic rating scared me a bit, but it is apparently related to a much earlier, now-gone phase of the game, in it's current state it probably deserves better. No idea how many players will be left after the current free period. I hope it won't die too soon, it looks interesting. And I hope the netcode is stable enough. My first attempts of joining other people's games were greeted either with timeouts or lags. Then I found a good lobby and sticked to it until the host closed it down. It seems to be working with peer-to-peer mechanics; unfortunately - dedicated servers would make it easier to avoid such issues. Peer-to-peer games often trouble me.
2346	0	a	I would like a refund this game ♥♥♥ af and not what i expected wathc gameplay before buying not worth 50 cents
7091	1	a	Lemme tell you a story: One upon a time there was a player who was eager to get the 'You're Redikulous' achievement, so he hosted a game playing with his fellow friends. The group of dino hunters progressed as they withstood thousands of gigantic lizards. Two hours later, when they finally reached the last wave with the near victory in sight, the host started to run into a wall, followed by the message 'server timeout'.  GG  
2354	0	a	Don't get this game. Spend your $1 on a frozen coke at MC Donalds.
2355	0	a	birth controll should have been considered

2365	0	a	Being a dinosuar in this game is cancer... I couldnt even damage the enemy. Mega thumbs down from smeagol.
7097	1	a	What the hell do you even want more?This game is freaking amazing.For 0.99?!Do the devs even earn something?Or is it more developed towards the players than profit? It's worth the money.It's fun.Buy it.
7099	1	a	Halo... With Dinosaurs.
7101	1	a	  Is It Bad That My PC Cant Run This Lol
7103	1	a	OMFG, ok so to start off the metacritic review is flat out wrong and either needs to be updated or removed. This game is downright amazing to play with friends, its like every childhood dream, its requires skills and is super fun to play with friends as you can do large survival missions, the vehicles are epic and the gameplay lothough repetative never gets old i highly reccomend it and tell you to ignore the ratings!
7105	1	a	Best Game I've Played in a very long time!, In the league of Battlefield 4, Crysis 3, and beats NS2 and most of my other FPS games.
7107	1	a	Nice game
7109	1	a	ya can't go wrong with a 1 dollar game. Over 60 updates, awesome and a large array of guns. What do i mean by all this? GET IT ITS ONLY 1 DOLLAR IT WILL MAKE YOU ADDICTED TO IT
2376	0	a	dinosaurs had feathers  this game has no feathers
7111	1	a	this was surprisingly worth the dollar i payed for it
2377	0	a	Looks and plays like a Roblox minigame.
2378	0	a	This is just....
2379	0	a	The game is still crap even after all the updates its not user friendly and has texture loading and connection problems it doesent give you hints when playing. I TELL ANYONE WHO DOESENT HAVE THIS GAME {DO NOT BUY IT} i will give my copy away in a trade menu for 30 cents for anyone looking to buy.  This game should be bought by absolutly no-one. The amount of time making level's in this game should be the amount of time a player playes it for.  When you push sooooo many people away buy making a game that cost money that should be free you push away player's because of NON POPULATED server's this game is multiplayer but there is no one online to play with congrates because this game sucks.
7113	1	a	i love this game
7115	1	a	Its only a dollar or in england 0.79 I mean its soooo worth it as 0.79 or a dollar is nothing for this amount of fun im surprised at the cost. BRILLIANT
2384	0	a	So I started playing and looked at the wall because I was checking my surround. a dinosower slid up the wall doing the walking animation then began to slide sideways on the skybox while sliding it did not have a animation so it flew like a angel on sunday 
2385	0	a	Silly gameplay occasionally glitchy with floaty controls,wouldnt recommend
2386	0	a	Wasted money on this bug ridden game 1/10 would not buy bugged games again
2387	0	a	Ordinary, recycled, and just plain confusing as there is no tutorial. Wasted a $1.09 I could have spent on a chocolate bar that would have been much more satisfying than this game.
2388	0	a	heretical,duisgusting,tainted, evil, divorced peice of dinosaur slaughtering sh*t. burn it all
7117	1	a	Could use more bacon.

7121	1	a	Most broken game I've ever played but this game is so broken that it's good. It's like eating sushi from a 711 but something in the sushi makes you forget show ♥♥♥♥♥♥ it tastes so you keep eating it. Glitches and broken mechanics usually ruin a game but not this one. This game is so bad that it's good.
7123	1	a	Best Game Ever Played
2396	0	a	this a very gud game  They have me at gun point here plz dont buy this peice of ♥♥♥♥     
2397	0	a	Despite the developer's numerous attempts, Orion is still an unwhelming game at the end of the day.
2398	0	a	This game is a ♥♥♥♥ing piece of poop pooo i mean the creators can just shove this ♥♥♥♥♥ game up their poop shoot and jerk off each others asian size weewee's and just ♥♥♥♥ this and guess what.......♥♥♥♥ U MOTHER ♥♥♥♥ERS this game can suck all the dongs in the world because it's a horny ♥♥♥♥!!!!!!! s............l..................u...........t.........and it may be the jews fault white power im rotting in hell. You're all a bunch of female dogs and u know what i mean. screw you adam thien suck a ♥♥♥♥♥♥
7125	1	a	this game has taught me to never give up in what you doing. this game went from a %35 aproval rating to %75 in 60 updates. the special thing about this game is the devs never gave up on what they thought would be a good game!
2400	0	a	I love a FEEL GOOD story, especially one where there is an underdog involved. I always root for the underdog. In this case the story of an underdog has nothing to do with a storyline that you follow in the game, but has ONLY to do with the developer(s) of ORION: Prelude. It is sad. Very Sad. Not because of what they went through as you would expect, but because their story about making a better game over time is ' more fictional' than the game itself. They may have worked hard but it is still TERRIBLE. Just because some people are willing to dig through the trash to find a half eaten donut does not mean it is good does it? How about a little day old meat? mmmmm.... that is what you get with this game at best... day old meat found in the back of a butcher shop on the ground next to the dumpster. If you like that, you will like this too!  MY COMPLAINT: They suckered me in to buying this game thinking that I was helping someone overcome a financial debt of time and love that they put into the shooter gaming society. As it turns out, all they did is waste my time and money. The only achievement they have truly accomplished is in getting a million plus people to buy something a million times for a buck... when it's not worth a penny! To me, that is the same thing as robbing people. They are problably laughing their butts off all the way to the bank while innocent people are paying them for trash. They are essentially bums on a street corner asking for a dollar. That's fine... I can accept that. But don't tell me that they have succeeded at doing anything except stealing innocent teens (and adults) money.  Bottom line: They say they fixed it, but it does not compare to anything else you will have in your library because nothing else LIKE THIS would have ever been released. It's that bad!
7127	1	a	RAWR IM A DERPY DINOTARD RAWR FEAR MY FANGS AND MASSIVE DINOCOCK I WILL CRUSH YOUR PATHETIC LIFE WITH IT  somethings wrong with me, I should stop typing now
7129	1	a	wow wasted 50 cents on this game and its f2p now lol 
7131	1	a	Holy ♥♥♥♥ i bought that game so give my back my MONEY!
2402	0	a	Step 1 make a game thats good and fun. Step 2 make money off of it. Step 3 make the game free to play.  These steps describe this game.
2403	0	a	this game is needs improving they should make the graffics better and make the game openworld survivel.
2404	0	a	I bought 4 keys... how is this game free?
2405	0	a	I didn't think they would make a game off my favorite novel Gay T-Rex Law Firm Executive Boner but they did and man that just gets me so flaccid like on a scale from 1 to wet noodle id be angel hair spaghetti.  But for real this game is an anal shipment of crap and I hope no one suffers the same fate as i did.  3 out of a George Forerunner.
2406	0	a	This is horribly optomized dont trust the requirents this game is literally a piece of ♥♥♥♥ Tbh tho, 4/20 ♥♥♥♥♥♥
7133	1	a	Similar to Killing Floor.
2408	0	a	i have more then 1 reason why this is not a good game (bad game)  1: i playeed this 8 hours then a long time not played and then when i want to play it (today) it doe not start so i look up forums aint standing me problem so i deleted and installed again and it said missing file but it stopt the download when it said missing file -_-  2: you need a good grapihc card and or good PC
7135	1	a	I still enjoy it. For the price of one freaking dollar per copy this is insane.
2409	0	a	dont buy this game evn if its for 1 dollar this game lags everytime. THE WORST GAME OF ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2410	0	a	Sucks. Game it self is fun but it is very hard to find a match that is not full, does not lag, or boots you. Fix that issue and game will be great.
2411	0	a	In this game you can play as a dinosaur who has to protect eggs and eat spacemen, or a spaceman who has to steal the eggs and shoot dinosaurs. I don't think much planning went into making this game, in fact I think this is just two different games, from teams who had zero communications with each other, shoved together and released for 75 cents. This is a game that Ed Wood would release if he made video games about dinosaurs. This is a game that Strong Bad would think of after drinking too much Mountain Dew.
2412	0	a	Buy this game for someone you do not like!
2413	0	a	terrible isay terrible game terrible i say who lieks dino's people that like dino's are IDIOTIC dino's suc k my ♥♥♥♥
2414	0	a	This game had a fun idea but failed completely in realizing it, its poorly optimised (runs de same amount of horible on whatever setting), the enemies are juist plain boring and the 'special abilities' of your class are just plain pointless.
2415	0	a	As far as shooters go, zombies and people are the only thing I like killing!  It's fun for a while, but when you've tried all of the modes, it gets pretty boring.
7137	1	a	Turok meets Halo. Good fun.
2417	0	a	Don't even bother buying this game...
2418	0	a	Meh, the game is O.K. i guess. If it kinda appeals to you, buy it. It's only 0.99$. But I wouldn't recommend it. I would rather spend 0.99 on a TF2 ticket. Right now it's just holding up space in my library. Kinda fun with friends.
2419	0	a	Crap game.
2420	0	a	MUST HAVE: fast pc in order to play right! very slow game, bad graphics. crashes when you least expect it! extreme lag, if you fix these thing would be a great game! (like tf2 but with dinosaurs)
7139	1	a	At one dollar, I would highly recommend this game.
7141	1	a	this game is so fun! i could just shove it up my butt yaa its that great!!! :)
2425	0	a	I played this game for 1.2 hours total. I feel so dirty, There isn't a shower that can wash away my regrets for accepting this game on my steam list.
2426	0	a	If you have an AVERAGE pc DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Very unoptimized to the point where it's not even worth the $1. But I guess if you have a pc that is Above Average, then get this game if you must. But why would you get this game instead of playing WAAY BETTER Free To Play Games?
2427	0	a	strated to get really ticked off bought the game it worked the first time i tried playing it and now it doesnt even load when i try to play it def waste of$1
2428	0	a	50% terrible 25% hard 25% nothing 0% need to buy this game
2429	0	a	why does the dev suddenly want money for this game? i know its low priced, but to me its not worth it. uninstalling now.
7143	1	a	Futuristic weapons Prehistoric enemies Turok meets Halo, absolutely blast of a game!
2430	0	a	I paid for this game and it got for free. How dare you people do this kind of thing?
7145	1	a	Its a single dollar buy it, you kill dinos and its fun.
7147	1	a	  my grandma had an aneurysm and instead of helping her and calling 911 i played this game instead and to be honest it was worth it because my grandma is an absolute nincompoop xdddddddddddddddD
7149	1	a	A quick pro/cons list of this game:  Pros: -Looks decent -Tons of game modes -Tons of character customization -Runs well  Cons: -Not the best graphics or animations -Not a huge playerbase -Really weird UI that reminds me of an arcade cabinet  The game is definitely fun, isn't too involving, easy to jump into a game on a moments notice and have fun. Great if you have a few friends.
7151	1	a	Very fun with friends
7153	1	a	this game is very fun if you have a decent computer.
7155	1	a	Why the ♥♥♥♥ did I buy this?  
7157	1	a	nice game worth 1 €
7159	1	a	could be better also could be worse 7/10 would bang againe ;p  EDIT: YALL BETTER FIX THIS BROKEN MACHINE CUZ AINT NO LIGHT THREW THE BROKEN SCREEN HONKY HONKY HONK  ANY OF YOU CRACKAERS WANA PURCHASE SOME OF MY METH
2442	0	a	There is a reason this game is $1  Firstly, for a multiplayer game there are rougly 20 servers at any given time, oh and about 18 of those are above 200 ping.  Secondly, the graphics are awful, they would have been acceptable about ten years ago. The game mode balance is hoorendous, some modes being ridiculously hard for the dino's, some the other way round. The gameplay is slow, clunky and badly designed. There is nothing good about this game, go and play ARK survival evolved as it is a much superior game.
2443	0	a	I highly recommend that you do not buy this game, because it's just a complete re-release of the previous game. The dinosaur AI is so bad, I'm sure that I could do better and the bugs oh don't get me started on them. This game is riddled with small and irritating glitches. I understand that sometimes it's very fun to play crappy games especially with a friend, but this is just too boring, broken and downright ♥♥♥♥ to play. The game has one of the most clunky and buggy menus I have ever seen in a video game and I've played kinect games which usually have shocking menus. ORION: Prelude does it's best to make sure that you do not know what the ♥♥♥♥ you are doing, and if you somehow work out what to do it kills all of the fun with bugs and ♥♥♥♥ AI. I had to think hard to find a good thing about this game, and all I can say is the graphics aren't terrible. But to even play on these settings you need a really good pc, because I swear the developers did not do anything to try to optimise this mess of a game. From playing the game, I have concluded that this game is just a load of small bits of other games glued together with ♥♥♥♥ (the warthog and ghost from Halo, the wave defense mode from Killing Floor and the gun shop and base defense from Empires). I swear the game feels like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mod or a terrible indie game cobbled together really quickly. All in all this game is a piece of ♥♥♥♥, do not buy it even though it's cheap you could spend that 80 pence on another game or something.
7161	1	a	Its really fun when you arent feeling a competitive mood and you dont feel like playing Counter Strike xD Super fun game with friends, really chill if you dont feel like doing anything
2450	0	a	First problem is... This developer makes you pay for the game, but then makes you pay mictrotransactions if you want to have any of the customization options with your carachter. Are you serious? A bit greed don't you think... pay for the game, and then pay more for base line options.  As for the game itself, It's fun enough for about a half hour... but then you realize there is no campaign, no story mode, no depth.... its just 'Survive X number of waves'.... over and over. Meh, I can live with that... but then you realize there isn't much depth to the gameplay either. The classes don't feel different enough from each other... and the weapons lack any distinction either.   Then there are the REALLY irritating issues like.... when you die, you have to wait 45 seconds to respawn.... and when you do, you are nowhere near your party, or the gear that you dropped when you died. Good luck making it back to the group before the wave is finished. On top of that, you lose your upgrades.... sigh,
2451	0	a	I want my $0.99 back
2452	0	a	Uninstall simulater 2k12

2455	0	a	Bought it on 2012 by the name Orion: Dino Horde and is a 4man pack too ! Played it once and left in my Library till today.  December 2015 Review.   How far Orion it has improve since this game sit untouched many years after my first gameplay. I would never imagine myself to touch this game again. It leave me a very really bad impression after my first gameplay but today Orion has make a difference in comparison to heyday.  I came back after I found out the reversal of the review been gaven, it goes from Negative to to Positive.One gotta see to believe. What can I say after a try out then letting this piece of game sit unattenended?!  Well... first of all, Do not expect any fancy or detailed graphic on this games,soundtrackwise is pretty decent and good to go with; to this you will find yourself TODAY Orion:Prelude is kind of Pretty-Cheesilly-Wonky-Onehella of Fun shooting game !! Seriously this game is FUN ! You will get alot of gun,ride a jeep,steer a tank,handle a Goliath and fly a heli-hover-plane-thingy. Not to mention there is lot of skin and hat to be applied from.  This game get really cheap when on steam sales. Buy 1 for yourself maybe a 4 man pack too as well. Sit back,enjoy the laughter and shooting frenzy with your friends. This game does earn a worth to be in your library. Give it a try today. It was insanely cheesy fun.  Well I feel like I'm the Marine in The Avatar and fighting that Blue Monkey and Toruk Maktor ! We are tryin to take over their planet after all !!!
7173	1	a	Worth my last 50 cents
7175	1	a	I love this game, best like 50 cents ever spent.
2456	0	a	You say the game is fixed? let me tell you, I have not been able to play the game without any lag! and I have a Intel Core i7 NEW! this game also seems largely boring, all my friends regreted the buy so did I, 4/10 (Broken Laggy Mess with some funny moments) this is a personal opinion if you liked it, then im very happy for you but for me its very broken.
7177	1	a	very cheap lots of bugs
7179	1	a	This is great game that is also cheap.
7181	1	a	You kill dinosaurs, whats not to love.
2463	0	a	Congratulations. This is the only game that I have ever seen to be the worst game of 2012, AND the worst game of 2015. They should get an award. 
7183	1	a	better than dino city tenoutoften hotornot bestgamepizza
7185	1	a	This game is really good. To me it play well. But I suggest seeing for yourselves.
2465	0	a	This game is a trainwreck
2466	0	a	Is it worth $.99? Sure. Is it worth your time? No
7187	1	a	The game is decent for the cost. The only problem I have with it is that is was gifted to me, now Steam is telling me I have to buy it in order to play it.
2467	0	a	I really wanted to play this game unfrotinately i get disconnected every time i try to join a server even when i get into one instant disconnect. i was looking foward to playing this but i made a mistake buying it.
7189	1	a	from what little i played of this it was fun but i didnt get much time into it 
7191	1	a	This game was so crazy awesome! with just the right amount of glitch and insane dino killing that i rate this game a 11 out of 10 for 1 dollar games!
7193	1	a	i love this game the feel and desin is uique and awesoe (not good at spelling so dont judge and my keyboard sucks)
7195	1	a	This game is to C.O.D. what Adult Swim is to The Simpsons.  If this makes sense to you then you DESERVE to own this game.  It's a Buck. What else are you gonna buy for a buck? A Candy bar? You'll get FAT. A Soda pop? You'll get FAT. A Cheeseburger? You'll get FAT. Don't get FAT, get this instead.
2468	0	a	Was a really fun game untill they wigged with everything...
2469	0	a	Its as bad as the title suggests.
7197	1	a	I Absolutly Love Fighting Dino's in Space! This is my absolute favorite steam find and i am looking forward to their up and comming sandbox game from Spiral. Keep up your Indi Gold.
2470	0	a	ABsolute piece of ♥♥♥♥. Would not recommend to my friends. This game is so glitchy and the gameplay is just absolute ♥♥♥♥. It's literally just a ♥♥♥♥ fest of awkward dinosaurs running towards you and you shooting them with you no recoil when hipfired gun. This is possibly one of THE WORST games of 2013/2014. Completely fix the glitches before you release the game. If there are a few glitches, I wouldn't mind. But there is one literally around every corner. Don't release a game that is still broken and is in progress. Even if it is on Earl Access or not. So yea. Enough of my rant. ♥♥♥♥ this game. Fix your ♥♥♥♥. Spend your money on something better. Like, Natural Selection 2. Or Maybe even a classic like Star Wars Battlefront 2. But seriously. ♥♥♥♥ this game. 0/10 would not play again. Waste of money. Peace.
2471	0	a	would never recomend (no teamwork)
7199	1	a	Played once and it crashed my computer. The Metascore is misleading.
2472	0	a	Won't run very well on my mediocre computer. Put the visuals down as low as possible and it didn't help much. The game seems fun but I can't play it.
7201	1	a	Boy do i feel sorry for you if you didn't get the early games hwen they were free. You would have got ths 100% free, and boy it is fun.  9/10 Would Slow-mo Shoot a Trex in the face again.
2473	0	a	really good but lagg to much idk why but its a really cool game to get on and play XD
7203	1	a	The best game ever made.
7205	1	a	Best game I ever played for $0.99.
2476	0	a	Not even worth $0.49
2477	0	a	This is an all around disappointing game. I spent $0.99 on it, and still got extremely depressed after playing it. ORION: Prelude is an FPS dinosour survival game, that focuses on simply shooting dinos before they eat you.   When I first entered the game, after playing five minutes, I knew it wasn't anything great- but at least at that point it was still worth spending one dollar to see what the game was like. Yet after each minute passed successively, it just got worse and worse. I realized that the graphics were pretty terrible, and that if you wanted to really obtain good gear, you would have to play for at least 30 hours, which I just wasn't willing to put into a crappy game that was not fun at all after 10 minutes.   Since then I've played a little more, only to realize that very few poeple play it, making it hard to find specific lobby of your choice.   ORION: Prelude is NOT at all worth the $0.99 it charges. It is disappointing and just plain stupid.
7207	1	a	it's freakin BIG and run so fast but FUN!
7209	1	a	OKAY game, people behind it seem like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s though.
7211	1	a	Very awesome game for less than 1€.So much action and the enviroment is just astonishing
7213	1	a	good game but not the best single-player experience 
2478	0	a	Unless you enjoy playing endless rounds of killing dinosaurs...then I guess this game is here for a reason...but if not, as usual, then don't even bother to look into this game, even when its on sale for 99% off, becuase trust me...its still not even worth it...like seriously, I am still doubting myself of purchuring this game...I want my $0.99 back fow
7215	1	a	Killing dinos is what i do :D
7217	1	a	The graphics for this game are amazing. On the highest settings you can see the detail put into the maps. The AI in the game is pretty well done, there are only a few times where a dinosaur will get stuck in a wall or rock. guns are fun although the sighs are all the same so hip fire is the best option. overal a really good and fun game.
7219	1	a	Theres no faking,I love this game its one of my favorite indies on steam!
7221	1	a	Amazing and it's even free to play now!
7223	1	a	A worth it dino horde game of all time
7225	1	a	One dollar, why the ♥♥♥♥ not?
7227	1	a	Amazing game bit laggy but isn't every online game other than that i love this game
2486	0	a	this is more disapointing than my son
7229	1	a	If you have some friends willing to play, it can be some mediocre fun. If you don't, you'd have more fun playing Warframe.
2487	0	a	I don't remember where I heard this but 'You can judge a fps by it's shotgun'. I tend to find this to be true at least in my case. Which is where I'm sad to say the shotgun sucks.
2488	0	a	I buggy $0.99 game. Lost nothing, gained nothing.
7231	1	a	:)
7233	1	a	this game is great
7235	1	a	I believe that we all had a dream of fighting or being a dinosaur. ORION: Dino Horde brings this dream to reality... well, at least they did it visually. True, Dino Horde may not be the most beautiful game out there. The characters you and your comrades control, run and perform their tasks in impractical and awkward manners, and giant dinosaurs break the laws of physics once their health points reach zero. Simply speaking, this game has a lot of flaws.  Though, I can't really say these flaws killed the joyous atmosphere when I played the game. The humans have amazing technology, which somewhat resembles that of the Halo Universe. On the other hand, despite their primitive traditions of chewing and tossing rocks, the dinosaurs proved themselves to be a challenge.  ORION: Dino Horde is not meant to be taken seriously. It's a game where everyone plays with a smile on their face. With a huge variety of weapons and abilities, followed by a decent number of game modes, Dino Horde is a game that offers a lot of alternative styles of playing the game.  Right now, as of the date this review is given, ORION: Dino Horde has the price of only $0.99. It's fun, hilarious, and suitable for both casual and hardcore players. If you want to give this game a try, now's the chance.
2489	0	a	THank God its only 0.99$.....  do i have to say more??? The game has no direction....Just dont waste a single penny on this game....Graphics is not good enough...dinosaurs looks like its made of clays and crayons....Gameplay is aweful
2490	0	a	No. Just No. Not even for 99 cents.
2491	0	a	how has this game been released three times and still isnt done 4/10
7237	1	a	the unintstalling process worked great.
2492	0	a	laughing just at the fact that they put random (fake? who knows) people comments on theyr video to show how good theyr game is..  'this game is ♥♥♥♥' randomguy25 'never hated a game so much' trollaccount4ever
2493	0	a	The game is a mediocre shooter, but the devs are the main reason I'm giving this game a negative review. I do not want to support developers that partake in asset theft. You can google the developer for more information, there is so much shady going on there.
7239	1	a	this game amazed me for 0.99 Euro! TRICKSHOTTING DINO'S 4 EVA    9.5/10 -IGN GOOD GAME WE ONLY DONT LIKE THE FLYING ♥♥♥♥.

2496	0	a	Very laggy and slow. IDK if it's my computer or not.
2497	0	a	its not very good its on par with or slightly better than browser based games
2498	0	a	I saw the metascore of 36 but the game was on sale for a $1.50, so I figured I'd take a chance. Well, I gambled and lost. Let's just say that giving it a metascore of 36 is being extremely generous. It's an incredibly stupid and poorly-made game; I can't wait to un-install it.
7249	1	a	I got it when it was expensive
7251	1	a	It's like a Counter Strike,with dinosaurs,and pressing Y will generate a FATAL HIT :) I love this game.
7253	1	a	Great game,  to idle for cards.
7255	1	a	Remember that this was $1? Now don't waste a dollar for this ♥♥♥♥ :D
7257	1	a	After getting a buff PC I can say this game is completely worth the .99 cents.  I honestly love this game, I wish more people would play it, I mainly have to hop in 100+ pinged servers.
7259	1	a	Great game!
2499	0	a	Just.. don't support them

2505	0	a	This game is only really worth it to play with friends. Even then its way too glitchy for my taste coupled with poor gameplay. I only put the number of hours I did because me and a friend turned the difficulty high up and laughed at the newer players getting slaughtered by an ocean of meat and teeth.  Would it be worth trying out? Maybe. But I would not recommend it unless you want to play a game with cartoon stupid enemy ai, cartoon bobble-head accessories seen on players, and a musical number that repeats itself so much that I have to listen to heavy metal to get it out of my head.  Oh yes and the Rex himself likes to throw giant boulders at you with his mouth
7269	1	a	make the dinos extinct again in a glitchy manner but sh:t it was (nearly) 99cents 10/10
2508	0	a	This game is not worth whatever it is put on sale for ever. Just not a fun shooter. If you want dinosaurs get primal carnage or dino d-day, anythingnother than this. SHAME, SHAME, SHAME, SHAME.
7271	1	a	Fun game, really. I love the Halo-like feel of it and the various classes are a nice touch. Some of the maps are repetative (and no I'm not just talking about the day/night maps), but are overall fun. I just really wish people played more of the other modes other than survival.   Them ost SEVERE problem with this game is the crashing and lagging.. the developers of this game really need to watch the 'Leroy Jenkins' video and find out what happens to a computer when you have too many enemies spawning at once! Hard to shoot dinos when they are lagging the Hell outta my computer! That and coupled with random disconnects makes this game almost more of a frustration than a game.   But Hell why am I complaining for $1?   This game is fun and if your computer won't take a dump while trying to play it, you're in for a serious thrill.
7273	1	a	Got 10 USD worth of coins in it for buying a 1 euro game.  666/10

7281	1	a	if you like killing things then this is game for you  :)  
2519	0	a	Unlike the trailer said, the steam reviews are right. The only thing nice in this game are the art assets, pretty much everything else is garbage. You truly get the quality you're paying for.
7283	1	a	One of the funnest dong hopping gaems of all time. If you like dino-based autism and want to kill fugging dinos while smokan weed and circlejerking with your gayass ♥♥♥♥♥♥ friends, then this is the game to get. The leader of the company however is a greedy sociopath however.

2528	0	a	Like a poor man's Evolve. A VERY poor man. Just terrible connectivity, the menus are a mess, the dinosaurs are all glitching across the field; It's near impossible to shoot a pterodactyl. This one is an AVOID game.

2531	0	a	It committed the cardinal sin of having flying enemies in an FPS.  0/10 no just no

7289	1	a	STAY AWAY FROM ME DINO!!!! &gt;:V ILL KILL YOU!!!! 10/10 would run from the dinos again!!!!
2536	0	a	this game sucks it lags way to much

2538	0	a	yeah, bought a full game several years ago and now i have a f2p moneygrab game instead that doesn't even show up in my libary anymore! i call this a huge scam and a facekick for everyone who ever spent their money on that game!!! i demand a compensation other than some ingame crap i can't even access for this -.-'
7291	1	a	A better dinosaur game than ARK: Survival Evolved
2539	0	a	This was a very quick review, because there doesn't seem to be a lot to the content. This game feels like an arena-styled, Jurassic Park meets Quake. You encounter waves of Dinosaurs, which get progressively more difficult. Killing these waves and surviving earns you points, which can then be spent to purchase new weapons and upgrades. Large Dinosaurs appear which you can fight and then assist in the capture of as side objectives for additional points. The game has a solo option where you have computer controlled NPC's assisting you as a team, or a multiplayer version where you can battle in a group. The graphics are slightly below average for games coming out today, the map board isn't very large and the game is very repetitive. Unless this is your cuppa java, I don't know if you would like it. I prefer better graphics, some kind of storyline, and less repetitiveness, but this game is more about Dinosaur Body Count. I wouldn't recommend it.
2540	0	a	There's a magic potion you can buy, that makes you forget you ever played ORION: Predule it's called bleach
2541	0	a	Making this free2play is a problem
2542	0	a	Oh god... at first I thought I was going to be able to write some hilarious review about how it was the best Dinosaur Survival Simulator of all time... but it's not.   To be quite blunt with you all, this is the worst game I have played in my entire life. And I have played a lot of games. This game takes the cake for being the most worthless piece of garbage that I have ever had the misfortune of wasting time on. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE COOL TO FIGHT DINOSAURS - I REALLY DID! But once I started playing, I realized that it just was not going to work.  I was able to make it through the first wave of a survival match, and after shooting down 8 velociraptors, I realized that this was not the game for me; or rather, this was not the game for anyone. Anyone who tells you this game is decent is a child with absolutely no experience with any other games, because I'm pretty sure this deserves the title of not only Worst Game of the Year, but Worst Game of the Decade. The only thing I was impressed by was how bad it was...  Graphics: 0/10 Gameplay: 0/10 Sound: 0/10 Fun: 0/10 Premise: 10/10  0/10 Would not reccommend to a friend.
2543	0	a	YOU KNOW A GAME'S BAD WHEN THEY TRY STEALING CONTENT FROM CALL OF DUTY
2544	0	a	Not worth a dollar. These people have ripped off other companies assets and are going to get a Dino Beat Down soon enough.
2545	0	a	So this game was earlier known as ORION: Dino Beatdown and ORION: Dino Horde, but it's not mentioned anywhere in store page and haven't exactly found any other reason for that than making it harder to find bad reviews. Thankfully I only spend under euro, but I already knew that I disliked Dino Horde and as game wasn't expensive I just bought it before realising this.   To summarize: even though it has every desireable PC options included thanks to Unreal 3, it's pretty unoptimized and looks hideous. I can't count how many times dino spawned right in front of me even when I haven't played that long, guns look, sound and feel really powerless toys, menus and hud feel like mess, filled one game with bot player and they are simply brainless and coop doesn't even seem to matter as long as you simply shoot even more brainless dinos.   Only thing making it worthwhile is price at this point, but I still wouldn't buy it. They should've just let this thing die ages ago instead of trying to rename it every week.   - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  Eli tätä peliä on aiemmin myyty nimillä ORION: Dino Beatdown ja ORION: Dino Horde, mutta sitäpä ei mainitakaan kauppasivulla enkä ole ainakaan itse löytänyt tälle mitään parempaa syytä kuin tehdä huonojen arvostelujen löytämisestä vaikeampaa. Onneksi en tuhlannut peliin edes euron vertaa, mutta tiesín jo vihaavani Dino Hordea ja koska peli ei ollut yhtään kallis niin ostin sen ennen tuon tajuamista.   Summa summarum: vaikka peli sisältää joka ikisen perusasetuksen jota PC räiskinnältä voi haluta kiitos Unreal 3:sen, jostain syystä peli näyttäisi olevan tosi huonosti optimoitu ja näyttää järkyttävän kauhealta. En enää pysty laskemaan kuinka monta kertaa dino spawnasi suoraan eteen vaikken ole edes pelannut niin kauaa, aseet kuulostavat, näyttävät ja tuntuvat erittäin voimattomilta leluilta, valikot ja hudi tuntuvat hieman sotkuisilta, yhdessä pelissä käytetty bottipelaaja oli täysin aivoton ja tiimipeli ei tunnu edes sen kummemmin olevan tarpeen kunhan vain tappaa vielä aivottomampia dinoja.   Ainoa asia mikä tekee pelistä enää pelaamisen arvoisen on hinta, mutten siltikään ostaisi sitä. Niiden olisi vain kannattanut jättää tämä tuotos kuolemaan sen sijaan että muuttaisivat sen nimeä viikottain.
2546	0	a	not even worth 99p its the worst game that i have  
2547	0	a	I think this is one of the worst piece of sh*t games i have ever payed for i want my .79 cents back. The graphics are horrible, the game is a laggy piece of trash. 0/10 War Z is better-IGN
2548	0	a	ORION: Dino Horde (DH) is an updated version of Dino Beatdown (DB) despite what many users claim.  Originally copies of DB were retitled as DH after an update, claiming that they are different games is similar to claiming that TF2 became a new game after they added item updates.  Onto the review.  Dinosaurs + Sci-Fi soldiers + Coop + Giant maps should equal unmitigated fun, yet DH doesn't seem to rise above tediousness, for the longest time you could connect to servers despite opening ports, stable connections or close proximity.  I will say that I have not played this game recently, and maybe the game has changed for the better but given my past experience I am not compelled to try it again any time soon.  Check other reviews who have played the game lately.

2550	0	a	its worth 1$ thats about it.. crappy sounds... crappy play.. crappy gfx and crappy controls.. but for 1$ its okay.
2551	0	a	This is one of the worst games I have ever played. Even at 99 cents, it is a waste of your money and time. In fact, I wish I could pay 99 cents to remove it from my Steam account.  Edit: I have since asked Steam Support to remove it from my account. Goodbye forever, Orion.
7293	1	a	Why can't I have a game in which I kill dinosaurs with ♥♥♥♥ing LIGHTSABERS WITHOUT CONTROVERSY
7295	1	a	bought this today after ORION was taken down, ♥♥♥♥ activision
7297	1	a	The best developers, the best community, the best dino-killing game. You just to hear that and watch a fast gameplay, so you can buy it.
2561	0	a	It's pretty bad
2562	0	a	American Servers only. So pretty much sucks for the whole world unless you can deal with 300+ ping
2563	0	a	I bought this game when it used to be called Orion Dino Beat Down, it is hands down the worst purchase I've made on steam. If only steam had their new refund policy back when I bought this game I wouldn't have this horrible piece of trash sitting in my library today =(
2564	0	a	dont buy that game, just dont. bugs like hell, flat storyline and gameplay. just dont buy it!!!
2565	0	a	the joke sale of the day -10% on 89 cents of total 'value' they say once they did a CONSTANT 90% off on the game.. in hopes it will get people to actually play this ♥♥♥♥♥

2567	0	a	Don't waste your money on this one, the devs went over to another title... again.  We will probably see more re-releases of this game in the future.

2572	0	a	this game is very laggy
2573	0	a	Like skyrim but without a development team.
7299	1	a	dont even. no. just. stop. no. dont. no. it isnt good. yes, i bought it. idk why. just let me go cry and wish i had used the money to buy a large rope and rickety stool instead.
2575	0	a	Everytime I shoot my, gun is delayed, but it did cost me just one buck. I wish I had never played (this crap), but I can't be bothered to give a ♥♥♥♥ (because it did cost only one buck. Still not worth it)  Just in case you wondered, this was an 'alternate rhyme scheme'. (ABAB)
7301	1	a	  rely gude
2581	0	a	One of the only games on steam that is not even worth a single dollar.
2582	0	a	I'm glad i tried before i buyed, the game is only $1 on special and i wont even pay that. It may say single player but there is no real single player story. It's just you in a multiplayer map. I lasted for around 10-15 mins before i got too bored to play.
2583	0	a	  I'd rather get stabbed with a Jagdkommando tridagger than recieve this piece of ♥♥♥♥ as a gift.
2584	0	a	I thought this game was going to be good because who doesnt want to ♥♥♥♥ up ♥♥♥♥??? Well no not at all this game is really boring and I wouldnt waste another second on it. This review is trash but I don't feel like listing everything wrong with this game because it would take me an hour
7303	1	a	Got it at 93% off and its well worth the dollar spent. This game reminds me of Turok the dinosaur hunter from back in the day. Graphics, animation and fun are all decent enough to have a good time. I recommend it while on sale!
2589	0	a	THIS GAME OMFG!!! THIS GAME FORCED ME TO MOVE MY HAND ON MY MOUSE AND CLICK BUY! IT COST ME £0.79 WHICH IS NOW GONE FROM MY ACCOUNT AND THAT IS £0.79 I WILL NEVER RECOVER! THERE IS A CHEESEY VOICE TELLING ME '2 DINOSAOWERS RIMEIN SNIKGDHM' HONESTLY... COULD THEY NOT AFFORD MORGAN FREEMAN TO VOICE OVER THIS. AND FINALLY, WHERE THE ♥♥♥♥ IS HARAMBE??!!! WOULD NOT RECCOMEND TO A GORILLA FRIEND.  I R8 -8/8 WHILST I FINGR MY PROST8.                              JUST A PRANK HAD £0.79 SPARE..........    STILL ♥♥♥♥
2590	0	a	ummm... uuhhh... why this game become F2P? ._.
2591	0	a	Don't believe what the others say. It is not a good game. I promise you. It is okay, but seriously, pick up Killing Floor instead.
2592	0	a	Good game, but the problem can hurt each time you starting ERROR.  Personally: I really like, I am very pleased with it.
2593	0	a	only had a few quick games but so far nothing to shout about, gaming seems boring and dull. The only apspect that impressed me was the size of the dinosaurs..some are MASSIVE. one to avoid for me personally.
2594	0	a	its good but a lil bit not ... you know the graphics and the movement try it your self and you will see
7305	1	a	It's alright..
2595	0	a	Maby a yes if you didnt steal.
2596	0	a	I only have ~40 minutes logged on this game - make of that what you will, but rest assured that I don't want to log any more time on it. Good premise, could have been fun, but the priorities are ALL wrong - a very pretty frag-fest with no atmosphere and nothing to hold the game together except scoring points. Dinosaurs don't behave convincingly, the maps are tiny, and despite having 4 Gb of ram and 1 Gb dedicated Vram the game doesn't run all that smoothly even with nerfed graphics settings. I picked this game up for 79p in a sale - I suppose it was vaguely worth that, but I wouldn't reccomend it to anyone at all. It's a poorly implemented set of bad decisions with no polish - they've left the fecking xbox botton markers in the menus FFS!
7307	1	a	for me i think the game is ♥♥♥♥. its not good at all but hey what can you expect for a 1 dollar game? Nothing!
7309	1	a	This game is wonderful. Buy it, you wont be sorry. 9/10 best FPS I've ever plated
7311	1	a	awesome game, awesome devs that stuck with the game for three years straight although everyone hated it
2608	0	a	poorly optimized
2609	0	a	could have used a dollar somewhere else
2610	0	a	Why is the T-Rex so loud
2611	0	a	This is a mistake.
7313	1	a	like a free much better version of evolve.
2615	0	a	Horribly Optimized Game That Looks Like It Was Made In 2003
2616	0	a	Whenever I talk about this beautifully crafted game I get emotional. It's just so wonderful and everything I've ever wanted in a video game. Huge alligators. Unrealistic dinosaurs. The amazing almost pixel like graphics. Wowza! This game is fantastic.
2617	0	a	This is a semi-good review.   it has great replayability but the core game needs some 'fixing up'   first of all if you look at the system requirements, you will notice that as soon as you start this game you will not be getting good FPS with the kind of computer it 'recommends'.  if they optimize this then I will give a better review.
7315	1	a	a 36 rating??? DAFUQ METACRITIC
2621	0	a	You know, I somewhat enjoyed this game. Cant really beat this kind of game for .99. I could rally a bunch of friends together and just go shoot dinosaurs. They didnt even have to have good computers. Just adequate ones and were on our way. I recently got my gf a gaming PC, and was going to get her this game.  I apparently had been living under a rock for the past year, as I had no idea the sequel was coming out back in December. I was excited. A better version of the .99 game that I had been playing with friends and loved ones. I decided I wanted to try and buy this game for her so that she could join in on the action. That is when I saw it. That is when I saw 'Mixed' for the recent reviews of this game, when it had generally been good. I had to check out what was up. I had to see what would make so many people badly review this game. Was there a game breaking patch? Nope. Worse.  After reading a myriad of reviews for the game from the recent fall, it became clear that this developer was not as wholesome as they would like to appear to the public. I dug into the recent debacle over the Activision DMCA, and what I saw was mortifying to say the least. A man, the owner of Trek Ind., playing victim and engaging social media wildly, starting far more fires than he could put out. To completely rip off guns from other games, and then blame the artist is shameless. Once is bad luck and I could see that being on the artist. But more than once and I no longer see coincidence. I see involvement. Either it was his idea, or they brought it too him and he gave the go ahead. Whats worse is that the artist likely cant even come forward with their side of the story as this a**hat has threatened to sue everyone for 'slandering' his good name with 'wild accusations'. Probably has some legal team ready to sue the moment he steps forward as they likely made him sign papers that would make him the fall guy in the very likely instance of this happening.  One things for certain: Trek Industries sure has earned a LOT of sheep. Reading through all of the posts defending this is aweful. Yes, Activision handled this poorly. But that DOES NOT excuse the owner of Trek Industies, or his handling of this matter. And then there is all of the other sketchy stuff this man has done... For instance: Funding your own indiegogo campaign to the goal just to get money from suckers. Sad. I dont know whats worse, the practice of this, or the suckers that fell for it.  So with all that said, I wish it wasnt too late to get a refund for this game. I will definitely not be buying the new Orion. And David, if you are reading this, please.... Please.... try to sue me for slander. It would make my day. You dont have a very good case becuase when you do stuff over the internet it is never forgotten
2622	0	a	unless this game has been updated its a huge garbage factory
7317	1	a	The dinosaurs are just too easy to kill. Except for those god damn flying things. Worst enemies I have encountered yet. Think you can shoot them? No, they'll just fly out of aiming range. Think you can melee them? No, they'lll just warp through your fists unharmed. Think you can learn to aim and dead them? No, the game will turn to night out of nowhere and start raining so you can't see ♥♥♥♥. These ♥♥♥♥s are the bain of my existence and should be eradicated from existence. Thank ♥♥♥♥ they were along with all the other dino ♥♥♥♥s millions of years ago. They can all ♥♥♥♥ off.      Buy it now. 
2625	0	a	tHIS GAME ISNT EVEN WORTH 1 DOLLAR!
7319	1	a	Awesome game but it doesn't run on my laptop :(
2629	0	a	It's like Ark but without everything that makes Ark a 10/10
2630	0	a	Jurassic ♥♥♥♥ up by the devs what were you thinking you cheeky micebummers, ill have you know i once visited an eskimo reservation and they thought i was a god, to bad this game doesn't do the same amirte could've been the new civ 5 2/10 had some good times but never really did find out what happened to jacob degenerate 2 it was my favorite movie because when they fell out of the closet and samantha saw lucy with the gun i think i backwards exploded into the review section of blockbuster
2631	0	a	srly dont waste yout time on this ♥♥♥♥
2632	0	a	After booting my potato machine, I decided to buy my friends this amazing looking game. No doubt, killing dinosaurs will be a blast. After waiting for 20 mins downloading the game we hopped in with high hopes. I will tell you right now, that the trailer is deceiving. The game runs at a solid (revolutionary) 20 frames per second. The game has a wonderful soundtrack if we could hear it without stuttering. What this game needs is to get out of the Dinosaur age technology and get optimized! (Also needs cheezus crust)   'This blows' - hanxshan 1/29
2633	0	a	Please don't remove this negative review. I am but a wee boy.
2634	0	a	.....
2635	0	a	this game sucks like Robin Chuuj
7321	1	a	I belive it used to be $10.99 when I got it. Good game though.
2642	0	a	needs update and help graphics drains to much cpu and speed sucks need more charecters
2643	0	a	Would you like give away 99 cents to steam, thats basically what you are doing when you buy this game.
7323	1	a	i bought the game for 50 cents but then I refunded it so now i'm probably gonna get it again now that it's free. It was a pretty good game but if you want a real masterpiece you should play this:  http://store.steampowered.com/app/362930/ 
2645	0	a	I would rather eat a dollar bill than use one to purchase this game. The name of the game may change but the development time might as well been put elsewhere, and even for a dollar there are better games out there that will allow you to keep your friends and your dignity. My love for dinosaurs is officially as dead as they are.  Overall 9/10 some of the art is 'kay.  EDIT: The two friends I played this with are now lovers and refuse to speak to me.
7325	1	a	i so love this game i hope they would give me a code for this :(
2653	0	a	Absolutely horrible, don't buy this game at any cost... there is a reason it's price has been cut so much, they couldn't pay me to play this garbage. I could forgive a lot of things in it, the bugs, horrible graphics, and boring gameplay if it was a early access to a degree, but this is a FULL RELEASE. Avoid at all costs.
2654	0	a	Im not sure what to say.   I got it for 1 dollar yet I still feel a little ripped off  you can still try it I guess  Maybe I played too little because I couldn't find anyone who would play
2655	0	a	Horrible, horrible game.
7327	1	a	I love it, worth all of the 0.99 cents i spent +50. The gameplay is fun, killing dinosaurs in mechs, tanks, aircrafts, with bows, lmgs, rocketlaunchers, 3 classes.. It's awesome. Don't see what all the hate is about.
7329	1	a	fun game to play with friends
2656	0	a	It seems good in the trailer, and it got a lot of good review but IT MOTHER ♥♥♥♥ING SUCKS PINEAPPLE! Not even worth those 0,49 Euro. You will regret this!!!
2657	0	a	I needed a gaming desktop to play this wtf  that's not why I got the gaming desktop don't worry

2665	0	a	This game was Very Laggy okn my computer and it is a quallity one. Even with it at its lowest quality i still had some problems with it.
7337	1	a	...Broken... This is the most BROKEN game i've ever played! Terrible frame rate, and looks like it is still in the alpha stage. The graphics are very low quality and it looks like something you do as a last minute project in a college game design class. If you are considering buying it... don't... pirate it first because otherwise your gonna be cheated out of money for a game that is just a re-release patch of Orion: Dino Beatdown. ...Broken... just wasted 3.3Gb of data on my computer
2668	0	a	LOL so bad, avoid like the plague. I managed about 5mins in a game before I got so bored with not knowing what to do. Also the dino's don't even look good.
7339	1	a	I am a stegosaurus!  But for real, this game is pure amazeballs. They got ya covered with all the cool stuff: -Dino's -Mechs -Rocket launchers -Overpowered compound bows -Tanks -Helicopters (?) -BABY DINOSAURS -NAZI BABY DINOSAURS (If your imagination is big enough) -Lightsabers -Pizza (Still waiting though...) -Achievements for just about everything  This game is a must try since it's even free now! (It used to be 1 Buck which was still amazingly cheap)
7341	1	a	I pay the game dafuq now its free :v jeeez
2673	0	a	Pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game. Boring from the head start. Didn't even finish one single game.
7343	1	a	  It's very awesome and fun for such a cheap game.
7345	1	a	What a fantastic co-op experience! I played this a while back only to come back recently and they've taken a great game and made it even better. If you miss the $1 week, shame on you, but even not on sale, Orion: Dino Horde is well worth your money.
7347	1	a	ayy why you bustin' my balls uh? I'm walking 'ere
7349	1	a	A glorious game. 360 mageshot a scrub ♥♥♥ raptor.  10/10
2677	0	a	well this game should be free it cost 72 cents? really? make it free plz
2678	0	a	very laggy even i use the recommended system
2679	0	a	I would not reccomend this game becasue the community is ♥♥♥♥. I say this from only needing to play 1 hour of the game. It is basically just a race to get the cheapest vehical and run over the enemy team with it before they do it to you. This game had a great idea however and was fun for the one time it that people didn't just run over the enemy team. If the games community was better I would reccomend this game however.
2680	0	a	This game is just pure trash ...

7353	1	a	Really fun, which wasn't expected. Spent hours playing this with friends.
2692	0	a	played five mins, on the menu that is, worst than cod with its host migration. Got a single player game to go, but it crashed before it got to the loading screen.
7355	1	a	Have a much value than 0.99$. Could get a better score than 36.  Olny problem is they release this game too early. :(  Not a bad game like you think, if you have a chance to play it, I recommend to do.
7357	1	a	when i open up orion prelude it keep saying not responding please tell me
2693	0	a	Not too bad of a game, but unfortunately, the devs are greedy morons who make no effort to treat their staff well nor clean up their product. The game is also incredibly broken.. play cloaker, cloak every now and then, and dinos run away from you... you're invincible.
2694	0	a	I really wish someone would've tagged this game with a 'Horror' tag before I bought it. I bought it today to play with my friend, then all of a sudden bloody raptors come screaming and trying to kill me! I was so horrified I literally ♥♥♥♥ my pants. Please tag this game with a horror tag to avoid such things happening again in the future.
7359	1	a	If you're wondering whether you should buy it or not - it's pretty funny shooter, definitely worth it's price, especially on sale. But the real reason I'm writing this review - maps sucks, they are awful.
7361	1	a	sucka butt poopoo dont buy

2726	0	a	I paid 79 cents on sale thinking I was getting a bargain. I ended up camping on a mountain shooting dinosaurs that looked like they were created by a DOOM modder high on bath salts.   Hey devs! Bragging about how much this game has improved since it's release is like bragging you have the best hygenie in every Wal-Mart you go to. You put a bow on a broken toilet and I'm not even mad.   At least I got most of my investment back from selling the cards.

7367	1	a	IGN - It's like Halo with Dinosaurs! 8/10
2741	0	a	Worse game I have ever played!  WhenI saw it was was like 'oh ok, looks pretty good and ok for $3.74. And then when I started to try to play it(Nothing wrong with the game in proformance). It does not have a quick match!  In all only mulitplayer games, there servers are poor, there's no configures like Passward Only, or Not Full Games. Hunting down a game is stupidly hard, heres a game! NOPE! it's full.  The actual game play: If you are a starter player, then you will be kicked out of games.... a lot  Heres an example.  SNIPER! SNIPER SPOTTED! GRAB THAT SNIPER! LOOK OUT! SNIPER!  'You have been kicked from Server'  what the ♥♥♥♥?...   The game play part plays like Call of duty/Halo mixed.  And they only got 2 game modes Team elimation. Horde.  Which are boring because Team Eliminate only is 10 players, and you will die alot because of the leveling system is out of wack. and Horde, it just a tower defence but with Dinosaurs, and you'll be kicked out all the time.  -1/10

2745	0	a	They rerelease it under a new name when the rating drops. It's pretty crappy, but s*** it was 99 cents.
7371	1	a	im just a mailman passing through.
2748	0	a	Worst game ever. You stand around and defend a tiny base from hoards of mobs running in. No time to enjoy anything. Once you've done it once, nothing is different the next time. Throw it away and never play it again. Best dolla eva! This game is always on sale for 90% off $10, making it $1.   The only thing anyone likes about this game is that it was a dollar. Thats as bad as saying that it made you happy to give a dollar to everyone at the mall one day. Actually, that does sound like fun! But maybe a better analogy is that its like paying to go into DisneyLand, but instead of riding the fun rides... you start handing out a dollar to everyone. No one says no to your dollar, but no one really appreciates your dollar either, except the young children... who think your dollar is the best thing ever.  You know another anology? This game being a dollar on Steam, where you can get actual good games that are also on sale for $5, is like standing in line for half an hour to get a snow cone, then realizing your snow cone tastes bad and spilling it on the ground. The End.  Other things that last longer than this game, that are also a dollar? 2 snickers bars. a movie at the dollar theatre. a large drink at McDonalds. a can of spray paint. 4 cokes out of a 12 pack. a pack of mini flashlights. a box of paper clips. a rock that someone glued eyes on. your dignity.

2760	0	a	The graphics...
2761	0	a	For whatever reason you may have to get this game, do not. It has worse graphics than Team fortress 2 and runs about 3x worse than tf2. It's fre to play now, but back when itwas 0.49, i would have never reccomended it. It's free now, but my statement still stands. This game is NOT worth playing.
2762	0	a	  idk, got it when it was free, and the game didnt work. so now that it looks like it actually works, it trying to make me buy it, so i guess ill pass on this one.
2763	0	a	i have to pay to play this game and now its free

2767	0	a	why did i buy this this is like halo ce but with dinosaurs  why am i even comparing it to ce
2768	0	a	Big pile of trash, stolen assets. Terrible devs well not so much the innocent makers of the game who get sacked and replaced every ten minutes, its more the owners who run the company who are liars, cheats, and thieves. Avoid at all costs even if this game was £0.00000001 i would avoid.
7379	1	a	For 99 cents, this game does everything you want it to do. It is fun and you can get a lot of gameplay out of it.
2772	0	a	.
2773	0	a	I am sorry but whoever is writing this game is excellent now after some changes, well I dont know how bad it was before, but the controls are AWFUL, that is putting it nicely, I tried htis game this weekend since it was 99 cents, but after playing it for a few hours, its the worst game trying to play at a FPS that ive ever seen, this game might have had people buy it 20 years ago, the controls are awful , the characters move like bricks, there is no fluid feeling its all fighting contols constantly, the game is so unbalanced its annoying between dinos and humans . PLus there is a cash shop! I dont recall the last time I saw a game I had to buy then have a cash shop to contend with.  Even for the 99 cents I cant recommend this, but for the normal price I would TOTALLY WARD you OFF thinking about buying this, the meta crtic score is generious at 36! The game devs of this game need some serious practice and help BAD BAD BAD feeling game play!
7381	1	a	This is the best game NA.

2788	0	a	Not really worth the money. Yes, I know it's €0.99.
7387	1	a	I would be more harsh on the game if it wasnt so cheap. This game gets old in 30 mins. feels like a N64 game and looks like one too. Poorly optimized. The list could go on but for under a buck and you are looking for a mediocre shooter that will give you an extremely short burst of entertainment look no further.
2794	0	a	In light of   this article,   I'm afraid I can no longer reccomend this game. It's a real gem, a real fun timewaster, but this is really rather shady. I cannot, in good faith, reccomend a game that has a shady buisiness policy and is run by a company with questionable practices.  All this over three sprites.
2795	0	a	Gameplay is good. Graphics are good. Consistancy of Bugs is good. Bad updates are good.  4/10

7393	1	a	jolly good meme 10/10  
7395	1	a	I think this game has a lot of potential. It could really use a campaign mode and just a few touch-ups. One thing that really buggs me was when raptors get up in your face, your screen is just a blob of pixels. The firt-person view on this game also seems unnaturally close to the ground.. like my character is a midget or something. I don't have a whole lot of time invested into this game, but based on first impressions, overall, I think the game is really fun and I don't regret buying it (although I bought it when it was on sale for .99c, If I paid $14 for this, I would be very dissapointed). I keep reading comments about how buggy it is, and I didn't experience any. Then again, like I said before, I don't have much tiem invested into this game. I'll definitely give it another go soon though.
7397	1	a	I bought the game and now its free $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$44
7399	1	a	The ♥♥♥♥ I never bought this, sooo um review probably a piece of steaming dog feces but probably good so [don't] buy it because is [isn't] good. There review done now to play a [better] game! 
7401	1	a	It was so bad, that I thought Infinite Warfare had been released early.
7403	1	a	this game is ok to buy in sale for £0.39 but if its more expensive then dont as the graphics are messed up no one plays and the game is utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t in mechanics.
7405	1	a	Add dinosaur mating and copulation and it will be perfect. 9/10 would ride some lady dinos again!
7407	1	a	One of the Funniest COOP Games EVER!!!!! Recommended 10/10 (Play with Friends only)
2848	0	a	I stopped playing and lost all interest after being forum perm banned because the devs think the steam forum is not a place to say things about a product in which and where it's hosted to directly download, Banned from the forum for Complaining about the disconnection issue at the end of the round  Disconnected from Host How annoying  Several threads   Really a Permanent ban from the forum well die in a fire. No wonder this game's not so popular.  If this game ever picks up the pace i would say they changed kiddie developers why did i bother with the 50cents in the first place all the signs were there to tell people this is not a good game.   I sincerely hope the person who banned me gets some form of cancer and dies because.
7409	1	a	I commited mass genocide of raptors by running them over with a tank. 10/10
2860	0	a	Is one of the worst coop games I played on Steam. I bought it when was $10. Also Prelude has very very poor performance, worst than Watch dogs and same like AC Unity but with worse graphics. The first version didn't have several optimization issues but still had and lot of bugs. Dino games aren't very good too. I can't recommend this game, absolutely. Is too bad, just play a F2P game or do something else, don't waste your time with this.  Uninstalled and will never be installed again. OVERALL: This game is too bad. 2.5/10
7411	1	a	It sucks
2891	0	a	I Think I Lost For This Game 8$
2892	0	a	Loaded up the game all excited to try out the updated version. Got my video settings set, went to the join game menu and servers loaded up and game crashed. Ok, checked out the workshop, loaded some mods, started the game up and got into a game in progress... waiting for round to end. I spawn, run around for a second. 'You have lost connection to host'. Back to main menu, ♥♥♥♥ this piece of gorilla ♥♥♥♥ game.
2893	0	a	I wasn't paid enough to play this.  From anim files that lose sync of each other to poor optimization, this game takes the idea of a dino shooter and turns it into hot garbage.
2894	0	a	Stay away! Dont give them anymore money please!
2895	0	a	i get kicked from every game just for being a low level? well ♥♥♥♥ this game

I hereby devote my very existence to driving a tank and shooting velociraptors on the ground and failing at taking pterodactyls out of the sky. ORION: Prelude is the pinnacle achievement of humanity.  11/10 would get stomped on by a T Rex again
2909	0	a	If you're thinking about buying this game, take your money and sign it over to your parents, and check yourself into an early 20th century style asylum that specializes in giving colonics made of dried sunflower seeds. 1/8 Handfulls of sunflower seeds

2929	0	a	Glitchy. Makes for a frustrating game. All I wanted to do was shoot dinosaurs. Couldnt find the damn dinosaurs... game crashed, uninstall followed.
7421	1	a	This game is honestly one of the best games I've ever played on steam! Endless hours of countless fun with friends combined with a game which requires great skill and strategy! I would recommend this game to my first born and tell him 'This is the game which revolutionised gaming as a whole! 10/10 would buy again      'NOT!' xDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
2942	0	a	Ive have spent so much time on this game (as seen above) that its truly sad that im writing a bad review for it.  I understand it is a one dollar game but many free games like flash games and warframe top this game. The hard work and time ive put into this game could have been spent with family so the moral of this review is dont play this game for hours apon hours when it is a bad game, ive suffered so you dont have too......91039/12....would play again.....maybe......not.....definitely not....

7429	1	a	Dinosaurs and Jetpacks, what more can i say.
7431	1	a	very exciting gameplay and fun to play with your friends :D
2944	0	a	Some games are quite simple, yet very enjoyable.That happens beacuse they surpass our expectations, proving to be more than just a simple game.In ORION:Dino Horde`s case, it`s the exact opposite: the games promisses too much and ridiculously fails at delivering it.Old looking graphics(not on purpose) , dumb A.I. and constant lagging and crashing problems make you wish someone more competent had developed this.No, the metacritic score is not so misleading as they say.
7433	1	a	NIce game  Really cool with friends
2945	0	a	This game gives the feeling that it was assembled out of models bought off of stock bmodel website. Gameplay is meh. UI is meh.   1/5
7435	1	a	It's a dollar, if you're reading this and its not in your library, you don't deserve to exist... simple as that.
7437	1	a	BEST TREK GAME EVER 
7439	1	a	Epic fun. Amazing game for the price. Tons of fun.
7441	1	a	If we move aside some visual bugs and that the modeling of the characters is not like we used to see in newer games, this game is absolutely worth the money and time.   Very fun to play, excellent co-op game with survival - would recommend to buy!
7443	1	a	Pretty Good game
7445	1	a	Got htis during the steam sale and i am impresesd with it. It's really fun and is definetly worth the 99 cents or if you get it during the winter sale 74 cents. I would pay atleast 2 dollars for a game like this. has pve and pvp modes.
2949	0	a	Its so freaking laggy i don't recommend it. I barely could move
7447	1	a	the game is awesome went it come to the guns you can use. the one thing i have problems with is i always die by t-rexs
7449	1	a	Dinosaur's+FPS+Horde mode+upgrades+vehicles+5-player coop + 0.99$ = why haven't you bought this yet?
7451	1	a	Ran around with a knife stabbing and eating volociraptors 10/10
7453	1	a	Orion is a game worth playing, but is also likely never going to achieve the critical mass necessary to be as big as it deserves. The ambition of the developers is apparent in the massive, multi-level arenas, the scale and power of the larger dinos, and the range of abilities and equipment with which you can kit out your Tron-esk soldier. There's a tremendous variety of game modes as well, including multiple variants of PvE, PvP, and PvPvE. The three classes of soldier (Assault, Support, and Recon) each have their own tree of persistent skill unlocks, and a microtransaction shop gives you plenty of options for purely cosmetic customization. Orion is largely satisfactory in terms of the quality of its graphics, and even surprises with neat environmental effects and an excellent day/night cycle (the night is actually dark, and can add real tension to a match). In short, it is absolutely worth picking up at full price.  So why did I start my review with such ambivalent language, if I'm willing to recommend a purchase? Because I'm skeptical that Orion is going to live up to its potential; the variety of equipment and abilities I mentioned above is present, but in dire need of an overhaul in order to establish clear class roles (or roles, period, if you want to drop the A/S/R distinction entirely). Server caps are set at 10 total players, which means those massive, multi-level maps feel deserted. PvE modes will see you fight a T-Rex with a tank (or a tank with a T-Rex, in PvP), which is cool, but they'll also see you use the same tactics against the dinos over and over again because their behaviour is both predictable and exploitable, which is not.  I want to be wrong about this, but the game came out in 2012, and it still features what I feel are considerable design flaws. It is absolutely worth picking up - I've even bought several gift copies just to encourage people to try it out - but prepare to break out your disappointed father voice at some point while playing.
7455	1	a	Didn't expect too much when I bought it, but this is definitely worth the money I paid for it, and more. A surprising amount of fun in such a small package. I would recommend this to anyone.
7457	1	a	I really like this game. I mean how can you not like a game that is under 1.00 that has DINOSAURS! Kinda glitchy from time to time, but did I mention under 1.00
7459	1	a	For .99 cents, it's a steal. Me and a group of friends have had a blast playing hours for random silly achievements and exploring each map. Lots of different weapons and semi-permaperks you buy with in-game cash per match.  Price/Hour ratio 10/10 Replayability 9/10 Variety 8/10  Overall 10/10
7461	1	a	Game is unfinished and buggy, but wow. I just fired 1000 bullets continuously into a horde of T-Rexes wearing Triceratops masks.
7463	1	a	I got knocked off a cliff and disconnected from the server 10/10 game of the year.  The game play was fun and fast paced yet some dinosaurs glitched through rocks alot.  Yet, I shot a stegosaurus repeatedly in it's ♥♥♥♥ and it died! What more do you want from a fps?
7465	1	a	If Bungee made an 'A Land Before Time' game this would be it.
7467	1	a	This game is game but also hilarious. I would recommend this game if you have some friend to play it with.
7469	1	a	Gotta say, It's a fun game. Super cheap,   if you play with friends in a versus game (taking off all the abilities of the human team) it feels more jurrassic park-y to me. Sure jetpacks are fun, but the real challenge is doing it all without any special help.  9/10
2953	0	a	It had dinosaurs. It was ok, just not great. Could use some more varying of weapons.
7471	1	a	Stalin approved.
7473	1	a	I LOVE DINOS and the game and its only 45 cence but i don't know how to get cc points i recmend this game for 8+
2954	0	a	other poeple may like this but i hate waiting half an hour just for about 3 minutes of little fun :/ 3/10
7475	1	a	Best 59p ever spent 10/10 would buy 4 times more
7477	1	a	It's a real fun game when you have dinos and explosions going boom all around you 
2955	0	a	If you're crappy and you know it, syntax error *glitch glitch*, If you're crappy and you know it, syntax error *bug bug*, If you're crappy and you know it, The Steam front will surely show it, If you're crappy and you know it, syntax error *pfft pfft*.
7479	1	a	I honestly only got this game because it was 50 cents, but I would have paid full price for it after playing it. It is one of those games you play with some buddies on a Friday night. Its really fun, and even though there are in game purchases, it is only cosmetic and don't really affect gameplay. All-in-all, its a 8/10.
7481	1	a	Way too much fun! Except there needs to be a 'Reconnect' button when you get disconnected from a server.
7483	1	a	you get to punch dinosaurs
7485	1	a	This game is actually Fun™.
7487	1	a	This game was released as a buggy mess. After it was rereleased it was still crap. However after about a year of patching, this game is great. BUY IT!
7489	1	a	I can no scope a T-Rex in the face in slow motion, causing it to fly into the air.  1/1 Would dino-scope again.
7491	1	a	What are you waiting for??? You get to shoot rocket launchers at giant crocodile's in the face while flying, in slowmotion!!! 38/10
7493	1	a	If you're looking for a game to have fun for a few hours - i recomend this. You probably wont play it for weeks on end, but an hour every now and then with friends, sure.
7495	1	a	My expectation were low as I bought this game for only 0,80$... But its been a big suprise as I think this game is awesome. Its pretty simple, the learning curve is low and its nothing new. But I found myself getting addicted to simple but yet fun gameplay. If you bought it just because it was cheap really give it a try!
7497	1	a	This is such a great game for such a low price. I would pay more. Pros - like call of duty zombies except its dinosaurs - intense and immersive - I got it for 39 pence  Cons - Can be laggy - Controller is kinda needed in my opinion  A great game to gift to a friend
7499	1	a	Yes this game is very fun. It brings out your inner 6 year old blasting dinos and such.
2957	0	a	Gameplay is nice. But they could make some imporvements.
7501	1	a	Not bad for the price.  Its like zombie game without the zombies. Plus the old school counter strike.
7503	1	a	Probably..... yes.....
7505	1	a	i thinks anyone can buy this game :D (becouse it's really cheap), slay some dinosaurs with your friends :&gt;
7507	1	a	Great Game. I love to play!!
7509	1	a	Got killed by a tiny dinosaur after defeating 100's of huge ones 10/10 would do it again
7511	1	a	Although this game has countless bugs and not exactly the best animation, it is still a very great game. This game is definitely worth $1 or maybe even more. I will admit it is not the best but not the worst. ( If you purchase this game, get the 4-pack because it is 1,000,000x better with teammates.)
7513	1	a	Nice game for low price :)
7515	1	a	Beheaded and carried by a pterodactyl, dropped on the back of a tricerotops, where i rode it across the map too its death, hwile my teammate was thrown into a mountain side and pummelled by a boulder thrown by T-rex. 10/10
7517	1	a	Like dinosaurs? What about laser guns? Or maybe fast and strong vehicles? Yes? Then this is the game for you! 10/10
2959	0	a	Don't play this.
7519	1	a	Don't let the price scare you away! This is actually a really fun game. It might not be a huge game, but it is very well made and a very satisfying FPS romp. The larger dinosaurs take a while to kill so you get to throw a satisfyingly large amount of ammo at them.   You can easily create our own server to play with your friends. With the low price and ease of entry it makes a great game to play with your friends at a party. Each player will need their own computer.
7521	1	a	If you enjoy those 'quarter' arcade games, this reminds me of them, except quarter arcades are now 4 quarters and this game was half of that. I'd say I spent my 2 quarters worth. Its actually rather fun, I was very surprised. The dinosaurs could look better (they have that floppy 2D feel that makes you think they are 3D while on ground level) but its still great and I think gives it that charm. Can't complain for the cost.
7523	1	a	A great game the objective of the game is to survive and protect your base from hordes of dinos.  After awhile bosses start spawning and your team has to work together to defeat them.  Your earn money by getting kills which you can use to buy weapons.  With 3 unique classes I could spend hours on this game.   Would I reccomend: Yes
7525	1	a	This is less than a big mac, and it last longer. Buy it
2960	0	a	Game might be fun but all I get are errors when trying to connect to a game...too early to say it's a waste...but don't really know how much more time to wait to play a game.
7527	1	a	This game has the premise of being a killing floor but with dinosaurs.  This game is fun , but it falls short a bit later when all you see is dinosaur blood, then you're all like:  Why am i playing this? It is very cheap tho, if you don't have it buy it it has an hour or three of fun then it is all grinding. I give this game a 5/10
7529	1	a	This game went through a lot so I'm rewriting my review after the big prelude update.  So let's get directly to the point : for 1$ this game is great.   You have a huge variety of weapons and perks with which you can shoot dinosaurs, there are 3 classes each one with a special ability (even if the one with the jetpack is the most fun to play and therefore might be the only one you'll be playing) and you also got a couple of vehicles.  And that's it, there are tenth of game modes, but most of them aren't that interesting and conquest or survival are the only ones worth it. There is another playmode where you play human team 1 vs human team 2 vs dinosaurs which is really interesting but there are just not enough players to play this. You can also play as a dinosaur, but once again you need to find a rather full server which can be difficult (at least in EU)  And bring a friend to play this because this game is I gotta admit very quickly boring in Solo, but if you can just convince a single friend to play this you will be entertained a couple of hours. I've spent about 26 hours in this game and I don't think I will relaunch it any time soon because I did everything that was possibly fun with friends (survival, conquest, workshop maps, trying all classes and weapons, playing as a dinosaur)  Finally let's talk microtransaction. Well they are not interesting, you can buy a couple of skins for your weapons, characters, dinosaurs and that's it. You can also buy hats which are quite ugly ^^' So I see no interest in paying for this. But at least the microtransaction do not make the game unabalanced.  So Orion dino beatdown is a 1$ game offering something like 20 hours of fun game before it becomes repetitve. But that's a good deal I think. 7/10
7531	1	a	I have to question how much a person really likes videogames if they've never wanted to fight dinosaurs. Here you can do it cooperatively and with outrageous weaponry. Disregarding how ludicrously low priced this game is, you should get it 'cause it's fun.
7533	1	a	Very fun to play with friends
2962	0	a	i want my 49 cents back
7535	1	a	This game is pretty awesome, I love it.
7537	1	a	I won this game in a giveaway, at first it didn't seem like it was going to be fun. Then i connected to my first server...  Its great fun a great survival wave based game (if that makes sense)  Its like Call of Duty : Zombies but without the Call of duty, and with dinosaurs... Plus Halo  Its actually a fun game i do reccomend buying it becuase for a cheap game its very good, because most 'cheap' games are £1+ and don't include much fun or effort. but for such a low price this game is by far the best on on steam! why not give it a shot :D  10/10 would win again
7539	1	a	With very basic controls, and an all-to-familiar gameplay style, I still have to like this game. Very good price to pay for a fun FPS with dinosaurs thrown into the mix.
7541	1	a	for the price, just play it. it is a crap ton of fun.
7543	1	a	i likie this dame it smells good and is fast paced
7545	1	a	Great game, but it needs more video and graphics options.. for $1....Definitly worth it though.. 7/10
7547	1	a	it's cheap, it's fun, it's something that you would want to bring to a party with friends or play by your self, and who doesn't like dinosaurs.
7549	1	a	You can kill thousands of dinosaurs with a bow and a grenade launcher
7551	1	a	This game is pretty awesome. If you are a fan of the Halo feel and dinosaurs, love muliplayer slayage, then you would really like this. It is easy to learn and adapt to, and it is very fun to kill the dinos. For a game without a campaign story, this is defintely a game that exceeded my expectations. Besides, for the price, you can't beat it. ($.53 at the time I bought it).
7553	1	a	This game is so bad.
7555	1	a	if you can get it cheap buy it, the game its fun to play with friends and it's dirt cheap.
7557	1	a	This game was actually alot of fun! It suprised me
7559	1	a	Killed a T-rex, it glitched into the earth and then flew 1km into the sky.   10/10
7561	1	a	Well, it's a dumb game... but it is a ton of fun! What could u like more? I mean, how many FPS out there are $1 where you get to shoot dinosaurs?   It's awesome.
7563	1	a	Gameplay like COD/Halo + Vehicles from StarCraft 2 + ArtStyle like Borderland = THIS AWESOME GAME and its more awesome with friends!
7565	1	a	14/10 Would pay mere cents to gut a T-rex with a lightsaber
7567	1	a	It is honestly alot of fun. I enjoyed the old Dino Horde as well. It is funny how the joke enemies were added, like the Pirate Compy for example. I would suggest they could add some new dinosaurs. I just wish they add the Argentinosaurus that actually has a million health, the stomp ability, and capable of causing mutiple fatalities. Also a few other types of dinosaurs like one that acts like a Velociraptor but can spit purple venom could be the Cryolophosaurus, a rham-sized pterosaur, the Tapejara, an Oviraptor, faster and deadlier than the Raptor,an Allosaurus that acts similar to the T-rex but can run faster, and a Carnotaurus, a carnivore half the size of the T-rex and can charge at great speeds, running over players. Since some dinosaurs cant heal in PvP modes, some ambient prey that can spawn almost any where you go on any map can help them alot even players who are lost in conquest maps by healing them (if they can cook it) and give them credits. Here are some ideas of the ambient prey: Pterodactylus- reward $50, heal strength 10-30 Orodromeus- $25, 5-10 Dodo Bird- $10, 20-25 Gallimimus- $60, 40-60 Pachycephalosaurus- $70, 80-95 *fights back* Dimorphodon- $50, 10-30 Moetherium- $100, 60-80 Deltatherium- $1, 0-3 (a large brown rat the size of a compy) Protoceratops- $150, 70-100 *tamable* Ankylosaurus- $500, 800-1000 *fights back* Meganeura- $5, 3-5 (comes in 2 colors) Lepidoptera- $5, 3-5 (a large butterfly that comes in 3 colors) Psittacosaurus- $25, 30-50 Parasaurolophus- $1000, 500-750 Arsinoitherium- $500, 250-475 Tupuxuara- $80, 40-55 Brachiosaurus- $3000, 5000-10000 (found in large maps, such as conquest) Hylaeosaurus- $150, 70-100 *tamable* Diplocaulus- $5, 5-10 Coelurosauravus- $5, 1-5 Glyptodon- $30, 10-30 Icarosaurus- $5, 1-5 Karaurus- $5, 1-5 Triadobatrachus- $1, 0-1 Eudimorphodon- $300, 100-142 *fights back* Archaeopteryx- $10, 5-15 Nomingia- $5, 5-10 *common nuisance* Caudipteryx- $5, 5-10 *common nuisance* Sinosauropteryx- $5, 5-10 *common nuisance* Along with these other ideas, they should also add in the enemy team we have seen in the other version of ORION Prelude on  kickstarter.com . If they allow these ideas to go on the game, I would recommend this game, but if they cant, I understand. But I still enjoy this game even when it was Dino Horde.
7569	1	a	best Coop for 0,49€ ever *_* lots of fun
7571	1	a	it's good and cheap it's really fun online but i havn't been able to hav too much fun as both my school laptop and my 5 year old laptop are crap so i can't really judge the bugy parts cause it's probz my cpu
7573	1	a	Costs next to nothing, but all the fun of games 10x, even 50x, its price. Buy it if only to have a game to play with friends. Drop-in, drop-out, play for 5 min, play for 5 hours. Great muliplayer. I mean you can fight a T-Rex in a mech. Do I really need to say anything else?
7575	1	a	Sold!  For a buck.
7577	1	a	It doesn´t seem a complete game, it has a lot to improve. But it´s cheap and funny, worth the price ^^
2964	0	a	THIS GAME ISNT WORTH THE SECONDS OF YOUR LIFE TO DOWNLOAD IT.
7579	1	a	It is so bad, it is good.
7581	1	a	Best Game on PC loving every minunte would pay 50 times the actual price for it
2965	0	a	Keeps freezing tried everything but nothing works
7583	1	a	Halo with Dinosaurs for 49c...i'll take it.
7585	1	a	One of the funnest multiplayer games i've played
7587	1	a	I paid 49 cents, killed some dinosaurs, had some fun.   Can't do much else with 49 cents these days.
7589	1	a	50 cents. Wow you guys are desprate
7591	1	a	Straight to the point: This is a fairly fun silly little game for the price.   It has some novelty. There are vehicles, and throwing a boulder as a TRex is kind of satisfying. You can fight off waves of AI or you can play competitively arena style. It has a variety of modes so you can mix things up a bit.  You probably won't be playing this game every day. I recommend buying it with a few friends, and you're probably going to get more than your money's worth of a good time out of it.
7593	1	a	Best lag simulator stil available for a low purchase.
2969	0	a	You should not buy this game, your caracter is hard to controle, dinos are everywhere and moving too fast. This is not fun.
7595	1	a	piece of ♥♥♥♥ 10/10
7597	1	a	This game was worth the $1 that I paid for it! I have only played it a couple of times and they were really fun. This is a very good game to play when you feel bored of the other games that you have.
7599	1	a	Its aight
7601	1	a	Surprisingly fun. 7/10 only for the bugs, visual glitches and the stupid rain.
7603	1	a	It's pretty sketchy if you have a laptop full of crap but works nicely for Desktop.  not much conplaining but if you play with a laggy friend that has  a slow laptop, on top of that a whole party (plz for your sake don't ask!) with laggmiksagqarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr all over there laptop.   (.nur dna lla meht lliK)      Desktop: 8/10 play then  laptop: 6/10 kill your friend.....
7605	1	a	♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥es
7607	1	a	Really, really, REALLY fun game. Gotta buy it, great with friends!
7609	1	a	Hands down best 99 cents you will ever buy on Steam. On whim bought for son and his friends and I am blown away how fun this game is. Hope the developers can earn some money on this because they deserve something. Co-op or single player with bots only, but very well done. Get it now.
2971	0	a	o you ever feel like slamming your face into the wall, whether due to frustration or any other reason? This is the game for you. Everyone should play this game. If not just to appreciate every other game you've ever played pretty much. Maybe you just spent a period of time witnessing idiocy to the extreme and feel like slamming your face into the desk. Perhaps you just came from the cesspools of the internet. Just play this game. Results may vary.
7611	1	a	You're basically Boba Fett with a light saber, thrown into the world of Turok. 10/10 would keep killing Dino....**** I just died...
7613	1	a	This is an absolutely hilarious and entertaining game, it is way better than I thought it could be. Lightsabers, tanks, and dinosaurs!
2972	0	a	the AI is ♥♥♥♥ in this game
7615	1	a	10/10
2973	0	a	Last time i played game i just entered in had no idea where to get weapons no guide at all it was rly messy no tutorials graphic sucked those pictures they show on fb community group are far from this game and will never be good.  All at all it not $0.something with no reason....
7617	1	a	Dinosaur game for $0.49, why the hell not?
7619	1	a	cant go wrong for the price ^.^
7621	1	a	It's not the deepest game in the world but it's hard to complain at that price.
7623	1	a	About 3000 cloaked dinosours attacked our squad ... We fought for hours trying to defend our base. But the inviz. heads won . ( did i mention that these cloaked dinosours had cloaked only their body ? wierd right ? ) Because there was a second wave .  Second wave which had 6000 more dinosours than the last. 10/10 Would get attacked by second wave and revive our generator every 10 seconds .
7625	1	a	pretty rad shooter for a budget
7627	1	a	
7629	1	a	Highlights include: Sniping a Trex in the face as I jetpacked to safety Mowing down dinosaurs with a jeep like vehicle Beating velociraptors in the face Battling several very large dinos  Cons: Graphics are a bit on the simplistic side, especially for UI and player model Controls not configured to ideal setup on get go Different modes other than survival not as enjoyable (opinion) Some content must be purchased in game (not required for game to be fun, but still)  Very well worth the price, especially with friends
7631	1	a	Get some friends, kill some dinos; at a very very cheap price. Too easy? Try playing on Insane. Now go kick some ♥♥♥!
2977	0	a	Worst shooting I've ever tried out in gaming.
7633	1	a	Really fun game where you with your team need to kill tons of dinosaurs, big and small and you need to do objectives like check the point or somethin ! You have about 10 weapons for each class and some special weapons for each class only, but you can buy in-match perk that gives you acces to all weapons in-match. You can cuztomize your character look and camoflague of your dinos, but only for these you are playing, not for those that are attacking you. You have many perks o buy in-match and there is a lot to do ! Its one of best Co-op game and its still updating and giving you even more of these things. It have steam workshop too where you can download even more maps and game modes ! The graphics are not the best, but they are on really high level, my pc that handled Skyrim on ultra, nearly handled this game on low-medium. This game is really interesting and fun to play with other people AND ITS ONLY FOR 0.99€. I recommend it 7,9/10
7635	1	a	I really like this game, I honestly can't believe how cheap it is for the quality. It has a lot of replay value also IMO since you can level up to 70 and you unlock stuff along the way. There are 3 classes and in some game modes you can play as the Dinos! Lots of different guns and perks (Augments) that you can buy for the match with money you make from killing dinos in that match. There is also cool armor, hats, and blade colors you can buy outside of matches to make your guy look really nifty. For what it is, this game is awesome and I highly recommend it.
7637	1	a	For the dino killers
7639	1	a	8/8
7641	1	a	I don't know why the ♥♥♥♥ anyone would want to play this game. Dinosaurs are awesome but after you play this game, you'll think that all dinosaurs are homosexuals.
7643	1	a	This is a game which you can play in Noob or Easy mode to get awards, or just when you don't want to try too hard, or you can play in Medium or higher mode when you want a challenge. Great to play solo or in a group and plenty of PvP if you like that, too. Best .99 Euro Cent game I have ever bought, in fact better than a lot of other more expensive games. This game is not perfect though as there are a few bugs, but nothing that would make me stop playing: bots getting stuck against rocks (happens in the larger maps when they have to travel cross country). One of the few games which it's fun just to play for 15 minutes, before you go out etc, or play for a few hours. There are plenty of weapons to choose from and NO weapons can be bought using real money, only in game money which is reset every match and not too hard to get, at lower levels ;) . The only things that can be bought with real money are cosmetic, like hats etc.  The graphics aren't cutting edge but they are good enough and the weather effects I really like. Try spotting a flying pterodactyl(?) at night when it's raining and the rain is running down your visor (I love to hate pterodactyl as they mob you when your hiding in the rocks shooting dinos with one of the sniper rifles). The snowing effect is great, too! And if you don't buy the heated visor opion, lookout when your visor freezes over (on the snowy maps), shoot the blurrs, LOL.  When I'm tired, after playing a demanding fast paced game, I usually end up playing this at Noob or Easy level just for some relaxing fun and to gain a achivement or two. If I want a challenge I play in Medium or Hard, although there are two harder level: Insane and Redikulous!  If one of the main boss dinos is killed the game goes into slow-mo for a few seconds and if you shoot a Raptor in the head, at this time, it looks great when it explodes in slow-mo, too. :) One last thing: watch out, the Raptors will swarm you!  It's on sale 0.59
7645	1	a	nice game for a quick and fun play
7647	1	a	I got this game for free from a friend who bought a 4-pack.  Unfortunately it lack content, you play a couple of rounds and explore, try the weapons, have some fun and that's about it.  At it's current price 0.99 it's a good deal for one nights fun, but don't expect much more than 5-6h of enjoyable playtime unless you reeeaaaally love dinosaurs.
7649	1	a	I saw this game on sale for 1$ and being as cheap as I am it sparked my curiosity so I searched it up on youtube to find some hilarious gliches like the front fliping t-rex. So I bought it xpecting to walk into a hilarous brokem mess that would be worth it for the laughs alone. Instead I got a genuinely good game, I would recomend to anyone to buy it because 1$ isn't much to spend on a game that is good. In fact this is the only game that I have spent under 4$ on and had it be good. If the pvp was more active I think I could have gotten into it a lot more because the pvp wasn't a broken camper noob tube filled shot gun spamming sound whoring mess (*cough cough 'cod'*) The pve was pretty nice too, it kinda reminded me of firefight on halo but better in almost every way. If you don't have it get it, for 1$ you can't really go wrong
7651	1	a	Great game when you just want to kill stuff. You can also up the level and comense rage ;)
7653	1	a	If Ed Wood were a game developer for our generation, this is what he would be remembered for and not Plan 9 From Outer Space
7655	1	a	Screw you, Dom.
7657	1	a	AMAZING GAME!  Defenately worth the cash and very cheap may i add, Great fun and good to play with friends, The feel of shooting dinos in a FPS futuristic game is amazing, get this game if your looking for a laugh and  something to do in your spare time!
7659	1	a	Joined a game lagged so much my computer blew up 10/10 would play again
7661	1	a	For what it's worth, it's pretty solid. It still needs moderate amounts of work. The price tag isn't half bad either, but I wonder if this hurts development. I've also not come across many players, and yes I've only logged 3 hours total. Learning curve is steep enough to engage you, but easy enough to master. Is it worth it? Only if you have patience, and you're willing to engage the developers in perfecting the title, they won't know unless you let them know. But it has enough to keep you interested for a casual encounter.  Pros: -Concept -Variety of Dinos -Abudance of achievements and trading cards -Borderlands art style -Action-packed, hardly a dull moment -Price Tag -Learning curve -Gamepad Support -Augments look promising  Middle Ground: -Vehicles (Solid, but have slightly clunky functionability) -Weapon Selection, limited, but not totally lacking -Environmental effects, rain, frost, etc -Gamemodes (showing promise, fairly solid, needs more depth)  Cons: -Servers are a bit unstable and lag spikes can be frequent (Might have been a clunky night, or a European server, even still, nothing overwhelming) -Limited Costumizability for weapons -Public reaction/community/support (Perception after 3 hours, can change)  Suggestions: After playing this title, I've observed that a lot of it has to do with cooperative play with close friends, or otherwise, gaming buddies. Now, I think a good approach for further development would be to emphasize more on this fact. All other issues aside. A little backround story, maybe some comedic voice-overs like that in Killing floor would give this game a much needed cult-like status. Adding a few story-driven modes, and perhaps even another class type or two. Also, I'm not sure if this is already the case, but sharing credits with others should be possible.  Overall assesment: I'd say it's promising leaning on above average, I'd give it a 7.5/10 for now. I'm looking forward to seeing steam automatically try to update the game over the coming months.
7663	1	a	Now i Know how the dinosaurs disapperd :3
7665	1	a	The Quick Brown Fox , i mean i - recommend this game to you if you really like playing co-op games with your friends, that game could be your favorite game. It has a good game engine and cool HUD. Nice weapons to shoot some dinosaurs or cut them all. Following objectives and beating this beasts is really cool. Nice graphical quality also feels you good when playing it, almost a perfect game for it's tags. #Dinosaurs #Action #FPS #Multiplayer #Co-op so thats it all, see ya on game guys.
2980	0	a	Good and fun game, after a while it gets boring though.
7667	1	a	it is cool 
7669	1	a	I killed a T-Rex in slow motion with a longbow. If that isn't worth your dollar, I don't know what is. It's a litle glitchy, but what game isn't? Graphics are very good for $0.99 cents worth, and the gameplay is just great, especially if you have friends. Buy the 4-Pack, and play with your friends. It's such a great game.  There are other games out there for the same price, but I'm confident that none of them will get you this much enjoyment.  8/10
7671	1	a	my first payd game on steam and is BEST!!!
7673	1	a	A rather wacky game where you shoot dinosaurs in the face with guns.  11/10
2981	0	a	This is one of the only Steam games i own that i wouldnt reccommend buying. When I first bought it, I was super excited, but whem i lunched the game, I found that the graphics were terrible (and slow), and that the overall idea of the game was kinda stupid too. Some people might enjoy it, but it certainly wasn't for me.
7675	1	a	This game is fun any easy to play. Also it is very cheap. What I am saying is ever one should get this game and at least try it. I just wish it had more vehicle to play with in game most air.
7677	1	a	AWESOME! Dinasours, TANKS, Choppers, Biks, Lightsabers, &amp; JETPACKS!! WHAT MORE COULD YOU WANT!!?!?!?!?
2983	0	a	zero skill involved in the game. Guns have zero recoil which shooting a bore. Fun concept but bad execution
7679	1	a	Orion: Prelude is not terrible.   Not Good.  But not terrible. Its a game that you know is kind of bad, but you can have fun with it with friends.  It has very satisfying controls, okay visuals and pretty good gameplay. But screw all that, its dang cheap. Pick it up for a few hours of fun. Its worth it.
7681	1	a	Really fun game, plays like halo1 on pc but has dinosaurs. You can jump out of helicopters and land on tpteranodons.   10/10 game of the year.   Make sure you have friends to play with cause community may be dead.
7683	1	a	A game this cheap with potentially hours of fun with multiplayer?  Don't think! get it!  Ps. You get to kill a Trex that throws rocks.
2985	0	a	you get what you pay for. The game is about as confusing to play as if I were making the game myself. That being said, it does have potential. BUT, if the developers do not clean the game up it's going to just be Call of Duty with dinosaurs. with just as many 'spinoffs' if the rumors are correct.
7685	1	a	A lot of love was put into one dolla
7687	1	a	you can shoot dinosaurs to hell with such varied weaponry that it doesn't matter how much you mess around 10/10
7689	1	a	this game is only 0,89 cent . For that kind of money this game is really good i've seen a lot of games for 30\40 dollars that are way worst . This game is really fun to play with friends so i reccomend it a lot and it still has a lot of poeple playing it
7691	1	a	Quite good but so lag when in lobby!
7693	1	a	I PLAYED THE DEMO AND LOVED IT !!!
7695	1	a	My friend said it was a bad game......but it's alright if you have friends to play with
7697	1	a	Expected more but I guess I got what I paid for lol
7699	1	a	This is a must have for your game library. You will get countless hours of enjoyment out of 99 cents. There are other game modes besides survival and great online community.
7701	1	a	amazing such good graphics my comp can barely handle it lol
7703	1	a	Can't argue with the price, and I killed a T-Rex with a revolver.   10/10
7705	1	a	♥♥♥♥... I mean I got a card but ♥♥♥♥...
7707	1	a	I wish there was a so-so option for recommending this game because Orion:Prelude is a somewhat of a decent Dinosaur game, it's sort of like Primal Carnage but doesn't have as good of graphical quality. The dinosaur selection in this game is ok where you can chose seven dinosaurs, two pterosaurs,and one Deinosuchus which also makes unique because there aren't alot of games out there that allow you to play as a Deinosuchus. Overall its an ok game. Overall score: 5.5/10.
7709	1	a	Jurassic Park in space.
7711	1	a	it's a bit buggy and sometimes not that pretty, but it can be really fun to play!
7713	1	a	Orion Prelude, a game for 0.99euro wich is in terms of fun above most games of 60 euro like really after 2 rounds (and I still didnt know the controls because I was to lazy to look for them) I was already addicted to this game.  Weapons and verichels in Planetside2 style, Dinosaurs, Like ya Dinosaurs guys  if u have 1 euro on your steam buy it right now u won't reget it
7715	1	a	This game... It costs very little and yet I'd rarther play this than some of the triple A titles such as Call of Duty. This game is such fun for a small price, I recomend it strongly to people who love to fight off waves of Dino's or face off against the humans as Dino's whilst protecting your egg! Just a Beautiful game...
2988	0	a	Claims to have full controller support, does NOT SUPPORT XBOX ONE CONTROLLER. This type of game NEEDS controller support. Please remove your head from ♥♥♥.    0/10 (unplayable without claimed controller support)
7717	1	a	Even though the Game is very cheap (1€, u wot m8), its actually fun to play. While its not the best in means of graphics or gameplay mechanics, who cares? You can fight a T-Rex by just hitting him with your itsy-bitsy gun, or shred a small Dino with your Rocket Launcher to pieces.
7719	1	a	This has to be one of the single worst games I've ever played, and yet I cannot stop playing. It's just so entertaining! Being drunk helps, of course, but it is not vital to the experience. Grab a four-pack and three friends, and give it a shot.
2990	0	a	Cool concept could be better
7721	1	a	Loved this game... not much more to say. Ya shoot dinosaurs and its loads of fun  9/10
7723	1	a	Definitely worth the dollar
7725	1	a	i dont understand anything/10
7727	1	a	An amazing Co-op experience for up to (I believe 10 players). Wave based killathon. A large number of gamemodes, weapons, powerups, enemies and vehicles. Highly configurable in terms of both game rule settings and also video/audio. Graphics are superb. Netcode solid (thanks Unreal engine). Tons of steam achievements. Map editor via sdk. Need I say more? Get it. Great job by developers to stick with it until the game shined.
7729	1	a	-Playing by yourself: 8-9/10 -Playing with Friends: 11/10  Really, the only thing that i do not like about this game is that it has no windows 8 support. Even then, it runs OK, but i guess its really up to your computer at that point.   -For those of you who have played CARNIVORES, you always get super bored of hunting and shoting over and over and ogre again. You never have any cool weapons, and hunt the same freakin dinosaurs over and ogre again. You always wish that there was something cool, something where you could play with others, something a little more upgraded than crossbows and forrest maps (with the exception of like one desert map, which is also mainly forrests.) When i saw this game when as browsing the winter sale, i clicked on it and it seemed fun; especially for the price. In the past 4-5 days, i have racked up like 15-20 hours on this game. This game gives everything that a carnivores fan would desire and waaaay more. lightsabers, Compound bows, sentry turrets, jetpacks, invisibility cloaks, healing guns, a revolver, tanks, mechs, helicopters even, warthogs, APCs; this game packs all of a dinosaur fans wet dreams into it.   -Ogre all review: 10/10
7731	1	a	Bought this game only because wanted to know what kind of a game can you purchase for 0,79 EUR. The first time I turned it on, I understood that you play what you pay for - outdated graphics, very simple physics, small maps which don't differ much from each other...  After a month gave it another chance. I must say, that even considering all the cons mentioned above, it still can be pretty fun. Not sure If I have been very lucky, but the community is good (At least in all of the servers I've played in).  Final verdict: The best fun I've had for 0.79 EUR!!!
7733	1	a	It's way cheaper than it should be
7735	1	a	This game is awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!
2995	0	a	I can't recommend this game, even though I got it for less than a dollar. True, I feel that I got my money's worth of enjoyment, but this game overdelivers on concept and far underdelivers on gameplay.
2996	0	a	I really wanted to love this game but the mouse delay was way to intense. Lag city ♥♥♥♥♥ lag lag city ♥♥♥♥♥.... 4/10
7737	1	a	this game is fun as coop. game . i like its grafics . it suits game too. its pice is good too. i think more ppl could give it a try :D
7739	1	a	Perhaps the 3rd steam game i got.  Pros:  + The game costs $1 + Very unique gameplay + Dinosaurs  Inbetween pros and cons:  = Slightly confusing controls(there IS a lot of keys that it uses aswell) = No storyline  Cons:  - Gets boring after a while - Only good computers can run this game - I assume it has about 1 months worth of gameplay  Graphics: 8.5/10 Singleplayer experience: 8.5/10 Multiplayer experience(PvE): 9/10 Multiplayer experience(PvP): 7/10 Overall Rating: 9/10
7741	1	a	Very unexpected joy coming from a game that costs less than a pack of gum.  10/10
7743	1	a	I like shooting zombies with friends. Dinosaurs is not that far of a leap I guess.
7745	1	a	this game is a result of star wars having sex with jurrasic park their son having sex with farcry their son having sex with Call of duty their son having sex with Killing Floor there was so much sex needed for ORION: Prelude to be born 10/10 ORION: Prelude will have sex with GTA
7747	1	a	You can run around as a dinosaur in some modes.... eough said XD Pretty damn awesome fun, for the cheap price! A must play with friends.
2998	0	a	Got the game from a friend tries to join lobby 3 times ends up playing with russians 10/10    not
7749	1	a	When i first started playing this game i was like 'what the hell is going on here?!', the moment i walked outside the spawn was like entering a hell, but then with dinosaurs. I had one word for it..'Whoa...'. Everywhere you look dino's walking, screaming, running, flying it was amazing! Even better is the Rampage mode where you can actually BE a f* DINOSAUR! One tip, to change the class you play, press 'N' to change it next time you die. Also i want to say the people i played with were very nice, and i think that there are way too less games of this. One bad thing is the clipping and hitboxes. My dinosaur could not get through a space where i had 2 M left on both sides, but then again, it's still making me laugh if i see how they magically walk side of the clif edge if you manage to get lose xD
7751	1	a	as long as you don't mind losing, this game is great. When a T-rex gets ahold of you are most likely toast. It is a bit hard to win you may have to turn it down to noob. Come on you are fighting dinosaurs with a tiny gun. What do you want? You are crunchy and taste good with ketuchup.
2999	0	a	DONT BUY THIS DESPERATE PIECE OF CRAP  Notice how no actuall CRITICS leave messages in the trailer, that's because they got random users to say unbelievable crap about this decieving ♥♥♥♥ bucket of a game,  I know it's '99c' It doesnt mean you have to buy this game Just go buy a piece of paper, draw a dinosaur on it and you will have more fun doing so then you would playing this garbage
7753	1	a	This game is top. Buy it now
7755	1	a	OK i dont care what anyone says this is one of the best games for $0.99 cents after i started playing it i even forgot that i only paid $0.99 cents

7757	1	a	played for 2 hours, got a lightsaber, did less damage than my knife. 10/10
3003	0	a	Buggy, decent graphics, and repetitive gameplay lacking variety and weapons. The maps are dull and playing as a dinosaur isn't nearly as fun as it seems it would and probably should be. Also the controls for controlling a dinosaur are unclear, unstated, and a lot of the times do not even work. Not worth playing - it is a waste of time and not nearly as good as it should and could be.
7759	1	a	I bought this game for $49 - oops, I mean $0.49 - you fight waves of dinosaurs. You can use a pistol to kill them. Or two pistols. Or machine pistols. Or shotguns. Or sniper rifles. Or LMG's. Or SMG's. Or a grenade launcher. Or a rocket launcher. Or a bow and arrow. You can place turrets. Gun turrets, rocket turrets or flamethrower turrets. You can drive over the dinosaurs. You can shoot them with rockets from aerial vehicles. It's bloody brilliant, and for 1 dollar you cannot get better value for money! I've only played co-op with a friend, and it was insane amounts of fun! Buy it, this game is a steal!
7761	1	a	  To start with.
7763	1	a	My god it is fun with friends. You will need friends to play this though, it's better to have someone to help you with this experience. It's like an even more indie version of Killing Floor, but with dinosaurs, mechs, tanks, and (helicopters?). Good for how cheap it is, if you can get over how indie it is.
7765	1	a	You can't beat the price, and it seems like the devs are always putting out stuff for this. The game was kinda unplayable at one point, but it's made a big turn around. Check it out.
3004	0	a	Still doesn't work. Waste of money. Steam should remove.
7767	1	a	So I don't know if this game is bad or sorta ok. I'm conflicted. On one hand this game is not really polished and there are a lot of iffy things about it. You can't buy ammo for guns you run out of, the kill cam is weirdly stuck on the enemy's face, the music is incredibly heroic for some reason and I find things aren't particularly well explained.  HOWEVER you can play as the dinosaurs and eat humans. That's fun. It's not fun for the humans because the dinosaurs are too stronk.  I'm giving this game a posivite review because it's given me some good ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles but if I could give it eeeennnhhh I would.
7769	1	a	I got this game from a friend of mine and we played it for a tad over 24 hours total. It is actually a horrible game if you start thinking about it (bad sound ok grafics and gameplay but quite some bugs and stuff), but for the low price it's actually ok, since you can have quite a lot of fun plinking around with friends. Oh speaking of which: DO NOT play this game ALONE, it completely and utterly SUCKS alone! Get at least 1 friend to play with you, otherwise fun=0 I also disagree about the micro-transacion thing in the game. I think this is the realm of free-to-play stuff, not games you actually have to pay for, even if it's just 1€! If you want a more serious and complete game i suggest you take a look at Primal Carnage, especially when it's on sale (since it's a little priceier) but I haven't played that one so I cann't comment on the quality. But as far as Orion goes: 1€ for 24 hours of fun gamelay? Why not? :)
3005	0	a	Don't buy this is game is a troll
7771	1	a	Great game if you enjoy to play FPS games. Has a few minor bugs.
7773	1	a	the game lags to much but its still worth the money
7775	1	a	Jetpacks, heavy weapons, and dinosaurs.  It could be more polished. But until you beat a raptor to death with a rocket launcher while flying.. you dont know what true glee is.
7777	1	a	This is what happens when a stupid idea is amazingly fun.
7779	1	a	I'm just going to give you the specifics in 1-10 ratings. Game smoothness - 6/10 (Meh) Class variety - 3/10 (3 of them) Weapon balance - 2/10 (Sniping with machine guns) Dinosaur AI - -4/10 (Hilarious) Bot AI - -∞/10 (No) Vehicles - 10/10 (Killing machines) Game Hilarity - (1.6 x 10^8)/10 (My god yes) And last but not least... Is it worth the price? It has had more free days than i've had showers. Yes. Just yes. 
7781	1	a	i always thought this game could never be better but i hope more people play it but i would still play this than titanfall i would give it 1000/10 points i mean this game could be better but i like it this way i stil think that players should be able to choose what dino to be but the boss battles i would give a 5/10 and the rest is just fine accept please higher the price's for some equipement
3008	0	a	This game is buggy, there are bugs such as doors remaining closed the whole game. The melee weapons are also useless as they are outmatched by the heavy weapons, such as the minigun. This game also has terrible graphics and the game has random lag spikes (the lag might just be my computer).
7783	1	a	Not Bad
7785	1	a	The perfect drug.
7787	1	a	A lot of fun, but has frequent framerate issues. Sometimes to the point of gamebreaking (may just be my computer though), but hey it's only a dollar. If you are playing with a controller, it can be unresponsive at times during the gameplay.
7789	1	a	This Game is very fun. first point: It teaches people about the jurrassic  second point: Its FPS , who don't like FPS third point: You Can play it online or play with your buddys and family  Most Important Point: The Game Is Cheap
7791	1	a	'Lets have anal'-A MAN
3010	0	a	It was fun before the 'Prelude' title came about. Now the game feels like a generic P2W / F2P title.
3011	0	a	Dinosaurs? More like DinoSORES! Hah! This game is terrible. Just awful. If you play this game, you're scum. If you made this game, you're scum.
3012	0	a	Shoot Dinosaurs as they skate towards you.
3013	0	a	I wish i could sell games on the steam market...
7793	1	a	Great game. Love to play it with 4 other people. That way it's a full party and we can own. If you want to play with me just message.
7795	1	a	looks great i would recommend this to those who like halo and dinosaurs
7797	1	a	its a fun game and i reccomend it makes me feel like a bad ♥♥♥ 
3015	0	a	I gave the game an honest shot, I really did. I just could not bring myself to liking it, it felt far too generic and shoddy. I can imagine the game being good fun for a couple of buddies on LAN but that's as far as I would go. Accounting everything from graphics, game mechanics and accessibility i'd give the game a 5/10.
7799	1	a	Turok meets Halo in this jump in jump out game. Initial thoughts were that this game was going to be boring but it is one of those games that remains a hidden gem. Get it, play it, and see for yourself.
7801	1	a	You shoot dinosars and it's co-op, what more could you want?
7803	1	a	Neat idea. However the gameplay gets boring fast.   Since the update, this game has become actually playable and enjoyable. It still needs some work/balancing. The most unfortunate part being that each game is a fresh start, so you can never truly enjoy character building. Also there is no storyline, just killing hordes of dinosaurs until you succumb to a t-rex.
7805	1	a	killed a T-rex by stabbing it in the head with a lightsaber-type sword.
7807	1	a	Drove head-on into a stegosaurus, exploded into a ball of flames. 10/10
3017	0	a	I AM CHOKING ON THE QUALITY OF THIS GAME JK
7809	1	a	Super stupid fun, worth the I think.... 2 bucks I spent on a sale? Would not buy full price, there is just not enough content here. It is best played with a bunch of friends doing stupid stuff but don't try to play the Dino Vs Human, the dinos are so overpowered its no contest. A dino player can choose the massive dinos like the T-Rex and just maul a human with little effort while having a health bar that takes literally 6 mins to chew through, and the human objective is to collect eggs that every dino can just camp. Playing a small dino is pointless however, it is the compleat opposit with the exception of the exploding compy (a dino that somehow has a bomb strapped to it's back?), you get killed so fast from any weapon you have to get very lucky just to get an attack off. The flying dinos.... I don't know, I never figured out how to even attack with them. The Human vs CPU dinos is fun though, you have to go to objetives, get in vehicles, protect buildings, ect. There are jeeps, tanks, mechs, and I believe ATVs. Do not get stuck as a gunner on the jeep if it gets stuck in a wall though, there is a bug where you can't get out. It feels like a quirky unreal tourny vs dinos and you can pick perks to upgrade your humans.  Overall its a fun game if you can snag it on sale, play with friends and don't take the game serious at all.
7811	1	a	So much co op fun ignore the meta score!
7813	1	a	A few cent's to experience how truly the dinos died C:
7815	1	a	Good game, has some issues with control but the game play itself is good. The graphical scenery is almost AAA title level in places. Great game if you can get it on sale
3018	0	a	4/10 gets boring quickly i dont know how maybe the atmosphere of it. only get it if its on sale
7817	1	a	Orion Dino Horde is fast and furious (Hectic in fact). It is fun and adrenaline fuel at it's best. Gameplay is smooth and the conrols are superb. This game has evolved from a motley dog to a supreme gaming experience. Hat's off to the dev team for salvaging this as the concept was solid. There are also 250 steam achievements ...
3020	0	a	This game blows. Trust me.
7819	1	a	Only played for 2 hours so far, but this game is very fun. I'm not sure why the metascore is so low, but it was def worth the on sale price that I payed.
7821	1	a	This game is awesome. Shot a stegosaurus in the face with a grenade launcher then shot a pterodactyl that was diving at me out of the sky while backpedaling.
7823	1	a	Just one problem with this game.    It feels cheap and unfinished
7825	1	a	Its not suppose to be a award winning triple A game with amazing graphics and story. Just a simple, very fun horde mode sci fi fps with dinos. Its all up to how much fun you have with the game. Playing with buddies is a blast for me. If you are intrested, wait till the price drops and get it for you and your buddies.
7827	1	a	realy good game
7829	1	a	honestly at first i tought this game's graphics where a bit on the bad side but i was having so mutch fun i didn't even think about ghraphics 
3021	0	a	well I got the game to try out and let me say I DO NOT LIKE IT. The grafics are slow and multiplayer is bad. Its not worth the mony, I rather recommend tf2 or dota 2 than this. But the game can get beter with updates and help so what im saying is put some work into it and I'll recommend it but not now.
7831	1	a	An FPS where you can actually see your feet. 10/10
7833	1	a	I tentativly would reccomend this to freinds its killing floor with dinosaurs 5/10 for me it has potential but it dosent use it
7835	1	a	Years old and not quite all out action but none the less addictively fun and entertaining running around shooting dinosaurs in an Unreal Powered environment.
7837	1	a	This game doesn't seem extreemly polished at first but for some weird reason it's really, really fun :D
7839	1	a	t rex bit my face off. the bite scores a 5 but the game scores a solid 7.
3023	0	a	Stupid and only fun for a short period of time.
3024	0	a	to play this game you need 2 things beer and lots of it and frineds that are willing to buy this game
7841	1	a	Got a 4 pack on summer sale for like 5$ (wich is a steal...) this game is worth the 15$ full price IMO but it's probably gonna be on sale again if you want to wait...  It's a nice coop game and relatively easy to understand how everything works (buying system etc.) there are vehicles in wich you can make roadkill (ever tough they could just run over raptors in Jurassic Park? well you can do that) and you have a Jetpack too, so in resume you get to drive vehicule and shoot dinosaurs with rocket launchers and machine gun, what more can I say...  didn't play too much since I just bought it but I like it soo far, buy it :P   
7843	1	a	This might be the weirdest game I've ever played. Well... maybe not the weirdest, but certainly odd. You can play some sort of marines, or dinosaurs... and fight. It's simple. I mean... that much info about the game made me buy it, so maybe that's enough. Great game.
7845	1	a	Awesome game, quit heavy on your pc and sometimes a bit laggy when playing with other people but everything else is awesome!
7847	1	a	15 out of 10 stars.best game i've ever played!whats better than lag, bugs, and dinosaurs!worth the fifteen dollars.
7849	1	a	So glad I tried this....easy learning curve and fun.
3026	0	a	I bought this game for one euro.  Still felt robbed of my money.
7851	1	a	dinosaurs vs humans. interesting concept and very un. Can't wait for there august update.
7853	1	a	IT'S SO STOOPID IT'S GOOD
7855	1	a	This game is really interesting! its a game whereby conventional fps would seem very lacking in. Basically this games can at take at least 10 hour of your time. to actually test everything out! However its recommended if you search up for guide about the control , because this game is not newbie friendly! so its something the developer should keep note of! as well as the repetitive of the maps! as well as objective!.. other than that you should find the game quite interesting! =)
7857	1	a	High tech and guns + dinos = AWESOME
7859	1	a	If you don't have a proper team or group of people, then prepare to get eaten. Surviving against waves of dinosaurs (big or small) is not easy nor is it a boring chore. The graphics suck and the character designs for the player are bland but at least the dinosaurs look good. Pick this one up on the cheap.
7861	1	a	It's a pretty good little game. I got it for 1 euro, and that's about the best value for it. The survival mode can be really fun if you get some decent teammates but really, that's a problem that all online games have, getting matched with stupid ♥♥♥♥ing kids. Other than that, the Versus mode is a bloody nightmare, I was getting 200 ping on the servers, couldn't get a lower ping for the life of me... Because of that ping, in Versus mode, I had one of the lowest K:D ratio I have ever had in ANY game, EVER! Lol... Graphics are pretty decent. It has the occasional glitch but nothing too bad. Like I said, not too bad. Take it with a grain of salt.
7863	1	a	Well worth the price, still buggy and a work in progress but a lot of fun!
7865	1	a	i liked this game because the dinos are very colorfull and that the guns and melee weapons are very powerfull
3031	0	a	I got this game for free and I only played for 15 minutes. What a waste. The graphics are awful, the animations are terrible, and the combat is a Halo ripoff. It's a really bad Halo ripoff with ugly dinosaurs. Avoid this game.  0/10
7867	1	a	Best $1 bill I've ever spent. I've logged several hours now in to this game and it's fun. It has it's bugs and minor glitches, but if the devs give attention to this game it can only get better.
7869	1	a	Spent $1.50 to kill some dinosaurs and have some fun. Left satisfied for what I paid for.
7871	1	a	Only when it is on the 99cent sale
7873	1	a	This game is definitely still in beta. Some server functions don't work, and there's still a fair amount of glitches. All that aside, this is one of the most fun games I've ever played. If you're looking for a team-based shooter with a fairly fast pace, this game is for you.
7875	1	a	Very fun game if you have some friends to play with!!
7877	1	a	Much better since the last update
7879	1	a	This game is a mixture of Call of Duty:BO 2, with killfloor, Haloesque themes combined with Jarassic park! Somehow it works. I mean survival is fun the game modes are fun. Hey you could say it has a bit of battlefield. The neat thing with this game is they can combine all of the various shooter modes into different game modes and keep them there. Like counterstrike style or halo style etc. It's a pretty neat game for $1-3. It's probably a $40 value! All the great things are fairly obvious. Best thing 3rd person first person shooter.  Some things to add note (minor tweaks.) (all negatives.)  I wish each of the characters were male-female. The shop purely is aesthetics which is nice if say you wanted a skin. It's a dollar but steam want syou to use a 5. So sells ome stuff for the skins. Another problem is the pvp game modes like capture the flag sometimes are non-halo. I wish you could do one where it's just pvp with the counterstrike style (choose your weapon.) If the animations worked a little better, the game would be more fluid. There are some issues like the vehicles aren't that classy, and the dino's are seethrough if you phase through them.   The main two modes I really want is a pvp where I can choose. I love the free for all with the cryo sword. But they need to expand on the game modes. Make a slightly better UI when interacting to make games and bingo! It's a triple AAA title. The best thing about the game is the graphics scale! My computer can handle halo 1-2 graphics no problem! My friend had on the shaders and it ran fine as well in 400k Perfect! 1080P? maybe, but higher rez great!  Have a 64 person mode with vehicles. and dinosaurs in the mix. IDK!  This game is going to be the next COD! No joke. If they added a few AI trianing players with dinos running around and then had pvp. That creates the best game ever. Thus far there's no real point to leveling up. NONE! It's something that they probably are adding on in the future. 
7881	1	a	Game runs like crap but is fun on conquest with a group of friends.
7883	1	a	Its a fun game that kinda reminds me of the old game called 'Turok' . If your not into the worlds best graphics but you like how the game is set up/gameplay this game is for you .
3036	0	a	As hopeful as i was for this game, it did not turn out so well.  Playability is 1/10 because once you find the groove you can easily win any game mode.  Graphics is decent 5/10  UI is about 6/10 but vastly could do for some maintance with some buggy area's.  Lobby and Server waits/connect is 2/10 because it seemed like the first two times booting up it didn't let me join or respond to click imput.  Overall 3/10 because it doesn't suck you in and has you replaying over and over. If you really want to try it out, wait for free trial periods then if you want to buy, get it on sale because 15 bucks is way to much for a sub par Killing Floor type game.
7885	1	a	When this game first came out it felt like a waste of money and had little content, but after thousands of updates and improvments this game is acutally worth every $! if your looking for a fun coop game with dinos! then this is a must buy :D
7887	1	a	Hilarious game! This is a riot to play with your buddies. I would say don't buy it for single player, but if you have at least three friends that would play with you, just have someone man up and get a four pack (when it is on sale). The co-op against the dinoasurs is too fun to pass up. 8/10
3037	0	a	It is a meh game. At first it is fun, but then it just becomes wave after wave of the same thing and it becomes boring. There is really only one good-ish game mode. I am glad that someone else got it for me at a 93% off promotion because it is not worth $15. I just can't reccommend this game. 4/10
7889	1	a	This is a really great game to play with your friends. It is frantic and fun. Imagine a expanded nazi zombies mode from Call of Duty: World at War with dinosaurs. Really fun
3038	0	a	Alright for shooting some dinosaurs in the face, though the difficulty ramps up a little too quickly for my tastes. The assets are decent enough, but they suffer quite a bit in motion due to an odd application of motion blur.
7891	1	a	Purchased this game on sale and it was worth the buck. It could use more polishing though, there are times when it gets too buggy and the graphic's latency can also improve.
7893	1	a	Pretty fun, got it on sale and it was worth the couple bucks
7895	1	a	This is quite an enjoyable game. From the amount of intense gameplay when your getting mobed by a pack of tiny dinos to the exitment of being in a giant walking mech and mowing down a bunch of dinos. Its fun left and right, The enviornments are very colorful and pretty, Wide open so you feel free in a sence, I highly reccomend this game.
7897	1	a	enjoying the CRAP out of this game. A very great game that is so much fun to sit down in front of for hours and just mow down dinosaurs!!!
7899	1	a	This is basically Halo with dinosaurs. I never liked Halo, But this game is superfun mega challenge fantastic happy blood storm. With dinosaurs!
3040	0	a	36/100 Metacritic is too ♥♥♥♥ing generous.
3041	0	a	Did not like the game, difficult to control, though I'm not a huge fan of FPS versus hordes
7901	1	a	AWESOME GAME even though has a few bugs such as : The pistol floating for a sec after switching.
7903	1	a	decent with a group of friends
7905	1	a	Worth a go if you find it cheap, played for ~5hrs and want to play more.
7907	1	a	Join random server first time playing. Was instantly thrown up and eaten by T-rex. 11/10
7909	1	a	A grand old stupid time.
7911	1	a	Brilliant. Amazingly fun. Have you ever wanted to blast dinoz with friends? This games for you. Simply the best relaxed shooter ever.
7913	1	a	Fun $0.99 game buy it if you want to shoot dinosaurs and what-not....
3043	0	a	It's fun for... less than the time it took me to download the game. Glitchy and un-fun.
7915	1	a	this game is A+
3044	0	a	this game is so horrifly terrible. Not worth a quarter
7917	1	a	awesome cuz you shoot dinos and more dinos, then you shoot some more
7919	1	a	This game is a great co-op game. good vehicals, multiple ways to play all while helping to complete the same objective with friends or strangers. If manage to get this during one of the great deals it is well worth 1-2 dollars. if not then if you enjoy first person shooters and good set of vehicals. would get it. A lot of people are friendly when playing currently so helps learning curve. Not much of one but every game has one.
7921	1	a	This is a good game if you like to kill dino, what else is there to say? Down with the zombie fad and long live the dino!
7923	1	a	Not the most polished game, but I have had a lot of fun with it for the $2 I spent. Good dino shooting gallery game, and coop is fun.  7.5/10
7925	1	a	I went in expecting nothing. Best god damn $1.50 I've ever spent.  You NEED friends to play with, it makes it so much better. I believe the metacritic score was for their old game before they overhauled it. Seriously, I spent $1.50 and ended up not stopping the game for 6 hours.
7927	1	a	It has dinosaurs, more people should play this game. 10/10.
7929	1	a	You can be a dinosaur buy it
7931	1	a	I can pistol whip a raptor in the face  11/10
7933	1	a	are you serious? GET THIS GAME! 10/10 kill dinosaurs
7935	1	a	very good game especially with friends and skype
7937	1	a	10/10 would shoot dinos again, hey thats rhymes
7939	1	a	This is a really good game. Sometimes it can be quite laggy, but what game isn't these days. If you like COD zombies, this is basicaly the same thing, but dinosaurs, and a whole lot more fun than zombies. Great game!
7941	1	a	it be cool yo
7943	1	a	Who is the right mind would pay 15$ for this asinine game?
7945	1	a	A quirky, yet satisfying FPS twitch survival game. Meet new friends, kill big lizards, bring me some pizza!
3055	0	a	Halo styled play with dino's. Meh.
7947	1	a	It' pretty good, but the dynamic weather can get really annoying, but hey, that makes it more 'real', the rain can really blur your vision, other than that, it's a fun game for a decently low cost (on sale)
7949	1	a	This game is very fun, especially if you grab a few copies for you and your buddies. You'll get a few enjoyable hours out of it minimum, and for around a dollar when it's on sale that is an insane bargain. It does have its bugs--clipping and crazy physics among them--but if you can look past those kinds of things you'll really enjoy the game. Personally, I've already put 27 hours into it and I got it for LESS than a dollar. Best value I've ever gotten out of a game. There are several different modes, but the core game modes are Conquest and Survival where you're defending against increasingly difficult waves of dinosaurs. This does get repetitive after a while, (especially in Conquest) so if that bothers you it could be an issue. Personally I don't mind it, because it's fun. Gun game is my favorite mode for PvP. The class skills spice it up nicely.  tl;dr Give the game a chance. It's usually around a dollar on sale and it's a blast. But if you're looking for a polished gem, this probably isn't it.
7951	1	a	A really nice game, especially for multiplayer. High paced action and a lot of chaos is ensured
7953	1	a	It's like Battlefield with dinosaurs.
7955	1	a	Such a good game!
3057	0	a	Thank god I only lost $1.30 on this game. It's cheesy in all the wrong ways, so much so that only a 5 year old boy with devolpmental issues wouldn't find the cliches grating. 0/10  Even on the lowest settings the game is prone to crashing and hiccuping frequently. Too much time to jacking to leaf textures and not enough time actually putting some thought into the game. I wouldn't recommend this to even stalin.
7957	1	a	This is an awesome game good for you and your friends to play or make some new ones its a clean take on FPS horde games check it out!
7959	1	a	Decent game. 7/10 would play again.
7961	1	a	this is a dinosaur game were there are 3 diffrent classes and vehicles inclunding tanks and mechs and gamemodes and a lot of stuff you should go check it out!
7963	1	a	I've only been able to play survival mode so far but have been having a blast doing so. It certainly requires team-work, especially in the final waves, to take down the hordes of bigger dinos before they smash your base.   Credit based weapons and augments are available between waves though in some cases getting back across the map in time can be difficult if you happen to be stuck on foot. There is also a teleport device available by pressing 5, but if you've burned it up and it's on cooldown, hopefully you are paired with other players that realize this and stop to pick you up in one of the multi-seat vehicles.   The amount of upgrades available really let you customize your class uniquely from other players. I played medic in all matches and each time was different. In one case I was able to get an augment that allowed me use of other class' weapons, very cool.  The controls were something I still fumbled over with at the end of the night (even after remapping keybinds). Keys 1-4 seemed to have no visible use for changing weapons, althought 4 does bring up high-cost weapons like turrets once purchased, and 5 brings up a teleport device to return you to base quickly (found completely by accident on my part). Scroll Wheel does little to help with weapon switching as it will only cycle your primary and secondary weapons. For the case of a medic, there is a 3rd healing gun which I had to bind to Mouse3 just to have fast access to it. Quick switch on Q had me repeatedly bombing my team with grenades. Out of habit from other FPS games, I've become accustomed to subconciously hitting this to go between primary and last used secondary which never included grenades. In this game however, grenades are looped in. I'd like to see them removed from the quick switch cycle. These are minor adjustments the devs can make if other players felt the same way I do.  Lastly, the AI of the infantry dinos (raptors) seems like it could use some work. They are way to easy to take down in packs as they come at you line up in a row with no signs of deviating when being shot at. It was effortless to rack up killing sprees and higher on them. There were also times entire packs of raptors would run right passed me with one of my teammates firing on them; not very raptor like. The larger dinos seemed to have more intelligence as they would knock me away from the group often and keep us divided by distances. I would see the T-Rex target snipers by hurling rocks, so I wondered if the devs spent some time tuning them with actual objectives.  Other than these minor encumbrances, this game is fun and I look forward to playing more.
7965	1	a	I LOVE IT, just wish more people played it.
3058	0	a	Horrible load of ♥♥♥♥, I got it for free when they were giving it away. Not even worth the price of free, it's like a really broken and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ version of Halo 1 with dinosaurs.
7967	1	a	good with friends bad when you are alone.
7969	1	a	THIS IS THE AWESOME! I know this comment isn't really the helpfull. But it is true.
7971	1	a	This game is fun if you have people to play it with, otherwise it is rediculously hard to play.
3063	0	a	It's not often that I am left speechless, but today dear reader, I must cut off my voice and gaze upon the glory that is ORION Dino Horde in humbled silence. Truly a masterpiece, perfect in every way, the Citizen Kane of video games. Words cannot describe the joy and pleasure that result from engaging in this program. I must confess that I climaxed not once, not twice, but three times during my first session. If you only buy one game this year, if you buy only one game this century, if you buy only one game ever, I implore you, purchase this glorious piece of art and feel the warm glow of true satisfaction.
7973	1	a	This game is a lot of fun. If you are looking for a co-op game for you and some friends I advise you give this a try. Don't listen to the reviews from 2012 they don't apply to this game anymore, it has came a long way. For the price it's at you can't be disappointed. 
7975	1	a	This game is amazing. I got it in a four pack in the steam summer sale. Me and my friends have so much fun with it, and it cost so little. Tottaly worth getting. Really it is. The metta score is wrong. Don't belive it. Play this game with people. Co-op op.
7977	1	a	First time first person shooter.. and I really like this game.
7979	1	a	PLAY THIS GAME!!!!   That is all.
3065	0	a	I DON'T LIKE POLONIZE
7981	1	a	this is awesome! get this game!
7983	1	a	dam every fun with people :D recommend :D
7985	1	a	.....
7987	1	a	This game is fun xD
7989	1	a	It's mindless fun. Well worth the Summer Sale price. Would love to see some L4D-esque run n gun maps in the future. The almost have it with the outposts, just need a little more thought and it will be awsome! Level editors for the community maybe?
7991	1	a	Never before has humanity faced such a great evil as the invasion of dinosaurs, This series of revalations have shown me the true light of how we must face down the threat of a dinosaur invasion, i have ridden on a dinosaur, that much is true, i am the son of god, that much i hope, but mum could just be covering up for an affiar she had. Back to the point at hand, i reccomed this game, it has shown me how to save humanity from a threat that is like no other, ♥♥♥♥ the nazis they are nothing on this ♥♥♥♥. We need to deal with this threat and deal with it now! BUY THIS GAME AND JOIN THE FIGHT TO SAVE SLOTHS FROM AN INVASION OF SMALL ARM FART MACHINES!
7993	1	a	Not as bad as metascore says. Seriously, it's pretty fun when playing with friends.
7995	1	a	Great game other than being a bit laggy
7997	1	a	For all the money a person throws away on crap... The $1 I paid for this paid for itself! Yes, it's repetitive. Yes it's grapically boring. Yes, it's actually pretty pointless. So is Pac-Man, and people still pop in quarters to play it. If you're at least in your 30s, think back to all the times you popped in money to play Dragon's Lair. Even at the 1014 summer sale price of $3.74, it's worth getting imo if you're looking for cheap random wtfits amusement! If you have a friend to play with, it will quickly pay for itself. It's like going to Jurassic Park with jetpacks and guns! Don't go into this with a serious face! Go at it knowing what you're getting yourself into.  the bad... - very limited ability to customize yourself without the IAP bs. You do unlock a few things by playing a lot. - 1 music track for everything. Turn off the music, pop on some MP3s! - T-Rex 1 bite kills you! - Raptors are NOT clever! - It's not worth $15.00 when you can hit Walmart and get old AAA games for $20.
7999	1	a	A great game with plenty of action. The weapons are nice and the ability to run things down in vehicles is a plus. Challenging and always keeping me on my toes and the A.I. is better in this game than in most that I have played. Overall, a great and challengning game.
8001	1	a	Much better than metacritic gives it credit for
8003	1	a	One of the cooles coop games out there! metascroe missleading ignore plz and watch user reviews. worth every fakn cent 
3067	0	a	Cheap yes but lag ugh so much of it....If you want to play for 30mins than get bored than this is the game for you someone made this in a day just to steal your money dont buy unless you love games that you get stuck or people camp where you cant get them its like really if your going to make a game than do it right thank you:)
8005	1	a	Great fun with some friends, just think your in jurassic park, and fight of waves of dino's !
8007	1	a	I would recommend this game solely because it is fun to kill dinosaurs and how cheap you can pick it up for if you wait for a good sale. The graphics aren't very impressive, but it is very entertaining
8009	1	a	Loads of fun!  WELL  worth 0,99€.  Why haven't you bought it yet! 
3068	0	a	Got game for 99% off... Should've waited for a better sale, was not worth -1/10
8011	1	a	This game is very broken but is very fun if you are looking for a laugh with friends. My rating 6/10 It would be 8/10 if the sounds weren't f***ed up.
8013	1	a	The melee dueling combat is actually pretty fun; it feels Jedi-esque, and the horde mode is pretty fun (especially with friends). It was well worth the 90 cents I paid for it. There are a few glitches here and there, and the vehicles seem somewhat underpowered except for the car with the gun (it is only good because of its mobility).
3069	0	a	Even for 1.50$ this game is a huge waste of money, plain and boring, dont buy
3070	0	a	The Metacritics were right!!
8015	1	a	It looks like it's gunna be rubbish but it really isn't.
8017	1	a	Halo with dinosaurs  343/343
8019	1	a	Haha had a lot of fun with this game.. well worth the couple bucks. I personally played it with a couple buddies for a co-op fps and we waisted a lot of time and dinosaurs!!! :D
8021	1	a	A fast paced romp through a horde of dinosaurs. enjoyable alone, but the game really shines in its multiplayer. working together to take down the dinos is sufficiently difficult to make you chear when you hear the satisfying death screams. I haven't played much yet, but i thoroughly enjoyed it so far.
8023	1	a	Fun game. A little confusing at first but you will get the hang of it
8025	1	a	Ruined to my life!! Buy This Game I LOVE THIS!!!
8027	1	a	You can try to run over a T rex... 'try' 4/5
8029	1	a	Fun game, you get to shoot dinosaurs
3072	0	a	When this game first came out in beta it was known as orion : dino beatdown...It was a complete and utter junkheap then...Hardly anything worked and the gameplay was crap.However with the most recent update 12/21/13 it has slowly started to redeem itself and is slowly starting to become a good game.   * Never mind its still a piece of ♥♥♥♥.
8031	1	a	The graphics were not too bad, the gameplay does have a few bugs and the boss dinos are pretty hard hitting but what were you expecting from a 99p game. In my opinion this game is pure gold, it has fun gameplay and it's almost innovative to the indie genre. The weapon range is large and it has a competetive element inside it. Therefore I would consider buying this not if you just have spare change but if you want hours of fun then it's a must buy.
8033	1	a	This game is one of the best fps shooters i have played in a while. You just can't beat the feel of Halo with bad ♥♥♥ dinos.
8035	1	a	Shot my friend and killed him, then turned into a dinosaur and ate him. 99999 out of 10
8037	1	a	when it was free
8039	1	a	This game is so much fun to play. I like the fact that you can play as dinosaurs. It's a lot of fun chasing my friends around trying to eat them with zombie gator. lol 
3075	0	a	Glitchy, unplayable, boring, not fun, broken, poor ai, bad sound effects, bad graphics, strange physics... there just isn't a positive thing to say about it. Avoid it.  The game has been 'updated' since I wrote this but you should know the full history of the game:  Release week: game literally unplayable. Literally, you could open the program and not actually play the game due to some networking issues. Dev's blamed it on steam.  Week later an update came out 'fixing' the problem but you could only get the game to work by messing with some things. IE: ♥♥♥♥ing with the program.  So now you could kind of sort of play, right? Well, I was treated to one of the glitchiest games I've ever experienced, far worse than Dead Island. Things that happened included: hitting a pterodactyl corpse with a jeep and shooting STRAIGHT INTO THE SKY. The dodgy AI also got stuck inside buildings somehow, so that was entertaining. At one point I saved up money for 20 or so minutes to buy a flying thing, then immediately (like 50/70 feet above the ground) hit the skybox and either took damage or blew up (it's been a while). Also pretty sure I bought a walker, stepped off the pad (maybe 2/3 feet) and fell, taking damage or blowing up.  There's also this:   http://imgur.com/a/G2sts/noscript   This game was broken on release and the dude is super shady. The game was renamed to get around crappy metacritic scores and then the new game had the metacritic padded with fake accounts. After about two years is the game playable? Yeah, sure. It's just not very fun.  There's so much information on this game out there and if you're actually considering it, please go educate yourself on the history to it. Please.  Update as of Sept 13, 2014:  Alright, it's been a few years and I guess this has gotten a lot of updates (and two name changes? To avoid the poor critical reception me thinks) so I had to ask myself: is this game fun now?  Well, no, it isn't. It's been updated a lot, there are a lot of new features and the visuals are better. Hell, I would even go so far as to say this is an actual game now!  But when I join I still don't know what the hell I'm supposed to do (I kill dinosaurs, sure, but I don't understand the objectives at all -- probably because I haven't played enough). The AI is still dodgy as ♥♥♥♥ and can be outwitted simply by jetpacking on top of a building. Vehicles are still op in that going back and forth will just mow down an entire wave. Worst part? All of the new features have just further alienated me from the game. I don't know what the ♥♥♥♥ is worth geting and what isn't, which might not matter since everything just runs out of ammo very quickly anyway.  This game is still a pass. I'd recommend killing floor over it because the mechanics are similar but Killing Floor is actually good and fun. I will say Orion had and possibly still has a lot of potential, and maybe it's fun with friends when you know what the hell you're doing. But then, so are a lot of things.
8041	1	a	So worth the 99 cents. Got tons of laughs, really enjoyable, a bit frightening at time. But overall, a really valuable game to play once and awhile with friends.
8043	1	a	I played only a small portion of this game, though I can say that it is amazing. Despite it being EXTREMELY laggy/buggy (Might have just been the server) I found a lot of promise in it. It is a $0.99 game after all. You should be getting a mobile game at that price, not a game full in every way. Thank you, devs, for this awesome experience.
8045	1	a	well worth the money gve me hours of fun.
8047	1	a	If you have friends buy this game. If you dont have friends buy some. If you dont have money get a job. If you cant get a job rob somebody. if you cant rob somebody well you cant get this game :-/
8049	1	a	So cheap So fun So Simple. Buy the four pack and play with some mates for a few hours. its a bargin. unlike other some other games out there.
8051	1	a	The MetaScore is a LIE. A very if not superbly underated game.
8053	1	a	This game is amazing. The only question is, why the ♥♥♥♥ is the price so low. This is a $30 game. $0.99 for this good of a game. This game is perfect, fun, entertaining, engaging, and action packed.
8055	1	a	Running i7,8GBRAM, Geforce GT 720.  Stars: 1.5 ASSTAR RATING (so low it hurts my ♥♥♥)   -Pros- -FPS Dino Counter Strike -kill dinos -childhood memories    -CONS- -9mins and my ♥♥♥ hurt, so that means (ill be switching to a diffrent game.) -Play to waste time, in between wasting time like usual..
8057	1	a	love it must play
8059	1	a	This has developed into one of the best indi games out there. If you like Killing Floor, this is your type of game. But it has better graphics, deeper custimization, massive maps, vehicles, and rediculous outfits. Very tough!
3078	0	a	C'mon, you know you want it. A dollar. There are dinosaurs, guns, vehicles, melee, all you need. BUT, only buy it if you have a friend to play with you, because this game is coop based. Have fun.  EDIT .: WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED HERE
8061	1	a	its well cheap lad
8063	1	a	 Orion: Dino Horde/Orion: Prelude.  This is a relatively fun game, It has quite alot of customizable options as well as a neat Combat System. Now one of the main objectives of the game is to defend against 10 Waves of Dinosaurs increasing in difficulty which each Wave passed; You have a lot of weapon choices to purchase and use as well as Vehicles you can use to help defend against Dino Hordes varying from Ground Troop Carriers to large airborne Helicopter-Like vehicles that specialize in dishing out damage to the Dinos. While the game is alot of fun it does take some time to get used to and lacking a Tutorial can see many new players dying to the enemy Dinos quickly and severly weakening your team. Putting aside the lack of a Tutorial i really enjoyed this game in the short time i had to play it; It does have a tendency to crash every now and then but apart from that it's a pretty solid and enjoyable game.  I'd rate it a 8/10; Would have been higher if the game had an implemented Tutorial system, I did die quite alot in the first few rounds i played on this game.
8065	1	a	Awesome addicting game
8067	1	a	Very Cheap and Very Good &lt;3
8069	1	a	Its well made, fun and interesting . . recomended for casual gamers. 7/10
8071	1	a	It's Awesome Game
8073	1	a	Worth the dollar but i didnt pay for it so i dont care 
8075	1	a	A first-person shooter that has light sabers and allows the player to kill dinosaurs; I am not sure what more I could ask for. Despite the lag I experience during the gameplay, I still loved the short hours that I tried this game.  A dollar well spent, I guess I could say.
3085	0	a	consolitis. The slew of positive reviews are developer shills.  Do not fall for this ♥♥♥♥ game.
8077	1	a	For $0.99 you will get a TON of Jurrasic fun! Buy it, its a bargain.
8079	1	a	idk much but seens fun
8081	1	a	This game is AMAZING! There, I said it. This is what everyone has always wanted, a mix between Dinosaurs,Halo, and a bit of Borderlands. Not the bad stuff like 3 years olds screeching in their mics when they die, no, like the good graphics and FUTURISTIC VEHICLES! If that isn't enough, how about the ability to be a FREAKING DINOSAUR! Its everyones dream to either be a dinosaur or ride one, so why not both in this game? INFACT, there is an achivevment where you ride a dinos back (preferably T-REX)! If all this fun isn't enough, this game is $1. THATS RIGHT, $1 DOLLAR. And if you are the free-to-play sort of person, these developers actually give out copies of the game! These people care, and I don't think they get enough back, that's why I recommend this game to anyone who loves atleast one of these things on the list:DINOSAURS,HALO,BORDERLANDS, AND HINT OF CALL OF DUTY (minus the bad stuff, and no, its not everything). If you can get your friends to play this with you, maybe you'll finally be able to see how many dinos you can kill with an extra dino trying to eat you! Or just PVP with freaking light sabers, your choice. Final Verdict: 9/10 Would recommend!  (And a tip, maybe more servers that include rampage, rampage is fun.)
8083	1	a	This game is amazing and well thought out. It has not only superb graphics, but amazing music as well. The gameplay is easy to pick up on and its fun to play for hours and hours at a time, even on maps that are worlds to roam around in. Killing dinos is now one of my favorite things to do in video games, thanks to this.
8085	1	a	This game is fun... I was a bit skeptical at first due to the bad rating.. but some of the reviews convinced me to try it.. i have to say its enjoyable... fun for some killing sprees on dinosuars ... its a bit on the basic side, but the devlopers keep polishing it... its well worth its price... i must say i do love jet packing over a T-Rex's head then putting some slugs into it with my dubble pistoles as im dodging flying terrodactos,
8087	1	a	Cool because it has dinosaurs
8089	1	a	Its all about the dinosaurs fools!
3086	0	a	The game get's really boring with just PVE, it's all people play. The is no PVP community. 4/10 Community runied it.
8091	1	a	The lag sucked, and i can't play as Dinosaurs, But for the most part, COMPLETELY AWESOME AND I RECOMMEND IT!
3087	0	a	The games fun. When it works. Buggy as hell.
8093	1	a	Much Dinosaurs. T-Rex, Power Rangers.  Good Game, GG, No- RE, Cluth or Kick.
8095	1	a	Great game. I recommend a lot! At first its hard learning controls and how the game works. Once you figure that out it's a blast to play. 9/10
8097	1	a	Not a great game, but for the asking price, at least the graphics are worth it!
8099	1	a	great game
8101	1	a	not a bad game, honestly if i wasnt utterly flat broke and three months behind on my mortgage paymant id buy this thing in a second. its not spectacular, but for 99 cents its a heck of a deal. I mean, where else are you gonna get to battle dinosaurs online?
8103	1	a	very easy to setup and play ! 
8105	1	a	is rly good
8107	1	a	A lot of fun for 99 cents.
3089	0	a	Survival game versus dinosaurs? Nah,i dont really like this game Because the story and level gap is to determine the game ==
8109	1	a	This game simply blows away those other $10-$20 survival shooters.... I just cant believe this game is priced just 99cents. Killing a T-rex..What more do you simply want from a game? I am gonna be playing this for a long time.
8111	1	a	It's Good More Then CoD Ghosts And Cheapest ! Buy it Cool Graphicks and Cheap !!!
8113	1	a	This is the most fun you will ever have in a game for 99 cents. From the aerial attacks, to the breakdancing T-Rex ragdolls, this game is fantastic with friends.
8115	1	a	its on no bad 
8117	1	a	the best game
3091	0	a	prelude is a downgrade from dinohoard dont buy this game and it lags the mouse alot even with almost everything disabled or minimul
8119	1	a	I recommend, the game is very fun, if you noob play cod you must try this one lol :P
8121	1	a	20/10 this game is amazing i love it 
8123	1	a	Really great and fun game, tons of customization and frenzied action, as well as constant free DLC! Only downside is that you need a semi-strong PC to run it decently.
8125	1	a	Dinosaurs, that is all.
8127	1	a	Its not all that but its fun.
8129	1	a	Awsome game!
8131	1	a	yes this is a asome game 
8133	1	a	very good but he graphics are ok
8135	1	a	best dino killing game 10/10 would buy this for all of the people who dont have it jk
8137	1	a	Ever wanted to play a game where the support class doesn't work? Ever wanted to be utterly destroyed by tons of dinos? Ever wanted to buy useless upgrades that won't affect gameplay at all? Ever wanted to win a ps4? Ever been ready for freddy?  No. This game deserves to be worth 99 cents. pls fix it tho
8139	1	a	Was $15, but they renamed it and changed the proce to $1. ♥♥♥♥ed over whoever bought Dino Horde, but animations game still on point.
8141	1	a	Is it a great game? Nah. Do I feel like I spend most of the time backpedaling as fast as possible to keep shooting dinos in the head? Yeah. Is the weapon and perk buying between waves mechanic decent? Sure.  Am I debating just buying a handful of four packs and giving them out to my friends saying 'We need to get a group together to play this?' Ooh hell yeah.  There seems to be a lot of polish missing, but for 99¢ there isn't the 'I paid $30 for this garbage?' response. Sometimes I know I don't want to play a real complicated game, and I just want to dome some dinos. And given use of the Unreal Engine, and decent selection of weapons, I have to say I prefer this as my mindless dino shooter of choice; beating out Primal Carnage despite it being objectively better in most ways.  Give it a try. If you don't have a buck to spare, what are you doing looking at reviews on Steam anyway?
8143	1	a	This game is $0.99 and amazing, if you don't buy it you're actually ♥♥♥♥ed.  Seriously...  Buy it you ♥♥♥♥.
8145	1	a	I don't like it but with friends is funny. For less then 1 € it deserve a recommended :)
3093	0	a	This game is so terrible that it's hysterical, worth the pennies they're selling it for on sale just to laugh at it for an hour :D
8147	1	a	This game boasts many game mods and playing hours, it's fun for solo but great for multiplayer, SDK coming out soon is crazy and I can't wait to see what will cook up.  Thank you devs for your continuous efforts and good luck!
3094	0	a	its a bad game. i bought on sale 2 bucks and it still wasent worth it and even though its only a $1 now its still hard to justify. the gameplay is repititve and not very satisfying. i played maybe two hours before i got super bored and never touched again. graphics suck as well. the action is decent but it still gets old fast. 3/10
8149	1	a	Ok I clicked recommend but its right on the edge between good and bad. Yeah its only $0.99 but its only ok. The graphics are ok, the effects are kinda ok, and its only multiplayer(so it probely shouldve been free). But it has lost of fast pace action and can be fun. Its kinda worth the $0.99 but it wouldve been better free.
8151	1	a	Good game i like it.The game is costing only 79 cents but it would be like 10 euro
8153	1	a	For the price, the game offers many hours of enjoyment.
8155	1	a	This game is very addicting! Don't let the metacritic fool you. I've played my money's worth with this game a hundred times over.
8157	1	a	Great fun with friends for the low, low price of only €1
8159	1	a	Besides completing some objectives in-game with random people, operating some vehicles, and killing s***loads of dinosaurs, this game doesn't really have much to offer. The graphics are pretty good and this game truly impresses me, but it's just not my cup of tea. That being said, who doesn't like dinosaurs in video games?? If you like running around Halo Reach style and killing many tiny-to-massive dinosaurs with your teammates, then by all means this is your game.
8161	1	a	It's fun and easy to get the hang of. And even if you don't like it, it's a dollar.
8163	1	a	Killing floor with dinosaurs and tanks.
8165	1	a	When i first saw this game I thought 'This looks okay, lets check it out... 79p? Lets try it out, if it sucks then i lost 79p which isn't a great deal' but wow, this game is great! Much better than COD GHOSTS if I'm honest.
8167	1	a	shooting dinosaurs how can it not be good?
8169	1	a	pretty dope as hell. wtb more guns though and a better fov slider.
8171	1	a	I highly reccomend this game. The graphics are very good, the gameplay is very good, and the design is very nice. It's a lot more fun to play with friends than alone, but still fun regardless. And shoot, it's only 99 cents!
3098	0	a	it is a lot like a more kid friendly version of the game evolve
3099	0	a	Atleast uninstal works...
3100	0	a	Wouldn't play it if it was free. Nothing exciting, there's no challenge or skill. Either your class can beat your challenger(s) or not. It's actually pretty frusterating because so many mechanics, ballences, or hitboxes make no sense. Just run around and shoot. There are much more multiplayers for free. If you like the concept of dinos vs humans -&gt; Primal Carnage. Occasional server bugs, but worth paying for over this.
8173	1	a	Ok, so, my previous review was a thumbs down, HOWEVER they have updated it and lowered the price which in my opinion made it a lot more worth it. So, I dont reccomend this game if you are a lonely person with no friends because this game is SUPPOSED TO BE PLAYED WITH FRIENDS! I cant express that enough, this game honestly does not quite fill all the gaps that it had before it got updated a lot *aka glitches, bugs, etc* however its cheap and its a fun survival game to PLAY WITH FRIENDS.  Overall Scores: If you are playing it alone: 4/10 If you are playing it with friends: 7/10
8175	1	a	Hate dinosaurs? Shoot em in the face.  Unlike most games, this game needs a lot of attention. it would be WAY better if the community was bigger. One of my main problems with this games is that when i go to check out all the servers, theres hardly ANY open servers. 
8177	1	a	Oh my! I've played for only 20hrs and already I have had lots of fun. For 99c you get: Good graphics, a host of weapons, and lots of Dinos to wreck! Totally recommend this! 2 thumbs up!
3101	0	a	.99 cents and it still isn't worth the money.
8179	1	a	Very fun game for only a dollar. Just get it
3102	0	a	Lemmie just fix up the store description...  'ORION: Prelude' is an indie Sci-Fi shooter (FPS/TPS) that blunlty blends together half-♥♥♥♥♥ visuals and subpar combat. It puts you and your former friends together into boring, bland battles using some of the most generic weaponry and clunky vehicles in which you must work or compete against one another to accomplish mission objectives, explore modest-sized worlds and survive the devastating Dinosaur Horde.'   I know this game is a dollar but it wasn't originally and this game tried to put out major damage control to try to not look terrible.  'Don't believe the reviews' my ♥♥♥.
8181	1	a	It's .99 cents, if you still have an issue with buying it, you might be jewish.
8183	1	a	...

8185	1	a	I never played Orion: Dino Beatdown so I missed all the hate towards that first iteration. I first played over a free weekend in August of 2013 with Orion: Dino Horde. And now they have released Prelude.  Prelude seems to have added a lot of polish to the game which is nice and appreciated.  Is ORION: Prelude a great game? No. Is it a Bad game? No it is not bad either. What this game is, is pure unadulterated fun. If you like shooting dinosaurs with guns I highly recommend this game to you.  The only downside of this game is that if it isn't a free weekend, the servers can be sparsely populated. With the introduction of bots (that will fill one of the slots for squad members until a human drops in and takes their place (which is brilliant btw)) and lowering the price of the game, hopefully this will no longer be an issue.  So grab this game! It really is a lot of fun :D
8187	1	a	The animations make my sides hurt. Near-static dinosaurs are hurling toward you, and something about the human running animation is so awkward to look at. It's quite buggy, but it didn't really hurt my experience. I was battling against floating raptor heads, for instance. Quite hilarious. For $0.99, it's pretty good.
8189	1	a	I wish iI could use all the weapons that u buy
8191	1	a	Great COOP Game! Success in my LAN House! :D
8193	1	a	This is a very fun game. sometimes lags a bit even on my alien ware PC other than that a great game  - it should be more than 0.99cents  - i'll give it a 9 out of 10, fix the lag  - a few glitches
8195	1	a	can't go wrong for 99 cents. lots of fun to be had here 
3105	0	a	Absolute rubbish do not buy it
3106	0	a	i boht it and 1 week later it vanished from my library.but its a great game.
8197	1	a	Very fun game! Good weaponds, Great vehicles!  I give it a 8/10. Needs a little more polish for the ingame interface, but hey for .99 cents worth every penny! 
8199	1	a	The best game ever
3108	0	a	First game I join. Dinosaurs with pirate hats attack. I then uninstalled.
8201	1	a	very fun. i never played the original, so all i have to go on is what ive seen here. Picked it up on sale, well worth the $1 i paid for it. Cool weapons and augments.
8203	1	a	Killed a T-Rex almost cried. I love Dinosours. But it's a nice game and easy to learn.
3111	0	a	Its like you pay for ♥♥♥♥
8205	1	a	the servers are lagy
8207	1	a	It's actually pretty fun
8209	1	a	Dinosaurs and futuristic weapons.  The first time I played this game, my childhood  exploded  was rendered all over the screen. Many other reviews cover the finer details of the game, so instead of rehashing them, I say just go play it!! Plus it's really really cheap, so you don't have much to lose, yet everything to gain.
8211	1	a	it has Dinos lightsabers and jetpacks and it only 1$ buy it now
8213	1	a	1 dollar for loads of fun* Only if you play with friends, THIS GAME IS THE BEST.  Rating : 6+x of 10 x= amount of friends
8215	1	a	Game is pretty badass but very poorly optimized
8217	1	a	This game is great for co-op, it's like left 4 dead. Nothing much but it's fun if you're with your friends.
8219	1	a	Nice game!
3113	0	a	Great if you like Halo with dinosaurs and toilet skid-marks for graphics. -10/10
8221	1	a	One of the most fun games I've played for 0.99 cents ! Be a T-REX! and eat people! Or shoot em up as a person. Either way you're bound to have fun, best 0.99 cents I've ever spent.
8223	1	a	its great and for only .99 it is too good, if they added a story line it could be even better but still great. if you like halo and call of duty zombie's mashed to gether than download it now
8225	1	a	I knifed a t-rex.  11/10
8227	1	a	Great game. For a $1 ... its worth more
3118	0	a	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLJTAqnmHt0 
8229	1	a	best buck you will ever spend
8231	1	a	Hell of a bargain for less than a dollar. Little bit laggy and altogether not very visually impressive, but a good time killer with friends.
8233	1	a	Best .99 cent I've ever spent. Its stupid fun and nothing is broken.  I shot a Trex with a Flamethrower, it ate me while i was on fire, I went into second wind, it died from the flames. I won.
3120	0	a	there is nobody playing the game and i cant play@!!! 
8235	1	a	this game is the best. all i could ask for is bots in PVP maps
8237	1	a	its k for the price of snickers.
8239	1	a	For the money the game is well worth it. Its fun to play with Friends and make new friends 8/10
8241	1	a	Why isnt this 100% positive? WHAT THE HELL HAS THIS WORLD COME TOO?
8243	1	a	This game is just really fun. I love the concept of it and I love how you can upgrade to different weapons! It's a great game for such a price, a steal really. I recommend this game. It might get boring at times so I will give it a 8/10.
8245	1	a	I have no idea what's going on  But hey it's a dollar.
8247	1	a	so good you cant consider your self a gamer if you havent played it
8249	1	a	10/10 very good for a dollar, but not as good as Bad Rats
8251	1	a	Awesome and cheap game have alot of achieve ments :D
8253	1	a	Best $1 i ever spent. to run on my pc, i had to put most settings to low. Even then it still looks pretty good! best advice, turn settings to low, and keep depth of field. If you're into co-op, horde mode games, check this out. fun gameplay, good game to bs around in for a little while!
3122	0	a	complete utter ♥♥♥♥ do not download, hopefully as people give it ♥♥♥♥ reviews they wont change the name again. Rest In Pestrami
8255	1	a	Killed a T-Rex with a shiny purple bow . 11/10
8257	1	a	Join Shoot Upgrade Die Game Crash Repeat
8259	1	a	At this point dont bother trying to differentiate the Orion games. If it goes on sale, pick it up and play it until you're bored. It's like a $1-5 gumball.  With dinosaurs.
8261	1	a	I like killing dinos not to mention shooting things
8263	1	a	Quoth the Mackelmore;  'But ♥♥♥♥, It was 99 Cents!'
8265	1	a	this game is awesome
8267	1	a	At less than a dollar, you cant afford to not own ORION: Prelude. Not in this economy.
8269	1	a	gameplay nice, play fast
3125	0	a	All the demos are at like, 1/4th the speed of the actual game. The game itself is so incredibly fast that unless you know precisely how it works from the get-go, you're going to be spending a long time just figuring it out.
3126	0	a	It crashed after 9 minutes.
8271	1	a	the most fun i have had for 99cent. Game is great fun to play with friends :)
3127	0	a	Its very laggy i would rate this game a 6/10 the graphics aren't that good and its should be free for the games performance. Tell me what you think in the description.
8273	1	a	This game is awesome. I think every one should play this game.
3128	0	a	Why da F*CK did i buy this game for 0.99,- ? i dont know. 
8275	1	a	I don't play this game. Why do i have this? I looks okay... i think           Nah not really
8277	1	a	This game is a riot for a goodly amount of time, but after a while it gets a little plain. One of those titles you lose interest in and then come back to. But s*** it was 99 cents.
8279	1	a	for 99 cents (thats some top dollar pricing ya hear me homie).
3129	0	a	the trailer makes it look gret but the graphics glitches and driving are terrible and theres not even single player missions or bot matches, i could get better free to play games. Im so disappointed i wasted my money.  3/10
8281	1	a	very interesting fps game, recommended to play, i like when hitting a t-rex with my gun, so say hello to my little friend :3 #bang #bang
8283	1	a	real men dont use guns, they use swords, 10/10 for manliness score, now go solo a t-rex with a sword
8285	1	a	fun shooter game reminds me of halo shooting stiles 
8287	1	a	this is a fun game if your really bored and have nothing to do...
8289	1	a	This game is very fun and i bought it for only 0.79€!
8291	1	a	Buy this game for all your friends when its on sale and force them to play with you. Then you gotta find some more friends.
8293	1	a	The game is about dinoasourse and shooting a t-rex can throw a rock at people i mean honestly what do you people want.
8295	1	a	My system is moderatley-okay, and can run most games on mid-high mixed settings, but this unoptomized lemon gave me 3fps and made me re-think my life choices.  3/10 would not buy
8297	1	a	Don't let the price tag fool you, this game is absolute gold. There are hours of fun to be had with a friendly community or solo. You can make this game extremely easy to kill everything or so hard you won't surpass wave 1. You will not regret buying this game, especially at this not-even-on-sale-price. The only thing this game is missing im my opinion (or, rather, what this game needs more of) are guns and abilities. Namely, class-specific abilities. It is a great game overall and is not an incomplete game, it just needs a few more abilities/guns/dinos/maps to play on/with.
8299	1	a	Borderlands 2 + Left 4 Dead 2 + Halo + Jurassic World + Evolve = ORION : Prelude   9.5/10  Graphic good, environment good, gameplay good, but movement too stiff  I would like to recommend this game
8301	1	a	Very good for a $1 game, if your in to games with dinosaurs and your low on budget this is the perfect game for you.
8303	1	a	Tell me why this game is so cheap?
8305	1	a	1: Watch this  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShQ3GBFI4KQ  (Official video) 2: Buy this game. 3: Profit.
8307	1	a	I am not going to go into depth on this game, but I will say this. The Developer has really done this game justice, constantly updating it, making it playable, and making it enjoyable. For $0.99, this is a steal. If you can find friends to play this game with, it's amazing.  VERDICT: Halo + Killing Floor + Dinosaurs = ORION: Prelude
8309	1	a	10/10  Would play halo with dinosaurs again.    -NGI   wait you mean this isnt halo?
8311	1	a	Choose Recon Buy x2 energy and ninja upgrade KILL ALL SONS OF BI***** with knife = BADASS 11/10 would kill T-rex with only knife again (■_■) 
8313	1	a	ORION: Prelude is fun in some aspects. But, in others its pretty bad. I like it though.
8315	1	a	Very Good Game
8317	1	a	ORION: Prelude might possibly be................ the best game in our solar system. It's advanced understanding of the way human and dinosaur love would really be in the year 1916 is amazing. I had ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic reactions upon opening ORION: Prelude. Dinosaur is another word for gaming experience with a new, captivating, yet sentimental brutality. ORION: Prelude is the type of friend that you could just make love to 3 times before getting bored. i r8 9/8 gr8 game
8319	1	a	i played this game when it was ♥♥♥♥ and loved it with my friend now i cant play it because of a ♥♥♥♥ pc and want to so bad 100/10 omg yes all the time
3137	0	a	I'm glad the 'Quit game' button works.  This game is the most poorly optimised game I have ever launched, you know it's bad when you have to set the graphical settings to minimal with a 4GB graphic card. Please save yourselves by NOT purchasing this. I'm glad my friend bought a pack for us, so I can write a review. Please, do not buy this game. Developers need to optimise this game and fix several bugs to make it worthwhile...
8321	1	a	CoD and Jurassic Park got married and had a child but then CoD divorced Jurassic Park and Star Wars become the stepfather.    0248329 WI5THNAJDBSFBESBEELZEBUB/10 IGN would get molested by a Trex again.
8323	1	a	It's an alright game.
8325	1	a	Did you ever wake up one day and felt the need to drive a jeep into a T-Rex' face? Now you can  Ever wondered what it felt like to ♥♥♥♥♥slap a raptor with the butt of your rifle? Now you can  Ever seen a stegosaurus do the moonwalk on the side of a cliff? Now you can  Do you have the uncontrolable urge to jump on the back of a triceratops and stab it with a knife repeatidly? Now you can.  Ever wanted to play Halo, Borderlands, Turok, Time Splitters, Planetside, Jurrasic Park all at once? Now you can.  This game is absolute mayhem. It doen't win any prizes for its quality but it does what it's supposed to do: deliver hours of hilarity and action. I binned Mass Effect. I binned The Witcher 2. I tossed aside Deux Ex 3.  But this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ shooting gallery? it will make me come back for more. If anything, this game is a guilty pleasure.  Ever wanted to pwn dinos while laughing your ♥♥♥ off for a whopping $0,99 and give money grabbing corporations like EA the finger in the process?  Now you can.  DO IT.
8327	1	a	Quality time unleashing my inner wrath with my friends. Please add widescreen 2560x1080 support.
3138	0	a	Think of owning this game like adopting a troubled child. Sure it'll grow, and sure chances are it'll get better year after year, but at some point when it's revealed that the child is actually a derranged serial killer, you'll wonder if it was born that way or if there was anything you could've done to avoid to. The answer is no.
8329	1	a	Saw this game durring a Sale, was .49 Cents, Thought, 'Hey I got nothing else to spend it on, might just be a boring game'. Boy Was I wrong, Game is very fun and only being a Dollar it's easy to get, Short time Ive played it enjoyed it
8331	1	a	It's a great dinosaur FPS game! The sensitivity of your head movement needs some work, but other than that, great game!
8333	1	a	I fought someone wid yellow light sabers den he told me he is my father  i crieded ;*(  10/10 would cri agen
8335	1	a	What A turn around.
8337	1	a	This is nowhere close to completition, it lacks graphics, combat etc,etc... But if you have friends to play with you, you can play for a few hours and it's cheap!
8339	1	a	Poorly optimized.  EDIT: The devs really turned the game around.
8341	1	a	Great game fast pased shoot em up. would like to see a ambient sound bar and a seperate gun sound bar. graphics are beautiful and the action is real gameplay on youtube. well done really happy with this :)  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIFzwvmFrUtWUVJh19TXkuw/feed 
3139	0	a	Look, just because a game is inexpensive doesn't mean it is worth your time. I thought with positive reviews and the inexpensive price, running and gunning for dinos sounded like an okay time. And it was, for the first hour... maybe two. It isn't even that it is a bad game, it really just isn't a good one, at least not without other players. Maybe they're all on privte servers or something, but pulic ones seem to be pretty sparse and while Bots can fill in, they are incredible stupid and apparently can do nothing other than prance about shooting dinos. Sounds like the point of it, right? Well, they don't provide cover fire if you need to rescue your generator and don't ever seem to work on objectives other than killing dinos. In a word, useless.   I'm not going to complain about graphics because they aren't that bad, though maybe it was my video card or something but I had some wonky glitches from time to time. Game modes are shoot dinos, shoot more dinos, shoot dinos and each other, shoot more dinos, and did I mention shooting dinos? The variations on the theme are not overly interesting. You guard a generator vs waves of dinos. You guard it against waves of dinos and an enemy team while trying to take out theirs. You capture objectives while taking out waves of dinos. I reallky wasn't exaggerating when I said 'shoot more dinos'.  Are there cool things you can do? Certainly. Is it awful? No. Am I recommending it? No way. I just think there are other things that could, would and should be more fun. If you really want something inexpensive and midly amusing to play for a few hours until something else you're aching to play comes along -- Orion may be the game for you. Otherwise, play some backlog, spend that buck on cards and make badges, or find something else and spare yourself a bit of grief.  As with all reviews -- this is merely my opinion and your mileage may vary.
8343	1	a	IT GOOD GAME
8345	1	a	Why is there not a pro scene for this game?!
8347	1	a	Really awful game in a lot of ways, but I deeply enjoyed it while playing with friends. You get pitted against dinosaurs. The devs say it used to be worse. I can believe it. My favorite thing has got to be zooming away on a vehicle and sniping scary dinosaurs from a distance.
8349	1	a	It's horrifically awesome
8351	1	a	Fights dino with ''lightsaber'' always die 10/10
8353	1	a	Really laggy for me.
8355	1	a	This is awesome, have fun with friends.
8357	1	a	This is a perfect example of a bad game turned good. Shoot dinos in the face and get interesting upgrades. Graphics are meh, dinos glitch out (in funny ways lel) and the sound design is wonky, but it's a buck. What more could you ask for a buck?  Honestly though, if this game were free, no one would play it.
8359	1	a	11/10 would play the worst game ever again :D
8361	1	a	Fun game.If only it wasn't for the lag(but that's probably because of distance, not the game). I can't really complain about anything. Got it in a 4 pack for myself and a few friends, glad I did.
8363	1	a	The best worst game ever Play with friends
8365	1	a	A nice combination of dinosaurs and fps
8367	1	a	One of the greatest stories in gaming ever. Absolute disaster turned into a hilarious and fun game with a simple and near perfect premise 'Dinosaurs attack and you have jet packs, rocket launchers, and 4 buddies.'
8369	1	a	its .99 cent. its multiplayer. theres guns. theres dinosaurs  
8371	1	a	I killed a T-Rex with a butter knife and then died to a chihuahua sized raptor. 10/10
8373	1	a	Orion Prelude... What can I say... Fun multiplayer/ Co-Op dinosaur killing mayhem, all for the low price of .99 USD or 3.99 USD for a four pack. Can't go wrong. :)
8375	1	a	great game
8377	1	a	it's great but i didn't get time to play it much. 
8379	1	a	this game is awsome the gameplay is great the game everything about it its awsome keep on what your doing guys keep it up
8381	1	a	This is so addicting especially if you have friends and the Graphics are bearable. Again the gameplay of shooting dinosaurs and the guns are awesome!  Positives: EXTREMELY CHEAP!!!! $1.19NZD and $0.75USD Nice graphics(Unreal Engine 3, I think) Fun gameplay Great gun selection Easy and quick movement 3 balanced classes(Assault-JetPack, Medic-Medigun, Recon-Cloak Device) Good and easy server selection AI is good and bearable(ACTUALLY)  Negatives: Huge terrains/maps; so big and takes a while to get across but creative Some glitchy AI spawns Some server lag but once in your good  Overall: 9/10 due to some bugs
8383	1	a	dayum dis focking cheap 79p BRAHHH
8385	1	a	This game is amazing. Picked it up for about 10 cents.... Best 10 cents I have ever spent. Even if you only get a couple hours of fun out of it here and there, it is still well worth the money.   In this game you fight dinosaurs and defend your power generator with guns and vehicles (mechs, helicopters, cars, tanks, etc.). You can also get perks that increase your survivability. That pretty much sums it up.  The graphics are nice, gameplay is fun and simple, and the multiplayer is great and active.  My rating: 7.5/10
8387	1	a	You can use the FORCE! :D
3143	0	a	Bored. If I could give it away I would.
8389	1	a	bought all of the Augments, Turned from a HALO Spartan IV into a Spartan I
8391	1	a	Hmm, let's see.  Guns checked Violence checked Dinosaurs checked  They have utilised elements from Halo, Star Wars, Turok, Quake and Crysis. Now if they can utilise the Alien franchise, this will be my number one FPS!
8393	1	a	The game is absolutely crazy I really like the game, and it really likes me I was playing it, while drinking my cuppa tea the weapons in this are like fish, in the sea so buy this game it only costs a small fee i've added so many dinosaurs to my family tree we're really close but they eat endlessly  done with the tea, now i'm going for a pee!
8395	1	a	So, Are you guys smoking something? This is worth more than a dollar.
8397	1	a	This is so much better then the original game! so fun and time consuming I would love for anyone to play the game, although hard at first and laggy i still love it.
8399	1	a	Very nice.. need some graphic improvement :O
3144	0	a	This may be one of the worst games I've ever played. I made it through one match before the mad animations, terrible graphics, and the lack of sounds for certain weapons got to me.
8401	1	a	very good game 5of5 stars:)
8403	1	a	when i got this game it looked great now it looks ... i do ... because there are no words to describe this game definitly get it 0.99 is totally worth it
8405	1	a	Legit THE BEST 74 cents I have spent on steam. This game should be worth 10 dollars. It's so awesome. I just played 3 hours straight, It's awesome. 10/10 Great Dev's
3146	0	a	Its not good, like at all. Everybody is praising it because it used to suck but it still sucks. It is very, very far from being a good game. The fact that it used to be worse than this scares me and makes me wonder how it got on the steam store at all. 2/10 - Shameful.
8407	1	a	DO IT!
8409	1	a	Seriously? $1.00? Can't go wrong with this one!
8411	1	a	This is a really awesome game that suits everyone! 
8413	1	a	I actually liked it and for the price of 1/5 kebab, why not?
8415	1	a	I would love to see better graphics and to fix some more bugs. Otherwise it is really fun :)
8417	1	a	My first time seeing this game I didn't watch any gameplay something in me knew it would be an amazing game. The metta Score of 36/100 is misleading it deserves a 90/100. This provides an amazing co-op gameplay you can play hours without getting bored! I would sugest buying the 4-pack and grabing your freinds to play this epic game! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Update 5/5/2015  Since my original review I have to change my rating of this game. Since I first bought the 4-pack back when Orion Dino Horde first realeased up till now I have bought atleast 5 more copies of this game after buying the 4 pack for friends! Instead of the developers abandoning this game when it had horrible reviews they never gave up! They continuously updated the game over and over again making it better and better each time. Untill eventually it became Orion-Prelude the Dino game we all know and love today. Keep up the work with this amazing game! I must change my review from a 90/100 to 100/100!
8419	1	a	It's a no brainer. I felt like playing a new shooter, I bought this for a dollar, it was fun for a few hours. Even if I never play it again, it's a dollar well spent.  Seriously, just get it. If you looked at it and were mildly interested, just get it.
8421	1	a	Bought bow and arrow on noob mode. Shot down a pterodactyl cause he was in my face. resisted urge to yell 'YOU HAVE FAILED THIS PLANET'  would play Arrow with dinosaurs again.  10/10
8423	1	a	nothing to say but i like this game soo thumbs up
8425	1	a	Fun FPS sci fi game killing dinosaurs over and over with sweet gamemodes best game ever!
8427	1	a	Hilarious times. I had a tank and shot a Triceratops about 300 feet up into the air.   Gameplay: You choose 1 of 3 classes, each of which as its own unique ability. You then fight waves of dinosaurs by capturing objectives or by defending your base. In between waves you can upgrade your weapons/abilities. There are also hilariously hard to control vehicles. You will crash into a wall a lot.  Also no friendly fire, thank goodness.  No bugs that I can think of. Smooth gameplay on the unity 5 engine.
8429	1	a	So much fun, I foresee hundreds of great hours ahead of me
8431	1	a	Wow 3 years of work, you know I was going to toss ♥♥♥♥ about it but instead I am going to said GG Gid Gud  I honestly enjoyed the game, and sides it's not that expensive in contrast to every single popular shooter that is out right now, thank you giving me something to do in my free time, if there is one thing I apreciate more than anything in games is being able to blast stuff with grade launchers
8433	1	a	Like Killing Floor, but with dinosaurs and vehicles. You literally can't go wrong, especially for the price point.
8435	1	a	Simply an amazing and addicting game. I spent 60$ on GTAV a couple weeks ago, but when i saw this was free i gave it a chance and holy crap. I have been playing this more than most of the games i payed 20$+ for! It makes me think of a mix of Tribes: Ascend, Jurrasic Park, Killing Floor, and Halo. I love it.  First game i played as a level 1 i killed a trex with an automatic pistol to the face. 10/10
8437	1	a	Complete MADNESS. Instant ACTION. Fixin GENERATOR,for some REASON. No really,why im fixin it?
3149	0	a	PROS:  It's fun It's only a dollar  CONS:  It's laggy on my nvidia geforce gtx 980 It's repetitive It's unbalanced It's buggy  With the double damage upgrade and the longshot sniper you do so much damage it's ridiculous. Not only that but you can only suceed as an assault class for the jetpack. The clipping for anything but a flat surface is dreadul and you'll find yourself getting stuck often. When you fall into the void you don't die, you only continue to fall into the void which will force you to disconnect from the server.  It'll give you maybe 4 or 5 hours of gameplay before you get bored, more if you play with friends.
8439	1	a	I ♥♥♥♥ my pants by the loud intro volume  11/10
8441	1	a	its a dollar well spent
8443	1	a	Can't beat the price for a fun play with the dino's!
8445	1	a	Was free for weekend, saw it was 0.74$, bought it just for lols, and wow, this is so fun to play if you want some satisfaction out of killing dinos and getting 'ARMAGEDDON' voice queues. ♥♥♥♥in sweet.
3152	0	a	I purchased this game when it was released, I don't remember what it costed me then, and quite frankly I don't want to know. The fact that I paid money for this game haunts me every time I see it on the store page, at least the rocks have textures now. 
8447	1	a	Has evolve's monsters and halo's guns and AC:Unity's glitches MOST ORIGINAL GAME  10/10
8449	1	a	Its fun but it need optimization
8451	1	a	This is a very fun game at a insanely good price. Well worth checking out.
8453	1	a	A really good fun quick pace FPS. Though some of the controls are different than most FPSs they are still easy and fun to use.  The only disadvantage is that it stuggles with connecting and it can randomly lose you from the host it seems, other than that great game.
8455	1	a	WAY too much fun to pass up. The combinations that would describe this game are all fabulous apart, but even better when put together like this. Amazing. Just AMAZING. Entertainment for days at such a nice price.
8457	1	a	Today I ran over a pack of raptors with a jeep and rammed it into a t-rex before being tossed out of bounds and then proceeded to slowly crawl back to the map while shooting said t-rex with a revolver. 10/10 would ram again.
3153	0	a	This game is a very poor, POOR game. It runs like ♥♥♥♥ on my PC which was 600 euros a year ago which handles BF3 on high at 60 but nevertheless, I can't understand why this game makes my GPU cry in horror, the textures are beyond ♥♥♥♥. This game looks like an early PS2 game. It looks like GTA Vice City in terms of texture work, and to be honest Vice City is kind of beating Orion: Dino Horde or 'Orion:Prelude' to make people think its not the same ♥♥♥♥.  The game is utterly boring. Wave after wave after wafe after wave of uninspiring enemies that look like they came from a Jurrasic Park movie...that was made in 1950. Its only wave of murdering t-rex after t-rex. The guns are all about the same, I only used the Dual pistols to feel like Max Payne, which didn't really work. There is absolutely nothing good about this game, NOT EVEN THE NET CODE. Me and my friend were trying to play together, we are both in Dublin and I was getting a ping of about 200.  0/10 DO NOT BUY.
8459	1	a	Killing dinosaurs with a lightsaber using a jetpack = priceless. This game = 1€. Your profit= infinity - 1€ = infinity.  And on the plus side there is no voice chat so there are no crazy russian kids.
3154	0	a	The game is basically Halo and Jurrasic Park. It's a good game but it's really laggy.
8461	1	a	ok game. no 60fps. Yet maybe worth the money in this case. $.74 cents.
8463	1	a	I dislike playing it but would be more entertaining with friends. Not my type of game but worth it to just buy it and support the devs for all the criticism they have gotten and the successful project they have created.
8465	1	a	killed off chicken ancestors  11/10 would dino again
8467	1	a	You Can Shoot Dino Birds Out Of The Sky With Mini-Guns 10/10 Stars!!!
8469	1	a	So when I found this game I decided to buy it because it was 1 dollar and it looked terrible and when i played it i may have bought 4 other copies for my friends because ITS SOOOO AWESOME! there was one glitch that was the best glitch ever TWERKING STEGOSAURUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
8471	1	a	God dangit people!!!!! What are you waiting for??? It's 1 freaking buck. But it already!!! There's dinosaurs, multiplayer, good graphics, single player with bots. It's GREAT... Buy it! Buy it! Buy it! The game has seriously evolved over time and now is great time to buy, especially with the updated maps!
8473	1	a	I loved the demo for Jurassic: The Hunted but was sad when I couldn't find the game. Then I got this cause it was on sale for 81 cents! And let me say I am so happy I got it! A total blast, four player dinosaur killing craziness. Worth it even at full price!
8475	1	a	Its ok I guess 
8477	1	a	Very fun dino multiplayer shoot them up game.
3155	0	a	Game plays like a 90s multiplayer Turok + Left 4 Dead with jetpacks and medics. It's clunky, amateur, and very poor overall. There is an element of genius and fun in this game, but that potential is never reached due to the shoddy dev work. This game is one that should've been left in the bin. Some things are better not revisiting.  2.0/10 Terrible. Plays like a HS project, worse than most subpar mods.  Reviewer has played ORION: Prelude as his first outing in this series.
3156	0	a	Silly, not my choice
3157	0	a	This game is garbage, absolute and complete garbage. The matchmaking is crap, it cannot be played in full screen without crashing. Please do not waste your money on it. Here are 4 free game keys if you feel you want to try it, someone may get to it before you, but hey, possible free garbage game. The devs are not ♥♥♥♥♥, they gave me the free keys to give to my friends since the game is crap, but I do not hate my friends, so I am not going to give them crap. The devs say that they have fixed issues, they have not. They seem like decent, but completely incompetant people.  7MJ2P-EH42R-FZRW8 38Y8L-74QFY-A352D MFHAH-F0CN7-4N8XP 8BXK7-0VV7F-GQBX9
8479	1	a	Hey, for $1 its a few hours of fun. c'mon a buck.
3158	0	a	PLAYED IT GOT SOME CARDS NOW SELLING THEM BECUASE NO ONE PLAYS THIS GAME SO THEY ARE WORTH SOMETHING AND IT IS ♥♥♥♥ 
8481	1	a	This Game is Great I would sponsor this game on Youtube if i could.
8483	1	a	Its a quality game, and at this price point, its almost dumb to not buy it. The gameplay is pretty solid, bug free, and fun with some mates
8485	1	a	Fun gameplay! It's really for those who enjoy a quick game with some challenge.
8487	1	a	Great fun, didnt know what to expect and was pleasently surprised!
3161	0	a	If I diden't know any better I would say it's still in alpha. It looks like crap,sounds like crap,and runs like crap. Sry just calling it as I see it
8489	1	a	A T-rex threw my tank in mid-air.  10/10
8491	1	a	Fight waves of dinosaurs with your friends, what more do you want from a game this cheap?  Also, props to the developers who stuck with the game for years and made it better instead of giving up
8493	1	a	this game is incredibly fun. for only 1 dollar i get to 360 noscope dinosaurs. I CANNOT STOP PLAYING! BUY THIS GAME NOW!
8495	1	a	It's ok Definitely worth playing with a couple of friends, can get pretty fun.
8497	1	a	59p are you kidding me??? This game is worth £9.99! Killed a dino with the help of my younger cousin!   10/10 would murder extinct species again with a family member
8499	1	a	look its simple guys: 1) Mother ♥♥♥♥ing dinos 2) Guns and weapons 3) Cool arenas 4) Mother ♥♥♥♥ing dinos  What more do you want?
8501	1	a	Really fun with friends, lots of weapon choice and cool mix of upgrades in a shooter. Fun dino shooter. Definitely worth the money. 8/10
8503	1	a	Well I can use my lightsaber to fight the Dino horde 10/10!
8505	1	a	Cheap and fun.
8507	1	a	Worth playing for just a buck especially with friends
3164	0	a	most garbage outdated game
3165	0	a	1/10  this game may be cheap and it may have come a long way from where it started but still it has a long way to go. the game is unstable, buggy and the graphics quality on the highest settings is nowhere near what you see in the screenshots on the storepage. the character models and animations are just auful and the interface is strangly aranged.   now let's talk about the gameplay...   the consept of this game is good but they should have thought it out more. the game play get's very repetative very quickly.  the whole game is just:  spawn -&gt; activate generator -&gt; shoot dino's -&gt; shoot more dino's -&gt; buy new gun -&gt; shoot big dino -&gt; shoot more and more dino's until you die. then repeat on a (hardly)different map.  untill you get so borred that after a while you find the greatest feature in this entire game: The uninstall button.  so in concusion:  should this game be free?  yes  should this game be version 3.0?  definitly not, it is barely the level of a alpha prereleace.  if the developers update the game would you play it?  no, they have been at this for 3 years and it is still not better that a school project. it is unlikely that they will start to take this project seriously now.  is this review to harsh?  maybee, this is just how i experienced this game. maybee you will love it. but i don't, i took my time writing this so people think twice before buying this game. i know it is only 1$ but that single dollar could help little children in akrika get a proper education.. just think about that for a second before buying this so called 'game'.
3166	0	a	i got thet game free  :P 
8509	1	a	superb game if played online..
8511	1	a	cheap and fun.
8513	1	a	'Your connection to the host has been lost' 2.420 / 69
8515	1	a	This game so cool and funny LOL!!
3167	0	a	THIS IS THE WORST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED! DO NOT INTALL THIS UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES! IT IS A WASTE OF DATA! 
8517	1	a	this game is awsome if u like dinosaures and cool guns with friends to play with get this game
3168	0	a	An improvement atleast
8519	1	a	Shoot dinosaurs with guns. Stab dinosaurs with knives. Blow up dinosaurs with gernades.
8521	1	a	its $0.99 just buy it already
8523	1	a	It's worth your money.  720 no-scoped a dino with a bow and arrow, then used my lightsaber to kill fools. 10/10
8525	1	a	Watching this game continue to improve has been awesome, and they are right. Only developers can fail. These developers have not. If only more developers stuck to it the way these ones have, some wonderful concepts in otherwise terrible games would not go to waste. If I hadn't already bought the game for all my friends, I would now.
8527	1	a	i shot down a T-rex with a rocket launcher while jetpacking 8/8 would m8
8529	1	a	I bought this game through the steam store when it was on sale for .74 Cents !! i figured what the hey 74 cents. this is a pretty good co-op shooter ! no its amazing! good for team play and just all out Blast Fest super fun game ! Its Sort of a Unreal Tournament / Turok combonation everyone should try it !
8531	1	a	You know, I never played it when it was supposedly trash. But now that it's been updated, and the free week has been a thing, I gave it a shot.  Well, that shot became a good 81 cents Canadian spent.  It's not fantastic, but it's definitely not bad. It has a store, but it's cosmetic items. Armor color, hats, capes, that kind of stuff. And... It's $1. There's no reason NOT to get this.
8533	1	a	Really good game for killing dinos
8535	1	a	Co-op dino fighting! Radness.
8537	1	a	I wish i could play the game, But my laptop is crap so it runs at 10 fps rip :( Anyway one nof the greatest games ive demoed
8539	1	a	The ten minutes I played was completely worth the Dollar. Seriouslly, it's a dollar, It has dinos, you have tons of game modes.  Did I mention its a dollar Like 1 dollar I had fun
8541	1	a	Great game, probably the most enjoyable game I have played this decade.
8543	1	a	Just look at the price.
3170	0	a	This terrible game popped up in my library one day. I think a friend gifted it to me.  1. Play for trading cards 2. Sell trading cards 3. Uninstall 
8545	1	a	Very nice game. In my opinion this is worth way more than a dollar. Love it. Never heard of it before and then I saw the trailer that explained how this game came out in 2012 and how it sucked and they kept working on it for 3 years. I have no idea how it was before. But right now, if you have a dollar I think you should buy this game, even if you're not going to play it the guys who worked on it deserve something.
8547	1	a	Daaad there's a dinosawr in the backyaaawd.  *SLAM*  I'm tired of your sh*t Benji, you little b*stard.
3171	0	a	The game, though enjoyable, has its flaws. For one, it can't run AT ALL on any computer that isn't high-end. Therefore, I am unable to write a suitable review for it. If you have a high-end computer, good for you. If not (I'm assuming most of you don't...) don't waste your money. Orion: Prelude gets a 4/10.
8549	1	a	I'm killing about 100 pera however you spell it with a starting round gun. This game is tops.
8551	1	a	Best game ever made for a very cheap price!
8553	1	a	Great game 10/10 you can fight Dino's drive vehicles get weapons perks and play with your friends what's not to like.
8555	1	a	Very interesting, graphics are great. Lots of content. 8/10
8557	1	a	Never reviewed a game before this, all i have to say is this game takes me back to when games were fun for the sake of it instead of being over complicated. I paid £1.49 for a 4 pack and gave it to some friends. its truly superb just endless fun shooting dinosaurs. Plus i killed a T-rex in slow mo with a gatiling gun, enough said. 10/10
8559	1	a	THIS IS AWESUM!
8561	1	a	ORION: Prelude is a fun dionsaur survival FPS game. I bought this on sale for $0.74, but I would buy it for the full $0.99 if I had to. This game is perfect for those who enjoy shooting dinosaurs. My favorite feature of ORION: Prelude is... THE MOTHER FREAKIN LIGHTSABER! Yeah you can buy a lightsaber in survival mode. Did I mention there is multiple modes like conquest and duel? I did now...
8563	1	a	This game is great! I bought it for 74 cents and I've been playing this game a lot (when I should be playing GTA:V which I bought for $59.59). It's nice to see developers that tried really hard to fix a broken game, and honestly this game is great. It kind of reminds me of Halo, except compared to the new Halos this is better (and much cheaper). And I've only been doing solo mode. 10/10 not IGN
8565	1	a	Over 9000% I Recommend this game!  - More Dinosaurs - Jetpack so i can kill those dinosaurs with sniper - camper - hh
8567	1	a	I AM TUROK!!!
8569	1	a	10/10 BEST GAEM. It's like TF2, CS:GO, Halo, KF, and L4D had a GLORIOUS BABY.  For $1, you MUST buy this game! It is TOTALLY WORTH IT!
8571	1	a	Look, the game is cool and all and it would be worth a TON more than $1.00 ( $0.74 on sale ), but one thing..... YOU CAN PLAY IT!!!! I TRIED TO PLAY IT AND IT WAS SO LAGGY EVEN AFTER I PUT EVERYTHING TO LOWEST POSSIBLE EVEN THE SOUND, STILL IT WAS WAAAAYY TO LAGGY FOR ME TO EVEN MOVE MY MOUSE IN THE MENU!   Cool game, needs some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ computer suport ~ lewpro
3173	0	a	I remember playing this a long time ago and thinking it sucked. It has potential, but it sucked. Now for 74 cents, it still sucks. The game feels too 'cardboard'. Guns lack oomph or any muzzle flash. Id prefer it if the dinos didnt actually walk, just glide around at least that would make it funny.
8573	1	a	This is the best game that im played in years. Also very addicting. If you dont have this game get it right now.
8575	1	a	EPIC!  I have numerous top titles and I do my best to try to make time to have a blast playing this game.   For $1!?!? C'mon!!???  9/11
8577	1	a	This game is super cool :D
8579	1	a	This game was the most fun I've had gaming with my friends in a long time! Hours of ridiculous dino hunting will be had in the future.
3176	0	a	I bought it because it was onsale and they said they transformed the game into something amazing, they were wrong.  -half the time the gun animation doesn't even play  -the dinos still spin around and dont have very good ai  -the character holds the pistol like a assault rifle.
8581	1	a	this game is good just needs to lag a little less
8583	1	a	ThI$ Gaem Is sO GoOd 11/10
8585	1	a	Quite a nice game, still some bugs, but all in all a good start for a dine FPS shooter :D
3177	0	a	the game lags like hell and i cant even play it the game iss to laggie and no one cant play it cuzz one small dino kills you
8587	1	a	This game is really entertaining and simple to play You kill dinosaurs and hoard weapons and vehicles As for the story... there is no story. Great for playing with a couple of friends just for fun. Play by yourself if you have no friends, but game is still fun. I mean c'mon it's less than $1! Blew my expectations when I tried
8589	1	a	skeptical of such a cheap game, I went in expecting to find a dissappointment....  I was wrong.  With reminders of Early Unreal tournament and an enjoyable pacing Orion: Prelude is well worth the money. Spend the dollar, it's worth it.
8591	1	a	HELL OF A TIME I JUST HAD 
8593	1	a	THIS. GAME. IS. AMAZING. Its only what 99 cents? BUY THIS NOW!!!!!1!!!1!
8595	1	a	fun to play because DINOSAURS
8597	1	a	Post Edit: The below review was for when the game was fairly new, the developers have taken responsibility for their games shortcomings, for one dollar a pop you could easily set you and your friends up with copies of the game and have a killingfloor-esque bundle of funs. Everything in the pre-edit still applies however --------------------------- Pre Edit This game has a fair way to go. It doesn't perform well on my computer (fairly high end), and it is very difficult to find a match. I got it for 1 dollar and it for me that was worth it, but i'm not sure it's worth the $15 price tag. The game does have positive and negative points to it.  Pro: The support service is excellent, they were polite, helpful, and got my problem resolved quickly  Pro: When you get into a game with lots of dudes, you have some dino killing mayhem to look forward to.  Con: They have a coin system for cosmetics  Con: I couldn't get it to work when I first started and had to contact Spiral's customer support  I may edit it if I play it more, but this was my initial experience. I have high hopes for this game, but at the state it currently is in, I'd hold onto your $15 and wait for a sale to get it.
8599	1	a	Jurassic Park: The Game...  But it's actually good. Seriously, buy this. It is a steal for the price.
8601	1	a	Once upon a time on May 4th 2015, the internet was slow. I knew it couldn't be the provide because I don't have comcast. What do you know, it was steam. I scroll down the big list of games, some great and some well, not so great. I stumble upon this game, Orion: Prelude. Oh yeah I said to myself, wasn't this a dollar, but with all steam games you never play them. This update must be good I say to myself, at 1.4GB it better be. Once done updating I open the for the fisrt time in months. Saw that it was the same gui, but I gave it a chance. Why not, I mean it's not like I have any homework that I left at school. I finally join a game... SAME GAME DIFFERENT MAPS, well not that I knew of, neverd played all the maps, aight 1.4GB update doesnt feel like it. Same weird chat system, confusing upgrade system. Thus I close my eyes and begin to shoot. Killed everything in my path. Won the game. Alt+F4 DONE  In all honesty I thought the update was going to be a graphical upgrade, but I'm sure it added a ♥♥♥♥ tone more stuff. Get the game for a buck, about 3-5 hours of fun with your freinds.  10/10 Probally going to get addicted
8603	1	a	It's a ridulously fun and mildly nice game. To say that it has 'huge, endless environments' is somewhat pointless, because it isn't fun to explore them, for there is only scenery outside of the area where dinosaurs spawn. Though they will follow you.  I would definitely recommend this game. The optimisation is fairly decent, considering that it looks fairly pretty on high settings, but there are always a few bugs here and there. The gameplay is balanced to an extent, but in a more interesting way than a generic fps, instead going for a more classical unrefined approach which makes it much more fun and progressive (in my opinion).  And best of all, the developers are still working on it, so it can only get better from here.  Did I mention that it's only $1?
8605	1	a	Come on Its only    $0.74
8607	1	a	Dino Beatdown x 2
8609	1	a	Honestly, I bought this game as a joke for me and all my friends, but then later I actually started playing it and now love playing it. Its an awesome and fun game for playing co-op and just whenever. Best 1$ spent on Steam.
8611	1	a	From buggy and laggy game turned into my opinion BEST dino game today
8613	1	a	This game is incredibly fun and will fill you with awe and joy. With this said, it can also drive you crazy, the rouge-like nature of the game, causes you to loose your mind over and over. You keep dying to small things such as bees, you set fire to yourself or you couldn't pick enough flowers. Overall it's pretty fun.
8615	1	a	Played this game for an hour and it is already one of my favorites in my library.
8617	1	a	When i first bought this game it had plenty of bugs, some of them game breaking, but it was unique. These developers have done exaxtly what they should have done by continuing to work on the game to make it a very enjoyable game. This is truly a great game and for a dollar you should definatly buy 12
8619	1	a	If this game was priced at $30+ I would say avoid it like the plague.  If this game was priced at $20 I would say don't bother waiting for a sale.  If this game was priced at $10 I would say just buy anything else.  If this game was priced at $5 I would say you could buy lunch instead.  If this game was priced at $1 I would say you have no reason not to own this.
8621	1	a	You cant beat the price. Fun for atleast a few hours, a sh it load more fun if some friends have it too. 8/10 would shoot dino again
3180	0	a	I personly liked the gameplay from the beginning. My only problem with this is game and the reason why i am still not going to play it is, that it has only support for some common screen resolutions but my 1280x1024 is still not supported. And nothing is more infuriating that playing with the wrong resolution. Don't get me wrong. I like it that you have improved and fixed a lot of stuff. But the only thing i am asking for is to get the resolution problem fixed.
8623	1	a	Purchased this when it was still entitled ORION: Dino Horde for 99 cents.  Hands down, it is the best dollar game I have ever bought.  9/10  Did I mention you can kill dinosaurs with a Mech?
8625	1	a	I bought this game because of the fact that theres no possible way i can buy a game for 99 cents and not atleast get my money back in fun and i was right to me this game is one of the funnest games just for survival alone and i recomended for anyone! plus it has freaking dinosaurs....
8627	1	a	This is the first time I have ever changed a review from negative to positive. They did a lot updates to this game, it is still not the greatest but it quite a bit of fun, I highly recommend this game.
3181	0	a	Its not the worst and if your friends just need a break from something else go for it. However, even with the tiny price, there are far better games like it. I wouldn't recomend getting this soley because I haven't touched it since the last summer sale. I just don't like it. I would wait for the summer sale to spend your 2 bucks on, this isn't just worth it in my own opinion.
8629	1	a	This game is impeccable fun, and its only $0.50!
8631	1	a	Played this game for an hour.......1$ well spent! its like HALO,Star wars, borderlands, battlefield and unreal tournament and Jurassic park all mashed up with insane graphics nd some awesome gameplay....unless u lack a dollar there is no reason u should not buy this epic game.....where else can u kill dinosaurs with a lightsaber!!!!!!!?????????
8633	1	a	got trampled various times by triceratops. 10/10 would do again.
8635	1	a	hours of stupidity with the buds
8637	1	a	Most epic 99 cent game! :D  Dinosaurs are awesome!
3186	0	a	After playing for half an hour I guess I know y this game is so cheap. Because it's cheap. Nothing attractive, u can get the best weapon in coop after the first wave.  No challenges and strange task settings. And btw, totally a terrible firing sense. DONT BUY THIS GAME.
8639	1	a	This got my ♥♥♥♥ hard in 2.6 seconds
8641	1	a	This is actually a really goodgame! I have fun playing this. I am impressed with the many variations on game modes and the smooth and fun game-play. There is a massive pile of achievements to strive for also.  I may update this review later after I have played more of various modes, know more about the ins and outs of the game.  I will say that a good set of surround headphones are useful to assist in finding the loot chests.
8643	1	a	halo feel to it. its great
8645	1	a	im so proud of the devs who put the time and care, to transform a game like this is impressive bravo. 
8647	1	a	By no means is ORION: Prelude the best game you will ever play. However, if you're looking for a fun way to kill a few hours here or there with a group of friends, its hard to find games that fill that gap so well. For $0.99 this game is more then worth while, its a ton of fun to just sit through its horde mode and kill wave after wave of dinos with a few friends and just enjoy it.
8649	1	a	Like a cocoon it emerges majestically.
3187	0	a	im not really into this game it lags like hell so i cant move/turn around witthout doin somat stupid and there is nothing there to kill when i join a multiplayer game so yeah... its crap for me (i wanna get a refund but i dont know how)
8651	1	a	For less than 1€ you have a super silly funny dinosaur shooter. Reminds me of an malformed halo son with a killing floor vibe to it. Anyhoo, it's just fun and there's DINOS.  And also, the devs made a great trailer for their game after 3 years of support with a lot of self criticism.
8653	1	a	Truly worth getting  This is Were HALO meets Zombies Then Zombies Replaced With Dinosaurs
8655	1	a	This game has many epic raptors but they're weaker than the tractors. &gt;:D
8657	1	a	cool cool
8659	1	a	Orion: Prelude is a funny game, especially when you're playing with friends!  Pluses: +Cost less than 1 euro. +Good co-op. +Many achivments. +A lot of fun.  Minuses: -Boring after few hours. -Not best optimized. -Many buggs.
8661	1	a	Played this game for a mere 20min; and it was by far the most ridiculously fun 20min I have spent playing a PC game. Does it have a brilliant narrative like Halo? Absolutely not. Does it have dynamic gameplay like Deus Ex or Remember Me? Well, no. But let me just say this. I rode on top of a Triceratops, ramming it into a T-Rex which then proceeded to knock me off and trample me while my teammates crashed a vehicle into a building. Yes, that is all that needs to be expressed/said here.
8663	1	a	After reading the negative reviews I was amazed at how far the level of stupidity could go.  I bought this game only yesterday and since then this game has been a pure pleasure to play. For only 1$ I have to say, not only is one of the most cost efficent games I know of but this game is a hell lot of fun. You go around either freezing dinos with your medic gun/healing gun or you could go full Arnold mode and just shoot the dinos and **** them over. This is an amazing game, survive endless hordes of dinos, eventually you can buy new guns and upgrade and get new perks. Overall I will give this is game a 10/10 not only because of the value, but the fun and happiness it brought me.  It has some cool ♥♥♥ glitches and bugs as well, such as driving on a charging stegosaurus and flying 20+Meters up.
8665	1	a	I played it for a few minutes when it was on sale way back then, needless to say, even though it was such a short time, it was worth it. Sadly I've got burned on my alternative account so I have literally no money but still, I remember the time and it was worth it back then, don't know about now though.
3189	0	a	This is the most terrible game ever. Within 3 minutes of opening, I quit.
8667	1	a	So much potential.... this thing could be epic with some of the minor problems tweaked... I do hope they don't give up on this game
8669	1	a	Clearly not the best game ever made, but for 74 cent it's still sold quite much under what it's acutally worth...
8671	1	a	But ♥♥♥♥ it was 99 cents
8673	1	a	It's not bad.
8675	1	a	when kids ask me how did dinosors die i let them play this okay this game 11/10 {Great Buy] buy really amazing game for the money
8677	1	a	Played dis with my friends worth buying 10/10
8679	1	a	Its really fun and has a very friendly community because most or some of you are just new to the game and its just really fun... i recommend this to anyone
8681	1	a	I actually change my mind. At first didn´t like it, but well it is that cheap that you can have a go. It will bring you fun for a few hours
8683	1	a	Halo + Nazi Zombies + Dinosaurs = Orion: Prelude  Highly recommended if you have people to play it with.
3192	0	a	Sucks.  generic fps with dinosaurs guns sound like airsoft sounds are gross vehicles are clunky or overpowered stores are meh its not satisfying  2/10
8685	1	a	So cheap you must grab! And so much play value if you only play one match you have gotten your moneys worth!
8687	1	a	It's like Jurassic Park in space
8689	1	a	Pretty good game to kill some time... and dinos.
8691	1	a	I recommend only because its cheap, anyways 1/10 but 10/10 if you like games with quality of the 70s pornos
8693	1	a	10/10 never used R$2,19 so well
3195	0	a	i dont care how many updates they had. this game isn't even worth 99 cents in my opinion
3196	0	a	NOT A JOKE REVIEW  One of the worst games I have ever played. The graphics are absolutly trash. THe dino AI is simulatenously OP and dumb. The weapons are all the same and the minimap might as well not be there.
8695	1	a	Like Halo + Call Of Duty Zombies + Dinosaurs. Would recommend. For the price, you cant go wrong really.
8697	1	a	'There are two conditions: first, I'm in charge. All you have to do is sign the checks, tell us we're doing a good job, and open your case of scotch when we have a good day.  Second condition: my fee? You can keep it. All I want in return for my services is the right to hunt one of the tyrannosaurs. A male, a buck only. How and when is my business. Now if you don't like either of those conditions, you're on your own. So go ahead, set up base camp right here, or in a swamp, or in the middle of a rex nest for all I care. But I've been on too many safaris with rich dentists to listen to any more suicidal ideas, OK?' 
8699	1	a	I Love This Game It Contains Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch And The Favorite Defender.
8701	1	a	better than Evolve
8703	1	a	I have seen a lot of people hate this game but I'm not sure why. I think this game is great, the bugs have been worked out and I have had a lot of fun. There is incredible co-op and it is a good experience. I would recommend buying it, ESPECIALLY when it is this cheap.
8705	1	a	This game is what Evolve should have been. The controls are tight, the gunplay is satisfying (even though some guns sound like Nerf guns,) and the graphics are great. Pretty much, if you liked Killing Floor or Dino D Day, this game is for you.
8707	1	a	Bought a knife and stabbed a t-rex to death for $.49 10/10 would stab again
8709	1	a	Dinosaurs!!!!!!!!  Roar!!!  Yum?   Really though,  get this game.
8711	1	a	Used jetpack, accidentally landed on a T-Rex, and died. 10/10
8713	1	a	I ♥♥♥♥♥ a T-Rex to death with my Cryo Knife I punched a stegosaurus to death with my Assault Rifle I rode a car to a T-Rex's Mouth,T-Rex became pregnant      10/10 the only reason i buyed this game is for ♥♥♥♥♥♥ some dinosaurs
8715	1	a	it's... it's beautiful, it's godlike, it's goooooood GET THIS GAME NAOWWW
8717	1	a	This game was really rough when it first came out, but Spiral really upped their game and made this a BRILLIANT title in the updates since then. It definitely has a Halo vibe to it (its Firefight mode in particular if you're familiar with it), but much faster paced with a lot of upgrades and weapons to choose from. The environments are gorgeous, and the gunplay is satisfying. Definitely one of my top-10 games to play with friends, and a great deal at any price!
8719	1	a	So Bad, Its GREAT!!!
8721	1	a	Buy it now. Don't bother reading the rest of this review or any other review. Are you still reading? Ok then, fine. At this price you will not find a better value in gaming. This is gonzo bonkers fun. Get your friends together, run around and kill some dinosaurs. Even if you play it for half an hour, or one day, you only spent a dollar! Buy this game, buy it for your skeptical friends, and find out THE REAL REASON the dinosaurs went extinct.
8723	1	a	I originally wrote a review back when this was Orion: Dino Hunt, I'll leave the original review at the bottom.  The developers have come a long way with this, they even admitted it was a disaster at first. But they did something I'm very surprised and pleased with; instead of abandoning this failed game, they reworked it, made it better and sold it cheaper.  It may be just another Unreal wave survival game with little-to-no story, but it is fun to play, especially with friends. The developers have realized that they should just make this game fun more than serious, so you get people running around in Halo Spartan-style armor with lightsabers and cheeseburger hats.  The devs have changed my opinion on this title, it is worth getting this cheap if you can and having some fun running around in this game with your friends.  ORIGINAL REVIEW:  Yes, I know, shoot dinosaurs in the face with high-tech weaponry, yadda yadda  But that gimmick doesn't last long. All the survival matches have the same format and waves of enemies no matter what the map is. Plus the game has a lot of quirks; the animations feel unrefined, the user interface is very user unfriendly (there's no labels or hover-text to describe what each number or button is for, and some buttons you have to double click quickly or it will only play an annoying select sound), the controls for vehicles feel awkward, and there's plenty of glitches.  I was in a vehicle when I was tossed up onto a rock by a T-Rex, none of the wheels contacted the rock, so I couldn't get down, and the vehicle was at such an angle that whenever I stepped out, I was magically forced back into the vehicle. I had to wait about four waves before my teammates could ram a tank up onto the rock far enough to dislodge me!  This game has an interresting concept (although I can't find a story anywhere for this to make sense), but it's just too clunky and unrefined for it to be a worthwhile game.
8725	1	a	so good for being such a bad game.
8727	1	a	this game is good but it lags for me so i havr to return it im sry but if it didnt lag for me it would be 10/10
3200	0	a	It is a very laggy game (needs Improment (Fast) ) 
8729	1	a	How do you add a Xbox One Controller in?
8731	1	a	Killed a Pterodactyl with a lightsaber 10/10
3201	0	a	Eh... it's a dollar. Grab it, have a bit of fun with it.  Honestly though, I just didn't find it fun. It's still really unpolished and clunky.  The menus are just horrible. Both in looks and in feel. The customization menu is terrible. Like... it all works, it's just not an enjoyable experience.  It's hard to complain about it considering the price, but it's just annoying to look at.  
8733	1	a	Unless you like to laugh at how bad the game is get it... However if you like to laugh at how good the game is get it.... just get it i mean its come on... it was only 99 centsssss
8735	1	a	Cheap fun for the whole family.
8737	1	a	I don't think I've ever played this game before. 10/10
8739	1	a	i played tthe game with my 2 friends before when there was only like 1-2 maps in workshop, we had so much fun killing dinos and eachother. 10.5/10 -ign
8741	1	a	11/10 Ragdolls are hilarious Game gets intense fast Buy it on sale!!!!
8743	1	a	this IS the best game ever!!
8745	1	a	[OLD REVIEW/OUTDATED] Now I know why it's a 1$ deal, this game, while having good graphics and some nice lightning effects and visuals, sadly is very poorly executed. It's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of bugs and stuttering ranging from 5 to 30 FPS, you can't even play it because it is so poorly optimized that when you move you don't move normally you teleport from one place to the other. Guys I know it's 1$ and that we're all impulsive buyers here on Steam, but is it worth buying something even if it was 0,01 cents when you can't enjoy it? No, I highly recommend do not buy.  EDIT: Since a ♥♥♥♥ ton of updates I must update this review, due to developers never before seen change of hearth I think they themselves saw what a ♥♥♥♥ of a game they made and they decided to completely transform it, making it from one of the worst games on steam ever to the best money spent:fun had game on steam, props for all the bugfixes and updates and for admitting your wrongdoings, not a lot of people would do that and I respect you people for that. For this kind of money? Game is a steal, buy it and you'll have fun, I guarantee.
8747	1	a	At first I thought, 'Oh, Darryl wants me to play this...*sigh* it's a PVPFPS...' I couldn't have been more incorrect. it IS a fps, but it's geared toward co-op fp combat....AGAINST DINOSAURS! The AI is good, because they know how to swarm your ♥♥♥. You'll find yourself backing away while shooting at your feet...and at the little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that are trying to snap off your ankles! I think, graphically, it still has a way to go, but the gameplay is fun and exciting!
8749	1	a	Very very good game. The dev team is putting so much work to this game, you should be happy its about a dollar.If you dont apriciate the dev's job your life is a misery. Really worth 1 dollar. I rate it 10/10
8751	1	a	I can safely say that this game was worth every cent. took couple of minutes to get used to it and the graphics don't even bother at all. Would reccomand it to anyone and the price is just redicilous for how much fun it actually is.
8753	1	a	What a game for a dollar.
8755	1	a	Totally worth for the price of a mcdonalds cheeseburger!
8757	1	a	This game is fantastic. Once you get past the first few hours of just reveling in the ridiculousness that is this game (like slaying a TRex with what is essentially a lightsaber), you realize that this game can actually be really difficult and requires top-notch co-op skills. 20/10 would buy.
8759	1	a	good but laggy sometimes ate/10 hehehehe see what i did there?
3206	0	a	Tried changing the resolution from 1280x960 or whatever crap it was on to my 5:4 1280x1024. NOPE. The setting doesn't exist. They have 16:9, 16:10, and 4:3. But not 5:4. When I applied my graphics settings, the game went black and my screen was constantly blinking. alt+tab didn't do anything and ctrl+alt+del would bring up Task Manager, but still wouldn't let me use it because my screen was blinking. Alt+F4 did nothing to it as well. Had to restart my computer.  TL;DR  -Stupid resolution settings -Game crashed my computer before I even started playing
8761	1	a	well if youre looking for a good game that is cheap this is it i think its on of my favorites because it has a good multiplayer mode and the singleplayer mode is nothing to laugh at over all it is a great game for 1 $ i think its a great deal
8763	1	a	if i had to sum this game up in 1 sentance it would be: Halo meets dinosaurs!   I paid just over 1 dollar for this game and you get:  +cool abilities to use  +a nice selection of weapons  +vehicles that highly resemble the ones from Halo  +some of the maps are quite large, while others may be cartoon-based +getting tired of killing dinos? try your luck against Robot Santa (thats right!), or hell you can BE any dino in this game! +There is a great selection of game modes to choose from...  +Lightsabres! (lets not kid ourselves) +teleporters!  whats not to like about it? if i had to say.... -there is NO tutorial or story -no detail of game mode, unless you are starting your own game -slightly buggy dinos sometimes (stuck way off in the middle of nowhere)  BUT! im just being picky there none of those things caused any issues for my enjoyment of this game! if you have a spare buck in your account and are tyring to avoid lemons, just buy this game, it was my first spare buck i spent on steam and i dont regret it at all! Dino surfing and punching T-rexes in the face is awsome!
8765	1	a	this game has very little content...for well different gear but ways to play let's just say i've put 720hours in and i'm still fiding new ways to play. It all depends on the people you play with!
8767	1	a	It's much better than many $30 plus AAA and Early Access games and only 99 UScents.  Think Halos firefight/Spartan Assault modes but with dinosaurs instead of Covenent.  Seriously hope the dev makes a follow up. 
8769	1	a	So bad that it's good.Its hilariously basic and buggy.I love it for the atrocities.Its too dank.
8771	1	a	I know.......only a few minutes in the game and a review..right? Well, just some info for new buyers, this game gets a little laggy. Its graphics arent the best, but the fun is epic. Big thanks to friends who got me this game.
8773	1	a	Started it up Joined a server Moved around then died a lot without seeing anything Holds Tab Sees my ping is 900 Disconnects Finds a new server Ping is 4 Destroys dinos  10/10
3210	0	a	boring useless and stupid game , i regret that i bought this crap!!!
8775	1	a	Extremely fun for a 99c game, Ive already reccomended it ot a few friends  11/9 Got memed by a friend playing a Spino.
8777	1	a	THE GAME IS JUST TO GOOD
8779	1	a	cool
3211	0	a	got boring real quick
8781	1	a	It is alright i guess not the best game i must admit but i guess it worth around 79p it has developed since its early stages a lot as i saw there vid on it. But u no i guess it kinda addictive just work on the graphics and the style of thae game.
8783	1	a	Tiny Dinos that are strapped with dynamite and bark as they go up in a fiery explosion 10/10
3212	0	a	So much nope. Don't buy it. This game is a buggy, laggy, unpolished... heck, even uncompleted, mess.
8785	1	a	DINOSAURS! RAWR! if you like killing dinosaurs and just being an overall badass, this is the game for you.
8787	1	a	needs a bit of work but fun feels like cod zombies
8789	1	a	Worth every penny,
8791	1	a	This game launched as a mess, but because of the loyalty of the development team it has really grown into a great game.
3214	0	a	This game sucks my other left nut
8793	1	a	Jurassic Park and Halo had a love child. Then that child had cancer. Then the government conducted genetic experiments on this child. Then Microsoft hired this child as a game developer. The result is a hilarious, cheesy game to play with your buddies. For the price, I give it a 10/10.
3215	0	a	The graphics are mediocre, the gameplay is boring, and the mechanics are clunky. I bought this last year when they at least pretended it was worth something (base price of $9.99). The game now only costs $.99. This is not a quality game. Don't waste a penny on this
8795	1	a	Bought a 4 pack when it went on sale from $15 down to $1 as they started promising huge updates.  Devs changed base price to $1.  Went from 25% off for $0.74 to 51% off for $0.49 in the last few minutes  11/10 great game plz buy my copies
8797	1	a	Get it on sale but it is still worth it
8799	1	a	I killed multiple Stegosauruses and Triceratops. I ran over the tail of a T-Rex in a vehicle, then shot it in the face with a friggen bow. All in the span of 20 minutes. 10/10 Most spectacularly horrrible game ever.
8801	1	a	Honestly i dont see why some many people dont like the and why its beeing considered the 'worst game ever' i had lots of fun alone and with friends. I bought it like 10 times and giftet it to friends because i think its great. And for 0,50$ i dont see a reason why not to buy it  
8803	1	a	got spookt by t-rex 10/10
8805	1	a	Jurassic Park meets Borderlands.  You and your friends grab some sci-fi guns and jetpacks and shoot a bunch of dinosaurs. Or you and your friends are dinosaurs and you eat people with sci-fi guns and jetpacks. If that doesn't sound fun, consult your doctor because there's something seriously wrong with you.  And it's only a dollar! There do appear to be optional transactions in the game's 'store' menu, but it's only for cosmetic items and stuff like that. As far as I can see this game is NOT 'pay to win.' One dollar; tons of fun.
8807	1	a	it's a fun game for a great price 
8809	1	a	great game would recommend ^^
8811	1	a	I played this game for like 2 games and it blew my mind. I really recommend it for anyone who loves sci-fi and shooters.
8813	1	a	I really like this game. It has several different game modes to play, 3 different classes to choose from each with their own special ability, there's the ability to level up characters, customize the appearance of your character, edit your starting loadout, different rewards each time you reach a higher level, there's a nice array of weaponry to choose from and some cool vehicles to use. You can play with up to 4 other players ie. 5 people in a team and the graphics are excellent (if your system can take advantage of setting everything up full I'd recommend it!).   I have played many hours on this with friends and we've had some epic hours gaming on it. I must admit the game has been buggy from time to time, problems with friends joining and some of the AI can occasionally be glitchy whilst playing like for eg. once I got killed by a raptor roughly 4 seconds after I'd already headshot it clean dead with the Longshot sniper rifle with the damage increase augment purchased. I suspect these glitches are simply down to internet lag between players. I plan to play this game over LAN (1 Gb/s) soon with friends at which point I will update this review.  I would like to note that I don't normally suffer issues gaming with my friends online, We play often on a variety of games and 99% of the time its perfectly smooth. My connection speed is 100 Mb of which I'm receiving speeds of 106.9 Mb/s (12.6 MB/s) Download and 6.09 Mb/s (0.7 MB/s) Upload (results from  http://speedtest.net  tested via closest server). In my rig I'm running an i5 quad core CPU @ 3.3 GHz per core (Corsair H55 Cooler + 2 x Fans), 16 GB (2 x 8 GB) Corsair DDR 3 @ 2400 Hz, MSI NVidia GTX 760 2 GB (NZXT GPU Bracket + Corsair H55 Cooler + 2 x Fans), Asus Z97-P Motherboard, 2 x Kingston 60 GB (RAID 0) for Windows 7 Ultimate and 2 x Kingston 120 GB (RAID 0) for games powered by EVGA 500 Watt 80 PLUS 12v+40A PSU.  My friends whom I play online with the majority of the time are on similar spec rigs with similar speed internet connections and we all live within a 10 mile radius. I suspect where some of the issue is coming from is there are 2 of us using the same internet provider and package, we get the same speeds. My friend who is on the same provider and speeds as myself actually has 2 people playing from the same house which will obviously greatly affect internet throughput. My other friends have much higher upload speeds, up to 20 Mb/s or 2.5 MB/s for those who'd like it converted :) We all suffer these glitches from the AI, some of us more than others so clearly its a common problem which leads me to internet connection issues must be the root. I have also forgotten to point out I also get these glitches when playing with newcomers when I host an open game although I haven't noticed them during solo play however I must admit I tend to mainly play this game multiplayer 90% of the time.  Additionally we tend to get these problems the most when playing Conquest mode which is a 30 round game mode which can last a good hour or more (depending on how many players have joined). I intend to play a Conquest mode game with my usual 4 companions on this game in a LAN situation. The same computers and players as usual, same game mode, rules etc but connected via a 1 Gb/s network switch and see if the problem subsides. If this is the case then it is clear that the most effective way to play this game with friends on this game in Conquest mode would be to get together to play via LAN instead of struggling with glitches via online play.   I have been very specific with this review to help those who may still be pondering over buying this game. It really is a good game, hours of entertainment, loads to do on it and its 95% smooth gaming but there are those little issues from time to time sadly. This is without a doubt a really fun game to play solo but even more fun with friends, as long as you are happy to live with a little lag if you gaming online.   All in all, long review aside, great game, well worth what I paid for it (got it in a sale happily) but its worth the full price in my opinion. :) Hope my review has helped!
8815	1	a	Best dollar get yet? YES! Fun only with friends though.
3216	0	a	Tried out one server, then hated it. Hard to get momentum in this game. Slow. Sloppy. -infinity/10
8817	1	a	this might be the best 99cents ive spent on steam yet.
8819	1	a	Not too bad for a $1 game. :P
3217	0	a	At least the uninstall button is working 11/10
8821	1	a	If you like: --- Dinosaurs --- Guns --- Jetpacks --- Cheap games --- Customizable characters --- Invisibility --- Elf hats --- Flying helicopters with rockets and miniguns --- Driving trucks with miniguns on their backs --- Shooting miniguns --- Being a dinosaur --- Sniping --- Knifing --- Shooting --- Big boom booms --- OR ANYTHING ELSE   you will love this game  p.s. you can be a dinosaur  100000000/10
8823	1	a	One of the best Indie on steam. After 3 years of post-release support it has become a great piece for any gamer interested in a dynamic, competitive or cooperative Dinosaur themed game. Dinosaurs are well made, there is a very big amount of maps (every map has day-night cycle and dynamic weather conditions), there are a lot of different game modes (cooperative survival, open world conquest, many competitive PvP modes, and 'rampage'-a team of players playing as dinosaurs protecting their eggs from an enemy team of human players-), there is the possibility to use PC bots as team mates and the graphic is good as well. Great soundtracks too, perfect to the sci-fi atmosphere of the entire gameplay. Really satisfied with this game.
8825	1	a	I wish all game developers were this devoted to their games.
3219	0	a	'I got the game and it still had really bad Graphics and lag OMG.'
3220	0	a	probably the worst game i've ever played in my life
8827	1	a	fun with friends
3221	0	a	not a game for me
8829	1	a	if i knew how to cry, i would do it now
8831	1	a	Got hooked on this via the free Steam trial, and had to buy it. An excellent shooter, it has a distinct Halo feeling to it but with an intense PVE and cooperative focus to the gameplay, although PVP options are available. Needless to say it is a ton of fun. If you ever wanted to pilot a futuristic helicopter and get rocks thrown at you by a t-rex then this is the game you want to get.  The game as a whole looks great, and for the most part runs great, although it can be hard to find a game that fits your ping when the game is still in the lobby. Other then that no complaints, it is a true hidden gem and would go great in an library, even for only the casual FPS player.
8833	1	a	I just bought this game its really cheap,and my screen is black all the time.Can somebody help me pls? :)
8835	1	a	This game is really fun to play, plays a lot like halo in terms of mechanics, the warthog uses look to steer for e.g. and you have the same weapon's setup i.e. guns grenades &amp; melee.  The combat isn't as polished as halo obviously, (billion $ franchise vrs small indie) and the weapons and vehicles feel a little light but having said that it is still really fun to play.  For the current asking price Its a steal, and that price includes all the important game features that you'll need to play. (No PTW features only hats &amp; cosmetics as far as I can tell).   If you enjoyed gow 2's hoard mode you will probably enjoy this game although it has lots of other game modes, I've not tried them yet so can't comment.  Definitely has that 'one more round' thing going on and the new steam add is cool as hell. ;)   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShQ3GBFI4KQ 
3222	0	a	4/10
8837	1	a	good game.. good graphics... really fun to play :D
8839	1	a	Suprisingly good.
3223	0	a	Oh my god. Worst game experience ever.  1. The hardware requirements are ridiculously high. I can play many games on high settings. Here I have input lag in the menu and low FPS even on 720p .... 2. 'Connection to Host lost'. Joining a game (with decent internet connection) is like russian roulette. 3. Map design is confusing. Makes me miss battlefield or basically any other shooter. 4. Shotgun: 25-100 Damage. Fists: 4700 Damage. Why the hell should I buy weapons?
8841	1	a	best co-op i've ever played. is fun, edgy and spicy.
8843	1	a	Fantastic. For the price this game is amazing and fun. For 99 Cents you can kill countless dinos. Take a little bit to get use to the way the game works but overall amazing game.
3224	0	a	Right,,,  So I got this game during the free weekend, and played it for a little bit, and was lucky enough to get a free key of it by the end of that weekend, I would load it up when I was bored, and would just play for a little bit. And now, after 6 hours of this game, I can safely say that it was terrible.  The game is a mess, even after all the updates. For starters, graphics customization does almost nothing to fix the frame rate, which went from pretty good to PowerPoint levels of slow by the end of a game. The AI is just awful, the Pterodactyls in particular being a major pain in the *** (imagine trying to hit something flying through the air with a PowerPoint frame rate). The game is just littered with technical issues, many of which render it unplayable. I can't think of a single time I quit that wasn't due to some technical issue.  However, I still liked parts of it. Its a good concept, just terrible delivery. The developers know this, and dropped the price down to just a dollar. Even then, it goes on sale all the time. So, to wrap up this crappy review for a crappy game, buy it if you want to, but don't expect much
8845	1	a	only for dinosaur lovers 
8847	1	a	I got it for .99$ and it was SOOOOOO worth the money. I'd spend anything south of 10$ on this game. Great laugh inspiring gameplay but, no real goal. Just mayhem. Great for friend games and honestly it can be fun with the right crowd. The online community is really good I just wish there was a single player mode.   5.5/10
8849	1	a	For 99 cents this game is amazing.
3225	0	a	Was only able to connect to one server,  
3226	0	a	its a glitchy game
8851	1	a	good game so OP jaws droppin at my feet
8853	1	a	Entertaining and fun with friends :D
8855	1	a	when i was testing it i became a t rex then killed someone and he flew out of the map..........         10/10 BOI
8857	1	a	For 1 dollar it's an awesome and fun game!
8859	1	a	it is so fun
8861	1	a	Sure, game had a rough launch, but very rarely will you see a game with such a dedicated dev team, that not only fixed the game, but made it superior in almost every way to what it once was.
8863	1	a	Damn this game is legit, the price is unreal.
8865	1	a	This game is fantastic. Bought it for $1, made 5 cents on the steam cards system.
8867	1	a	rather get this game than any f2p game out there 100/10
8869	1	a	Game is good but it have vere bad optimization
8871	1	a	the graphics are kind of old, but that isn't a very big deal. This game would be affordable even if it costed 4000% more. Many gamemodes, weapons, cosmetics, vehicles and dinos are included in an awsome co-op, pvp game for just 0.99€. There's no reason why you shouldn't buy this game.  Loved it from the very first beginning  The only - is those weird acidspitting dinos....
8873	1	a	This game was really fun. I got many hours of entertainment for only $5. Worth every penny.
3229	0	a	It is laggy and had a bad graphix on my pc but it has great dino-combat series , it doesn't have much weapons so kinda sad
8875	1	a	this is a combo of star wars, halo and jurassic park all rolled in to one   what more could u want   definetly buy this 9.5/10  if u like to fight dinosaurs with friends and a combination star wars, halo and jurassic park this is the game for u definetly get it  and also i would defenetly recomend playing online or with friends to get full expiereance because the AI isnt very good
8877	1	a	I killed a triceratops with a lightsaber off of the hood of a jeep.
8879	1	a	this is the best game with dinos 
8881	1	a	I saw this game and said, well it costs less than a dollar, let's try. Spent couple of hours playing and it's awesome, it has some glitches but doesen't matter. It's really fun to play especially some friends to play with.  Give it a shoot, it's just a dollar. (And you can knife T-Rex or roadkill raptors as well)
8883	1	a	Never plaid such a fun game i have had it for 2 days and ive played for 26 hours and for only 0.99 its a creazy good deal.
8885	1	a	yeah, preety decent game Best thing! It is playeble!
8887	1	a	If you expect a high quality dinosaur game, go pay more than 80p. For 80p I can't really argue with the content provided, it's pretty comprehensive for that price tbh If you can, get it in a sale for 10p less because this is Steam; the haven for penny pinchers!
3231	0	a	It's a broken game worst game ever it sucks
8889	1	a	AWESOME GAME!!!!! AND ITS ONLY $1!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
8891	1	a	this game is incredible, when going through ghosts... and considering the connection is so bad you cant walk 10 feet. this game allways promises the ability to choose your game and play how you want not limited to how a server says you shouldent. this game is fun and reliable
8893	1	a	FPS is not my first choice of games but the trailer and 'plot' drew me in. WOW! Just started playing, I don't even have all of the controls memorized and i love it. 
8895	1	a	Good Fun..still a bit to go gameplay wise
8897	1	a	If you read back in the history of this game you'll see a lot of shiesty stuff, allegations of the developer not paying the programmers and things of that nature as well as misappropriated game assets. The game somewhere along the way even changed it's name, an event some use as condemning evidence of it's sordid past.   Me I don't know, we got this game as a pack during a seasonal sale and you know what for the dollar it cost it was worth it. The reviews in the past were all negative and that was the community supporting the people that got ripped off, now they're mainly positive because people to forget the past and lets face it for a buck this is a stupidly fun game.   Level progression in this game has been revamped (not for the better imho) and content really hasn't been updated that I can see for a while but at a buck you do get your moneys worth.
8899	1	a	Killed a T-Rex by punching it.   194/10 game of the year every year
8901	1	a	I owned this game when it was a POS. I hated it and I hated the money I spent on it. Made me sad to see such potential wasted on what could have been an awesome dinosaur multiplayer experience.   now, that was about a few years ago, when I bought the game. NOW, its completely different.  Are there bugs? yes. plenty still. Is it worth playing? ♥♥♥♥. yeah. NOW ITS AMAZIIIIIING.  I give it 2 zugs.  Zug zug.
3234	0	a	This game I thought had a lot of promise when i got it as a gift but when i played it it was horrible. it always lags lots of errors and i can never get into a server.Should you buy it?NO Only if the developers fix this will it be a good game in my eyes.
8903	1	a	Who told you that you have to spend a lot of money to have a great game? This is so cheap and dope ♥♥♥♥
8905	1	a	Buy it, this game is so much fun, despite a few minor bugs. First of all, what game have you played that lets you defend against a wave of dinosaurs that isn't crap? This game has so much fun in it for the 99 cents it costs.
8907	1	a	had 99 cents bought this, fun as hell. Haven't played csgo in a week! (that's alot for me)
8909	1	a	this is the best game ever
8911	1	a	This Pumpkin King 10/10 would fight again
8913	1	a	It's just awful so awful. Words cannot describe how awful this is   10/10 would play again
8915	1	a	Fun game. nothing to say about it, it's a bit boring in a long play but what a pleasure to kill over again some dinos :-) 
8917	1	a	This is the greatest of all time. I played a little bit of Dino Beat Down and knew that it could grow into something amazing, and it has. If you play with friends you can play for hours on end, enjoying every second of it. It is a unique game and although it has a few minor bugs and glitches, they are not at all game breaking or even noticeable by the average gamer. I recommend this game not only because it is an amazing, fun, addicting game, but also because it is only $1.00. Like, seriously, it is $1.00, just try it.
8919	1	a	This game is the most HORRIBLY AMAZING GAME IVE EVER PLAYED FOR JUST 1 BUCK I WAS SO HAPPY I JUMPE OFF A CLIFF then lost all my weapons and we lost........BUT STILL 10/10!!!!!!!
8921	1	a	Jurassic park simulator 2015
8923	1	a	This is truly a great game. I've played this game for A WEEK STRAIGHT and I haven't gotten tired of it! It's AWSOME!!
8925	1	a	I really wish that this game didn't get so much flak after its initial release. I mean, sure, I hear that it was a fairly buggy, garbage game. But now it's definitely a blast to play with some friends or to just pick up a round now and then. You get to run around killing dinosaurs with some cool weaponry! Sure, it's not the most involved game out there, but not every game needs to be deep - sometimes a game can just be fun, ya know?
3235	0	a	game is my ♥♥♥
8927	1	a	still bad like before,bad server,big pings,etc.But this games was so good.Please fix dis games 
8929	1	a	great and fun Coop game - a bargain for ~1€
8931	1	a	Honestly, I can only describe this game as a knockoff Halo with dinosaurs.  I shot a pterodactyl in the face with a bow and arrow though.  I didn't pay enough for this game.
8933	1	a	I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!
8935	1	a	When I first played Orion Prelude, it was a peice of crap... I just couldnt play it. It was near impossible the glitches were real. Over the time I have spent a good 10 hours at the time of this review. I can't even try to be negative about this game. It has some of the best co-op I have ever used. It has Evolved. It was Orion Dino Hoarde... Now it something more... Orion: PRELUDE. ITS WORTH $.99 
3236	0	a	It's boring, too repetitive, dinos come in waves and that's pretty much it, because I don't even know what's the point of the game or what do I have to do because there's no tutorial or introduction. Thank god I only paid 0.59€ and can get back some of it from the cards. Not to mention it crashes if I try to play it on fullscreen for some reason.
8937	1	a	It's just a dollar, and I can guarantee you it is more fun and longer lasting than a candy bar of the same price. Basically crappy Planetside with dinosaurs. Just buy it you nerd.
8939	1	a	Unstable and broken, almost impossible to play. First I had trouble finding a server that I could connect into, then I had trouble trying to play because of the lag, and finally I was always thrown back to lobby because server disconnection. After this happened couple of times, I quit playing. There are free games out there that are more better and intact than this.  From what I gathered, the game is about surviving a wave of dinosaurs and then upgrading your weapons. Each wave of dinosaurs gets a bit more difficult after each wave, but you have about a minute between the waves to buy better weapons or abilities. All the action happens in a one huge map, that consists somewhat of desert sand and canyons. Sometimes the game gives the players a side quest, which is just an assignment to go and kill even larger dinosaur somewhere in the distance. Yaahoo.   I bet there were more game modes and possibly more map types, but fuggetaboutit. There is no chance of me going through this laggy crap again.   EDIT: Okay, been playing this with my wife and it actually is quite enjoyable. Changing my recommendation to 'Yes'! Still broken though, but LAN co-op is somewhat satisfactory.
8941	1	a	i want this game and is very cheap 
8943	1	a	Do you want to shoot T-Rex with RPG? Or slash Stegosaurus with lightsaber? Or rather just casually drive throught hordes of small dinos in a tank? Then look no more as this is game just for you! And i cost just about €0,50 Absolute WINRAR
3237	0	a	I can't play this game. Screen will turn black then crash to desktop upon opening the game.
8945	1	a	This game still has some broken elements, but it is still entirely playable. It just takes some getting used to. Once you do get used to it, it's incredible fun.  it's $1. Go buy it. Why? Because guess what else costs $1?  A McDonaldss happy meal. And IMO McDonalds is disgusting.
3238	0	a	I can't see many problems with this, but it's simply just... Not fun. I tried to get into it but it got very boring very soon. It was also extremely confusing at first and took a lot of questions in chat to understand what I was doing. Thankfully it didn't cost too much. :)
8947	1	a	What happened to this game its one dollar? and yet it is better then some of my 60 dollar games this game deserves more
3239	0	a	this game is still in need of work. i got the game for a dollar so its not a bad deal. just could be better than what it is now and what the game want's to be.
8949	1	a	Best $1 I EVER spent. Must buy, just sell a couple steam cards and buy this.
8951	1	a	This game was awful before but now its more polished and is a lot better. Its worth 1 dollar and even 5 dollars but 10 dollars and above it wont be worth the money it isnt that polished, The community is awful and it was a bit confusing. The graphics are fine and there are less bugs then before.
3240	0	a	Multiplayer game where one team fights as humans and the other team as dinosaurs. The human party has various weapons options and the different dinosaurs has abilities, whether is is flying, jumping, strong attacks or great defensive armor.  The game itself is actually well thought through and the game offers a lot of possibility, but the game is poorly optimized, the server lobby has flaws in connecting to games and several things ingame leaves you frustrated.  It's a game in progress, but they have to do much more work to compete with other games. Still, the game is very cheap and if you don't need insane graphics and flawless optimization, then it's a game for you.  Pros  * Originality * Team based fun * Diversity in characters (Dinosaurs - big, small, flying, crawling) (Human - Recon, Assault, Medic)  Cons  * Game needs optimizing * Glitches * Bad dinosaur models (bad handling leaves you with some of them not able to attack) * Bad landscaping (Getting stuck ingame) 
8953	1	a	BEST AND MOST FUN AND AWESOME DINOSAUR GAME THEIR IS OUT THEIR IN THE MARKET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DINO/10 :D XD
8955	1	a	jet packs, t-rexes, guns, tanks, coop all for less than $1
8957	1	a	A good solid fps game for mp, still playable for my old pc. It has solo play to train yourself before playing in mp.
8959	1	a	Knifed a T-Rex to death. 10/10
8961	1	a	Orion Prelude is probably the game with the best price/quality ratio you will ever buy! 
8963	1	a	What's fun about this game:  1.Killing Dinos!  2. Vehicles and jetpacking!  3. Shooting the T-Rex and jumping to higher ground and laughing at them becaue they can't get you (Unless they throw homing rocks which are easy to dodge with super jumps.)  4. Random Ragdoll physics  The Bad:  1. Getting stuck in random places  2. Dinosaurs clipping through buildings and cheaply killing you  3. Getting stuck on and underneath dinos  4. EXTREME lag at random moments  5. Bad texture pop in  But I do heartly recommend this game, it's only $1 and it's tons of fun with friends! If you had to describe it to someone, I would says it's a mix between Halo and Left 4 Dead. Hopefully with further updating and help from the community we can make this a great game.   It is glitchy, but it is a blast! Give it a try you won't be disapointed with your purchase! :D
8965	1	a	got a mini gun killed 100 raptors in 10 seconds.
8967	1	a	I got stuck in a rock and both of my friends got rekt by a T-Rex. 10/10 would get stuck in a rock again.
3243	0	a	I bought this game because of my love of dinosaurs, and it was only a buck, so I thought, 'Why not?'. I watched all the videos provided above, and they seemed really cool! Until I started the game. Unfortunately, I am not able to join any servers, no matter how hard I try. The closest I have gotten to real gameplay is being on the server list when the game is about to start, and then it just says I have lost connection to the host. I wish I could play this game for hours and hours and recommend it, but with these issues I just can't.
8969	1	a	For 1$ its an absolute steal
8971	1	a	A dumb little romp. Good to play with friends, worth the $1. Devs are a bit shady apparently, but I don't really care. In game purchases, but they are not necessary to enjoy the game.
3244	0	a	Almost as high-quality as E.T for the Atari 2600.  do you like devs who boost reviews on their own games? this is a great start
8973	1	a	9/10 This game is incredible! Dinos 10 times your size all waiting for the chance to tear you to pieces. This is with out a doubt my favorite dinosaur game of all time. If it only had some more boss dinos...
8975	1	a	i got chomped by a T-rex and lay on the ground bleeding my life out.........while the entire team stood around me holding revival kits laughing their asses off and flipping me the bird.  11/10 would play with those guys again
3245	0	a	Why does this game even exist?
8977	1	a	awesome fun gameplay 10/10
8979	1	a	I've played this and the reviews don't lie! This is a super fun game! Anybody that dosen't like this game should burn because they ACTUALLY KNOW HOW TO MAKE A GAME CONSIDERED ONE OF THE WORST GAMES OF ALL TIME INTO ONE THE GREATEST DINOSUAR GAMES OF ALL TIME!
8981	1	a	Very fun and casual game!  All the vehicles are just great and gameplay fun. i will give this game 78/100
8983	1	a	Remembered playing Turok: Dinosaur Hunter. Sucked weenie. Play this. Still suck weenie. 10/10 Will Attempt to Kill Dinosaurs Again
8985	1	a	Great, dumb fun if you have any friends to play with.  Gets old fast though.  Excellent Value for the money
3247	0	a	Terrible game bad animations to much walking to slow for what it is trying to be...
8987	1	a	With how inexpensive this game is, you're a terrible person if you don't buy it for your friends and have a hell of a time.
8989	1	a	this game is alright
8991	1	a	fun game played it when it was a free weekend! 
8993	1	a	Addicting, Fun objective.   Pros:  Fun, Cheap, and Addicting.  Cons: Bad Graphics, Poorly FPS Optimized, Some Items in game require real money, even tho this is a paid game.
3248	0	a	It's freexing to death. I don't know why it's popular.
8995	1	a	This game is surprisingly cheap, surprisingly stupid, and, in fact, surprisingly fun. You basically shoot dinos - there's little more to say.  It's definitely not an AAA title, and it has a few flaws - the main one being that the terrain collision detection can get somewhat wonky around rocks or other structures with sharp angles - but it's undeniably fun to play, and it's definitely a game I will keep coming back to for quite a while yet. For a game that costs 80 pence, what more could you ask for? Go ahead and buy it right now, you won't regret it.  The community, by the way, is rather nice, too. For example, when you need to cap an objective that's ~1km away in survival mode, and there are vehicles on hand, people will almost always wait for everyone to get on before riding away. I have yet to encounter anybody swearing or insulting people.  In short - for this price, I definitely recommend this game.
8997	1	a	Fun. Pure fun. Funniest fun ever. I don't really like dino games, but this one is awesome.  Halo + dinos. Great aesthetics. Co-op and PVP. Tons of action. What else do you want?  I missed only one thing: a small tutorial for beginners. When you click 'play' you see two lines: 'find game' and 'create game'. There could be a third one: 'tutorial'.
8999	1	a	cool some weird glitches not enough people on
9001	1	a	If you enjoy slaughtering dinosaurs and don't mind dishing out a hefty amount of money to do so, this game is an absolute must buy, mainly because it is extremely cheap so you don't have to dish out a lot of money. It's worth every penny I paid.
9003	1	a	Cheap, fun, easily worth your 1$
9005	1	a	It's a little glitchy, but nothing a good update can't fix. Really fun FPS and great for the yonger crowd.
9007	1	a	The best £0.59p I have ever spent.  This game is alot of fun, the maps are pretty huge there is multiple game modes, there's vehicles, many weapons, 3 human classes to choose from, lots of dinos and you can also play as the dinos in some game modes.  And for those of you (like myself) who love achievments this game has plenty of them.  At the end of the day, value for money wise this game is awesome.  10/10. 
9009	1	a	Best dollar game I have ever bought.
9011	1	a	Very very very very very very very..............AWESOME !!!! P.S ITS AWESOME (GET IT NOW OR ELSE!)      (If you like FPS you will like it because it ROCKS!!!)
9013	1	a	Fun game with friends and cool developers. 'Games can't fail only developers' The indie devs ♥♥♥♥♥ing about steam refunds could learn from these amazing developers.
9015	1	a	I bought this game as a joke for 50 cents... i like it.  10/10
9017	1	a	Graphics aren't the best, mechanics are a little glitchy. But the amount of fun I'm having with this game definitely justifies the cost
9019	1	a	Game is super slow on my computer. I have all the needed requirements for ir, but it laggs like crazy. It seems like a fun game, but I can't enjoy playing it because the graphics that are shown are not what I see in the game. Any help for what I can do to get rid of this problem?
9021	1	a	Best Dino game ever!!!! Grab some friends and have fun, or try to beat the wide veriety of levels.
9023	1	a	T-Rex ate my friend  I laughed from a safe distance Then the Rex threw a rock and killed me too  There is no safe distance
9025	1	a	its a little bit laggy but its ok when you restart and refresh the game  
9027	1	a	Very interesting game :)
9029	1	a	best devs ever 10/10 would show up Bohemia Interactive again 
9031	1	a	For 0,79€ you'll have a good game with dinosaurs, robots and lightsaber, what do you want more? 7/10
9033	1	a	Used to be one of the worst games I've ever played. Is still terrible, but now terrible in a 'Star Wars Holiday Special' kind of way. Best to play with friends, probably while highly intoxicated or sleep deprived.   Tip: Buy a magnum, only spend money on upgrades, and have a blast.
9035	1	a	best i ever played in the history of dota
9037	1	a	Very good price-performance ratio.  10/10
9039	1	a	This is my favourite game that i own hands down. I find myself on this for hours every time i blow the dust off my PC. 79p you can not go wrong here :D
9041	1	a	Extremely fun co-op game! Vehicles are fun, its difficult without being annoying!
9043	1	a	Saw this game for 49 cents and it looked fun so i had to get it. It is such a fun game to play with friends and has many different guns/maps/dinos/augments which make it awesome. Hands down best 49 cents I have ever spent :)
9045	1	a	Well you see in mathematics this game can be defined as:  $.99 (Got it on a Steam sale for $.49)+Dinosaurs+360 No Scoping+Multiplayer=Usually Failing and sucky games  This one however, = Amazing  Buy it, it's a buck. Why the hell not!
9047	1	a	Orion is a wonderful game to occupy your time, always promising entertainment for you and your friends. Definately worth the $0.99.
9049	1	a	Good game for the right price!
9051	1	a	Love it. I only have one problem though. I don't know what it might be but sometimes when I open it up, it opens then once the full screen kicks in, it goes black the shows my desktop again. I try to click the icon only doing the same thing. I can hear the unreal and trek sounds then it just stops. I try to reopen it after closing it but it does the same thing. I also do wish I could get a better CPU because it always runs out of CPU power and crashes. That is all. Great game though love it. Bought it for all of my friends.
9053	1	a	Soda at McDonals: $1 5 minutes of enjoyment.  Orion Prelude: $0.5 3-5 hours of enjoyment.   Its a pretty easy choice     Seriously though, this game is better than half the FPSs I play and the devs released it for $1 or less. Thats a damn good deal.
9055	1	a	It's ACEstounding...
9057	1	a	Jurassic Park? More like low budget Jurassic throwdown! ♥♥♥♥ my ratskins, the dinos in this neighborhood won't hesitate to bring unprecedented rainfall and atmospheric pressure to your neck of the woods! You can level up so much I don't see how you'd ever g et bored! Unless you play for 1+ hour at a time am I right? In all seriousness, this game needs hella work but is a solid 7/10. I've had some good tmes with it. Buy it. Buy me. Hilary Clinton. Anal beads. Orion: Prelude. Stegosaurus.  ~♥♥♥♥bad
9059	1	a	Best 1$ spent in my life. I could buy cola for that money and enjoy it for 5 minutes. BUT WHO THE ♥♥♥♥ NEEDS COLA FOR 5 MINUTES WHEN YOU HAVE THIS?! JUST ♥♥♥♥ING BUY THE 4-PACK AND PLAY IT!   Conclusion: Orion:Prelude is better than cola...and GTA V   10\10 Duck enjoyed this game and you will too
9061	1	a	Halo + Dinosaurs? Nothing's better than these combined!
9063	1	a	I fly up 50 feet, look into the landscape with the filthiest, most ♥♥♥♥-looking graphics I've ever seen in my life, and the game proceeds to have a stroke on the floor with foam coming out it's mouth. The game then writes on the floor 'We know the dinos are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the invisible rain gives you a headache from pounding on the plexi-glass you have on your face, but what did you expect for 50 cents?' To which I reply, I expected more foam before you died on the floor.  NeedAnAdvil/10 -My Head
9065	1	a	This game is fun. Pure and simple.
9067	1	a	worth the dollar
9069	1	a	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHspCZRla-0  - Even though I haven't played that much of this game, It's so good and probably one of the best games to play and at such a cheap price. I want my money back plus more because this game is so fun. It's a part of the government or sent by aliens.
9071	1	a	Knifed a T-Rex and a Stegosaurus with just a knife  10/10  Worth the money
9073	1	a	BEST GAME EVER LOVE IT WHEN YOU KILL A TREX IT'S SLOWMOTION
3257	0	a	This game is like the new Jurassic World..... ♥♥♥♥!!!
9075	1	a	BEST GAME EVUR! YOU JUST HAVE TO PLAY IT! IT'S LIKE 1$?? REALLY????? IT FEELS LIKE.. WOAH DUDE, I WOULD HAVE PAYED MUCH MORE FOR THIS INSANE EXPERIENCE! JUST BUY IT, I MEAN WHO CARES ABOUT 1$ FOR SUCH AN INSANE GAME?
9077	1	a	by far the greatest master peice of gaming ever created 11/10 stars
9079	1	a	I thought was a good mofo game like shiee. would have bought it if it was 7+ dollars but im a cheap mother ♥♥♥♥er so i only played it during the free weekend. Maybe when i'll buy it one day when i can afford it.(which will be never this game=2 packs of noodles)
9081	1	a	I'll admit i did buy this game for a dollar, but damn that was a well spent dollar. A wonderful platform to fight TREXs with a lightsaber probably wont hold your attention for long but definatley fun pick it up on sale.
9083	1	a	I launched game for the first time and i joined a random game.. 2 guys were rly good to me now i have 2 more frends bcs this game. Everyone are frendly and want to help you.. Buy this game its amaizing!
9085	1	a	Turned On Game  Started Playing Looked Up  Got Chomped By A T-Rex   100/10 Would Recomend this Game
3258	0	a	this game will constantly lag through out the game 
9087	1	a	It's ight
9089	1	a	YES YES! i like this game so much!!!!
9091	1	a	I think that this game is definietly worth $1 its better than most of my $20 games.
9093	1	a	I DIDN'T TALK TO NOBODY YESTERDAY, I WAS IN THE CAR TAKING A ♥♥♥♥!!!
9095	1	a	Is this a good game? No. Is this a bad game? No. Is this a good game for 1$? Yesyesyesyesyesyes. It's still pretty broken at times, but it's a lot of fun.  What do you do in this game? You shoot dinosaurs. That's it.  Of course, there are upgrades and new weapons, which are awesome. But basically, you shoot dinosaurs. So if you've ever wanted to shoot really mediocre looking dinosaurs with cool guns while flying around with a jetpack / on a chopper, buy this.  Is gud.
9097	1	a	ORION: Dino Horde is by far one of the greatest games I have ever had the plesure to play. It is seemingly genius how the devs immerse you in it's gameplay. For example the loading screens and trailers all show moe or less amazing artwork and gameplay but when you actually play the game it is complete ♥♥♥♥. This gives the player a sense of confusion, similar to how an actual space marine would feel when being told the greatness of war and seeing how it actually is for himself. Another example is the attack animations. When you are being attacked by a dinosaur in real life you won't pay attention to how it moves so in ORION: Dino Horde there aren't any attack animations. Also the iron sights don't really do anything there is an in-game store where you buy various taunts and hats. Just like that game Team Fortress 2! But they did what valve never could do with their game. They not only unbalanced the weapons but made the in-game store even more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that in Team Fortess! Do you see what I'm getting at here? It has some of the most advanced immersion tactics I have ever seen and is a must play 10/10 and I'm totally not being bribed to review this.

9099	1	a	First game I was 'forcefully removed' from a 'NOOB' level server on my very first game. Graphics are dated and not optimized, however the game is fun for 99 cents. I recommend for a dollar nothing more.
3259	0	a	No... Just No
9101	1	a	Glad to see they finally fixed it. Good game.
9103	1	a	This game is soo cool!
9105	1	a	It's a good and cheap game.
9107	1	a	i played beatdown and dang this is way better gonna get it soon as i can :D
9109	1	a	9/10  The graphics and animations bother me. That may be a little harsh, but what harm could an update do? Otherwise the game is absolutely excellent. I love the feeling of being able to fly around on a jetpack while shooting up random extinct animals. I hope Chris Pratt will be proud of me.   Definitely worth the 25 cents.
9111	1	a	Would 4-Pack my friends again.  Two pistols way, way up!
9113	1	a	1.Bought game 2. Was extremly laggy  3. Directions not clear enough dinousuar stuck in toaster 4. Game stops lagging 5. Buy pistol 6. Buy Primary  7. Spend all of my money on this game. Orion :Prelude is love Orion:Prelude is life. 8/10
9115	1	a	Let me start this review off by saying one thing:  I reccomend this game for one thing only, and that is the fact that it costs 1 dollar. If this costed 15 bucks like it used to, I wouldn't reccomend this game. Additionally, I have played this game a bit, and I have enjoyed my time with it. I did start playing when the game was known as ORION: Dino Horde, and this is what I will be partly basing my review on. And finally, I will be avoiding all gamemodes except the dinosaur survival, because it's the only gamemode that is actually unique and fun.  When I first bought this game, I got the four pack for 3.99 and gave it to my friends. We didn't really know what to expect, but we all just jumped right in and played survival.  At first, we all sucked, and we were just fooling around. We only played survival mode and we couldn't even beat it on medium. Nevertheless, we found ourselves laughing and having fun, joking at the audio glitches, the UI bugs, and what became known as 'the reload glitch' (melee while reloading and it instantly fills the clip).  The best part was, the game was still 'In development.' All this stuff would improve! More dinosaurs, maybe new maps, the bugs would get fixed, and the game would be replayability.  This, of course, is where we all were wrong. I believe I have had the game for roughly a year and a half, maybe more. In that time, there has only been ONE major update. Don't be fooled by the video on the store page stating that it has had 60 updates. Most of those updates just changed small things like the main menu layout, or adding in-game purchases for clothing items to add to your character (which is a really lame way to get more money). There was one long hyped update where they changed the name of the game, and the developers stated how they were planning to make sequels to this game. I honestly think that they changed the name so people looking up reviews for 'Dino Beatdown' and 'Dino Horde' would not be associated with this game. Even after the '60 + updates' the game still is riddled with stupid glitches. If you accidentally double click a perk you already bought in the armor upgrades, whoops! Cause the game will just deduct your credits again! I can't tell you how many times either me or my friends have accidentally done this and lost a bunch of money we needed for something else. The shotguns are glitchy, too. if you zoom in after shooting you don't even have to pump it. If you get picked up by a pterodactyl, you can fall in the rocks in the maps and get stuck completely. If you're a support and try to heal yourself while looking at a dinosaur at close range, it won't heal you and it just displays the health of the dinosaur (which it shouldn't do) yet it still drains your energy.   In all this time, they have barely improved anything. From what I recall, all the major things they added are just these strange cartoon-styled multiplayer maps. And no, not the dinosaur survival multiplayer, but the really basic and lame PvP. The PvP just feels forced and it is really boring unless you do it with friends. The new maps they made for dinosaur survival were just reskins of the ones that were already in the game. They haven't added any creative new additions to the game, not that it had much creativity to begin with. The weapons, vehicles, and character designs all seem like a blatant rip-off of Halo, especially the vehicles. The jeep looks and funtions like a Warthog. The Dragonfly looks and functions like a Ghost. The Helicopter REALLY looks like and functions like a Hornet.  But that's not all. The game itself is really, really unbalanced. You get three classes to pick in survival, but the support class is ridiculously overpowered. You get a medic gun that you can use to heal yourself. And because you run faster than all dinosaur types except the giant ones, you pretty much never die. Sure, the assault class gets a jetpack, which you can use to just camp on the rocks and never take damage from raptors, but you can just buy the jump upgrade on support and camp the same way. And finally, the recon class is worthless. It comes with 'camo' which just turns you invisible. This is completely worthless, except when you have to revive someone. Oh, wait: with support you don't have to stand by them and you can just shoot your medic gun at them to revive. There's really no point in buying half the guns, either. One of the pistols is way better than the rest (M40) because it is both high damage, accurate, and fast firing. Most of the primary weapons cost similar amounts, so you never end up buying the weaker ones because you really don't have to. In fact, I usually just save up for the sniper rifle which can kill large boss dinosaurs like the T-Rex in a few hits. Unfortunately, the game is really easy unless you play on hard or higher. However once you play a few hours hard will probably be too easy as well.  The developers have really just not tried with the game. I remember how, in that one large update, they hyped stuff up. 'Oh boy, we're going to add bots to single player! Now you don't need friends to play with others!' What we got were inept AI bots that are programmed to hover around objective that the player is near. They ALWAYS shoot and never melee, even if a dinosaur is in front of their face. They don't even follow you around, they just teleport to you when you go to capture the base objectives. The worst part is that they are programmed to revive you, but it feels like they only go for you if you are within a certain distance of you, so half the time they just ignore me when I go down. 'But we also added weather effects!' All that happens is rain just drips on your visor and the sky turns into fog. It's really disappointing to see the game abandoned like this.  The game isn't all bad though. It is fun to mess around with your friends, especially on some of the larger maps that require you to use the vehicles and have day night cycles. The (small) online community isn't just a bunch of hackers, and I have met some nice people. The graphics are fairly nice for what I'm concerned. The core gameplay is solid, despite having many repeating elements (Same boss dinos spawn on each round on each difficulty every time). I've had some fun with this game.    TL;DR:   When it first came out the bugs were excusable, but it's been over a year and the developers haven't improved their poor game design decisions, fixed some unbalanced gameplay like the classes, or added any decent or unique content to improve the game. Feels like they abandoned the game and are just trying to get as much money they can out of it. Only worth buying because it costs one dollar and it is fun to play with friends.  
9117	1	a	oy mate this game is pretty yeet
9119	1	a	What you will hear while doing combos: Double kill Triple kill Mega kill Kill us all Armageddon BRING ME SOME PIZZA
9121	1	a	'Monster Kill' x8 bonus from overlap instakill melee on 99+ raptors at one time.  10/10
9123	1	a	6/10  +its a $1 +Gamemodes +Workshop +Coop +Maps are very interactive +driveable vehicles -Specs need to be high in order to play
9125	1	a	This game is very original mixing with prehistoric technology also has good controls and excellent gameplay, I really like the idea of putting dinosaurs as enemies and gives it a more interesting touch to the game.  8/10 Good game but lacks some to be a great game.  LolerMan
9127	1	a	Work in Progress, only 3 classes and lots of game modes. I would hope that it continues to update things like more classes, perhaps a mmo server for the entire game, maybe even unlockable vehicles. But 1 thing is for sure... Melee (except the Ion Blade) is SUPER OVER POWERED, example: I joined some guy's server at round 6, by the time we won on round 12 or so in survival i had gotten 204 cryo melee kills and their best person with guns got 83..... liek... dafuq??? plz nerf, needs to be more realistic.
9129	1	a	This version of the game is a good buy for only €0.99! Lots of fun if you like a lot of shooting and dino's.   Only con i can think of is the server size with only 5 players. I think it would be a lot more fun with at least 10 or more ppl.  8/10 - MNN
9131	1	a	got the game as a gift. i spent an hour killing dinosuars, and yelling turok was a ♥♥♥♥♥ at people and then i was kicked from the server. best hour ever spent in a game
9133	1	a	wow BEST GAME FOR $1 I HAVE EVER PLAYED. so worth it. i have played this more than CS;GO
9135	1	a	why am i able to write a review for this? i dont even own it.
9137	1	a	This is game is incredibly fun! Best Dollar I have spent in a long time.    10/10
9139	1	a	I gave it a try and I liked it :)
9141	1	a	lol i get this free somehow
3262	0	a	This game has so much potential o be a fun time-waster. It's inexpensive, it has a fun premise, and it's got a motha-♥♥♥♥in' T-Rex in it.   But it's just awful gameplay wise. The frame skip and lag levels are UNBELIEVABLE and it is utterly unplayable. I tried re-installing it twice and setting the graphics to the absolute minimum to make sure that I could run it smoothly, but it was still impossible to play effectively.   Once (if ever) these issues with lag and frame skipping get fixed, this game will be so much fun. I only hope it does happen, because I'm ready to start gunning down dinosaurs.
9143	1	a	well ♥♥♥♥ i guess i should give it a second chance
9145	1	a	Get Paid  Get Gunsaid  Rek Dinosauraid  360 no scopeaid  buy for friends play co-opaid 
9147	1	a	One of the great game i love lmao
9149	1	a	i recomend this game dude lie seriously might have not the best graphics but i recomend u try it
3263	0	a	Mutliplayer is garbage, riddled with bugs, no lan support, and dedicated servers are near impossible to set up for private lobbies
9151	1	a	I still want my Money back you f*ckers :(
9153	1	a	Awesome..... enough said 
3264	0	a	you frekin crashed my computer with your frekien bugs
9155	1	a	For how cheap the game is it can provide fun with or without friends. Blowing up dinosaurs is probably one of the best things you could want to do with friends online.
9157	1	a	this is one of the best cheapest games ever but i still like tf2 but orion dino horde i mean dino beatdown I MEAN prelude they change names allot for some reason but i like it buy the game for 1 dolar you get 20.000 free orion moneyz and the graphics are better than freaking tf2 but the only problem that holds is the bugs but even if they have bugs its okay they will fix it sooner or later its not permanent about the bugs almost like magicka that has like a few bugs but evrything is perfect 9.5/10!
9159	1	a	It's actually pretty good for I bought it for 50p but that's at a sale I think normal price is at 75p but a really goof game if you like hunting dinosaurs, only problem is that using workshop maps is confusing but I figured it out so yeah I RECOMMEND THIS GAME very highly.
9161	1	a	Random dude -Why should you buy the game?   Me -NO QUESTIONS JUST ♥♥♥♥ING BUY THE GAME ALREADY, geez.
9163	1	a	Awesome game and it's really cheap!
9165	1	a	so much fun for only 0,99 cents
9167	1	a	If you can run it on your computer, definitely get it! It's definitely worth more than $1, so I don't see why people wouldn't want to get this game
9169	1	a	First playthrough: Started off with a basic pistol, killed a compy and felt pretty successful, but then got stomped by a stegosaurus. Realised everyone was using bigger guns so I decided to get one for myself. Was about to buy a cheap assault rifle when a teammate came into the weapons area, started throwing credits into my face and said 'I'm about to make it rain, ♥♥♥♥♥'. This was enough credits to buy all the best weapons and perks. After the wave ended, another teammate made me fly the hover jet thing while he stood on top of it shooting t-rexs' with a compound bow, rocket launcher and grenade launcher. 10/10 - I have never felt more manlier in my life.
9171	1	a	Im sorry but, this is problay 1 of the best game in my entire life, before, people said it was so bugged and glitchy, and now they transformed it to something so awesome, I can never stop playing! Add more updates too ! :D
9173	1	a	awesome game great for its price and just an amazing game that you could enjoy with a bowl of pop corn or nice cold chocolate milk co-op is awesome and over all the game it self is outstanding
9175	1	a	1. Buy Ori and the Blind Forest 2. Play Ori and the Blind Forest 3. Sell Ori and the Blind Forest digital trading cards to little kids. 4. Buy Orion: Dino Horde with said little kid money. 5. Go back to playing Ori and the Blind Forest  50 cent hustles are what's really real XD
3265	0	a	Good game. Highly recommended to play it with friends. The reason I didn't give a recommend to this game is because it's poorly optimized. If you can get past it, it's a really damn enjoyable Co-op game!
9177	1	a	Ok first this game if one of the best ive ever seen, like for 1$ are you kidding me ? Seriously i would pay more than 5$ for this, this is a great game but i am about to say all of its bad things, and it might make you want to not buy it, so here i go:  Bad Things:  Ghaphics : It is ok not that broken, but it dosent reach my standards, with is very low.  Difficulty: You are rather over powered as hell and it is at the state witch is not fun any more, or you get beaten by a T-rex every freaking time you spawn.  Vehicles: It is acually ok, but the shooting on the cars and tanks are broken. And never drive a heli it is 100% broken, and one time it even killed me.  Dinos: Most of them are fine exept the birds, thy are always broken to shoot or kill.  And thats pretty much it, but there are lots more that i havent said, so yea...
9179	1	a	This is a good game 
9181	1	a	I havent smoked anything in my life EVER but i sohuld start now because this game already gave me cancer, Fun cancer. 10/10 - 'dont do drugs kids'
3266	0	a	this game is lagging alot
9183	1	a	This game has no story behind it, no special features and no complex things to perform.  Yet, surprisingly, once you get the hang of it, it's really fun, especially when playing with other people. And what makes it better, is that you can play as a noob or as a seasoned player, the result is still fun.  Plus it's really really cheap. For the money it's asking, it's worth it.
9185	1	a	played this back when it was '♥♥♥♥' i have to say i enjoyed because it was one of those games that are soo bad that they are good, played it with one of my friends, having a good time. i really didnt care about this game back then, i though it was going to stay like that forever, i thought that the devs would just let it die, but turns out these guys are some stuborn mofos and i really think we need more devs like them.  keep up the good work guys this game is worth waay more than 99 cents.
9187	1	a	'Rain sound xfects 10/10, nxt gen af'
9189	1	a	The game itself is a little buggy and weird, and there are some flaws in some of the maps (getting stuck in various places), but it's overall pretty enjoyable. Animations leave a bit to be desired. But overall, you certainly can't go wrong for the price. 7/10
9191	1	a	This game is literally only fun with friends and not really strangers. It's really dumb but really fun when you get into a certain groove. Hopefully it picks up more traction in the coming months and gets expanded upon because as it is, this game is mostly a horde-mode class-based dino shooter. Don't come into this game expecting Call of Duty or Battlefield levels of refined gunplay. Come into this game expecting to be entertained with friends. Best if played in conjunction with a skype group chat, from my experience. There are like 9 guns and 3 types of dinosaurs, and to totally throw that off balance, there's mechs and vehicles and gigantic levels that require you jumping from base to base.  So I'd recommend getting this game during a mad crazy sale and only if your friends have it. The potential for fun, while bottle-necked, is pretty vast, I suppose.
9193	1	a	If you like would like to shoot dinos in an fps this game is for you

3270	0	a	This game sucks. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! 0/10
9197	1	a	'Jurassic park theme'
9199	1	a	Really enjoyed this game. It has a good idea with dinosaurs!
9201	1	a	I have just played this twice with a few mates in Co-Op Quite enjoyed it and wanna get into it some more
9203	1	a	♥♥♥♥boys have everything for less
9205	1	a	A fast-paced, straightforward, fun game where the only thing you need to do is take down dinosaurs. Graphics aren't cutting-edge, but doesn't at all detract from the overall experience. Dramatic soundtrack, hectic gameplay rhythm and simple Halo-like reminiscence add up to a great time-killer with or without friends.
9207	1	a	it's fun and very idicting  it has good graphics it cost's only a .99
9209	1	a	totally worth it
9211	1	a	Dinosaurs, jetpacks, guns, Redikulous cosmedics...  What's not to love?    Actual Review
3272	0	a	I rate this game 2/5 Nearly Ok but it's actuallly bad.  Sure this game is cheap. Sure this game is fairly free. Yes the online community is friendly. The graphics are okay. But this game is also extremely repetitive and it lacks any great music or sound effects or anything to really keep me interested. You Hunt dinosaurs on alien planets with futuristic weaponry. The dinosaurs die (mostly) and wave after wave of them come at you. There are some other game modes but in my opinion they all lack challenge and are variations on an underlying theme of repetitive gameplay leading to boredom. This might be a lot more fun if you know someone else who is really into this game and wants to play it with you but I know no such person.
9213	1	a	A decent game with a great community. Definitely worth the buy.
3274	0	a	This game literally sucks. Objectives are stupid the graphics are awful and again and again the same dinosaurs
9215	1	a	A fast-pace co-op FPS. Can't praise graphics, but it's not what this game is about, the picture is just about what is needed to keep on going. The action, however, is AWESO-O-O-O-ME!
9217	1	a	This game is Superb! 10/11
9219	1	a	Got a graphics card, great horde game
9221	1	a	This is the best bame evvuurrrr!!!! My and my clan for cod play this game everyday in hopes for Chop Suey to come out with a new song. Kelpy G inspired me to start making reviews for game like this one. So that is my review for Orion Prelueds, like this video and subscribe to my youtube,  https://www.youtube.com/user/JonDrinksWater  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Also listen to my mixtape which includes classics like, 'It's Me,' 'I Hope You Die In Fire,' and the Frozen soundtrack!!!
9223	1	a	This game is one of the best FPS's i've played in awhile. Lots of destruction and mayhem and lots of cool weapons and vehicles. It's a lot of fun and it can keep you entertained for hours.
9225	1	a	Straight up, good fun. Shoot dinos, cry over a T-rex tossing your beautiful buggy into a cliff before opening you up like a can of tuna. Place revenge on said T-rex with a turret and your entire rocket supply. Alot of fun, best with friends. For $1, just get the 4 pack bundle and bring people with you. You wont regret it.
9227	1	a	Started playing and fought many small dinos. FUN until the triceratops. Got stomped and died and lost my awsome bow. 11/10 would get stomped and lose bow again!
9229	1	a	A friend bought this game for me and two other friends.  Within 5 minutes we had our first hard crash.  10/10 IGN
9231	1	a	Need moar Playars
9233	1	a	you've lost connection to the host you've lost connection to the host you've lost connection to the host you've lost connection to the host you've lost connection to the host you've lost connection to the host you've lost connection to the host you've lost connection to the host you've lost connection to the host great game 10/10
9235	1	a	Do not buy this game.  It may be 1 dollar but the cost of Chemotherapy isn't worth it. 
9237	1	a	This game is super satisfying.   for maximum fun only play with the knife and never get any guns. totally worth it because the struggle is amazing.
9239	1	a	Great gaem , would shoot dinos again
9241	1	a	10/10  good for 2012 Game , Would play w friends
9243	1	a	'vrooom vroon' - the sound of the hexagon makes as you dreive out of the garage. you take a left turn, then a right, bulling onto the main road you know so well. you join the same traffic queue you always do, changing a lane here, making a mistake on the changing of the lane there. n ot a big mistake though. you come off of the road at the exit and get into the work area. where your office is. 'hello' you say to no one in particular. orion prelude is a video game where you shoot dinosaurs a lot and have an exist until you die from a dinosaur byte. there is a building you can climb which reminds me of other struggles in my life also.
3276	0	a	I really don't know... I feel like it was better as Dino Horde than this. I'm sorry, but this change made me stop playing the game entirely.
3277	0	a	Amidst the plethora of multiplayer dinosaur games released around the same time as this one, came ORION: Prelude, previously going by a different name I can't remember.   Frankly, I found this game to be a waste of what short time I spent on it and the $1 that I spent on it as well. It is un-original, has some of the quirkiest physics and game mechanics I have ever seen, and in general just really fails to deliver an enjoyable experience outside of the initial learning phase. There isn't anything unique or fun about this game and it really ended up being $1 I would rather have bought candy at a gas station with.  The game got boring quick, with nothing different than any of the other dinosaur games really, and seems to have a fanbase with similar personalities to the people who drool over Nazi Zombies in the latest Treyarch Call of Duty release. The developers seem to be having fun with it, which is good, but I honestly don't see a reason to promote them for this game in the slightest. They delivered a fairly buggy, un-original title amongst a sea of the same genre.  I would not recommend this game, even given its extremely low price point.
9245	1	a	BEST GAMES OF ALL TIME (MY OPINION)  1)TF2 2)ORION: Prelude 3)Super Mario Bros For The NES  I Love This Game
9247	1	a	If you don't buy this game, you're probably a dino. And we do bad things to dinos so you better change your mind about buying the game.
9249	1	a	Dont 40 hours from this game, but for 3 dollars, the four pack is worth the money, buy it for you and three friends, its pretty fun.
9251	1	a	Pretty fun game definately worth one dollar
9253	1	a	This is an awsome game where you kill dinos. First lets get to the problems. A whole lot of bugs to do with walls + lag. they can be good and bad depends on the situation. This game overall feels like your playing halo, but killing dinos. there are cars that you can drive, upgrades, lots of weapons and tones of stuff to do. This game goes on sale all the time for only 0.99$ each and 2.99$ for a 4 pack totally worth it. Again some problems, but the game is great and even better with friends. It's worth it if you can get it on sale
9255	1	a	Absolutly love this game! I've had the best fun with this. definately recommend getting this game
9257	1	a	One of the most enjoyable silly games around imo. great survival game tho i wouldnt bother with other modes tbh. 8/10
3279	0	a	Gets very tedious very quickly. Even with friends the game isn't nearly as fun as games such as a Left 4 Dead or any other Multiplayer Shooter Siege-Survival. If you need a budget game there are many others but this one has ill-defined objectives, very basic gun selections, and a broken health system (where you can be fully healthy for a few rounds then instantly die to a small mob of dinosaurs which are impossible to hit).
9259	1	a	When you look past the terrible game connections and the horrible servers. This game is actually amazing. I don't think I've ever had so much fun just by getting eaten by a T-Rex. Everyone is usually really good when it comes to teamwork and as for the weapons and armor, it's all pretty simple. Grant you I haven't been in a game long enough to complete a match (connection) but hopefully after the whole connection bug is fixed, this game will be a pure diamond in the ring. [7/10]
3280	0	a	Game no workie. Tried the only 'fix' posted on the Steam forums; got as far as splash screen. Worst part is it makes my computer practically unusable until I manage to forcible end the various processes associated with the game. I want my time and $.50 back.
9261	1	a	ITS THE BEST GAME EVER
9263	1	a	Worth the 0.39 euros !
3281	0	a	lets just say that i play 1 min and then i just used idle master on this...
9265	1	a	One of the coolest most cheapest game i have ever owned!
9267	1	a	Okay so this game... -Not realistic -Terrible Graphics -Stupid AI -Overall crappiness BUT HOLY CRAP IS FUN! Its like eating Nutella from the tub, you know its stupid and frowned upon, BUT YOU CAN'T STOP!  seriously tho, its worth like 1 dollar or 50 cents, because its a blast to play, Heres an example: Me and ma friend we be riding in da hood in my warthog *ahem* turret-car, and we got the WHOLE server on this car, then the friend I was playing with got picked up by a pterodactyl and gets dropped into a T-Rex Overall 7.5/10 xD
3282	0	a	Uhh... No.
9269	1	a	This is an amazing game, it is so unbalanced and glorious. I reccomend this game to anyone and everyone! Dinosaurs, jetpacks, infinite ammo bows.... what is not to love!
9271	1	a	You can play as a tiny dino with tnt strapped to its back and detonate it on will 54/10 would compy suicide bomb again
3284	0	a	Gets boring very fast.
9273	1	a	Do you have friends?  .....No, I mean real friends?  No? Okay, then don't play this game.  Orion is a pathetic excuse for a game. Good enough to be worth .99 cents, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ enough to be worth anything more. Unless you're 9 years old and your room is still covered in dinosaur wallpaper, I would avoid this game all together.  (That is, unless you're a filthy achievement ♥♥♥♥♥ that gets off on the idea of wasting hours of your time compiling meaningless accomplishments on a computer, if so, please get help as soon as you can. You seriously have a problem and you need to get a job or something)  Orion: Prelude is a game. That's pretty much all I can say. It doesn't offer anything outside the established norm of a FPS besides 'OH BOY HERE I GO KILLING DINOSAURS AGAIN!'. Turok did it. Dino D-day did it. ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ing the ♥♥♥♥ing hunting genre did it. The only difference between Orion and the rest of the crowd is the 'horde mode' it emphasizes. Orion is, in itself, a 'friend game'. If you don't have friends who enjoy stupid, silly, ridiculous and down-right ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (Yeah, I said it, so what want to fight about it?) games, then don't buy this.   This game is best enjoyed after knocking back a couple brews, smoking a few bowls and releasing all of your pent up daddy issues. It's a nut-less shooter with the brain the size of a walnut. Given the state of the FPS genre now, I'm sure this game must appeal to the majority. 'BUT NOT ME DAMMIT, I'M SOPHISTICATED'; you say. Ha, how cute, you must think playing CS:GO makes you bourgeoise. Bah! I say! Bah! Orion is nothing special and neither are you. What makes it special is the company you enjoy playing this game. That being said, lesbian honest, isn't that all of life? Get friends, get drunk and or high and play this game. If you are sober, avoid this game entirely.    Pros:  +Perfect game to nut around in +Graphics aren't bad +MOM! MOM! LOOK! A T-REX! + Life will.....uh...find a way. +There's a warthog +Great game to play with friends    Cons:  -Hats -Seriously, why hats? -Other game modes (specifically conquest) look like the result of combining two VTD student's art portfolios. ( what I mean by that is the textures don't match, you uncultured philistine, jesus how are your parents not ashamed of you?) -Wonky controls.  -No single player value. -Wtf who would pay 5 dollars for a hat in a .99 cent game? You're not TF2, Orion. -There's not much to offer in the game besides the peanut-butter horde mode. -Too many cards. -Absolutely does not diverge from any different from the traditional FPS standard. -Flavor of the month game. Give it two weeks and you'll get bored and move on. Maybe you'll come back to it in another 3 months.   My Dinosaur Book Report: 6 stegosauruses/10 apatosauruses
9275	1	a	but shiiiit it was only 99c
9277	1	a	The best $1.50 I've ever spent on steam. This game went threw some major updates from when I originally watched a friend play it. Literally 'Watching a heroine addict turn into a successful banker' kind of updates, this has got to be the best multi-player wave shooter for your money on steam! I'd recommend this to any one and their family members, and even to family pets.
9279	1	a	My boy DJ Roomba bought me this game for Halloween. He is super cool for that. We play it on the daily and I would definitely recommend this to all of my friends.
9281	1	a	Definately a fun game, it looks and feels like Halo mixed with CoD and dinosaurs. I really enjoy it just for the first person shooter vs dino's. Sadly though due to my pc's specs I can not run the game very well. So there is nothing negative I have to say about this game.
9283	1	a	This game is loads of fun! I bought it last night before I went to bed so I could try it in the morning. I ended up trying it that night And was on it for 2 hours!
3286	0	a	Bought this game to play with a friend and when I entered the match, it just keeped rotating non-stop, I restarted the game, restarted steam and the pc, and it was still rotating when I entered any match...
9285	1	a	Great game! Got hooked on my first game! If you like team based shoot em ups or fps games then you're getting way MORE than your money's worth with this game. The graphics are okay, gameplay is solid, the upgrade system is interesting. This game is good if you want to burn some steam off!
9287	1	a	The baby dinosaur of Unreal Tournament and Battlefield. Would get chomped again.
9289	1	a	Great game for 99 cents. Get one, buy one or two for your friends, and have fun!
3287	0	a	I should be able to run this, but I'm very,very laggy, lowest settings
9291	1	a	10/10, I love it. What isn't there to love? Dinosaurs, guns, money, more guns, jet packs, cloaking devices, and much much more!
9293	1	a	bought the game for 69p since the release. now it costs 79p. played it, lags like mad because my pc cant handle a smashing game with bad graphics. uninstalled it since it lags. lag is lag. money is lag. it was worth it..
9295	1	a	Exploded a car into the wall and got an achivement for that. 10/10
9297	1	a	Ok so heres what happened i played orion and i was going to buy the sword and also in survival then i ran inside a rock fell through the map and like an hour later....................................................................................................I DIED...
9299	1	a	nobody is playing this game again!
9301	1	a	Why don't you own this?
9303	1	a	I'll put this simple: 12/10 Would fly a VTOL right on T-Rex's face again.
9305	1	a	actually really good
3289	0	a	This game used to be my favorite but now with all it's updates and stuff it just went down. Yet now it appears to have more lag and Framerate issues. The gameplay is fun but hard to enjoy. So I would not recommend it at the moment
9307	1	a	It's an alright game for what it's worth don't get me wrong. However it gets repetitive and the jetpack makes the other classes overpowered. 6/10.
9309	1	a	Can Be Extreamly glitchy, overall a good game
9311	1	a	For me this game has alot of potential!!!!!! For me i thing there could be more options with weapons and armor but overall the game was worth it to me
9313	1	a	Now, ignore the negative reviews, this game is a huge stea when you compare it to cs:go skins 'oh my gun looks cooler than norma, it was $10 and tracks stats' Nah, i could buy 13 copies of this game with that money( 3 4-packs 1 normal) so this game no matter how 'bad' it is because of 'ai' it's still killing dinosaurs with miniguns
9315	1	a	While killing dinosaurs i saw a T-Rex Tea Baging a dead teammate started laughing the T-Rex saw me and killed me with a rock.  11/10 would laugh again
9317	1	a	Very fun and tactical game. Many diffrent things to do from killing dinos, buying guns, buying perks, driving cars, flying planes, controlling mech suits, being dinosaurs and KILLING MORE DINOS!
9319	1	a	Its a fairly simple but fun coop game.  You level up your weapons and class the more you play so it gets easier with time, however higher difficulty levels Do seem to require you do have a high level character too or you will get insta chomped by dinos.  Great price, great fun and it will last you until you get sick of blasting dinos with lasers.
3293	0	a	If your friends own this game somehow, mayb- Nevermind, don't buy this game. Even though it's cheap, don't spend your precious time with this. Unfortunately unsuccessful.
9321	1	a	I loved This Game 10/10 you guys did AWESOME on this.
9323	1	a	Whilst flying a helicopter with my friend he jumps out and lands on a T-rex instantly killing both of them.   10/10 would fly with friend again
3294	0	a	It's bad. This game is honestly one of the worst games i've ever played, i only payed $1.50 for it and i'm regretting my decision. Just please don't buy this game.
9325	1	a	my game is very slow/laggy friend me if u know how to fix it plz. i can't realy tell what is wrong 
3295	0	a	Wtf how can I write this review while I don't even own this game. Silly steam.
9327	1	a	This game taught me how to survive the impending dino apocalypse.
3296	0	a	The FPS is horrible, and i thought after having this game for a few years and attempting to come back they would have atleast fixed the fps. no its not my computer, i have a gaming computer, its the servers zzz
9329	1	a	Great game 1000000/10
9331	1	a	ORION:Prelude is a fun dino fps game similar to ARK: survival evolved but instead of taming dino's in a safe humane way you just blast their heads off with a 12 gauge shotgun. it has it's bugs, like the dragonflies constant spassing out, and my character glitching into rocks but those just add to the fun of orioni can tell you now like most first timers i tried to take on a t-rex by myself and it ended up with my 20,000 credit bow and 15,000 credit flamethrower being eaten never to be seen again, but that was really fun. GOOD JOB GM'S.  10000/10
9333	1	a	I don't know what to do. I'm addicted to this game. I play 8 hours a day, and I've been fired from my job because of it. My girlfriend left me even after being engaged from my addiction, because the game would get me so frustrated I would take it out on her. I have 1600 hours in Orion combined from my alts, from less than 6 months.Everytime I finish an Orion game, win or not, I tear up a little at myself and cry or grieve my life as it is right now. I have no more friends, the only friends that I had hate me now because of how I act during Orion and how seriously I take it, wasting my life on it. I celebrated Christmas alone this year, as my mother and father reject me in favor of my more successful siblings who have also rejected me. I have a Master's Degree in Engineering from MIT, and I'm sitting at home, playing Orion and weeping of the things I lost.
9335	1	a	Very Underrated game.
3298	0	a	Bought this game for laughs tried to get a refund and have not got a refund yet. (P.S THIS GAME IS TERRIBLE)
9337	1	a	Hey For a dollar this game isnt that bad its not great but not bad
9339	1	a	A very good game compared to the price  Full of Dinosaurs, jetpacks, vehicles, skills and weapons stuffed in maps with future tech
9341	1	a	Awesome use of 1€. May require a bit better pc than my schoolcomputer but still looks and sounds awesome!
9343	1	a	Dinos and Shooter Very good game for this price. I only can recommend this game!
9345	1	a	
9347	1	a	cheap fun great way to burn a few hours
9349	1	a	holy ♥♥♥♥ i like this game worth his prize over nine thousand man, is just a meme itself
9351	1	a	like killing floor but a lot cheaper and with dinosaurs, vehicles (jeep, tank, mech suit, helicopter thing), jetpacks, more game modes, some hilarious collision physics, more bugs, and more fun. buy it 100%
3301	0	a	I'm happy I only bought this game for 55 cents. It wasnt worth it. Not only can you make dinosaurs fly, but you can also be sent flying by them. Unoptomized too, It sucks to play, I probably damaged my eyes.
9353	1	a	Gameplay is fine not hard to master, controls are good,  the game is great tho i havent been playing the game that much to say, the game is relaxing and it doesnt give you the hard diehard tryout  i would say  -Teamgame on higher difficulties - Squad controls  -Fine to give each other money or credits to combine weapon damage -Having vehicles to shoot with( Tank, Titan, Hovercraft etc.) -Difficult game modes, team deathmatch king off the hill waves etc   the game is worth ur 1 euro and the game woould evenly be worth to buy it for 10 euros if u buy it trust me you wont be disappointed
9355	1	a	but ♥♥♥♥ it was 99 cents
9357	1	a	I actually quite like this game! The game is a really fun experience for 50c on sale, allthough I do have some critisism to this game, even though it is practically free.   1. Like many games that are quite generic, like this one (wheter you like it or not) it needs something more special to it. One thing that I myself liked (at least in survival mode) is the jetpack feature for the assault. Whilst if you time your jetpacks right you will be able to pick up speed and travel further, but I would like this to be a bigger feature. something available for all classes. I would also try to make it so that the speeds that you'd be able to pick up where to be higher, so that a good player would basically be able to fly across the map with incredible speed!   2. The dinos AI isn't really the best, it basically just runs for you and if theres something in the way. It may struggle (this isn't all the time but it has happened).   3. Bots, the bots are well programmed, but I do think it's a bit sad though that they will not revive you most of the time, which is something I would like. because it would prolong the gametime and would make everything a more enjoyable experience.   these are just some points that I noticed whilst playing the game, but I have mostly played with bots and with the normal game mode. I really do consider this game a great game to play on a lan party and I will certanly be playing on the LAN parties that I am holding with a fairly consistent time span onbetween. I also wouldn't say no to a sponsor from the creator to get a couple of keys to give away to people of the LAN parties!   I would give this game a 7/10 a great game for the money and it has lots of potential!
9359	1	a	Pretty darn good, and only cost pocket change. Thanks to my buddy for gifting it to me.  The cash shop seems to be ALL COSMETICS, so no pay2win. Very happy about this.   You cannot go wrong with this game.
9361	1	a	Good game but it has some fps issues.
9363	1	a	I can afford this game with the coins under my sofa.  420/420 NGI
9365	1	a	Writing a recommendation for this game because after the things it has gone through up to this date, it certainly deserves one.  If you're not one to hold grudges against developers for making some 'mistakes' in the past, you can take it from me that the metacritic score is no longer valid.. if it ever even was. The game speaks for itself but to put it in another perspective, it's basically Killing Floor except with dinosaurs. Furthermore there's a dozen of gamemodes including team PvP and Free-for-all be they with or without dinosaurs.  The game does have an in-game store utilizing real currency but it's purely vanity and cosmetics so it shouldn't bother anyone really. With the amount of great updates the game has received, it has definitely become a much more fun game. Whether it's worth full price comes down to personal opinion if you're into this type of game or not. Regardless, it's definitely worth taking a (new) look at.
9367	1	a	for the price its asking for this game is honestly good fun if you play it with friends, there are lots of weapon types and abilites most of which stand out from eachother and lots of percs and upgrades.  I think the devs are almsot under selling the game, its not perfect thats true but its not a game i cant say i regret buying 3 copies for me and my friends to play. just dont go in with high expectations and play with friends and fun will be had. : D
9369	1	a	the best game in the world
9371	1	a	I got it for free
9373	1	a	Pretty great but stay out of the heli-planes if you want to keep things interesting. Love the massive dino fights.
9375	1	a	If you dont have money for ARK: Surivival Evolved this is great game for you
9377	1	a	Haha.  Got a 4 pack for 0.75€.  It's fun for a round but I can't play it much longer.^^  You can buy it in a sale tho.
9379	1	a	10/10 would waste 99 cents again
9381	1	a	I was just supposed to test the game and see how it ran then quit after a few minutes.... I played 86 minutes by mistake.... I first played this back a few years ago when it first came out and was called 'Dino Beat Down', I hated it. It was boring and glitchy and ran like crap. But now, it isn't so bad. It still has glitches (The hover bike makes me lol), and I don't really like the default third person running animations with the pistol (they need to put the gun up by their head or down low instead of always pointing it out forward, they should only point it forward when you shoot), but overall the game is REALLY fun.  It is like Halo, actually, it is a whole lot like Halo. The jeep and the tank looks like it pretty much was ripped out of Halo, but the Dino defense and survival is actually really fun. I can honestly say I like this more than the original Halo and Halo 2 (Those were the only two I played. Let's face it, Halo was over-hyped poop... don't hate me).   Overall, the game has its flaws but it is really fun to play. I also play Killing Floor and I played Killing Floor 2, and so far I can say that I enjoy this just as much since it operates on a similar survival mechanic. Since the game is so cheap, I highly recommend you give it a try, it's worth the buy
9383	1	a	is a rilly fun game
3308	0	a	Terrible game, do not purshase. BUGs, bad gameplay and historyless.
9385	1	a	Co-op dinosaur wave clearing. We bought a four pack for 80 cents and had a blast playing it.
9387	1	a	Got stuck between stones while climbing a mountain. Had to ALT + F4 out of the game   -would play again
3309	0	a	Servers are crap, it's always laggy, no tutorial ( so I was pretty much lost), and worst of all i bought so I could play it later, it passes by the return date, i play, and it's bad. These are just my thoughts, if you had a blast with the game, good for you, but these are my thoughts, so I could care less
9389	1	a	cheap.. im mean....
9391	1	a	This game is awesome, 50 cent for 4 copies? WHAT!?  Do the developers even eat? Are they even real?  Buy 4 copies of this game, play with some friend who have a wooden pc/ laptop and awesomeness gonna happen.  Aside from that, the game is actually not bad. I thougt that this game is really cheap because it is s***ty. But i played it a little bit and i had a good time.
3311	0	a	'In 2012 we released one of the worst games of all time'                         Still sucks 
9393	1	a	Would r8 gr8, wad fun with friends but could do with some work.
9395	1	a	High Quality Graphics and cooll gampeplay and also Hardy Cheese Lemon Hard  10/10
9397	1	a	Game is very cheap and is fun and works well for its price!
3312	0	a	this game is not fun
9399	1	a	Fun for 50cents. Need graphics card and even then a bit laggy.
9401	1	a	Great banter, 10/10. Actually, you'll probably only have fun with some buddies in this but ♥♥♥♥ it.
9403	1	a	This game looks like it was some computer geniuses response to 'Well, Why don't you make own game if everything else sucks right now?'  So, they made it in a garage and molded it into an awesome Halo/KF2/bored group of friends/Dino-genocidists 'special' dream.  It plays well. Buy it. Do it now.
3313	0	a	(Pukes)   I hate this game. It is so laggy even tho it looks crappy. Ive been playing on lowest settings and I got like 2 frames more. And the gameplay doesnt even make any sense. You are a Halo guy that needs to survive hordes of dinosaurs. Wtf im outta here
9405	1	a	Only been playing the two modes Survival and Conquest. I personally like this game but i wont brag about it, simple and nice gameplay with 3 characters you level up. For the small price you get allot of game with the unreal engine.
9407	1	a	Frickin' sweet. Six Words: Best Halo instant kill melee simulator.
9409	1	a	Nice game :)
9411	1	a	Monster Hunter meets Halo for $0.99? Yes please.
9413	1	a	I must say, this is a well constructed game with half-active servers even three years after publication. I would recommend Orion to anyone looking for a solid FPS PvE game. My only complaint is that sometimes there are glitches, other than that great game!!
9415	1	a	Pick it up with some friends if it is cheap, interesting wave suvival fun.
9417	1	a	cool cool.
9419	1	a	Great game for 82 cents a 4-pack. Bought this for all my friends.
9421	1	a	cool game
9423	1	a	This is a steal. Probobly you will have more fun with this game than SOME 20$ games. This used to be a terrible game but now its awsome, less glitches, bugs.... Please get this its really fun
9425	1	a	Recon best class 2016
9427	1	a	This is a really really good game, very friendly for most pcs, can run on mostly anything, has really good content, i love it. Havent played a lot, but from the little i have i really did enjoy it.
9429	1	a	First off, let me just say that this game is unique from alot of other titles out their. You get to play in some power armor from the original Fallout and fight of dinosaurs. What more could a man want from a game?
9431	1	a	5 player co-op online, massive weapons, dinosaurs, drive-able vehicles, tanks etc. 9/11 1.2 hours played so far and I really enjoy it.  Oh.. And also, it only costs 0,99€. That's amazing. The 4-Pack is pay for 3, get 4. And also, devs doesn't bash their community. And now there's a sequel. Going for that soon.
9433	1	a	Being a badass and going all in toward a trex with a lightsaber.(true description of the game)  1999/10 highly recommended
9435	1	a	0.99 $ for this. Just get it and see what u can get for only 1 dollar this game is atleast worth 15.
9437	1	a	Wait, I played this game?
9439	1	a	very good  Update :  Well looking back when I bought it it was just a better than average early access game. NOW it's the best value for money game out there that has fun co-op, dinos, jetpacks, lightsabers, mechs, cosmetics and it's price is only like less that 1Euro (about I 0.75 I think).  Must buy.  Also shout-out to the devs for giving me free points for skins.
9441	1	a	An amazing game but this is a new account on my old account ive been playing for 1378 hours :P  This is not sparta THIS IS PRELUDE its freakin' amazing the weapons the halo the JURASSIC PARK the well EVERYTHING! 9999999/10 love it love it love it co-op PvP freaky mode (prehistoric mode) just wonderful in every way possible and dont even get me started on those graphics and its got gamemodes its just plain amazing i would buy this if it costed 1000 USD i dont care its just perfect
9443	1	a	This game is so damn fun. You can drive airborn motorbike-like vehicles, mount tanks, troops-transportation thingy with a mounted machine-gun, and a mecha-robot thingy. There's just so many ways to kill the hordes of dinosaurs. Only disappointment was the lack of blown-out intestines while walking through dead dinosaurs. 
9445	1	a	I wanna play this at 4k ):
9447	1	a	I killed a Trex by ramming my helicopter up it's ♥♥♥. 11/10 would do it again.
9449	1	a	Really good concept, great idea, but the execution in the game was pretty bad. It's still in progress, and needs fixing, but it's a blast to play with friends!
9451	1	a	cool game for a cheap price but it get borring when you have killed 100 dinosoars and nothing else to do :/
9453	1	a	Very great game!!! Recommend it! Shooting dino's for fun!
3318	0	a	It is not a good sign when the game has the graphics of a mid 2000s arcade game and has 15 fps. A game with graphics this average does not need to take up that much of my computer's power. I can run open world games that have better graphics at higher frame rates. i havent even started on the gameplay, which is ok at best, you basically just run around and shoot the little dinosaurs. I chose the assault class and the only weapon i could use was a pistol. Although I am sure this is due to my mental retardation, it still shouldnt spawn the assault class in with just a pistol, especially if you arent gonna use traditional ways of switching weapons (mousewheel, numbers etc.) and that is assuming it even has a rifle.  5/10 Wouldnt waste 5 mins on this ever again
9455	1	a	This game is glitchy. It is really unoptimized with many framerate drops regardless of how good your PC is. It has a mixed history that includes quite some controversy over changing their name to avoid a terrible metacritic score. It was described as one of the absolute worst games of all time. All but the last are true.  The game itself is buggy and absolutely unoptimized. It is also extremely fun, with a very large variety of weapons and quite a few different enemy dinos to take down. The special weapons were particularly fun. It makes for a great game to jump in and shoot some dinos with friends, or even just alone. Throw up max money, buy all the cool weapons and just wreck the dino horde.  Is it the greatest game of all time? No, but it is far better than everyone made it out to be. When it was $15 this would've been a negative review due to the poor performance and that things just don't work right a good chunk of the time. But now that it's a dollar, and a 4-pack can be had for $3 (prices as of writing) it is a hearty recommendation instead. Think of it this way: A cup of coffee, an energy drink, or 4 copies of this game for yourself and friends to play. It'll provide a minimum of a few hours of entertainment, either through actual fun with the game or purposefully trying to break it and make silly things happen.
3319	0	a	10/10 my ♥♥♥♥ got chopped of by an toster
9457	1	a	Cool game and cheap :&gt;
9459	1	a	This is the best game ever for the price, it is great. If you want a great game but dont have much money get this
9461	1	a	Its an investiment for a better game it already has changed so much
9463	1	a	Its a really fun game i really recommend it and not to mention its very cheap it cost less than a dollar if u dont like this game i dont think u should dislike this game just because its a really cheap game since it cost less than a dollar ill give this 8.5/10
9465	1	a	Awesomest community ever. Awesomest Devs ever. Awesomest Memetastic game. 50% off on the new Orion game for owning the prelude.  Buy this.
9467	1	a	This game is neat, at first you may be a little opposed to playing it... keep playing for a while check out the weapons and powerups plus the vehicles. Neat game!
9469	1	a	HOW CAN YOU NOT LOVE THIS GAME!?! It´s 1$ and ♥♥♥♥ing great. ♥♥♥♥ the haters, this is a great game to play with your friends and it´s even better then most games out there, ♥♥♥♥, i had more fun in this than Call of Duty Advanced Warfare, and this is only 1 ♥♥♥♥ing $. Just buy it, play it for 4 hours, and then passout cuz of all the fun you had!
9471	1	a	Buy this game now.
9473	1	a	Like halo, but with dinosaurs  10/10
9475	1	a	Definitely recommended, I shot at dinosaurs for nearly 70 hours and I still come back to it from time to time to have some fun.
9477	1	a	Realy good.3 years of suporting.Low price+good game.Its posible 
9479	1	a	This game is like a cheap mexican restraunt with good food. Once you get through the disgusting parts it is great. So please don't hate it because of lag get a few of your friends and it is really fun.
9481	1	a	Sure, it's buggy and glitchy at times, and it seems as if the devs are not going to complete or fix the game, but for $1 there is still a fun time to be had. The game has a few people on every once and a while, but this game shines best when you play with a friend. And even if you don't want it it's only a dollar what will it hurt it give it a try. You could always return it if you don't like it.
9483	1	a	Great game over all but would be better if it was just a tad optimised for lower end rigs so i can play it with more friends
9485	1	a	A very fun game and for $0.99. This is 100 out of 100
9487	1	a	Considering this game is $1, and the developers still took the time to revamp it when it had issues out the wazoo, I think this is one game that should be in every Steam user's library. You can't have more fun with a single dollar, than what you can have with this game.
9489	1	a	It's a very nice dinausor game, at good price!If you don't want to pay much money, but you want a good game with dinausors, this game is for you guys!
9491	1	a	all im asking was this game realeased on 2014 or 2012 because it says orion dino beatdown was in 2012 and orion dino horde was in 2013 so im confused
9493	1	a	Basically, theres a class who can heal vehicales, teammates, then yank out a minigun and literally kill a giant bloody aligator dinosaur in under 10 seconds, and then get dive-bombed to death by flying dinosaurs. Best game ever. 
9495	1	a	Dinosaurs,big dinosaurs,small dinosaurs,flying dinosaurs and guns and some ♥♥♥♥tards to play with u game
9497	1	a	You get to shoot dinosaurs for $1.25 What more could you ask for?
3326	0	a	For starters, this game crashes more than a ♥♥♥♥ing drunk driver in a bugatti and it runs at 3fps or less even when i have a decent gaming PC.
9499	1	a	Great game, absolutely love it for the price, got more for 1$ than in other games for 20. A must have for round based fps defense/survival lovers and the leveling system is a great motivation.
9501	1	a	Only $1...what more to say? Super fun and super buggy and super stupid concept. Can make it either really easy or really hard. AI are so dumb its funny. Lots of guns (kinda) and fun with a friend.   5/10
9503	1	a	It's $0.99 cents usd. Get it. It's fun.   DO IT! 10/10
9505	1	a	T-Rex rekted me inside a full health tank in 1 go 10/10 Would play again
9507	1	a	because it is chep a lot people.think it is ♥♥♥♥ game but when u try it is great and when u play with yput fri eds it is freaking awesome so u should try it
3327	0	a	♥♥♥♥
9509	1	a	Well worth the money
9511	1	a	rarely plays the games.... at least it's cheap and fun
9513	1	a	This game is fun, addicting, and cheap! GET IT RIGHT NOW
9515	1	a	This game is worth at least 5 bucks. Pick it up, you won't regret it.
3328	0	a	Terrible Game, Don't buy it.. get Primal carnage instead ;)
9517	1	a	Sure it's a good game, but sure it has bad graphics. Yes, I know this game is kind of old but as a first person shooter it's fun. It still is fun when playing solo, as it revives an old taste of waves/survival with dinosaurs. Now honestly, I never really played with people because I kinda got bored at some point of time and stopped playing it. For others who are on this game's page and fan of these types of games, you should get it as it's just 1$.
3330	0	a	laggy servers, no people play this game.
9519	1	a	the price and the game play this is my favorite game why are you even reading go ahead and buy/play the game right now!
9521	1	a	I used to play on a laptop. I bought this game and my computer broke. It was horrible. It lagged, it glitched, it was broken. I then built myself a gaming cpc, and this game is amazing. If you are a true PC gamer, you should have a gaming computer. On a good computer it is so much fun. I kept playing for hours. It wasted my life. (In a good way)
9523	1	a	An awsome fps in a dinosaur world. It looks really good. Alot of houres to put in to this game
9525	1	a	Great game, only thing is that all players rather go pve then pvp.
9527	1	a	♥♥♥♥ing amazing, just buy it, it is fantastic Its a dollar, don't be a ♥♥♥♥ Shoot some dinosaurs, high five your bros and/or babes, there's a lightsaber  buy it
9529	1	a	I felt like going back and try this game out again like 2 years after i bought it, but its not in my library anymore. I own it, or else i couldnt write this review. Help?
9531	1	a	this is a really fun game hard but fun so if you like a fun shooter to play with your friends or on your own this is a nice one ^_^
9533	1	a	Now don't get me wrong, this game is awful, but hear me out! It's the kind of game you play with a few mates for a little while when you're really bored. And it's that alone that makes it worth a few pence on a sale.
9535	1	a	You will have some fun with it, but after a while it gets boring.   Buy it for under 7€
9537	1	a	if you have a dollar i say go ahead and buy it or what for a steam sell and buy it for 50 cents either way it really fun
9539	1	a	GREATEST 3 DOLLERS IVE EVER SPENT leviling system makes it easy to lv up not much grind needed to get ok stuff but even in easymode the 'large dinos' get really overwelhming recomend to play with freinds makes the experience more life full great soundtrack and cool weapon exited to see this games updates
9541	1	a	A great game, full of action and dinosaurs. I recommend it to all my friends and to YOU!
9543	1	a	My computer isn't very good and can't run this very well, however, it is a pretty fun game if you don't lag a ton like me.
3333	0	a	My friends and I were arguing on Steam Voice Chat one day. We were trying to figure out the next multiplayer game we should all invest in. After agonizing deliberation that lasted several days over who was gonna scrounge up the hefty $2.99 sum for the 4-pack, we finally got the game. After all, how could we resist? It had dinosaurs and it was $2.99. How bad could it possibly be?  Prehistorically Bad.
9545	1	a	It's like if Halo and Primal Carnage were married but one day Halo cheats on Primal Carnage with Killing Floor And Halo and Killing Floor had a baby. Primal Carnage sees the baby and thinks 'What the hell? That's not my kid! Where are the Dinosaurs?!' And then one day Primal Carnage cheats on Halo and has a baby with Quake and then realizes that Halo has been cheating on him so he kills Halo and then himself and then Quake's and Killing Floor's baby had a baby which is this game.  So yeah, ORION is pretty good.
9547	1	a	Absolutely hilarious to load up this mess with some friends and shoot some dinosaurs. This game is glitchy, has horrible graphics, and plays super stiff like an old quake or something, but still is lots of fun.
9549	1	a	I payed £0.78 to shoot at dinosaurs for 4 hours, I also managed to make my friends buy it, I also managed to make my friend waste £10 on it to get it for his friends. I had a successful waste money for me and my friends spree. 11/10 would 360 shotgun dinosaurs again.
3334	0	a	To laggy cant play idk if it the game but i know lots who are haveing the same problem it ruins the experience and it look like aploute ♥♥♥♥ worth £0.39 at max
9551	1	a	Awesome game , gameplay is nice i wont complain but the graphics are so-so . What else do you expect from such an affordable game? its a nice game to play with friends and have fun killing dinos . (y) truly reccomended for people who can`t afford other expensive games :)
9553	1	a	really fun,
9555	1	a	Half the time you won't notice a dinosaur the size of your ankles killing you. 10/10, would rage at compys again
9557	1	a	Realy fun game, expecialy for that price!
3335	0	a	 2/10
9559	1	a	Pretty Good Dino Slaying Sci-Fi Game, Still Has Alot Of Servers Going!
9561	1	a	First, let me be clear that after 0.3 hrs in game, I was able to get the game to launch. I wasn't playing, just running an EXE that bombed. I have a Toshiba Satellite with Win10 and a few games just give it indigestion (Examina and Lost Mythologies, amongst others). I am not sure if this is one of them. I unistalled the program (a bit tricky) and reinstalled it. I got to the main menu and its subs and stopped.  So, I am giving a thumbs up for all the fan boys and a warning that it may be witchy if you are running win10. Try removing and reinstalling the program after you scrub all you caches and registry.  
9563	1	a	EPIC FUN [&lt;3 that we kill dinos!]
9565	1	a	This game is literally a big mess, and I got rid of 6 CS:GO skins for it.    God damn, have I never liked a mess the way I like this.
9567	1	a	This game really is good. Glad the devs stuck with it instead of ditching it like most do. Kudos, guys.
3336	0	a	Lag Central. My system is above the recommended requirements, and with every video setting at low or disabled, it still lags when the dinosaurs attack.
9569	1	a	Super fun game, worth way more than what it's priced at. A couple bugs here and there but nothing game breaking. So much fun to run around as recon stabbing ♥♥♥♥ with a cryo blade.
3337	0	a	it seems really good but it runs incredibly poorly and the servers are laggy. even with all graphics setting turned to low i had an terrible framerate. The maps look really good and i had fun exploring them its just too bad i cant play a game in them. i suppose if you had an extra beefy computer and an awesome internet connection this game would be superb
9571	1	a	Very interesting game , fun , cool comunity , BUT it is not optimized. Good job developers!
9573	1	a	Any game where you can slice the balls off a t-rex with a bowie knife is worth at least a look. 6/10
9575	1	a	It is a pretty fun survival game especialy if you play it with friends
9577	1	a	Pretty good game for 1$.
9579	1	a	Tons of fun for only $0.99 ... buy a 4-pack for $3 and have fun with friends. Cheap fun: man vs. dinosaur.
9581	1	a	It is decent fun with friends for a short while, worth its price but very basic in gameplay and design.
9583	1	a	Really fun game. Pretty much Halo versus dinosaurs. Have fun!
9585	1	a	Dinosaurs, lightsabers, and pvp. What else could you want in a game? (Semi-OpenWorld) 10/10
9587	1	a	Even if you like it or not, you won't lose much due to low price of 0,99€. It's pretty much like Killing Floor with dinosaurs but with more gamemodes and vehicles. Good graphics for indie dev game and gameplay is enjoyable for the most part. Since last time I played it had glitches and weird animations but nothing serious.  I will write longer review later when I have time (and if I'm not lazy).
9589	1	a	I bought my friend this game to see how well multiplayer worked  He got addicted  Send help
9591	1	a	Killing Floor with dinosaurs and capes
9593	1	a	Game is awesome and only for 0.99 can not beat that best game on steam for 99 cents!
9595	1	a	Great Game! only $1 for endless hours of fun with friends! Wether you want to work together in Survival Co-op, or fight against eachother in the numerous interesting and diverse 1v1 game modes, you're going to have a GREAT time! Why haven't you bought it yet? We will never know..
3340	0	a	It was a good game... but the people there are asshats and its near impossible to find a game, on top of that there just insnt enough content to last long.
9597	1	a	For the price of a few gumballs you can run around and shoot a triceratops to death
3341	0	a	Bad graphics, and boring gameplay. Not my type of game.
9599	1	a	Awesome Game For An Awesome price 
9601	1	a	Bought this game JUST to support the DEV team.  They stuck it out and put more work into making this into something, where most dev teams just drop promising titles. GJ Dev's. IDK how much I will play it, but I will pay it.
9603	1	a	The game of the century, not even a meteor could kill this one.
9605	1	a	I keep forgetting I bought this game for 50 cents.
3342	0	a	Its not bad for what it is, and honestly if deathmatches (and a couple variations) on a few small maps with dinosaurs that die with one shot, limited feelings of progression, and a microtransaction store sound like fun...fill your boots. Hardly anything that even hints at the depth and scope of SC.
9607	1	a	Deffinately worth a dollar But i wouldnt pay full price by any means.
9609	1	a	Nice. This game is so fun.
9611	1	a	i would totally recomend this game (i cant really explain that much ) but its one of those games you have to spen ur money on
9613	1	a	Great game for just 1 dollar. Like TF2 cross Halo cross Left 4 Dead cross Turok. in short it's an indie FPS masterpiece. However i keep experiencing issues maintaining a decent connection to the servers. It'd be nice if these problems were fixed. The game will often disconnect me shortly after joining, or time me out after about an hour on a certain server. This might just be me but i dunno.   Buy it and regret nothing.
9615	1	a	the only complain i got  is that I got stuck between the rock while climbing mountain in the snowy map and recoil from grenade dont work even that flying dinousaur wont even kill me when i want it to  other than that this game is awesome  10/10 would kill the T-rex by punch it in the face again      
9617	1	a	Tons of bugs, but i mean, you get to shoot dinosaurs
9619	1	a	iTS ONE OF THE FIRST GAMES I HAS AND ITS EPIC!!!!!!!!!!!!
3343	0	a	Note: this is before recent changes that have drastically improved the game, still not great but better.  I do not recommend this game. It is literally the worst purchase I have ever made. The mouse sensitivity goes only from Super Extreme to Mega Extreme, the plays worse that Carnivores from the 90’s, there is literally no one else online and it looks nothing like the previews or screenshots that I'm sure you’re looking at. You will get more enjoyment out of your money if you went to the bank and had it all turned into change, then subsequently ate all the change and waited anxiously for the aftermath.
9621	1	a	♥♥♥♥, it was 99 cents!
3344	0	a	PLAY THIS GAME IT TOLD ME TO TELL YOU     
9623	1	a	Can't afford to buy it for $5. Can't afford to not buy it for $0.99
9625	1	a	this is cool
9627	1	a	This is one of few games I really enjoy playing both single player, and co-op. I have not tried the PVP as I am more into team play then PVP. If you like shoot em up games, this one is well worth the buy &amp; you can not beat the $0.99 price here for this game. Yeah I know, you see a low price &amp; automatically you assume the game must suck, but it doesn't! Its well worth a 99 cent, and honestly I would have paid as much as $19.99 for it, because I think its worth it.  Getting the game &amp; want someone to co-op with? Feel free to send me a friends request, and I will be happy to play it with you.  Get it! Its worth it!
9629	1	a	Ok, this might not be the BEST game ever, but it's pretty damn fun for a while. Plus, it's only $1, so I'd say it's worth buying.
9631	1	a	it was great
9633	1	a	I killed a T-Rex with a lightsaber
9635	1	a	Kill them all, buy weapon kill them all, get vehicle kill them all. You will hate dino so kill them all.  Good game for cheap price.
9637	1	a	Awesome fun FPS for some quick n dirty fun with friends :). Seems like the game mechanics may be broken (or lack thereof), but in a good way that makes it fun.
9639	1	a	Great game for a great price! Lots of fun when playing multiplayer. 8/10
9641	1	a	I didn't know I owned this game, can't find it in my library either?
9643	1	a	Worth the 1$ no joke. Its pretty fun.
9645	1	a	Edit: The developers fixed this game up pretty good! When I reviewed this game back in 2014 it was a heap of trash but it is playable now and actually pretty entertaining. I've never seen a comeback like this before but kudos to the developers!  This game literally hurt to play. As a rule, I force myself to play at least an hour of a game before I make a final opinion but if I had the chance I would wipe that entire hour from my memory. If I had the option, I would trek across the planet fighting thousands of horrifying monsters to throw this game into a deep volcano just to wipe it off the face of the earth to save people the pain of going through what I did. When I was 11 I made a map for Delta Force Black Hawk down where the player ran away from alligators, this is that.. but an entire game with annoying, swooping pterodactyls. This is Raptor Island  (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0401742/?ref_=nv_sr_1)  the game. You just pour endless amounts of bullets into seemingly mechanical dinosaurs until they finally keel over. Save yourself the $14.99.   To be fair to the developers, this game gets a fair share of positive reviews as well so maybe if it goes on sale again it's worth a look. Just putting in my 2 cents.
9647	1	a	So when I first saw this game I thought, Hmm Its free for a wile and It has lightsabers spartains hornets and dionosaurs..... Sick!  So my buddy and i download it and yeah it was fricking awsome. Now ive played a few hours of it and Its still awsome and makes you feel like a badass at the same time. The graphics are good, the sound is good, the gameply is good, the animations are good. 8/10 This game is a lot of fun, and if you have some buddys they can play it with you easly because you dont have to set up a server or anything. Yay! So all in all this game is worth the fifteen dollar regular price but for 1$ Its a deal you shouldent pass up.
9649	1	a	Its a great game just for 1$
9651	1	a	This game so far has honestly has been quite a good experience, however, note that this game does NOT have the best graphics ever but 7/10 on this game. I may edit this further through.
9653	1	a	  Such gameplay, much Wow
9655	1	a	This game was worth it when you had to pay a dollar for it, now it's free, so there's absolutely no reason not to try it at least. most people will look for fun elsewhere when they see the childish dinosaur trailer. i was one of those people, but after hearing some great things about it, i decided to give it a shot. i've only put a few hours into it, but i had a blast while playing. Here's a list of pros and cons i quickly drew up. it's by no means an in-depth analysis, but the game's free, what have you got to lose?  (pros) &gt;graphics are actually pretty good, lighting effects blow me away &gt;variety of gamemodes &gt;each gamemode is quite different, so you'll have fun no matter what kind of shooter you like &gt;motha♥♥♥♥in t-rex &gt;lazer swords &gt;killer soundtrack  (cons) &gt;slightly repetetive gameplay &gt;small arsenal of weapons to choose from &gt;microtransations (only cosmetics though. it's not pay2win at all)   just get the game already, youw won't regret it 9/10
9657	1	a	its a very unique and fun game. no other like it
9659	1	a	This CO-OP game is good,but need to fixed some bugs.(Why this game is free?DAFUQ?)
9661	1	a	It worth the 80 cents!
9663	1	a	A nice mix between Halo and Jurrassic Park, can get glitchy time to time though
9665	1	a	This game is a dollar. I got to drive a helicopter while terroizing my friend without a car from above
9667	1	a	Many dinosaurs are in this game, your job is to make sure there are less by the time you return to your desktop.
9669	1	a	its meh alone  beyond great with friends
3348	0	a	Good for an evening of playing with friends but not much else. Once you've had one fun go it never seems to capture that magic again.
9671	1	a	a good game for this price !! just try it xD
3349	0	a	look yes i only played for 30 mins... but i bought this game as part of a 4 pack for me and my mates.... paid like a buck for it.. how bad does a game have to be.. that your m8ts try to return the game... and the dev's.. because of what ever they said.. Gave them more free copies to give away?!?!?!?  so NO.. this game is not worth even the $1 buck i paid......
9673	1	a	A great time killer or mess around with friends game. Nothing special but passes a few hours.
9675	1	a	Great game for co-op. Very addicting. I nominated this game for the 'I thought this game was cool before it won an award.' I think this game is under played and more people should get this game.
9677	1	a	Pretty rudimentary, but fun for the price.
9679	1	a	Dinosaurs are farm animals, yeah?
9681	1	a	Surprisingly very fun and enjoyable game.
9683	1	a	Caught it on sale for 50 cents. I do not regret my purchase.
9685	1	a	Now this game is actually pretty fun. With its ok graphics and somewhat buggy gameplay, it's actually quite fun to play. The basic idea is that you and your friends are the survivors, and waves of dinosaurs come at you. It's an fps-game, so a pretty familiar idea for many. There are three 'classes' or so in the game, and each has its own perks; a jetpack, a medigun and going invisible. However, there are a few problems with the game. I'm from Europe, and there aren't really that many servers close to here. Most of the servers on the list have over 100, over 200 ping. And another problem, at least for some, is the buggy gameplay. However, I really didn't seek for an awesome storyline or the sickest online game when paying like 1 euro for this game. Still pretty fun to play, 7,5/10
9687	1	a	Nice game.
9689	1	a	'Protect our base!' 8.5/10
9691	1	a	haha no paying for me cuz i played the game when it was free i can play the game for free  anyway everytime i play with my friends its fun so i really reccomend the game its cool
9693	1	a	Cool arcade like game that you can jump into and have a decent experience, without too much of an investment.
3352	0	a	  It is so bad! I had a good laugh with a friend while trying some multiplayer action. The delay between shooting animation and the sound, plus it is just so freaking clonky...
9695	1	a	Honestly a lot more fun than I thought, it's a great game if you find yourself in a cycle of playing just a couple games all the time.
9697	1	a	A great graphic novel , honestly made me cry...
9699	1	a	No need to listen to the critics, while the devs may not be too good, the game is very fun for 1 dollar. Defenitley worth it!
9701	1	a	A great and challenging game if you like dinosaurs, still way better than Ark
9703	1	a	This game is so cheap yet so much fun. A must buy I spend so many hour on this.
3355	0	a	1 hour of my life I will never get back! Thanks Mr Majestic!
9705	1	a	I'm not going to lie and tell you this game is perfect, as it's far from it. That said, it's leagues beyond the turd it was.   The gameplay itself is similar to any other number of survival shooters, with a slight objective-based element tossed in. In the most popular mode, Survival, players have to keep a generator safe from hordes of dinosuars. As long as the generator is running, players scan high tail it to a base where they can purchase weapons, turrets, upgrades, etc. There is the occasional objective point that you are required to capture in between waves, which requires that all or some of you leave the precious generator. If the generator is disabled during this time, you have 3 minutes to restore it, otherwise you lose.  The graphics aren't bad by any means. They have a very 'Halo' look to them, with some small issues of stretched textures here and there. The lense flair is very nice however, and would make J.J. Abrams proud.   I found the sound effects to be much better than they once were. Gunshots no longer sound like a tin can getting hit by a frozen pea, rather they sound like an actual gun. Dinosaurs still sound pretty ridiculous, but hey, they're a far cry from what they were.  Overall I would definitely reccommend this game while on sale. At 14.99 it's a bit steep, as the experience is far from perfect. That said, if you can pick it up on a deal (say, 99 cents?) go for it.
9707	1	a	First off, most of the people reviewing this as a bad game are the people that make PC gaming look bad. They are the nazi neckbeards who need everything perfect.  Now that that is out of the way, this game was actually surprisingly fun. I never liked replay games like Killing Floor, or games like Halo, it was a personal thing. But contrary to people saying awful things about this game, I bought it for the sale and was pretty impressed. With the chemistry for replayability and also versus mode, it makes this game great with friends. The idea of a Dino survival game is also very novel and interesting. The game is sort of clunky in some places, but otherwise the game is really fun all around. Probably not worth 15 dollars, but definitely pick it up if its on sale.
3356	0	a	Admittedly my time was rather short with orion Dino Horde. In that time during the free weekend I found the game to have had plenty of potential that is sadly lost in a generally bland game. It's sad to say really because the premise is pretty fun really. Running around as a team of soldiers blasting any and all Dinosaurs that you see with a variety of weapons and vehicles sounds like immense fun until you start playing it.  The animations are subpar for both the soldiers and dino's. Men look like they are gliding along the floor as they 'run' while dino's charge around the map with their jaws hanging open but not making any sounds. The large opponents such as T-Rex make roars every now and then but Jurassic Park level sound design this is not.  Weapons are varied but they all look pretty bland. Most weapons have flat textures with blue lights on them and many feel particularly weak when fired, or simply miss half the time. The weather effects for the snowfall is atrocious and overall it just feels bad.  I know this is by a small team who have accomplished something here that I personally couldn't and if you don't mind the general chepness of the title it's probably not going to grate on you too much. Certainly a game best enjoyed with a few friends. If however you are looking to buy this for yourself to game with random people online, DON'T. It isn't worth it as a single purchase.
9709	1	a	brilliant game. Love it!
9711	1	a	A moshpit of CoD, Halo, and Borderlands all wrapped up in one huge dinosaur world. Suprisingly addictive. It's a steal at only $1.00.
9713	1	a	For a dollar this is easily the best game in its class on Steam. Definitely has the potential to have a lot of laughs with friends while playing.
3358	0	a	Barely worth one dollar. If you can afford the computer required to run this, you can afford a better game then this. Reminded me of a horribly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ knock-off of halo: combat evolved mixed with dinosaurs. Most of the dinosaur models look like inflatable pool toys and the games motion blur hardley obscures the plastic looking models. Deresolution is so bad that my teammates look like the character from pitfall at 100 yards.  2/10  I would have said buy this if you've got no games on your steam account but TF2 is free-to-play now.  On a side note: HOW DARE THEY USE THE QUAKE KILL STREAKS.
9715	1	a	The game is good but can do with less lag the game was the worst game for lag with a lag so if you could do something about it. All in all the game gave a good scent to survial from really dinosuares. The controls were good in layout and well done. I would say play this game if you got a good computer but if not don't play look else where. One more thing the game could do with is a gameplay to learn how to play it. Thank you for reading this is dragonslayer20003 out...
9717	1	a	This game, although not perfect, is rather good. What I mean by not perfect is that yes, it has its bugs. The server optimization and lag compensation is relatively minimal to nonexistent. Even with those annoyances you learn to cope. Then the game becomes a redikulous, yet fun. How many games can you use a gattling gun to kill a dinosaur in? this one. For a dollar, this game is worth your money. It will keep you entertained for many an hour. Plus you can drive a tank, and run down dinosaurs in a small land jetski. What else do you need in a game?
9719	1	a	Ignore the metacritic score.
9721	1	a	Ive honestly had more fun playing this game than every AAA game ive bought in the last 2 years.. get a group of buddies together and its a blast. Almost feel bad buying for as cheap as it was, its def worth more than the dollar its on sale for.
9723	1	a	Very fast paced but an amazing ly fun and adictive FPS I cant describe how much fun this game is.
9725	1	a	OH MY DEARY LORD THIS IS THE ONLY THING IN THE WORLD THAT COMES CLOSE TO BAD RATS!!!
3366	0	a	So it seems to me that the map is just way to big and you end up running for minutes on end to get places and that dinosaurs at times can be way to overpowering if you dont have 4 or more people playing with you. Also the bosses can wreck if you are 4 or less. The matchmaking is absolutely garbage, with refreshing sometimes not working and trying to get into a game saying that you can connect but having a giant CONNECTING plastered on your screen. Friends can sometimes join games that you cant. Overall its a 4.5/10 in terms of gameplay quality and could be a meager laugh or too in coop play but there are far better options in terms of this catergory. BUT for a dollar you might as well buy it but for nothing more.
3367	0	a	Even for a dollar, Im not going to waste time or hard drive space on this prehistoric turd. All I want is a New Turok!
3368	0	a	this game was horrible. The graphics were crap, and the gameplay in general was just bs.
9727	1	a	Great CO-OP game with friends and great layout and guns 8/10
9729	1	a	Could be a nice game, unfortunately reactivating/protecting the generator is not fun. Would have been much better if it was just about surviving the dinosaurs or having a compound to protect. Also the 'Fight to survive' mechanic is absolutely annoying, i'd rather die instantly on the spot. Who thought it'd be a good idea? You fall on the ground, limping to your death, all the dinosaurs runs away from you and your goal is to kill one of them before they escape so you can magically be revived (Must be some form of blood magic)  But I still have to recommend it, the sheer terror when the ground starts shaking and a T-Rex appears, screeching, is absolutely fantastic. Those annoying raptors and tiny little green ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dinosaurs represents exactly what they are. The guns and the leveling up mechanics are great. It'd be great if there was a better; more detailed interface to tell you exactly the bonuses you have on what you're about to use/buy.  This game needs either an invasive expansion or a sequel, that would shape the game differently.
3370	0	a	Controller support is laughable at most... 'USE' was not mapped out by default and there are no options that allow me to invert the axis or sensitivity. Those alone make this game not even worth .99 to me.
9731	1	a	Conquest mode is awesome! Open world base-to-base defense and progress, you need both transport and sustain for your team, love it!
9733	1	a	Is the best game to send the dinos back to their extinction! + Multiplayer CO-OP! THIRD PERSON-FIRST PERSON! Multiplayer Human vs Human! Steam Cards Slashing dinos and a lot of fun extinguishing the DINOSAURS!...  IM IN.
9735	1	a	I find this game fun. It is enjoyable for me because I have been waiting for a dinosaur game like this and I have finally found this game. It may not be everyone's game, but I personally enjoy it.
9737	1	a	For a dollar you can't really go wrong with this game. Dinos and jetpacks for a buck... Don't expect a gta, skyrim, or cod experience for a dollar if you do you're a moron. But all in all this game rocks for the price.
9739	1	a	pretty ♥♥♥♥ing awesome
9741	1	a	This is a really fun game!
9743	1	a	It was great ^^
9745	1	a	Not the best game going, but i was plesantly suprised at how entertaing it was. If your running low on things to play or just want to pass a few hours give this a blast. On the flip side get to kill dino's in mech's and tanks whats not to like!!!!!
3374	0	a	Dont be fooled by the cheapness of the game. Believe me its not worth the 1 dollar and GB on your computer. People are reviewing this game poorly for a reason and no amount of percentage off the $15 price is going to make it anymore value for money. The game feels like a mod, not an actually game made by a company. Play Killing Floor, as its much more ahead of the genre then this game is.
9747	1	a	Bad Graphics and buggy, but the game is quite good gameplay wise. I reccomend it to anyone especially for 1 dollar
9749	1	a	THIS IS 99 CENTS! we should get it i played before and is so AWSOME! if you like dinosaurs and like tech and guns buy this game now before the offer ends   
9751	1	a	6.5/10  The game's concept and everything is great, but there is way too much lag. I had 70-85 ping most matches, but I lag like crazy when the waves start. The sniper, thanks, mechs, and such are un-usable due to the amount of lag and the dinosaurs seem to be moon walking. The single player is very fun, but the multi-player is meh... needs to have smoother gameplay (a.k.a fix the lag)  I'd say still buy the game and try it out (since it's pretty cheap), but don't get too disappointed when you start to lag like crazy in multi-player games.   (To be honest, for a game that's mostly based on multiplayer, it's pretty lacking when you consider how laggy it can get.)
9753	1	a	Since it's on sale for a dollar and is free2play weekend, I thought why not, I expected it to be a solid game but probably wont have alot of features, but actually theres quite a bit to do already. The game basically just needs polishing and I'd be finished in my opinion. Definitly worth a try and for a Dollar? Why not just buy it and support the devs for more titles.
9755	1	a	Holy ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥. You get to play as a soldier fighting to protect the galaxy from the dinosaur menace. There are no better things you could better with your time. There's progression, mechs, jetpacks, ♥♥♥♥ING DINOSAURS ♥♥♥♥, and even hats. You're a sub-human troglodyte if you write off the game before you even play it because of some stupid ♥♥♥♥ that leaked into your head at some point during your useless existence. Turn that useless existence into a meaningful and productive one by pouring hours into this game, you ♥♥♥♥ing pleb.  All in all I would say it's a fun game.
9757	1	a	Pretty fun, basically Killing Floor with Dinosaurs, jetpacks and and objectives, not worth $15.00 bucks, but totally worth it on sale.
3375	0	a	Wow, where do you start. I thought this was a re-release or a new Beta or what have you. Turns out, this game has always been buggy and well, kind of bad. And it still is. Where do I start?!  The sound, well, it is just, bad? The voice acting, the quality of the voice recording, the sound levels, the guns, the dino's, the music that cuts in and out. All pretty bad. Not horrible, but it is kind of like they just dumped a bunch of stuff in there, DONE!  The Animations are just plain weird and buggy. Your main starting gun, when you draw it, is drawn before your hands are in position. What?! The scope zooming is done like this is a game from 2007. The Dino's jumping animation is bad, the bites are wayyy off, flying dino's make insane 180's midair, the T Rex takes weird bites from the ground and proceeds to trow these 'boulders' at you... They spin and are only half animated, one side is just flat. Did they ever take a look at this game? Did they even test it and play it themselves?  Physics, well, ehh. Yes, Shoot a 10 ton Stegosaurus with a bow and arrow for 20 times and it dies, but the last arrow sends it flying like crazy. But a tank shell on a minature critter has no impact. Oh and did you know, dino's can pound the ground and send you flying off into the air, but their own kind is just glued to the floor.  And then the actual gameplay. Did they ever test it? What where they thinking? You are teleported out of fortified buildings when the enemies come in. Never heard of using bunkers I guess. You NEED the jetpack, if you don't have it you are just picked up and dropped to death. And fightning from a rock is way to go. So why are there 3 classes? It won't help if they don't get something like the Jetpack. So you defend this generator, that has no healthbar and needs to be recharged. You get random vehicles for liberating outposts but it all has very arbitrary time constraints. These game modes just make NO SENSE AT ALL.  3/10, would not play if F2P. It is now, but even at €1 it is asking too much. This game is bad. Cool concept, nice scenery, but the gameplay and pretty much all else is bad.
3376	0	a	Andddddd. WTF It may have...some...potential. Considering the menu seems to lag a bit, it definetely has flaws, but i'm sure it would run smoother on an enthusiast's rig. APUs don't support much, even in the fabled 'Dual Graphics Mode'
3377	0	a	It's ♥♥♥♥ing weird. Very small lobbies of five.    Its basically a dino versus human. You pick which side you're on... in lobbies of 5. Bigger lobbies would be a very fun game, there would be a lot of room for a f2p model like Tf2.   As is? not worth it
9759	1	a	GET IT WHILES ITS ONLY A DOLLA, ♥♥♥♥♥ ILL EVEN BUY IT FOR YOU! THIS ♥♥♥♥ IS SO FUN, ♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥S BE LISTENING TO REVIEWS IN 2012, TIMES A CHANGING! GAMEPLAY IS ♥♥♥♥IN AWESOME GOD DAYUM HOW IS THIS ♥♥♥♥ A DOLLA FOR N OW? BECUZ ♥♥♥♥ MARKETING AND WHEN IT RELEASED IT WAS SHIOOTTTTT, IT AINT SO BAD NOW, 8/10!!!
9761	1	a	Great Game Just like sort of jerracisisdisjadiobeasuhyvaeod
3379	0	a	Its an OK game but thats it just OK. Nothing to write home about.   You start off with just a pistol. Really?!? And there is no way to play with just a controller you can fire with the controller but cant interact with anything eithout a keyboard so whats the point.   Visually it looks nice, not the best but not the worst either.   Worth $0.99? Eh, maybe. However, I dont find this to be something I would keep coming back to.
9763	1	a	Best summed up: Dino survival 'Left 4 Dead' made with the Halo Engine.  This is a simple, standard shooter with a fun theme that when played with friends, is an amazingly fun time.  The game is also quite rough around the edges, but is still very enjoyable. If you have the chance, try it out.
9765	1	a	Sorry to say but this game is really bad, my advise: stay away from it.
9767	1	a	I paid $1 for this game.  It feels like Halo vs Dinosaurs.  Worth it.
9769	1	a	It's like COD but with that unexpecting element in witch you can actually rely on teammates for help
3381	0	a	Still cant find where my dogs at.
3382	0	a	keeps crashing when i try to play a game on it this game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t
9771	1	a	Its like Halo and a pack of diinosaurs had a fricken babu! Its great fun. *dinoshootingintensifies*
9773	1	a	If you have Friends on mic you'll love this game.  It has bugs but who cares ? The devs are updating this game like crazy ( 2 Go for an update, add'd maps/ games mods vehicules etc ... )  Survival FPS with friends you just need to play it.  Btw awesome music !
9775	1	a	Grab some beer, some friends and buy this game. You will not regret it!
9777	1	a	Good to play but playing alone is difficult
9779	1	a	this game is amazing it got light sabers and mech suits and cars and arcrafts and laser guns and sentry turrets and GIANTS DINOS !!!!!!!!!!!!!
9781	1	a	I installed this game with very low expectations. I was pleasantly surprised. The controls were nothing special or difficult, just standard FPS controls (+1). The single player was pretty lag free, though it was very lonely and kinda of hard (then again it was medium). Basically this game is along the lines of orcs must die and whatnot. good for mindless slaughtering fun and explosions. 
9783	1	a	DUDE! this is freaking epic! i will keep this at the top of my play list! fun for the whole family to boot! i give this a bannana out of blue. 10,000,054%
3383	0	a	This game really looked exciting. Kind of like a cross between Left 4 Dead and dinosaurs. However, this game was very disapointing for me. It had bad graphics, slow online play, bad mechanics, and bad AI. With all the hype this game had it was a disapointing result.
9785	1	a	Would not recommend it at full price, but 0,99€ is hard to argue with. Its equal to what you would give to beggars or musicians on the street, or hell, even less.  And I have to say, it's a pretty fun game!  Sure it has its bugs and its mediocre at best, but nevertheless, it actually is a nice game to play together with your friends, just mowing down those evil dinosaur ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s!!1  So, buy it while it's 93% (93%!!111) off and have a great time! :]
9787	1	a	Fun game definetly better than what it used to be, awesome game to play with some friends.
3384	0	a	ORION Dino Horde is a horrible time to be had and you will remember how terrible it is
9789	1	a	not the best FPS out there but not the worst either. For one dollar it will provide enough fun. Im just glad I didnt pay $15 for it
3386	0	a	So good that they give a -91% on it. Please avoid this game.
9791	1	a	Played it dispite the bad reviews I never played Dino beatdown before but this version is far better and lots of fun well worth 1 doller or even the normal price of 15 dollers but why not get it while its on sale.
9793	1	a	If Samuel L. Jackson and Jeff Goldlbum had Steam accounts, this would be the only game in their Library
9795	1	a	mechs, tanks and guns vs dinosaurs.  What could you possibly need more?  It is not a perfect game, but its fun most of the time. There are a few areas where it gets confusing, for instance when you have to go through the options in order to check the controls and you are met with an controller type menu with LS/LT button descriptions instead of the actual keys.
9797	1	a	it got bedder then 2012herrnotre
9799	1	a	It's Halo with dinosaurs. If you have an avid hatred for reptiles, and for all that they did to our mammalian ancestors, this is your chance for vengeance.
3388	0	a	I have never seen a more buggy game. The menu system is so bad I had to restart the game just to get rid of the lobby select screen. This game is so bad the developers should feel bad for it.  EDIT: After 2 more attempts to join a game and having to restart the game after each failure, I am STILL not able to actually get into a game. Absolutely shameful.
3389	0	a	Guys run like they have a ♥♥♥♥ in their ♥♥♥.
9801	1	a	This has no story mode, but it doesn't need to. DINASAURS! and I got it for 99 cents
9803	1	a	It has it all 5/5 dino
9805	1	a	awsome dinos love this game 
9807	1	a	Even though this game has it's bugs, it was probobly one of the most fun multiplayer games I have ever played! 8/10 on my list! However, I do not recommend this game on single player.
3391	0	a	tried it on a free weekend. not worth any amount of money. (This is for dino horde, not whatever it was called before)
3392	0	a	The dinosaursurvival is Great. But the multiplayer is crap. You can't shoot anything. Your bullets go over and to the side of your enemies. I rate the multiplayer a 1-10 and the dinosaursurvival a 7-10. But it has great framerate the graphics are outstanding but the gameplay, iffy.
9809	1	a	game was fun when it would play. could not play any conquest games and my computer is almost double the requirements the game recommends.
3393	0	a	Sloppy as hell and the network is held together by a potatoe
9811	1	a	for $1 its defiantly worth it.
3394	0	a	this game could be a great ps1 game in 1998, other than that, its not worth a dollar
9813	1	a	Fun and awesome game for a buck!!! Get it while you can! 
9815	1	a	great game, super fun to play with friends
9817	1	a	This game is currently 1$. It is the best dollar I have ever spent in my life. I've actually looked back and this is it!! Today I mowed down packs of raptors with a machine gun, I RPG'd a T-Rex, I drove a couplpe different vehicles over swarms of dinos, and even drove a whole car full of teamates to their doom!! (and got an acheivement for it!) The UI is a little chunky and not has a learning curve of about 5 minutes... So I can't complain. Don't but this expecting some sort of super polished 69.99 new-age game with all the graphics and cutscenes and stuff.... It looks like an n64 game (ok it's a little better) BUT ITS SO FUN!! I have no complaints about this game at all, I literally bought 6 copies for my friends so they can play with me. I will note that the multiplayer is where it's at and it was really easy to create a game and hace complete strangers come and cooperate with me. 9/10.
3396	0	a	I read some of the reviews, and watched the trailer video on the store page before trying this game our for the free weekend event. Let me tell you; Killing floor is fun..Jurassic Park is an alright movie. This game just wasn't what it was made out to be. The metascore is not misleading; it is dead on. This game rates a 3/10.
9819	1	a	Epic game but only if you have friend to play with you :D
9821	1	a	why did it go on my acount when i did not buy it and i have steam support its dus let me get in it said install help me same thing with call duty ghost 2player?????????? 
9823	1	a	awesome game with good game quites needs more dinosuars that u can play as
9825	1	a	It's better than the metascore implies.
9827	1	a	♥♥♥♥ 
9829	1	a	It sucks 
9831	1	a	This game.
9833	1	a	Now my opinion on this game is both good and bad because this is both extreme ends of the scale. I played this game for a while on most of the game modes and stacked up just shy of 40 hours game time so I hope my opinion on this isn't dismissed lightly. Anyway, Orion: Dino Horde is both a great game but it needs a large amount of tweaking before it is worthy of its famed rating. It has great content with weapons from a basic .45, fully auto or duel high powered pistols. A good variety and mix of guns including Light Machine Guns (LMG's), Sub-Machine Guns (SMG's), shotguns and sniper rifles, and not to mention the high grade adrenaline weapons to add some bang to your buck. There are some awesome perks to that give various boosts and take the game to a whole new level of entertainment.  Now onto the maps. The maps are epic to say the least, they have a great range with all varieties from night to day and even frozen varients, some are even on an enormous scale taking 10 - 20 minutes just to get from one side to the other while at the same time avoiding or killing dinos as you go. The community on this game is great and all are very welcoming and just make this game that much better, a big shout out for them.  Overall Orion: Dino Horde is a rollercoster ride of fun, planning and a rush of excitment when the going gets tough! But as all games do they have room for improvement so now I shall speak of the down sides.  Firstly is the most dominant of the problems, the lag. Despite this is a great game all round the lag really dents its rep and causes it to become almost unenjoyable and in some cases unplayable do to whats known as a 'rubber band effect' which causes peoples eyes to hurt from the lag on the screen. This is a server issue with the game and once its gone will be a huge improvement to the quality of game play.  The next issue would be dino controls in rampage mode, using the dinos is fun but is almost impossible to use them to any effect, in all my dozens of games I only met one person who could use the horde dinos well. If they were given an aimer to help guide biting, grabbing, throwing and spitting it would make it so much more fun but at the same time the dinos do seem a little over powered as they are but if the human's were given the option to spend money on guns or perks instead of a set class loadout it would level it off nicely.  Finally to my personal suggestions, these are neutral what I feel could spice things up. More guns! currently there are:  6 pistols 2 SMG's 2 shotguns 2 LMG's 1 Assult rifle  3 sniper rifles and 1 sword (excluding adrenaline weapons)  Although this is a great range of guns I think it would be nice if we had more of each type and if the stats were tweaked because SMG's are actually better than LMG's and LMG's are a support weapon designed to use high .cal bullets with a large mag, not as a controlled weapon like an SMG. But more assult rifles would be first rate with me, I personally am a fan of assult rifles and was quite sad to see only one of them to use so adding more would be a big boost to weapon selection.  My last suggestion will be a more base function that is currently missing from the game as a whole, a tutorial. When you start the game your thrown in the deep end and I personally dont mind because I catch on quickly but others might not and would take a while to learn the game. Adding a practise mode with a built in tutorial showing all the game funcions and what all the buttons are and how to use all the equipment to its fullest would be a big improvement. Not only would it leave less questions but give a direct insight into how to better play the game.  This is all I have to say on the game at the moment so based on my experience this is a great game that has lag issues and needs improvement but has amazing potential to become a truely epic first person shooter.  My rating for this game on a scale of 1-5: graphics - 3 weapons - 3 Speed - 2 connection - 3 vehicles - 3 controls human - 4 controls dino - 2 game modes - 5  Overall score - 3 (with improvements could become 4)  
9835	1	a	This is a very under-rated game. Who doesn't love killing dinosaurs and flying around in jet packs? A little glitchy but not bad at all.
9837	1	a	suhold free the game 
9839	1	a	One of the best Co-Op shooters I have played in a long time.
9841	1	a	Great Game can't wait till full game comes out 
9843	1	a	Most fun thing I've ever played with my friends.
9845	1	a	This game is definately ALOT of fun, Played it during the F2P weekend and now I own it. If you like the thought of teaming with your friends and fighting for you lives against hordes of Dinosaurs this game is for you. There are vehicles (ground and air *INCLUDING a Tank and Mech*), Augments (character improvments), many weapons, and even deployable turrets!   The game is being updated and improved, Check out the kickstarter and see what they have planned! 
3399	0	a	this game is so lagy
9847	1	a	I love this game The game is very good
9849	1	a	Greatest game to exist! Dinosaurs and vehicles!
9851	1	a	This game is actually pretty fun. It's by no means perfect, but I definitely don't think that the game deserves the low scores that it is getting. Also considering you can pick this game up for cheap on sales (I got it for $1) there is really no reason not to give this game a try. No it's not a AAA title. No it's not going to replace your favorite game, but it's an interesting game that is enjoyable and has a low entry price which is a win in my book.
9853	1	a	Its like Halo but with dinosaurs and stuff
3400	0	a	these reviews sound an awful lot like the captions in the trailer. The game is only worth maybe a dollar... and thats all i paid. it looks and plays like a dollar phone app anyway
3401	0	a	THIS GAME IS NOT PRIMAL CARNAGE - bought it for $1, still not worth it. Super boring, super repetitive, and the multiplayer doesn't work.
3402	0	a	I know it's only .99 cents right now, and I know their video says 'zomg, don't listen to all the negative reviews because we typed this message', but... it's totally a .99 cent game. Don't get me wrong, lots of work went into it, the idea sounds awesome, the first round was great (because I thought it would have actual gameplay once I learned the ropes). But... nope.
3403	0	a	i'm glad I got this when it was a buck because I'd be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ if I spend more than a dallor on this trash game. The controls are sluggish, the graphics are a joke and the overall evperience gets really boring after a few hours of playing. during matched you can upgrade your weapons and also yourself but for some reason the weapon area and the augment area are to far apart to get to both curing the cool down timer between waves. Why the hell do we have to return to 2 different building to upgrade our stuff. After a match it should be a menu you pull down and can upgrade whatever you want. I don't understand how this game has so many good reviews. dont waste your money
3404	0	a	It's like comma misuse but worse.
9855	1	a	I bought this game during the free week event. After trying the free version for one hour, I realized that it was good enough to spend one dollar on it. Well, I was mistaken. This game is worth its full price. Actually I love it. Maybe the graphics are not according to the new generation but that is not important for me. Once some bugs are fixed, I think this game is going to become one of my favourites. If you like games like counter strike, buy this one, you will like it too.
9857	1	a	Good game good for online not much for single but still good when you don't have internet.
9859	1	a	In all seriousness. I bought the game before seeing any reviews. After watching some reviews (that bombed the game into oblivion) I was worried about spending that 1 dollar per game. I bought a pack to play with friends and didnt even see it was f2p for 3 days :P. BUT I must say that even though it has some bugs wich aren't game breaking and a bit out of balanced pvp, the survival mode was great and I would even have payed 5-10 euro's for it. Just for the survival mode. It felt like a sort of halo coop game where you have to survive waves of dinosaurs and upgrade your gear (wich is quite fun to do and you have allot of options).   Verdict: If you are looking for a awesome deatmatch or team deathmatch game don't bother, there are way better games. But if you are looking for a great coop LAN game buy this indie misfit :). One of the most fun we had at our lan. In comparison we played: Loadout, Red alert 2, L4D2, Gary's mod, Cod5, Smite, UT2004, CSGO and Atomic bomberman.  P.S. For the devs: you can see the craftsmanship, sweat and tears of the developers in this game. They probably just needed better guidelines/manager and more polish. Try to make this games other gamemodes better and good luck on your next endevour.
9861	1	a	♥♥♥♥in sucks, they release a video saying its become so much beter, but all of that is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t
9863	1	a	It was so fun to play
9865	1	a	it is pretty fun.
9867	1	a	This game is nearly like primal carnage. It could do with a bit of work but either than that it's ok. You get more veritys of dinosaurs. I recommend it. :)
9869	1	a	Fun game to play with friends. Dinosaurs, vehicles, jetpacks and plenty of guns.
3408	0	a	This game is downright horrible, check the reviews on youtube (TotalBiscuit, Tobuscus) for the reasons why because its g.o.d.d.a.m.n awful. Played for an hour and uninstalled. Wasn't even worth my 0.99 euros.
9871	1	a	it vary fun:) 
9873	1	a	:3
9875	1	a	Best indie game EVER!! its halo meets killing floor with a little bit of jurrassic park.metacritic review is not for this game but actually for its predessesor.persistent ranking and the best coop mechanics to date (simply click on a friend to instantly add to party).9.1 out of 10 as more content is on its way 
3409	0	a	I would say this game is just bad. The sound volumes for some things are way too loud, when others are too dim. The character animations are bad, gunplay isn't that bad and movement system is somewhat nice. But still i wouldn't spend even 99 cents on this.
9877	1	a	More fun than you will find with Killing Floor and for £3 less ($5). This game has more to offer than the usual 'kill hordes of things' gameplay and gives more in the way of customization than one might expect from this genera of game. We were plesantly suprised with the comeback that this game made, and not to use the feaux-statement of 'New and Improved' (as how can something be new AND improved?) but if there were ever a time to use it, it is now. The game feels different than it did before and, with luck, will bring players back. 8/10 [Deductions] -There isn't much in the ways of plot or writing. -No emotional or immersive investment in the game.
9879	1	a	This game is one of the games, with a replay factor. Good for LAN's and with friends. Really love it and think it is worth supporting the Spiral team. If the Orion: Prelude Kickstarter is going in this direction, i will definetly buy it as well.
9881	1	a	Best game to play with friends.
3417	0	a	pros: lovey graphics   cons: the game my 24 inch monitor wont fit bad sound effects i have a 5.20ghz but i still had to run it on low graphics  and the modles look terrbal thank god i got it for 99p i would love to reccmend this game but its not even ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ wervay sorry ;(
9883	1	a	Best 99p I've ever spent. I loved it so much i proposed it... it said no, it was to good for me
9885	1	a	Stupid, awesome, dino-killing fun. Bit basic as far as today's shooters go, but that's where the stupid fun comes into play. Tons of game modes too. Vehicles are fun, I didn't expect there to be mech's, a tank from halo, and a choppa. As far as weapons go there is a Light Saber, laser guns, assault rifles, and a 'perk' system that can make you into a different fighter each game.
9887	1	a	Great fun for some 3rd/1st person dino killing action
3420	0	a	Game is impossible to play by yourself, there is no scaling for single player when you have a weak pistol. Trying to get into a lobby so I didnt have to play alone tried for ten minutes with no success. Glad I got it on a sale price of almost 95% off.
9889	1	a	This is legitamely the most fun I've ever had with one dollar. Grab some buddies, spend a dollar, and have a blast! Don't miss your chance, get while it's still over 90% off!
9891	1	a	Orion: Dino Horde is a wave survival type of game, there are pvp modes, but pvp is not needed to enjoy this game. If you're fond of wave survival games, this is for you. But i will say this game is kinda hit or miss. It seems hard to get a public game going, you have to wait awhile or hope to find one. Like any game, this one has it's pros and cons. But if you like wave survival and dinosaurs, this one is for you!
9893	1	a	Great game with terrific dinosaurs and guns. This game perfectly integrates our love for dinosaurs and call of duty mechanics. Couldn't be better 10/10
9895	1	a	addictivly fun, reminds me a bit of halo, section 8.
9897	1	a	This game is really fun! It's got Dinosaurs, vehicles, mechs, and so many customizable weapons. I highly reccomend it playing it with friends, as it only adds to the experiance. What more is there to say? Get it now!
9899	1	a	For off the wall fun this game is it.
3424	0	a	while i only payed a dollar for the game and got more then what i payed for i have to say the reviews of improvements of this game are greatly exaggerated. the hit boxes of the dinosaurs are something even red 5 would laugh at. (infamous for hit boxes that counted necks as part of the head). the connection even with a ethernet cable was horrid. the character models are so outdated that even models from star wars clone comando look better in comparison. the store's ui is cluttered and has no way of tracking expenses for items put on a character. the taunts and various animations.... i think even hi rez put more effort into their emotes and they were free. now for the REAL gameplay.  first off i bought the LMG assuming it was a large machine gun... apparently LMG = burst rifle..... thats a simple error to fix in 30 sec.. you dont have an LMG you have a burst rifle. bow was fun but kind of impractical. (however bow weapons tend to be heavily connection dependent to be practical). using the mouse to steer the vehicles when most controls for tanks rely heavily on the wasd keys and using the mouse for turret control was aggravating (but tolerable... tom clancy games have button mapping that was worse) .  settings are set to all optional parts enabled (motion blur, bloom, etc) and high settings. disabling most of the optional settings makes the game playable but connectivty issues and wonky hitboxes are never good for a game no matter how pretty.  the hats.... just.... just no.... i mean if the hat replaced the helmet instead of being on top of it maybe .... other wise... no. even tf2 knows better then to allow clipping of cosmetic items.  however.... this game isnt something from the bowls of hell.... its kind of a fun idea though i was never into being a sci fi dinosaur killer and this game has raised a slight interest. I also have to give props to the developer still putting the time and effort to at least try to make the game better. something we dont see enough of these days in an age where companies like hi rez and activision make a game cash the paycheck for a year then abandon it for a new project in a different genre.  In fact id love to see this game on a new engine with updated charcter models.... and working hit boxes -_-....and a more intuitive UI.  people are arguing its worthy of an 83 or an 80 on the meta critic score... after my expereince that is not the case. the game has definitely made steps forward from the 30 it originally received but not worthy of a 82. this game id have to say a 63 would be a much more accurate score of the game. its no triple A title and with a setting such as sci fi soldiers killing dinosaurs i already had low expectations... which surprised me in good ways and bad as well. there are large areas for improvement just to make the game a 75 worthy score and even an hour of gameplay is enough to see that. it was fun for a dollar and i hope it gets put into their next project. these guys have a nice idea.... just need to do a bit better job of executing it.   if ya got a spare buck give it a shot for a couple hours have a little derpy fun.... and never speak of it again. 
9901	1	a	Better than you would expect. Killing Floor: Dino Edition.
9903	1	a	In a given match, my experiences have varied wildy between laughably bad and surprisingly good. Some parts look gorgeous while others look like poop. I'd buy it while it's on sale.
9905	1	a	With all the technology that goes into games, it was only a matter of time for something like this to come around--and it's about damn time.   Think counterstrike but with the addition of vehicles, and you're fighting endless waves of dinosaurs...and you're shooting them with rockets and lasers...from a jetpack.   As hilarious and entertaining as the game is, please note it is still in development. However, the reports of bugs/crashes are greatly outdated. As of this review on 2-25-14, I have played COD: Ghosts and Dino Horde for the same amount of time. Ghosts has crashed 5 times while Dino Horde hasn't at all.   Well worth your time!
9907	1	a	dinosaurs vs guns and jet packs....and it's still a real challenge! get this if you have buddies to play it with. worth every penny!
3426	0	a	This game was worth the $0.75 I paid for it.
9909	1	a	Very fun and quick paced game! Easy to get into and improve in. I've been playing as the support class and been enjoying the war against the dino hordes a great deal. AI is decent and will try to hit you were it hurts which isn't always you :) And will try to swing around and flank you. Plenty of game modes to change the pace of the action and playable Dino's! If you like space marines blowing away prehistoric animals with all your dream weapons, Then Orion: Dino horde is for you!
9911	1	a	Its fun I dont understand the hate for this game, its a defend a base style game with dinos. Its a wonderful game to play with friends and i hope they expand on perks and weapons soon.
9913	1	a	Lots of fun, worth the purchase
9915	1	a	DEFINENTELY WORTH IT :D  I spent all my school day playing this (offline), and still wasnt board.  The reason this game was rated so low was that  A- Nothing was origonal B- Half the stuff has no animation (come on, at least make the flamethrower shoot fire :3)  If you put this aside, it is definentely worth it! Really fun, online and offine mods, and hopefully more graphical updates are coming :3
9917	1	a	The metacritc score is misleading that was for the first part of the game THIS GAME IS WORTH THE BUY NOW I PROMISE LOL ITS PRETTY ♥♥♥♥ING SICK AND FUN TRUST ME
9919	1	a	They did the cash shop right! Cheap easy and fast, just like my favorite kinda hooke--- tv dinner!  Graphics are great, though I wish the 3rd person view could be zoomed out a little. It would also be nice to have starting weapon for survival instaead of a pistol  All around 4/5!
9921	1	a	A mixture of 'halo' 'killing floor' and 'jurassic park' this game is so unbelievably fun that i can guarantee even the most boring of people 50 hours total game time if not more
9923	1	a	Shooting Dinos instead of zombies! very fun!
9925	1	a	Wow this game is ridiculously fun. Get it!! Only 99 cents for a limited time! (Feb. 27th?)
9927	1	a	lots of mindless fun
3427	0	a	This game is the most broken, unfinished, rushed unattractive game ive ever played, the controls are broken and in many cases..just start huffing paint and stop working completely, multiple crashes, barely rendered textures and an atmosphere that makes me want to place a colt 44 revolver in my mouth and squeeze the trigger, never ever EVER buy this game...theres a reason it was 92% off...  Just go play turok, it works its pretty, and it doesnt make me feel like a 4 year old with a disability.
9929	1	a	Combine Killing Floor and Halo, what do you get? Instead of zombies, there are dinos, but in a futuristic world similar to Halo, very COOL and fun.
9931	1	a	It is--at least--worth $0.99.  Unless you're odd.
9933	1	a	I would very much recommend this game! The metacritic score does not belong here! I have had a blast playing this game, and not to mention its 99 cents right now! Buy this game and partake in some of the best cooperative survival games I've ever played.
3430	0	a	Just another game that doesn't take itself seriously. Could be fun with friends, just to enjoy shooting at dinosaurs and see them chewing on human-made machines (?) Not great, not bad, if you're into Jurassic Park check it out.
9935	1	a	This is not a great game - it's pretty buggy, poorly balanced, poorly animated, unpolished, very cheesy, and actually pretty fun to play.
9937	1	a	It looks cheap and it is not the best game But for 1 ♥♥♥♥♥ dollar i should hella take it meta is wrong you really really should buy this game if you are going to play this with your friends. So think about it.
9939	1	a	No idea how the game earlier was, but I played with a friend the demo and was blown away. We are now 4 and all bought it and play it and it's amazing!!! You need to play in a team to win. It's fast, simple, needs strategy... It's a blast. And I'm very very picky with games. Would buy again even for 30.- Euro plus. Everything lower is just a steal.
9941	1	a	Yep totally cool.Very good graphics and the atmosphere feels so real!
9943	1	a	Paid next to nothing for this game and after playing for a while i'd probably buy this game at full price if i had too. Awesome game once you get into it and the PvP game types are just fun (if not more fun) than the game types with dinosaurs. I would recommend getting this to anyone especially if your the FPS gamer typer.
9945	1	a	Very great game!
9947	1	a	This game is surprisingly awesome. It's like Turok and a weird TD had a child and that child was slightly antisocial but once you get to know him he is actually pretty cool.
3433	0	a	For $1, I was pretty disappointed.
9949	1	a	Great game if you have some friends to play it with.
9951	1	a	This game is extremely fun, especially with other players. A teradactyl was flying in the air and I shot it down with a tank projectile, and killed it one shot. Then everybody told me 'Wow nice shot'. This game is awesome. One minute you're jetpacking away from a T-Rex, the next you're helping a teammate survive the horde of 'dinos'. If you like co-op, and the Unreal 3 Engine, then buy this game. It could use the support, and you could use the fun.
9953	1	a	I think the metascore doesnt pay justice to the game. It is a really fun game to play with friends. Get them to buy it also or buy a 4-pack. Get it when it has a discount on it. You can't go wrong!
9955	1	a	Better than expected. I feel the 'open world' mode is a bit of a disclaimer, but maybe I just didn't play it enough. It deserves a higher raiting than it got from its initial release, but still isn't my cup o' tea.
3438	0	a	I bought Pulsar: Lost Colony. It was accidentally released to the public in a non-working pre alpha state. Pulsar was more entertaining than this. The Video says something to the tune of 'Ignore the metacritic score. The devs listened to us and made this game better.' If this is better, I can't imagine the state it was in before. Who designed the levels? What's the point of spawning over a kilometer away from your DEFEND OBJECTIVE? You can't even set up stationary defenses along the way. You literally have to spend 5 minutes makin the trek to your base, or get lucky and stumble upon a vehicle. WHY????
9957	1	a	it's all right as it goes !! 
3439	0	a	Dont waste your money on this trash game!
9959	1	a	Its pretty damn good =3
9961	1	a	For $0.99, this is a great deal. The game suffers from a fair amount of latency issues, but is well worth a try despite it.
3441	0	a	Lags, frame drops, black screen, crashes, sound skipping. And dinosaurs. 30 euro? Are you crazy? This is hardly a beta, I'd say it's an alpha edition, not a final product. Yup, my PC meets the minimal technical requirements.  I do NOT recommend that you buy this game.
9963	1	a	heard a lot of hate originally, then the game came back out of no where awhile later, and now i cant stop playing!
9965	1	a	Got this game when it was on sale for $0.99. Best dollar I spent. Great game guys, keep it up 
3442	0	a	Average not my type of game but .... Average
9967	1	a	You get to shoot Dino's! 10/10
3443	0	a	I felt i was playing the first halo but with dinosaurs which doesn't sound bad at all. When i actually played the game i realized i was wrong. The game never really seems to go anywhere and after a few matches feels old. Its like heres some guns now go shoot some dinosaurs! But even then, the dinosaurs only rush your position and the only needed strategy needed is to walk backwards and spray. Im glad I didn't pay the full price for this because i would have been seriously disappointed.
9969	1	a	Great fun! very simple yet addictive, well recomended.
3444	0	a	Don't play it, it's bad, trust me..Despite being warned by a friend I thought I should give the game a try..Within the first 10 second my impression was: AWFUL. Textures are far from even an average 'standard' quality for PC...Guns feels weird, hard to aim, horrible sound and also feel weight less..FOV is low, makes you motion sick and nope, you can't adjust it.
3445	0	a	Pro: I get to shoot dinosaurs. Con: Dinosaurs do not shoot lasers back Con: Can not play as laser shooting dinosaur.
9971	1	a	i played this for 5 hours straight brillant game.
9973	1	a	fun, but laggy i also wish the weapons were permenant but nope they are not permenant at all. 
9975	1	a	I recomend this game if u are a fan of first person shooters and dinos but I unfortionatly cant play it anymore because the thing is done and the funny thing is tht my brother tried to buy it gor me but it dont go through and so they should of extended it for a couple more hours so tht I could continue to play this awesome game   
9977	1	a	Bought it for $0.99, I wouldn't have bought it otherwise for $15. But that's just cause i'm cheap. Either way, really fun game to mess arround in..hell, you can backstab a triceratops! Not disapointed at all!
3446	0	a	This is very good game,I played and i like it
9979	1	a	Very fun, could use a few tweaks to speed up or slow down time between rounds. A digital manual or tutorial would be nice. 7 out of 10 so far. I can't wait to try the next itteration.
9981	1	a	My favorite game. It's an amazing game with a bunch of different ways to play.
3447	0	a	Lmao Ill tell you right now the games not even worth $14.99, I was given the game by a friend a while ago when it first came out. After the first like 15 mins I uninstalled because it was garbage. I came back just a little while ago because I seen they changed it since then and what not. No its still garbage. I almost bought it for 2 of my friends for the $ 0.99 however I didnt feel like it would be played much and would be a waste of $2 which i could go and get a soda or something better then this game. It looks amazing looks like it would be a lot of fun and maybe it is? but I just can not stand the graphics, the animations, or the gameplay myself.
3448	0	a	Buggy gameplay, sticky dinosaurs, horrible dino control. 10/10. will never play again.
9983	1	a	A little rouch around the edges but fun to play in small intervals. The price tag is a bit steep for the product that is offered, although the developers do keep updating the game. Hopefully this game will evolve into a more polished experience.
9985	1	a	♥♥♥♥ gets intense, wish there were more players to play with, awesome game
9987	1	a	Game is super..
3450	0	a	though this game is filled with great graphics and dinosaurs, this game is full of glitches and crashes, not to mention if your playing with friends it takes forever to find a server for your friends to play on and even creating a server for the host it lags out , I just got this game and it asks me to buy it AGAIN ! well i wont this is a lesson to all of you dont waste your money like I did !
3451	0	a	This isn't a good game, but for a 99 cent sale I could consider buying it then. But not for 15 freaking dollars.
9989	1	a	Really Good! One man or many versus DINOSAURS! How cool is that!? 
9991	1	a	♥♥♥♥♥ dinosaurs and ♥♥♥♥. Gud gam.
9993	1	a	this game was super fun i recommend multiplayer but i loved being a dinosaur and a dino killer i made lots of freinds and warning tis game is very addictive.
9995	1	a	I happened to get it recently since it was on sale for $0.99 (I'm not gonna pass a deal like that up) and I feel that it was money more than well spent. I'd even go so far as to say that I'd be willing to shell out the usual $15 if I had to. There is nothing I dislike about this game. It's a fun slant on the usual wave survival/tower defense style game and it features a variety of game modes besides that. There is even one where you can play as the dinos.  All in all, I'd reccomend this game to anyone who likes FPS.
9997	1	a	Ahaha, oh man. Worth every penny of the $0.99 it's currently going for. Hilariously bad, so bad it's kind of good. Absolutely mindless entertainment. It's kind of like Serious Sam, but less serious. Great if you've got a group of friends who liked Halo:CE multiplayer and Killing Floor and hate dinosaurs (and want to kill them).  Haven't touched anything but basic survival mode, and haven't even opened the cash shop as it seems pointless.  Don't expect anything going into it, and you'll probably enjoy it quite a bit.
9999	1	a	The ♥♥♥♥? Or is it ♥♥♥♥?
