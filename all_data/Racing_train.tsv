1	1	a	  Death Rally   is a top-down combat racing game. Arrested for a series of crime and illegal racing, you avoid jail by participating in the Death Rally tournament where you must attract the attention of a murderous driver known as The Adversary.   Pros : This is a remake of a DOS game by the same name. You race against six opponents (always including one champion) through desert canyons, frozen strips and urban centers. Maps are pretty varied, and some races will drive the track in inverse, other times you'll have specific challenges or handicaps that keep each race fresh. The money you make is spent on upgrading your car's speed, handling and armor, while additional car models, weapons and equipment are unlocked by finding loot drops from other drivers' wreckage during races. Each car has a different acceleration and upgrade cap, while each weapon has a different attack pattern, damage rating and ammo capacity. The game looks great, only some textures and occasional close-up will show this was ported from iOS. As for the control, it is smooth and spot-on (at least with a keyboard, which is what I used 20 years ago with the original   Death Rally  ). In true tradition of the original game, it has multiple cameos from other games.   Cons : Gaining levels and money for your upgrades will require you to race A LOT, and the level variety only goes so far, you might find a certain repetitiveness only fans of top-down racing games will tolerate. There isn't much weapon variety, and as soon as you equip a better weapon, you no longer have any control over you base machine gun. Until you master each race track (in either direction), you'll find it near impossible to win the hard races, even with the most upgraded car and weapon, so get ready to do hundreds of races before you can really excel and start climbing the level rankings. The story is nothing more than an excuse for the setting, the story-based campaign is something you're unlikely to repeat.   Verdict : â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜† - Next on your list!  I really enjoyed this game. Although a mobile port, it is still one of the most polished top-down racing games out there. This genre isn't everyone's cup of tea, but if it's yours, I urge you to give  Death Rally  a try!  â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”   This was just my opinion.   If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated)  reviews . 
5	0	a	This game is filled with lazy design to the brim. Rubber banding, synchronous scaling, non-existent difficulty curve and so on. Accordingly it gets boring extremely fast. You can easily see the mobile game roots of this and they show their worst side. Grind without any substantial progress and achievements requiring you to basicly shut your head off and hold a button for 50 hours.  There is no value to be found here, stay away from this 'game'!
3	1	a	Death Rally is one of those game that gets lost somewhere between 'Hey this is fun' and 'Hmm, that could've been better..' The game looks pretty solid, but, looks are not everything. As soon as it comes down to the controls you might find yourself a bit lost. Not in the way of not knowing what button to press, bt more like 'Am I this stupid or is the game so sensible?' And to be honest, you won't get an answer. Sure, you need to develop some bit of a 'skill' to operate your vehicle of doom delivery, but you'll never end up with a ride that satisfies your control needs for a full 100% Maybe it's a design choice, maybe it's lack of understanding or interest concerning tuning final gameplay. Another thing is the actual upgrade and rank gaining feature. It's a bit like with that newer game 'Gimbal' looks nice sounds cool, need MORE!. Not enough options and not enough satisfaction for the upgrade part of the game. As a single player game it's a middle thing on the lower part. Let's say 6 out of 10 points regarding final concept. 3 Months more and $50,000 more would have done a lot for this game. Hmm, that probably goes for most games out there. Anyway, as a bargain price Death rally is good enough. But don't buy this at full price. It's not a game to feel bad about, you'll just don't get what you might expect if you buy this because of a similar movie franchise. It has nothing to do with that.
8	0	a	Going through the hassle of finding the original and getting it to work is less annoying than playing this 'game'...
5	1	a	Brilliant fun top down combat racing game. It was released as an app. first so don't expect too much of it though.
9	0	a	It's garbage. The handling is horrible and everything looks 'poor'. Yes you can play it with your friends, but you won't. Does not worth 1â‚¬.
7	1	a	Absolute classic arcade styler top down racer with bang! Played the original so many years ago and this remake does it jsutice! Hail to the King baby!
9	1	a	one of the most funny arcade topdown driving games i played so far.
11	1	a	Crazy fun little top-down combat racer. Graphics are very nice and the weapons feel great. The level up system is easily exploited though.
13	1	a	ENG:  Beautifully renovated, the original DR-game, a testimonial! : 3  FIN:  Upeasti uudistettu, alkuperÃ¤inen DR-peli, suositteluni! :3
15	1	a	Not as good as the original, definitely easier but still fun if you're looking for something casual.
17	1	a	I loved the original, I still sometimes play it. So when I got this on a sale price I could not resist getting it. I have not been sorry at all. It is not the exact copy of the original, but it has kept a lot of what made the original a classic. The handling of the cars is not overly difficult, but just so that it is not to easy. I love the fact that you donâ€™t have to be in front to win when your weapons are well upgraded and used in the game. One feature I do miss is how you pick the venue and then you can see who is up to race and then you can decide if you want to race. So if I could ask for one chance that would be it. All and all this is a fun game that can be played over and over again.
19	1	a	****Possible spoliers****  Quick PRO/CON list for anyone who doesn't want to read too much:  Pro: - Top down driving with good camera and controls. - Brings back memories of Death Race 2000 and Carmageddon - Variety of vehicles and weapons to unlock. - Graphics, for the kind of game, are clean and do the job despite being a bit dated by today's standards. - You can win a race by placing first (duh) OR by taking out the competition - and they occasionally take each other out. Or sometimes you.  Con - 'Meh' voice acting. Blame 'Tex'. - Weapons and vehicles unlocked through picking up parts. - Can't save money between races. - Some races inherently unfair. - Pick-ups during races come in sometimes hard to destroy boxes. This is due to a poor design of the main weapon that 'autofires' when it sees fit. - Randomness of pick-ups makes it easy to win some races, and frustrating to win others. - Unless you have a lot of armour and/or a really fast vehicle you probably don't want to be in front of anyone at the start of a race. Only mines fire to the rear and you only get 3 - and they never replenish during a race.  An ok top down racer with an extremely limited number of tracks and a rather dull story. But the game's not about the story as much as the race and at least most of the actual racing was fairly fun.  By the end of the game you'll be sick of driving the same tracks over and over and over. I was also very tired of whatever Tex mumbles. Tex looks like an oversized George Lucas, by the way.   Graphics are good, clean, and the vehicles and scenery look pretty good. The cars are responsive, especially if you work on the handling stat, and there are a number of extra weapons you can eventually unlock, level up and use - but only one 'special' at a time. Some are way, way better than others. The shotgun I found to be almost useless, for example, while the rocket at level 1 was far better than a level 9 shotgun. Unlock cars and weapons by picking up parts during races.  The 'shadow man' shows up once in a while (via phone call) to offer you advangtages on a per-race basis for a cut of your profits.  The end race against The Stig .. er I mean The Adversary ... was annoying and completely luck based for me. I'd have lost again if it wasn't for lucky nitrous drops at the right times, and a lucky bump that sent The Adversary into the wall just before my last nitro kick to the finish line.  This game os a 6/10 as it is. MAYBE a 7/10 if you really like this genre - and I mean *REALLY* like, as I like it but not enough to be generous and give it more than 60%. Still, gotta recommend it as it's not terrible.  It could have been better with the simple addition of longer, better tracks to race on. I didn't find driving the tracks in reverse to be much good for variety, although they do feel different in reverse. I don't mean longer as in more laps like the 42 lap marathon race without weapons - I mean slightly larger tracks. Some of them are so compact that you're at the final lap (Note that the final lap is usually the 3d, sometimes you're in a one lap race so that's SUPER short) before you've played much more than 70 seconds. Yup. 70. Seconds. Some one lap races last 20 to 25 seconds or so. Yup, takes longer to spend your earnings.  With better design decisions this could have been a 10/10 for sure. I'd pay for a simlar game that has no instant repair or ammo pick-ups during the race. It could have stats that can be improved for the driver and vehicles that are upgraded with parts you purchase with cash from your winnings. You could unlock different parts by making contacts or spending cash. Make it roguelike with perma-death *IF* you actually die when the vehicle is disabled and it would be even better. Improved ranking system, multiple places to race, larger vehicle selection, ability to mount weapons facing EITHER DIRECTION... *sigh*. I'll shut up now, y'all know what I want.
21	1	a	All for all it's a good game,  Still not near the old one though.
10	0	a	It kinda worth the sale price if you have some history with the 1996 version of this game. I wouldn't recommend it to new players though.  It's a rather boring race game with few tracks and half of these tracks are not enjoyable to play because of tight curves. Full upgraded cars don't make you overpowered, even against lower level races, so winning a race (or making money for upgrades) is rather luck for getting the right items from boxes than skill or hard work. Also, you can restart any race without penalties, which make the game less challenging.   This would make this a neutral review, but there is something that make the game worse. You can't beat the story mode. The game crashes when you beat the last boss and the story, which is not even a good story, has no end. 4/10 for 90's players, 2/10 for newcomers.
23	1	a	Death Rally is a port of Remedyâ€™s 2012 iOS racing/destruction game of the same name. I picked it up on sale for $3.50 and itâ€™s proven to be a good value for the money. The mechanics are absurdly straightforward, the story is so shallow that it borders on pointless, and yet the upgrade system redeems this arcade racer and turns it from something tedious to something genuinely fun and engaging.  The story, such as it is, is that a Joe Arpaio-type sheriff arrests the player, a young punk, for some driving-related mischief and, rather than putting him in a pink dress and sending him to pick up trash along the highway like any normal insane Arizona law-enforcement official, he recruits the maverick to challenge other neâ€™er-do-wells to deadly races in hopes of luring an archcriminal known as The Adversary out of hiding so that he may be captured or killed. Thatâ€™s basically it. The story plays out through a total of three cutscenes interspersed among the story missions, which are unlocked as your fame level or upgrades are purchased.  Non-story gameplay consists of selecting from among a group of seven randomly-chosen tracks/difficulty levels or playing a challenge mode race, which generally has a specific objective or vehicle/weapon loadout. If you donâ€™t like the options provided, you can always click the â€œstoryâ€ button twice and the computer will present you with a new batch (I personally preferred the â€œPitâ€ track because itâ€™s the least twisty and Iâ€™m not very good at these kinds of games).  Winning or losing races will grant you varying levels of financial rewards which are used to purchase upgrades. There are six primary weapons to unlock and select from (not counting mines) and each vehicle has three characteristics to enhance (speed, handling, and armor). You get more money for killing your opponents or placing better than sixth (each race features five AI opponents).  Graphics are about what youâ€™d expect from a top-down racer in 2012, neither spectacular nor underwhelming. Sound effects are serviceable and the cutscene voice-acting is atrocious (on purpose, I suspect). The music is limited to what you hear in the main menu, apart from one Poets of the Fall track that plays over the end credits (Remedy must have a long-term licensing deal with that band, as their music was all over the Alan Wake games).  The game is not without its quirks. It will not load in fullscreen by default at your computerâ€™s native resolution, which means you have to take the following steps to resolve this: go to the Settings menu, change the resolution to something lower-than-native, click the â€œWindowedâ€ button to â€œNoâ€, and then change the resolution to native. This would be a very trivial point if the game remembered your settings between sessions but it doesnâ€™t, so youâ€™ll be doing this every time you load the game. Your alternative is to play in a window but I wouldnâ€™t recommend it; given the amount of frantic clicking that the gameplay demands, you will inevitably click outside of the window, thereby losing the race for yourself and after you do this a few times, youâ€™ll give up and resign yourself to the above process. The PC controls for the mouse and keyboard work but theyâ€™re not great; as with most racing games youâ€™ll want to use a controller and youâ€™re best off with an XBOX controller (unless you enjoy fiddling with things like MotioninJoy). As with many PC games, the controller configuration is very limited and it doesnâ€™t work very well at all with my Logitech Rumblepad 2, although I can generally get the Rumblepad to play well with other racers like Burnout Paradise.  On the whole, though, itâ€™s curiously satisfying to upgrade your vehicles and weaponry and kick â™¥â™¥â™¥ in random races, which is the essence of this game. I put 13 hours into it, beating the story mode (that Adversary is a tough nut to crack) and getting most (84%) of the achievements in the process; you may get some extra value out of it if you enjoy competitive online multiplayer modes but these generally arenâ€™t my bag. I can say itâ€™s well worth buying, especially if you nab it during a decent sale.
11	0	a	If you don't want to read the tl;dr below I'll sum up this game like this: 'Race, Kill, Upgrade,' rinse and repeat all over without emotion until you win.  First of all It's a fun/good game in all matters. If you buy this thinking about the good old times of the 1996 version then you might get a little bit dissapointed. The depth of story and mechanics lacks short and if you though racing was about winning... Well in Death Rally it's all about staying behind and killing people to get parts to the next car.  There is no actual difficulty settings, as you can get in trouble by the first tier of vehicles when you already have a fully upgraded top car. Killing cars is also a bit more annoying as you never know for sure how long will it take to finish one off.  Game is indeed fun an all, but lacks emotion when comes to important aspects. Fans of the first version of the game will be sad to think this is the best they could make, and I'm glad I bought this on a sale because at full price I'd be a bit more sad.  
25	1	a	A must-have if you have played the retro game.
27	1	a	I'm recommending the game because, after all, it's still mostly enjoyable top-down racing BUT please do not misunderstand: if you played and enjoyed the original, like me, this remake is not ANYWHERE near as good.  Let me summarize:  The visuals are effective - not great, but good enough. It's obvious that this game was first released on iOS and you can clearly see that the developers did NOT bother to increase the detail on the models (textures might have been improved, hard to tell, but the polygon count is very visibly low). Cars like the Deliverator definitely don't look as cool as they used to in the original, but that's subjective I guess.  Music and sound effects are bare minimum. Music was never a strong point of Death Rally so I'm not too bothered by the rather generic, boring and colorless rock tracks they put into this new version. The sound effects are okay, nothing to criticize too much here.  The biggest issue, to me, is the way they changed the in-game economy (ie. the shops - everything you did between races). In the original DOS game, you had the (legal) shop and the (illegal) black market. You had money and you would make important decisions what upgrade or car to save money for. This was a big part of playing the game and the separation between the clean shop and the dirty blackmarket (where you'd get all the good, ie. illegal, stuff) also added a very nice and grimy aspect to the game. Well, they removed ALL of this in the 2012 release. Now you don't even really have money anymore. Sure, you collect dollars but then, all they do, is fill up 'upgrade bars'. It was amazing to be able to safe cash to finally get to buy that amazing and mysterious Deliverator in the original - now cars don't even cost money anymore! You just unlock them by collecting parts on the race track! Now you just click on the armor, handling or speed bar and it fills it up automatically with your money. That's it.  The fact that they completely omitted the black market is also indicative of another change they made: the atmosphere, the vibe of the game, is now very typically iOS orientated. This new game is almost family-friendly while the old one was dark and, well, just plain cool. The writing used to be excellent, in my opinion, really putting you into that oil-stained illegal street-racing, loan-sharking, drug-collecting world. The new version you're buying here is bland and clean, almost sterile. The writing is bad (literally: there's a lot of typos and language errors in the game) and colorless. Even the interface is generic in its 'brushed metal' look.  Another annoyance is the length of the races. Once again, there's the iOS influence. The race length is between 30 and 50 secs average. It's often times NOT enough to kill opponents and it's definitely never enough to actually get 'into' a race. This is clearly designed to be played on mobile Apple devices on breaks, in the bus or on the train.  There's definitely more issues that set this 2012 version behind the original DOS release but those are the main points of frustration to me. However, as I said above, after all's been said and done, this is STILL enjoyable. The actual gameplay is, despite some flaws, still the same good old top-down driving, shooting and killing fun. I bought this on sale for less than two Euros and, for that price, it's a no-brainer must-buy, no question, I would however regret my purchase had I payed full price for it.
29	1	a	Imagine sitting down and watching NASCAR for 80 hours, but there's Geoff Keighley there, too, for some reason.  That's what it's like to play this game.
31	1	a	I have mixed feelings about this game. On the one hand its alot of fun to race and blow all your opponents up but on the other hand it can get frustrating to get shot at all the time. I have really enjoyed this game from start to finish even though some of the achievements are nuts and hard to get. The thing that was frustrating for me was the game never fully going in to full screen mode. The option is there but it would never do it for me. The gamemodes can get repetitive at times if you are trying to grind away at kills and other things. The nice thing about all the achievements is that you don't need to play against a live human to get some of them. The 'Online' play can be done with bots, and the achievements for 'Online' can be done just like if you were playing against the computer. The cars can be customize which is a nice feature to have. The controls can feel crazy at first but with some practice you can get really good at fully controlling the car. If you like a full on shooter/racer game then this is the game to get. I mainly got it because I thought the achievements would be easy to get and for the most part they were, but some you will need alot of patience to get. I would say get it but make sure you get it while its on sale, then you will feel like you got your monies worth.
33	1	a	Decent mobile port of a remake  Story: 15/25 Gameplay: 20/25 Graphics: 18/25 Sound: 16/25  OVERALL: 69/100  This is a game where you race cars with pew-pew guns. So, the story is pretty nonexistent most of the time, but it's there. The gameplay is fun and fairly satisfying most of the time. However, in later stages when your car is maxed out and you know what you're doing, it gets really boring as you just get ay ahead and you just ... turn. Te graphics and sound are okay. Everything starts to look pretty bland and you start to tune out the sound, but ... oh well. Pretty solid for a mobile port and a remake of a game from 1996.
17	0	a	Death Rally combines the exciting destrcution of Twisted Metal with a side of racing. It's a fun little game that'll keep you busy for a bit, but you'll only be able to play in single player mode, because NO ONE plays online. I've tried many times, and its not recommended to keep online mode on in this game because you'll lose the ranking you get working your way up in story mode.  Its not worth the $10. Now, while I haven't played the original or mobile game, I can say this version of the game sucks. I give this game a 3.2/10
35	1	a	no need to reinvent the wheel, Death rally is here
20	0	a	If it's on sale for a few cents, it's kind of worth it. The total time to see everything and the game become boring is more or less 3 hours.
21	0	a	Stupid mobile port. I thought they might have added a few things but nope. Honestly just buy the original and play that again. You'll have a way better time.
22	0	a	Mediocre game, the racing part is poor and the shooting part too. I didn't expect an accurate simulation for the driving model, but even for an arcade game it is below average.  + neat gfx and layout, unfortunately that's pretty much all.  - poor sense of speed or acceleration, even with Nitro boost - average control, the game use absolute direction ( instead of relative to your car) - driving doesn't requires much skills, so you don't get any satisfaction. - only 8 tracks,  - the 'massive' campaign is only 7 races longs (less than 15 min) - What is really massive is the excessive grind required (smell mobile game) - dull gameplay, if you try to race from the 1st place you'll get destroyed by the opposition, best tactics seems to start from behind and kill as much opponent as possible, then use Boost to try to take the lead in the last turn.  Not so fun. There are much better racing games around. It is a mobile port and is just below average for PC
23	0	a	Do not buy this on nostalgia alone. You will be disappointed. The original has more features then this remake
24	0	a	Stick to the original. This attempt at a reboot is horrendous! There's too much emphasis on power sliding (even with handling maxed out), and the enemy's stats scale with difficulty. The original was great because the progression was consistent and you struggled to break the power curve, the point at which you become a serious contender. There are 3 things I absolutely loathe about this one: Poor handling, poor progression, and ridiculous 'hidden' enemy HP. In the original, as soon as the life meter ran out, cars blew up. Here, they enter a 'red, flashing danger' mode and continue to take extra hits before getting knocked out. This puts the emphasis more on the racing, while the original gave you total freedom. Stay away from this one!
37	1	a	The classic Death Rally has returned! Though without a lot of the personality that made the original game such a favourite of mine.  Some of the weapons and abilities don't seem as useful as others. The camera angles are sometimes a bit off putting and I find it hard to dodge objects at times, due to the camera not showing me what's coming up ahead.  Recommended, but I remain disappointed that this game could have been much better.
39	1	a	If you played the DOS version, then this one has some great improvements over the old one. If you're new to this game, then you are in for a treat.
41	1	a	They stayed true to the classic. If your looking for a cheap thrill with friends this is great.  Although there doesn't seem to be anyone else online.  Too bad tho, this game would be ALOT better with more players.

49	1	a	nice game,good graphics,good racing system how to destroy your opponents
51	1	a	  7/10 
53	1	a	Awesome Spiritual Sequel to the original MS-DOS/Windows 95 Death Ralley. Not particularly great controls but the series has never been great on controls(its part of its charm). I would recommend this for those who remember the original title. Probably steer clear if you have never played the original
55	1	a	It's like Christmas! WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
45	0	a	Within 15 minutes of playtime it becomes obvious that Death Rally was originally an Ipad/Iphone game. Following the story and having finished the available missions I would think that more tracks/missions would unlock. But that was not the case. There are about 8 tracks, and they are randomized every time you have played a level. The tracks remain the same, the objectives change from time to time though. These objectives range from killing certain boss enemies, racing a few laps, killing everyone in some sort of arena, etc. With the money you make you can upgrade your vehicle and weapons. During races you'll collect random parts of vehicles and weapons as well, and killing enemies always grants a certain part. But... the game is just so dull. You can tell it was meant for smaller devices. The graphics have been upgraded though, and other control schemes have been implemented as well, so it is a game worth having; just not for the full price.  [Rating: 57/100]
46	0	a	Just keep to the original. This is just silly. The original needed some skill to drive. Too bad the new version of it does not have multiplayer. This is not Death Rally (the original). This is some silly car game that is nothing like it.
47	0	a	The English language is insufficient to fully describe the atrocities this game comprises.  It is an abomination in the eyes of God.  You look at a screen. You aim with a mouse. You shoot cars. You race cars. Their pixelated corpses fly comically through the air.  Sometimes the cars are close. Sometimes theyâ€™re far away.   This isnâ€™t racing, but mental exercises in learning to keep a floaty polygon block (referred to in the game as a â€œcarâ€) on a flat and blurry texture map (or â€œtrackâ€) long enough to reach the first curve.  At which point, the oversensitive controls, nonexistent physics and spotty collision detection will invariably send your polygon block lurching wildly into the fuzzy green texture sometimes known as â€œgrass.â€ Start over.  â€œStay one step ahead of the lawâ€? The game didnâ€™t ship with police included. â€œRace your modified carâ€? It also forgot to ship with actual racing opponents.  â€œ5 different tracksâ€? When you try to load the fifth, the game crashesâ€¦ â€œNon-stop drivingâ€? Sometimes, when starting a race, the outstanding game engine believes youâ€™ve finished and rewards you with a congratulatory screen after five seconds. Genius!  Failure and embarrassment. From a playerâ€™s perspective, Death Rally is an absolute mess. The controls suck. The graphics suck. The music sucks. The multiplayer sucks. Take whatever expectations youâ€™d usually have for a piece of advertising for a Shovel and lower them by a few hundred percent. Tetris is a masterpiece in comparison.  There are some good things about this game.  Thereâ€™s multiplayer. It doesnâ€™t work  [but]  thereâ€™s a multiplayer button on the main menu. One beingâ€¦that you can quit at anytime. No, wait you canâ€™t. In fact, Death Rally crashes your computer everytime you try to quit.  To be fair, there was a comic bookâ€¦ created by the same people as the game, though, and published before the gameâ€™s release as obvious promotional material. The comic book contained +18 scenes. Clearly, the designers were too focused on the comic book than on proper programming. But hey! The programmers used only their left hand to create the game, what'd you expect?  -Miyuki 2015
57	1	a	A remastered classic! I played this a lot when I was a kid. It's pretty fun to gun down the other cars or throw mines infront of them. PETROL IN MY VEINS!
59	1	a	Death Rally was a fun game, not as fun as the original Death Rally game but imo they haven't failed the first game in any way... except Duke Nukem is not in this game... It's still a great game imo and i can gladly recommend it. Online racing is abit dead nowdays tho.
48	0	a	In my eyes is this game unbelievable junk. I played original and lot of similar games on market so I can say I can compare.
61	1	a	Guns + cars = perfect combination!  In my opinion, Death Rally is one of the best top-down racing I've ever played. It has a great length of story gameplay, a nice variety of tracks, plenty of different modes, such as specific cars, marathons, head-to-head, and much more.  The only thing that is quite disappoiting is the online matchmaking, because it takes a really long time to find players, even in a private match.
63	1	a	This game is the most legit game NA
65	1	a	You can't make or break yourself in the game; no financial aspect is present compared to the original but it's still fun and comes with hell of a final challenge.
61	0	a	Death Rally will set you back $10 normally, and $5 on a discount sale which is still $3 more in quarters than I would have put into it if it were sitting in an arcade cabinet at the mall. Yes, it's fun in an old school mindless fashion with your little car racing around small repetitive tracks but due to the mechanics and swimmy control input you can't really 'race' in any proper fashion so killing the competition is the only choice to get ahead. Frankly, the controls are weak even when using the must-have gamepad controller. You're never seriously penalized for coming in second or even last place, you just get less money awarded to you for the purchase of upgrades to your guns and car performance, and you can't carry the money over between rounds to help in purchasing the pricier goodies. Sadly even when you do upgrade the results don't feel like a significant improvement. Graphics are passable while the sound quality is merely functional; neither have flair or panache. The game tries to create some personality in certain key opponents you face off against but they come off as cookie-cutter archetypes and pose little more challenge than the basic racers which ends up making them boring. Boring and uninspired gameplay is really the biggest drawback to this game. I played for 3 hours total and during that time I was able to fully upgrade 4 cars and the gatling gun weapon and once I got to that level I realized I wasn't have any fun and none of the other upgrade levels were going to get any more compelling and I called it quits. Death Rally was a fun diversion but completely forgettable and only worth playing during a free weekend. Save your time and money and go buy Renegade Ops instead as that game handles this approach to automotive combat a thousand times better.
67	1	a	Death rally is a classic type of game.
69	1	a	One of the BEST racing games I've ever played!
71	1	a	This is Death Rally. If you liked Death Rally you will also like Death Rally.
73	1	a	A pretty good remake of the original. It goes 3D while keeping a very similar feel to that old DOS version. It could've done with more cars and tracks though. The sound effects from the original are also not present. Most importantly however, where is Duke!? Recommended but don't throw away your original Death Rally because you won't be 100% satisfied with this one.
75	1	a	Very fun and good game! Mix weapons and upgrades with cars, now who wouldn't want to play this?! Nice Visuals too! Recommended!
77	1	a	I played this game on DOS, I always wanted to play it in current generation graphics. Well, here it is. If you were big fan of the DOS version (even if you'r not), never miss this one. This is one of the best games ever, when you start, you will never stop playing until you finish the game, and you may want to play it again and again, it short though.
79	1	a	Very fun and good game! Mix weapons and upgrades with cars, now who wouldn't want to play this?! Nice Visuals too! Recommended!
81	1	a	Instant Classic ! I already played it on my Ipod and always hoped for something similar on the PC ! Why something similar if can have the original ;-) Just perfect , fast paced , top down racing and shooting action flawlessly executed !  After Max Payne 1 and 2 and the two Alan Wake titles , another favorite of mine made by remedy !
83	1	a	I tried the free weekend and went ahead and bought it. If you liked the original its somewhat similar. You can watch the video to see what the game is like, I got it because of the weapons on the cars, I've always liked that combo in games. After you get to the snow mission in the story section, you can keep replaying it to unlock and upgrade everything (you win about $5k a pop, and since its 5 laps long its easy to just kill everyone on the track). I got my moneys worth at $3.50 its fun for what it is.
85	1	a	Awesome throwback to the old DoS version. The camera needs some tweaks, as it seems to follow the group, even when you are very far behind or in front. Once you've spent some time adapting to the keyboard, its quite good.
87	1	a	This is the remake of classic game 'Death Rally' and it does all what remakes are about: better graphics and easy instalation for modern systems. Only problem in this game is death community and while computer AI is better than averange it still does not give the same kick as YOU would do! (Suomessa tehty)
89	1	a	A decent shoot-while-you-drive game, and as opposed to the old version it works on modern computers.   I miss the old music though!
91	1	a	Brings me back to teenage memories playing LAN parties with friends to the original Death Rally, Duke Nukem 3D and Warcraft 2. Great game. Thanks for making this remake. Same good mechanics but better graphics, better GUI. 
93	1	a	'Rip-off of Death Race' 'Not as good as the original' 'The xbox controller settings suck'... I don't care this is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing fun game!!!
95	1	a	I bought it for the nostalgia. Go exactly what I wanted. 5/10
97	1	a	If you ever played the original, this feels quite a bit different at first. I was pretty â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ playing this since the controls were so touchy. Once you unlock the second vehicle, it get much better though.
99	1	a	recommended, just as long you dont forget that this isnt the '99 deathrally...  no random bounties, no carparts, no sabotages. difficulty level is not high enough. but still fun as a casual game, and somehow ive been coming back to play this game a little every so months... but yeah. 12 hours, 3 playthroughs, dont expect too much. :D
101	1	a	Interesting and well paced arcade racing game. True  throwback  to the 'older 'one'', well polished. Good fun plus Isometrics is a bonus.
103	1	a	Death Rally is one of those legendary games from the past, back with a blast! Just like back in the day, it combines high quality graphics (genre considered) with fluid gameplay and a simple reward system that makes it oh so easy to hop in just for a few more rounds!  The only critique I have is for the menu system. For some reason I keep finding it behaving just a bit different to what I would expect. It is a small thing, and does not interfere with gameplay, but the UX design has not quite hit it's mark there.
105	1	a	I Used to LOVE this game growing up as a kid.  The new update to the graphics is amazing with the same amazing fast pacing driving. The new guns are amazing as well with new maps.  I would definately recommend this if your looking for a different racing game where coming 1st isnt the only criteria.  
107	1	a	Oh god this is definitely a worthy revival for such an awesome game.
109	1	a	So, for all you 100% fanatics out there. If you value your sanity, do NOT try to 100% this game. 'The 42' is easily the most boring, tedious, rather bang my head against the wall, or sit in dentist's chair, achievement I have ever gone for. Including torchlight2's 'sell 50,000 items'! I warn you now, stay away, FAR awwaaaaaayy.
111	1	a	Perfect way of spending an hour or two, waiting at the airport or spending flighttime, smashing your opponents to pieces!
113	1	a	Small, fun to play racing game with guns. Nothing like original, but fun in its own way. Steering could be better, opponent AI could be better (there's no real AI, it all depends on difficulty and on harder races they'll turn you into dust on lap 1, and lose horribly on beginner level). Races typically last around 1 minute. Powerups are contained in boxes, some boxes have more health than cars and you can't directly aim at them, while most get destroyed (opened) in 1-2 hits.  Overall, the game is fun. Just don't bother trying to get 100% achievements, its quite long and boring.
115	1	a	Just like the '96 classic!
117	1	a	A reasonable successor to the old MS-DOS game, but I don't find it as enjoyable.   For starters a player MUST upgrade his vehicle after a game or you simply can't continue. Sabotage and all that have made events that trigger randomly and I haven't seen the structo-bumper yet. I also noticed how the developers didn't like driving without ammo, as you seem to have an unlimited supply for at least your starter gun.  The difference between the cars are a lot better, it it's a lot harder to win from several pickup trucks when you're driving a beetle.  All in all a reasonable game, but I'm not so sure it should bare the name Death Rally, at least not in the traditional sense. But then again, I still play the DOS version...so...call me a nut...
119	1	a	Remember the original game by 3DRealms? Will this stand up to the classic? No not really. But for the price I paid, it was worth it. While it has some of the elements of the original, it is a completely different game. Did I have fun? Yes. Is it graphically awesome? No. Does it have a decent story? No, itâ€™s horrible. Replay Value? No.  I would suggest getting this game when it goes on a cheap sale as it takes about 8hrs or so to bust through it. For fans of the original, don't go into this game with expectations as you will be disappointed.
121	1	a	Although a lot of people find this a dreadful game, I played the original A LOT back in the days. It doesn't have that exact same ring to it, but it stays a good game. Just like the original, if you put some effort in it you can outplay the single player campaign in a few hours. It's a bit short, but I had my fun.  The upgrade system has become better and the graphics are very nice and maintain their craziness, like the original game (huge explosions, a bit over the top, but this is fun).  +: good single player, but a bit boresome after you finally have your pimped out max car. +: good fun for spending some time +: good graphics  -: no players found online (to be expected obviously, it's not the most played game on Steam) -: a bit boring after you max out your car -: a bit short single player campaign.  All in all: a good game, especially to be recommended to people who played the original.
123	1	a	So, for all you 100% fanatics out there. If you value your sanity, do NOT try to 100% this game. 'The 42' is easily the most boring, tedious, rather bang my head against the wall, or sit in dentist's chair, achievement I have ever gone for. Including torchlight2's 'sell 50,000 items'! I warn you now, stay away, FAR awwaaaaaayy.
125	1	a	Not sure why everywhere you look this game gets trashed so badly. I enjoy it just fine, though having a controller probably makes it much more enjoyable.
127	1	a	For a Super Sprint clone, Death Rally is pretty impressive. The car handling actually feels right with an analog stick, but it does take a little getting used to around the hard turns. There is a standard assortment of weapons and vehicle types. Plus, each vehicle has three basic upgrades which includes speed, handling, and armor. The unlock system for weapons and vehicles offers an incentive system that isn't overly challenging.  The game is not deep by any stretch, but it manages to include a nice little short story along with the races. Races typically last only about 60 seconds providing a quick fix. There aren't too many maps, but what is included is fun and the game has a nice variety of challenges and achievements. Super Sprint was one of my favorite race games back in the day and Death Rally helped me revisit some of those lost memories.
129	1	a	I remember the original game from my childhood. It was a real classic and one of my favorite games. I bought this remake immidiatly after I found out it was made. Played it many hours and noticed that it was still the same old game I knew from my childhood. For anybody else who remembers the old game this new one will remind you of the fond memories playing it. Its action racing game as its finest.
131	1	a	Awesome throwback to the old DoS version. The camera needs some tweaks, as it seems to follow the group, even when you are very far behind or in front. Once you've spent some time adapting to the keyboard, its quite good.
133	1	a	What's more fun than looking down on cars murdering each other? Not much! For those that want to indulge, Death Rally delivers. The control is good (with a gamepad), the graphics are full of eye candy and if you can find someone else to play with, it makes for some intense MP racing.   I reviewed the game at Techgage:  http://techgage.com/article/top-down_racing_destruction_death_rally_review/ 
135	1	a	One of the best vehicular combat games on steam , The controls are horrible remap them before playing it , after a few races it should stabilize.  Grinding is required to understand the tracks as well as unlock weapons on cars .  once you have the missile and Deliverator , The real death rally begins and you start to win . There a few bugs still , the game crashes after you defeat the final boss and the multiplayer is broken:( , i have requested the devlopers for fix no response yet.
137	1	a	I played the crap out of this game back in 1990's, the demo that is because my parents never would have paid for it.  The new version lives up to the original in many ways, but it is a bit more mobile game type sadly.
139	1	a	Classis remake. Looks easy, but is actually hard to master. The top down driving makes a comeback with this game. Try beat those bosses, in any class and you are truly a Death Rally fan!
141	1	a	A decent shoot-while-you-drive game, and as opposed to the old version it works on modern computers.   I miss the old music though!
143	1	a	Very good game. And it's good to play with a controller!  But why i can't feel the good old feeling, what i had with the original one?  oh yeeees....there are no humans on the streets......i want to feel the blooooood unter the tires..... :D :((((
145	1	a	Great as ever
147	1	a	this is a fast, fun game. My only complaint would be that the levels are much too short , with the tracks being short and only about 4 laps max. Maybe they get longer later on.
149	1	a	Highly addictive, played four hours straight after starting it for the first time.
151	1	a	Recommended to all who loved the classic back in the days! :) !
153	1	a	recommended, just as long you dont forget that this isnt the '99 deathrally...  no random bounties, no carparts, no sabotages. difficulty level is not high enough. but still fun as a casual game, and somehow ive been coming back to play this game a little every so months... but yeah. 12 hours, 3 playthroughs, dont expect too much. :D
155	1	a	Perfect way of spending an hour or two, waiting at the airport or spending flighttime, smashing your opponents to pieces!
157	1	a	Death Rally is pretty Cool! Good graphics, good tunes, and a all round fun game. However it's very hard to get first place even on easy mode. Now if you keep playing throught the frustration, this game gets better and better. Oh! Almost forgot, WEAPONS, lots and lots of destuctive WEAPONS.  So get out there, and blow up somes digital cars... lol
159	1	a	Not quite what i expected from a new version of the classic game which I hold dear to my heart even to this day, but I still had loads of fun with this game. I still prefer the old game because of the gameplay which feels a little off in this one. The added features and modern graphics aren't enough  to shake off the lack of immersive death racing.  I would recommend getting this game if you get a good deal for it or if you enjoyed the original game but cant bear the outdated graphics of it.
68	0	a	Classic is better
69	0	a	The original Death Rally was way better. The vehicles basically drive and shoot themselves and you just steer and hope that you're the first one to finish. It wasn't very enjoyable and there are many other top-down racers out there.
161	1	a	I played the demo of this game for years, back in the 90s, and then the fully game at another point. The game has always been a classic. I think those interested in the racer- shooter genre will be able to appreciate it, despite it's dated graphics - just picture yourself playing a super cool tablet game on your computer instead and you'll do fine =)
163	1	a	I really enjoyed my time with this game, but now that I'm at the point where I'm no longer likely to spend any more time with it I find myself being disappointed.    Let me explain.    This game handles speed really well and pulling off a flawless run feels great. There's a decent amount of content to keep you occupied, and there are some pretty well designed levels that are fun to play over and over. The core mechanics feel solid and are satisfying. Basically if you're into speedruning at all this should be right up your alley.    That being said there is certainly a huge lack of polish on this game. The game advertises multiple game modes but only one of them is really worth playing. The difficulty modes are an interesting idea but there certainly doesn't need to be as many of them as there are and some levels are (while all beatable) clearly not designed for the hardest one. Additionally its also impossible (from what I can see) to tell how many rockets you have left on the harder settings.    I really wish the devs stuck with this game a bit longer. While I am mostly satisfied with what I got. I can only imagine how great this game would have been with workshop support or even decent alternative game modes, but it looks like we wont be getting any of that.
70	0	a	There's a neat concept here, but sadly no content to use it on. The game has a very limited stock level set, unfulfilled promises of a level editor, and absolutely barren multiplayer servers. At the end of the day, even with its intriguing visual style and gameplay concept, it's just not worth it.
165	1	a	Great art style (the earlier footage from developer vlog looks better tho) Great music Can be very frustrating especially in harder difficulties Very rewarding when you beat personal scores, super hard levels etc. Very relaxing and fun in casual mode while ignoring the scores  In-game World Leaderboards still working MP is dead, you might still be able to play with friends but I haven't tried it yet
167	1	a	bunny-hopping: the game  also rocket jumping is kind of a thing in this game, except it just gives you speed.  god tier soundtrack, made by the same guy who did the soundtrack for ori and the blind forest.  Is it worth it? Yes and no. Its more of a novelty game than anything. I enjoy it but don't play it often.   If you're a steam sale game collector, get this one for sure.
169	1	a	This game is really good looking! Levels are beatiful and graphics are very fine. Music is great. Gets very difficult so maybe not best game for casual playing, but easier levels are much fun. One bad thing is that controls are not always working like they should be so you can fail because of it.
171	1	a	I didn't expect much from the game, but what I got was a lot.
173	1	a	This game is quick, simply but beautiful. Unfortunatly game getting quick boring. There's no servers to play with others, but if you wank you can make one. But it's good to play several minutes, challenge your friends, or just alone jump around and explore several maps.
75	0	a	MULTIPLAYER IS NOT WORKING. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING STEAM CHEATED ME.
175	1	a	inMomentum is a fast-paced running game. Speed and reflex is everything. A great game to train oneâ€™s muscle memory and coordination. Also a major achievement in gameplay.  It deserves a special place in every FPS gamerâ€™s heart.
177	1	a	It's okay, i guess.
179	1	a	The soundtrack for this game completes the level of amazingness that this game visually offers. Its a beautiful game, with such a unique feel to it. This game handles amazingly and the controls seem so fluent once you get used to them, and the only thing that could make this better would be to have friends that had this :c None the less, I really recommend this game if you're itching for a new parkour-esque type game.  What I recommend to the devs 1. Level editor- I love the freestyle map, but I want to make a map with a flow of my style, get what I mean? 2. Oculus Support- Ohgodyes that would just make the whole experience SO MUCH better. 3. I know it might sound a bit weird, but weather effects. I would just like to see it be down pouring as I jump from wall to wall, running through the rain. 8/10 would buy for friends.
181	1	a	Its a baller â™¥â™¥â™¥ game play the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out of it
83	0	a	it seemed like an ok game but the controlls are slugish
183	1	a	inMomentum is a game where you must run from start to finish. But it's not just a racing game; you must solve little puzzles on the way to get to the finish line.  Amazing visuals and a very good gameplay. Interesting concept for a just-run game.
185	1	a	Bunny Hop Simulator with chillout soundtrack
187	1	a	dude more people need to play this.
86	0	a	Poor controls, bad perspective, and graphics that are just so so.  The idea of a vertical first person racer sounds fun, this isn't.
87	0	a	almost worth it
189	1	a	My God what an amazing game for speedrunning! you should just try it for even a 'casual speedrun'!
191	1	a	If you want to be a Quake Ninja, this is the game for you.  http://deltagamer.com/19752/review-inmomentum 
193	1	a	This game... This game.
195	1	a	This is essentially 'Speedrunning: The Game'. It's fun, and the MP mode is interesting for racing friends in it, though a lack of good courses is a hindrance on it, and netcode's a little buggy.
197	1	a	Meh, good concept but not so good execution... And, either the achievements are broken or it's extremely unrewarding...  http://steamcommunity.com/stats/inMomentum/achievements/   Just check the percentage of achievements unlocked, it's ridiculous.
199	1	a	pretty first person freedom-of-movement racer. speedy goodness for tribes fans
201	1	a	review here:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJpD8jEKdDQ 
203	1	a	Reminds me of AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA. Not the easiest of things to get the hang of, but once you get into the flow it feels fantastic.
205	1	a	Its like Mirrors Edge meets Quake engine. Super fun if you want to use rocketjump mechanics to treaverse smoothly through a map with some soothing music. i enjoy this a lot.
207	1	a	It's in, and it's momentum. Awesome
209	1	a	If only this game got some working on and more levels(plus a whole lot more recognition), it would've been an even better title! I absolutely love these kind of parkour games with high speed, lots of mobility, strong vibrant colors, etc.  Basically what you do is try to get through a level as fast as possible in one of two different modes, time trail and sphere hunt. The game mechanics are built heavily around momentum and wall-jumping, which is most of what you do to chain throughout the levels in order to perfect your run times. The action takes place in a first-person perspective, but third-person can be activated by pressing G. Your in-game character can be customized with different colors and such, which is always a plus, especially for someone like me who likes to personalize along with my character. There really isn't that much more to it, so it's entirely up to you if you want to try the game or not.  Like most games built on the unreal engine, the framerate is pre-capped at 62 FPS with vertical sync on by default, which can be changed in steamapps-common-inMomentum-Engine-Config-BaseEngine.ini. There you can either change the maximum frame under MaxSmoothedFramerate(search for it with CTRL+F in your text editor), or remove the cap by changing bSmoothFrameRate=TRUE into bSmoothFrameRate=FALSE.  For anyone interrested in a somewhat similar game that's a lot more recent, have a look into Celaria, which is a game on Indiedb that combines this with a lot more elements from Mirror's Edge! It's free since it's in alpha, but I think it so far has a lot of potential!
211	1	a	Its like Mirrors Edge meets Quake engine. Super fun if you want to use rocketjump mechanics to treaverse smoothly through a map with some soothing music. i enjoy this a lot.
213	1	a	One of the best movement games I've ever played. The Unreal Engine can make for some sketch physics and mousefeel, but its the closest thing to DeFrag I've ever played.  The soundtrack is exquisite, the environments imaginative, and the sense of flow you get when you're on is just fantastic.  Superb game.
215	1	a	It's like having a seizure... but fun.
217	1	a	a really nice casual fun

221	1	a	Awesome Game, i have about 5 hours in this game, and have had an extremely fun time, i would recomend this game to anyone who is intrested in a game similar to mirrors edge, but at a faster pace.
223	1	a	Criminally underrated game. I'll admit, there's not much to it, but playing it can be very relaxing and very intense at the same time. Great game for speedrunning.

97	0	a	(Rage)quit the game near the end of the second level after getting stuck for close to ten minutes. Should've probably just slowed down the time and taken it nice and slow, but I felt like trying to go fast. Perhaps too fast for my skill level. The (quite uninnovative and bland) tutorial also accounts for a large part of my playtime.  Might be fun with friends, but apart from that the multiplayer seems to be dead. The single player content (just speedrunning the game trying to get to the top of the leaderboards or trying to farm the achievements) also doesn't seem too interesting to me, although I like both of those things in games where the core gameplay resonates with me more deeply.  Had some problems with the movement (lots of it due to missclicks, didn't quite get used to space as the shoot button, but then again how should I rebind the keys otherwise when there are two separate jump buttons?!) or maybe I just didn't grasp the basic mechanics behind walljumping as sometimes it didn't seem to reset when I thought it would/should.   Honestly feels more like a platform for making a game / a playground rather than a complete project. Aesthetics were passable, but in my opinion nothing too special.
227	1	a	Really smooth gameplay, along with an amazing soundtrack, but it had the potential to be so much more. Multiplayer would be wonderful but setting up a server is complicated, and never ended up working for my friend and I. Really could use more gamemodes and maps... but it's worth it for what you get.  Overall really well made, with satisfying fast paced gameplay, fun to kill a few hours with.
229	1	a	Snuggle Truck is life.   10/10
231	1	a	Snuggle Truck attempts to do something very simple in what it offers, and for the most part it succeeds. The main problem comes with the frustration of acquiring all medals available.  The basic premise of the game is to go through groups of increasingly difficult levels and achieve specific goals in order to earn medals. There are easy, medium, hard, and extreme groups of levels. In easy and medium, it's actually fun to hone in your skills and fight for all the medals. In the hard levels, the fun begins to diminish into something comparable to an annoying task or a dreadful job. The extreme levels are so much worse than the hard levels, that the experience ceases completely from being a game and fully becomes a terrible chore, or a punishment.  If getting the basic medal for all levels is enough to please you, then you'll be able to easily beat the game in less than an hour. On the other hand, if you're a perfectionist, and getting all possible medals is your goal, I'm sure that there may be at least ten hours of entertainment here for you. There are also some bonus developer created levels, as well as thousands of user created levels for you to download from within the game, but actually wanting to experience this much content will depend on how patient you are and how much fun you are able to get out of Snuggle Truck.  Snuggle Truck is okay.
233	1	a	Pretty fun, wish I had more time to really delve into it, though.
235	1	a	Fun game, smooth gameplay made me really enjoy it. just 'WASD' , delivering the 'animals' to zoo as quickly as possible.   7/10 
237	1	a	You and your group of stuffed homies drive off in the best epic action adventure RPG racing game of the year. This game is an emotional joyride as the superb character development keeps you on your seat begging for more. Travel the world on your certified kappa truck as you go through this ultimate adventure one jump at a time.
239	1	a	Just bought the game for the Brony Mode XD I like the game ;)
241	1	a	The mechanics are solid, there is depth in terms of content, and the execution is superb. I wouldnâ€™t call this one a â€œthrill ride,â€ but Snuggle Truck can be your burst game, that title you play when youâ€™ve got three minutes to spare.  Itâ€™s hard to just peg Snuggle Truck in a genre. I call it a side-scrolling racing game and then toss in the caveat that itâ€™s highly physics-based. In the game, you control a dirty truck that can be highly reactive to the terrain its meets -- the smallest dips and jumps cause the truck to lean back and forth. You can correct its arc with the arrow keys, but you donâ€™t do it for the safety of the vehicle -- you get lined up to protect the cargo, those cartoon animals riding in the back. Each animal is just as reactive to the truckâ€™s trajectory, and the point is to hit the end point as quickly as possible with as many animals as possible. Easier said than done, I've learned.   Thereâ€™s a lot of stuff that can get in your way in the process of getting to the end goal, the 'zoo': thereâ€™s an assortment of bumps, massive hills, dips, and even a few surprise environmental objects like explosive crates that get thrown into the mix in later levels. For the most part, Owlchemy Labs does a fantastic job providing change of pace opportunities: thereâ€™s a ton of different layouts and jumps experimented with, which give you plenty to do and think about.  Hitting and landing a jump without losing your animal dudes is all in the wrist and in the finger. You can use your keys to correct the trajectory and also use the basic movement mechanic -- pressing your fingers on either the up or the down key -- to slow or speed up your truck.  Snuggle Truck introduces one new mechanic at a time, giving you the ability to slowly learn and react to obstacles as you progress through the levels. But thereâ€™s a big trial-and-error element as well since you never know whatâ€™s around the bend. One small jump, for example, can take you straight into a wall while another of the same exact kind might not present any mission critical navigational issues.  To its credit, Snuggle Truck remains fun despite its clumps of middling level design. I chock this up to its relative snappiness -- levels take, generally, under a minute to finish, so itâ€™s not a great loss to start over again. Nor do you really need to ace a level since thereâ€™s so many in each tier.  Of course, there are carrots on sticks to chase -- Snuggle Truck goes heavy on the rewards after completion of each level. You can earn your traditional star medals, as well as completion medals based on completion and number of animals you save.  While Snuggle Truck actually feels like a game that went one direction and then the other, I recommend it. The truck controls well, the physics respond well, and the level design has that right mix of snappiness and intrigue. Check it out if youâ€™re in the market for another racing side-scroller, and keep your eyes peeled for updates. Owlchemy Labs has crazy plans for Smuggle Truck which include implementing community-generated levels which could lead to some awesome replay value.
243	1	a	Great game, very funny, Very good music. I really loved it. Thanks!

247	1	a	Snuggle Truck is quite possibly the greatest game ever made. From an objective standpoint, nothing else comes quite close to delivering the kind of experience that this game is capable of. If I were to choose one game in existence to prove to somebody that video games are art, it would definitely have to be this masterpiece.  Firstly, I would like to begin this review by asking the question: what is a video game? Some people would simply answer this by saying that video games are an interactive medium with the sole purpose of delivering entertainment to the players. Others prefer to give long philosophical answers which tackle every facet of this age-long riddle. After playing Snuggle Truck I can honestly say that any answer to this question is meaningless, and one only needs to play this game to fully appreciate the marvellous wonder of this pastime known as 'video games.'  With that said I would like to break the game down as much as possible within the limitations of purely text-based reviews; after all Snuggle Truck is a deep, complex experience which would transcend standard, traditional review formats. One of the most notable things I would like to bring to the forefront is Snuggle Truck's graphics and visual style. When I first loaded this game and began playing, I thought the game had crashed. Let me explain: I'm an avid fan of trucking in general, and as a result my desktop background is a constantly-changing slideshow of truck imagery. The visuals in this game are so incredible that I mistook graphical images for photography. The animation is also so incredibly smooth and lifelike that I actually started to feel brief motion sickness after only a few seconds of play.  This soon passed however as I quickly became immersed in the truly innovative and revolutionary gameplay found in this work of art. Snuggle Truck takes similar games such as Euro Truck Simulator 2 and completely slaps them in the face with its own brand of hyperrealistic physics and gameplay scenarios which leaves a completely before-unseen impression on the player. Because of how intuitive, responsive and predictable the controls felt, I was very quickly able to adapt to how the game must be played; and it even left me thinking 'hot damn, this is so lifelike, I could probably do this in a real life truck.'  That's not to say the game is easily played, however. While the game presents itself as being extremely accessible through its controls and simplstic gameplay objectives, this game has a very steep difficulty curve which constantly demands the player to step up their game. The difficulty is fair and never feels artificial, and if you mess up, it's 100% your fault.  The audio in this game is beyond noteworthy. No lie, when I finished playing this game because I had important things to do - such as sleep so that I would have enough energy the next day to play more Snuggle Truck - I basically had to leave the game idling on the title screen because the music is so incredible. It's insanely catchy and would make great classical composers of past ages such as Bach and Mozart weep with envy.  With everything said, I believe it stands to reason that Snuggle Truck should be considered one of if not the greatest game ever made. If, after reading this review, you still have any doubts as to whether or not you should buy this game, you are probably literally Satan; though I doubt even the dark lord himself wouldn't get a kick out of this truly magnificent magnum opus.
249	1	a	picked this up for my duaghter who is 6yr's old she loved it, i call it the 'lol wagon' simple fun physics gameplay.
251	1	a	the graphics and physics need some improving. However the gameplay itself is very enjoyable. The artstyle is weird and charming.
253	1	a	It was supposed to be called 'Smuggle Truck' and have you smuggle Mexicans across the border (or so I've been told), so that fact alone made me buy this.
255	1	a	I could NOT resist! Bringing cuteness into physics, and a somewhat reminder of Line Rider, the ability to create your own tracks - I had to buy it! It's yet another incredible indie game, and well worth the price. Get it!
257	1	a	Its like the perfect game for a â™¥â™¥â™¥, 5 stars!
259	1	a	Snuggle Truck is actually quite charming and challanging. It's a bit of a surprise really. Speed runs, keeping all of the stuffed animals in the damn truck with bad shocks... It's adictive as well.  It was bought for me as a joke but the jokes on them! I really enjoy it. I like to put some hardcore rap on when I play my Muthaâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in Snuggletruckin. 
261	1	a	I had never even seen a shooting star before. 25 years of rotations, passes through comets' paths, and travel, and to my memory I had never witnessed burning debris scratch across the night sky. I stared entranced, soaking in owlchemy Labs' new material, chiseling each gameplay moment into the best functioning parts of my brain which would be the only platform for the material for months.  This is an emotional, psychological experience. Snuggle Truck plays like a clouded brain trying to recall an alien abduction. It's the sound of a development studio, and its leader, losing faith in themselves, destroying themselves, and subsequently rebuilding a perfect entity. In other words, Owlchemy Labs hated being Owlchemy Labs, but ended up with the most ideal, natural game yet.  The experience and emotions tied to playing Snuggle Truck are like witnessing the stillborn birth of a child while simultaneously having the opportunity to see her play in the afterlife on Imax. It's a game of sparking paradox. It's cacophonous yet tranquil, experimental yet familiar, foreign yet womb-like, spacious yet visceral, textured yet vaporous, awakening yet dreamlike, infinite yet two hours long. It will cleanse your brain of those little crustaceans of worries and inferior games clinging inside the fold of your gray matter. The harrowing sounds hit from unseen angles and emanate with inhuman genesis. When the headphones peel off, and it occurs that six men created this, it's clear that Owlchemy Labs must be the greatest developer alive, if not the best since you know who. Breathing people made this game! And you can't wait to dive back in and try to prove that wrong over and over.
263	1	a	If you like games with cute graphics, catchy music and simple fun gameplay you could do much worse than this.   With only accelerate, decelerate and tilt as your controls, the objective is to take your truck through an obstacle course without allowing your cuddly toys to fall out.   I really like it. It's the kind of game you can play for 5 minutes and then put down, and the upbeat music puts a nice big grin on my face.   What more can you ask for?
265	1	a	This is one cute casual game. Easy to learn, hard to master. Levels are short, but they give a blast of fun.
267	1	a	Most addicting game even better than Dota 2 but you dont have to hate russians.
269	1	a	Its like the perfect game for a â™¥â™¥â™¥, 5 stars!
271	1	a	Snuggle Truck is a game on Steam that was previously a flash game called 'Smuggle Truck', a game commenting on the trials of immigration to the United States from Mexico. This is a narrative thread with satirization that works quite well.  Snuggle Truck is about transporting stuffed animals to the zoo, which makes for incredibly confusing commentary. First of all, where are the stuffed animals trying to escape from? Are they escaping from the bedrooms of a particularly stultifying suburb? Suburb living is the safest, blandest living there is to offer in the United States. Are they going to Burning Man or something?  No, they are going to the zoo. For some reason. Why? Are you playing as an international stuffed animal trafficker? What kind of demented mind steals teddy bears and stuffed elephants from the bedrooms and playplaces of children everywhere to take them to the zoo? What is to be gained from this action, especially when there are real animals to look at and already existing stuffed fascimiles to buy fresh from the gift shop at manufacturer suggested retail prices? THIS GAME MAKES NO â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ SENSE AND THE MESSAGE IT OFFERS TO THE PLAYER IS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING CLOWNSHOES.  It is a solid physics flash game and it'll entertain you for twenty minutes before it starts to get boring. BUT IT MAKES NO SENSE.
273	1	a	Greatest.. game.. EVER
275	1	a	Snuggle Truck is without a doubt the most hardcore game in existence. Think Dark Souls, but without equipment and progression, but you die a little inside every time you lose a level.  10/10
277	1	a	This shaz is the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ bees knees yo. I'm snugglin my truck all the way to the godamn bank homie, shieeeeet.
279	1	a	I like casually playing this game. Not sure why, perhaps just because of the racing and physics combination. It does get a bit boring after a while though. But that's after you've already had your share of the fun of course.

281	1	a	This game is stupid and I love it.
283	1	a	I bought this because the words snuggle and truck were in the title and next to each other.
285	1	a	A masturpecy in vidyagayms. A monolith of what humanitee reprezents. YES/10 wuld by many copies, kinda scary tho
287	1	a	very nice game cute and funny and all the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that entertains sometimes!
289	1	a	very nice game cute and funny and all the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that entertains sometimes!
291	1	a	Adorable side-scrolling obstacle course driving game, in which a truckload of cuddly toys must not fall out as you fly over ramps, TNT, and moose! Levels range from the simple to the incredibly hard.
293	1	a	I have felt every possible human emotion while playing Snuggle Truck.
295	1	a	Ok, Snuggle Truck (and Smuggle Truck) are pretty fun little games. Sometimes I like to relax with a casual game like this for a few minutes, I picked this up months ago.  But just now they added 'Brony Mode'... They snuck bronies into my Steam game collection. My Steam list is tainted forever now. Jerks.
297	1	a	hilarious game similar to happy wheels except you deliver stuffed animals.... the ones that dont fall out of your truck anyway
299	1	a	Sexiest Truck I ever seen in my life
301	1	a	Would snuggle again - 10/10
303	1	a	Snuggle Truck is a strange little game that I purchased because I was dumb enough to buy something simply because it featured something related to something completely different. That is not to say that it was necessarily a bad decision in the end, rather something that I have learned not to do. None the less.  The game is a simple physics game requiring you to get from point A to point B while still keeping your cargo inside of your truck. There isn't really much more to it than that. It's a bare bones game that is great when you feel like having some stupid fun, but is definitely something that could use a little more polish. It gets boring if you play too much of it at once. I suppose in the end it is worth the price of $5.00.  Also, for those curious of the origin of the name, the game was originally named Smuggle Truck and required you to bring foreigners past the border. See, learning can be fun!
305	1	a	  Yay, smuggle truck! Better than expected! Of course, it remidns me the Hill Climb Racing. Hard and extreme levels are fun. Remember, small rocks are evil.
307	1	a	You can do wheelies with a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing pickup truck.
309	1	a	Don't mock Snuggle Truck.
311	1	a	GOTY all years, marvelous gameplay, stylish graphics, great replayability, fantastic sound, insanely creative, an absolute must if you call yourself a hardcore gamer. BUY NOW!!
313	1	a	buy this game right â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing now
315	1	a	One of the best games evahr!
317	1	a	buy this game right â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing now
319	1	a	Would snuggle again - 10/10
321	1	a	Its very good gaem plz buy
323	1	a	Buy this game for the fuzzies.
325	1	a	Snuggle Truck is a game that I recommend because: - is only 4 euro - is a method to banish boredom - is a simply game - have trading cards  Enjoy!
327	1	a	Pricetag completely justified.
329	1	a	This game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing amazing. It has an indepth story line, amazing graphics, well done sound effects, and an immersive feel. This game is probably the greatest thing that has come to the gaming world since Duke Nukem: Forever. And the price is reasonable, I only had to put one mortgage on my house! Everyone should own this game.
331	1	a	Brony Mode activated!
333	1	a	I click on the Tab 'MORE' and all was for FREE :D
335	1	a	But â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, it was 99 cents.
337	1	a	Can I get a toot toot  Can I get a beep beep  Runnin' her hands through my 'fro  Bouncin' on 24's While they say on the radio  This is the remix to ignition Hot and fresh out the kitchen  Mama rollin' that body  Got every man in her wishin'  Sippin' on coke and rum  I'm like so what I'm drunk  It's the freakin' weekend baby I'm about to have me some fun  This is the remix to ignition  Hot and fresh out the kitchen  Mama rollin' that body  Got every man in her wishin'  Sippin' on coke and rum  I'm like so what I'm drunk  It's the freakin' weekend baby  I'm about to have me some fun  Girl we off in this jeep  Foggin' windows up Blastin' the radio  In the back of my truck  Bouncin' up and down  Stroke it round and round  To the remix We just thuggin' it out  Ooops sorry I confused Snuggle Truck with R Kelly's Ignition Remix because that's literally how â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING AWESOME this game is.  
339	1	a	I dont know how it got this game...  I.... well it have a car and animals...   10/10 5 year olds would play
341	1	a	I said how it's unjolly when people sell me Unity games without warning, ye? I did.
343	1	a	I made this.
345	1	a	Got this game in a indiegala bundle for 2 dollars with other 9 games. Not regreted it ever since.
347	1	a	I want to snuggle inside truck.
349	1	a	This title screams 'started life as a mobile game.'  It's mindless fun and probably worth picking up on sale and you want that kind of experience on your desktop. The graphics, music and level design are all competent. My main complaints would be the inability to distinguish obstacles from harmless background art and the 'baby fuzzy' mechanic is a little undercooked. I don't see myself going crazy unlocking all the medals but if you're a relentless completionist there's a lot of reasons to go back and replay levels. But if you just want to play all the levels it's certainly within your grasp, nothing about the game is frustratingly impossible and the learning curve is reasonable.
351	1	a	This game is way more entertaining than it should be! :)
353	1	a	This game is way more entertaining than it should be! :)
355	1	a	The level editor adds a lot to this already cool little game.

361	1	a	Funny jump and run, with all the little twists one would expect. :)
363	1	a	10/10 Will play again. 
365	1	a	The best thing in this game is clearly the pony mode.
367	1	a	A delightfully fun physics-based game. Don't let the name fool you; while it may seem like a game for children, it can get ridiculously difficult at times. This game can certainly entertain you or a group of friends, no matter the age.
369	1	a	Race across a bumpy landscape without losing your passengers. A fairly simple game that can be a lot of fun. There are different skins for your truck &amp; a few different types of passengers.  You can create, upload &amp; download levels. Supports other Operating Systems too.
371	1	a	Literally the first level and they drop the see me rollin' bomb. They got balls, I'll tell you that.
373	1	a	just buy it, dont ask why just buy it
375	1	a	More entertaining and challenging than you might expect going in.
377	1	a	I like it :) It's fun, has its own 'persona'. I like snuggling.  If you're hesitating, wait for a discount. It's true that 5â‚¬ is a bit too much for that casual game. Watchout it seems that there is no steam-cloud saving in that game or i did something wrong. Whatever I lost my saves.  Runs smooth on linux and xbox 360 usb controller. No issue at all.
379	1	a	Real fun! Slightly less than its brother Smuggle Truck, but still really fun!
381	1	a	gameplay is fun, good casual game if u need a break from a more difficult game.
383	1	a	9/10 Addictive iOS gameplay
385	1	a	BUY IT!!!!!!!! SNUGGLE TRUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
387	1	a	Extremely simple concept and controls which provide more silly fun than imaginable. Great for both adults and children, even extra emotionally sensitive types who might otherwise cringe and be disturbed by cute animals flying outta the back of a truck that's hurtling over all sort of wonderful hazards. Yes, they get run over. Yep, the truck can roll-over and land on the whole lot, but they're drawn to look like inert stuffed critters thereby making the whole deal grandly hilarious instead of traumatic.  Get from start to finish. Keep as many critters in the truck as you can. Catch a few falling extra if possible. Do it all as quick as you can for trophies. Each level has 5 trophies to be earned and many will be maddeningly difficult to obtain. As a bonus you can even come up with your own diabolical levels in the editor. What fun!   I highly recommend this game. Wait for a good sale for extra appeal!
389	1	a	BUY IT!!!!!!!! SNUGGLE TRUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
391	1	a	It be funtastic!! The soundtrack is cool too.
393	1	a	Surprisingly fun little physics game. Not sure what else to call it... Worth the buy if the premise appeals to you at all since the execution is really well done.
395	1	a	to snuggle the truck: one must be complete in mind, and truck in spirit
397	1	a	Surprisingly fun little physics game. Not sure what else to call it... Worth the buy if the premise appeals to you at all since the execution is really well done.
399	1	a	It's adorable, it's challenging, and you will feel terrible each and every time you lose a poor little fuzzy to your terrible driving skills.
401	1	a	Snuggle Truck is a physics-based 2D racing game, much like Trials. You have two goals: get to the goal as quickly as possible, and keep as many stuffed animals in the back as possible. To complete the stages, you need to perform both tasks well enough, with more rewards for a speed run or a perfect run. I found it to be a lot of fun. Getting through the levels with both speed and grace is an entertaining challenge.  The truck controls decently well and the art is vibrant, though the sound is a ittle obnoxious. The game doesn't seem to have the same skill/strategy depth as Trials, but there is quite a lot to do, and getting through the harder levels can be very difficult. I found that this game is best played in short sessions (though, for later levels, a short session may not be enough time to accomplish much).  If Snuggle Truck looks at all interesting to you, it will be well worth your five dollars.
403	1	a	this game is not as bad as you think this game is fun  worth it
405	1	a	A total laugh for 5 minutes of spare time, which often turns into much more. My kids also love it!
407	1	a	Snuggle Truck, life or video game? Once you play this game it WILL become your life. It is an obsession you will be unable to fufill because Snuggle Truck is life and thus unless it is your life you will be unable to fufill the desire that is Snuggle Truck.
409	1	a	Snuggle Truck is a straightforward but fun physics puzzler. You've got a truck, there are things to snuggle in it, and you've got to keep it that way. Unfortunately, the rest of the world seems out to prevent that, as harmless as it sounds. The bulk of the gameplay is managing the bounce of your plush toy cargo since you couldn't be bothered to invest in a net or a closed truck bed, which is surprisingly more fun than it initially seems.  The risk/reward balance of Snuggle Truck is such that the game becomes a great deal more engaging than you'd expect. The first few levels, you'll screw up a few times, but learn what bounces where and how to recover when it does. As things ramp up, however, you start actually caring a bit about how many snugglies you deliver, until the game sucks you in for more levels than you expected. It's not super deep, but it's enough to keep you going for a session. You can also try your hand at making levels if design is more your jam; there are already tons of them out there, so you'll never be at a shortage for things to complete.  I'd say Snuggle Truck is worth it as a pick up and play title to keep tucked in your game library for downtime or when you need a good distraction. It's unlikely to rock your world, but it's hard to hate.
411	1	a	This game is a blast. Adults and kids alike will enjoy it.
98	0	a	The concept is fun and addictive at the start, but in all it doesn't feel like anything more than a Flash game; the only thing it's missing is a Newgrounds logo. It's a well-made game, but most of the levels are just user-made garbage with lots of unfair traps and the physics can be wonky at times. I also got the occasional crash.  Buy this on sale only; it's worth about 3 bucks in my opinion. It's got a good amount of content and the concept is entertaining, but in spirit it feels like any other Box2D Flash game that has been flooding the Internet for free since 2006,
99	0	a	It's not that Snuggle Truck is  bad  per say, it's just...not very good.  Taking the Trials HD side-scrolling rollercoaster arcade racing formula, adding a basket of fluffy stuffed animals, and polishing off any of the more challenging or demanding bits, it's biggest fault is just how obnoxiously boring it is. Its personality is lost in a deluge of repetitive, tedious levels, designed in such a way as to be just obnoxious and tedious enough that they become a monotonous chore to complete. The challenge feels mostly arbitrary and poorly planned out, existing as little more than to cause you to replay levels numerous times but providing no satisfaction when you finally achieve a faster time or medal.  I wish I had some more elaborate criticism to add, but that's honestly all I can muster. Snuggle Truck feels like the cute but entirely moronic cousin of games such as Trials and Joe Danger, full of bright colors and upbeat music, but hard to spend more than a few minutes with before you can feel your eyelids start to close.
100	0	a	Snuggle Truck is a relatively fun casual deliver x stuffed animals in x time game. It has a nice amount of content, levels and an awesome editor meaning the community can make levels giving an unlimited amount of playable content. However, the game itself has too many minor errors making it not worth the hassle and here is why:  Pros:   â™¦ Decent Graphics and Sounds (These are alright for what it is, they are not amazing but fit the game) â™¦ Medal Concept is Great (Unlocking medals for completing x goal in a level is nice as it gives you something to do in the level and adds a nice amount of content to the level) â™¦ Gameplay is fun and works with minimal glitches (Driving through the level and delivering x stuffed animals in x time just works. It is pretty fun if you are the type that likes to be number one on the leaderboards and must complete all level challenges. If you donâ€™t like playing a game for leaderboards or completing challenges, then you probably wonâ€™t find this as fun as I did) â™¦ Easy to 100% with Achievements (Has a nice number of easy Achievements which are mainly unlocked by just using features of the game and completing the game) â™¦ Steam Trading Cards (This is always a bonus) â™¦ Each level design is unique (This is nice as every level feels different and no two levels feel as though it is a repetitive copy of the last level) â™¦ Decent level editor (Amazing level editor that allows anyone to create a level and upload for anyone to play. This is an awesome feature as it adds an potentially unlimited amount of levels and content to the game) â™¦ Truck and Stuffed Animal skins are very detailed (Custom Skins are designed very well for what they are and add a nice little bonus to the game) â™¦ Price is reasonable ($5 for a game is decent as if you look past all the cons youâ€™ll get your $5 worth)   Cons:  â™¦ No Steam Cloud Storage (Iâ€™ve had to restart this game 3 or 4 times for the sole fact of no Steam Cloud Storage and me always losing my save file. You could say I shouldâ€™ve backed up the savefile, but there is no easy way to tell which games you own have SCS. Therefore, as the game progresses by completing one level to unlock the next, SCS would be relatively beneficial. Plus, If a game is on Steam and doesnâ€™t make use of this free feature, then in my opinion it shouldnâ€™t be on Steam) â™¦ Method to activate custom skins is annoying (Firstly to be able to even use them you have to go and enable them in a â€œ+moreâ€ menu. The â€œ+more+ menu doesnâ€™t lead on to what it is until you click it which is annoying as I had no idea what It was until I clicked it. Though, once youâ€™ve enabled all the custom skins, you have to then get into a level and click the truck until your truck has the skin you want. This concept would be fine if it didnâ€™t mean you had to waste a play through just to enable a skin. The skin should be able to be enabled and selected from within the â€œ+moreâ€ menu) â™¦ Lacks Steam Workshop (This is bad as the game makes you upload to their servers and for some reason created levels donâ€™t always stay. I say this as I created a level a while ago and started playing Snuggle Truck again only to find my level deleted. Plus, custom levels not moderated properly as the only way is by a star rating which doesnâ€™t explain much. With Steam Workshop levels would be moderated by the community via ratings and comments etc and would be more likely to stay in the game)  â™¦ Has DLC activated automatically (This is a weird concept as the game calls certain features DLC but you canâ€™t actually buy any DLC for the game. This confuses me as to why itâ€™s even called DLC) â™¦ Custom level highscores don't load and you have to quit the game to continue playing (When you click the highscores in Custom levels made by users, it just shows a spinning loading circle and does nothing else. You canâ€™t close out of the spinning loading circle, meaning you have to close the game and re-open it if you want to continue playing) â™¦ No way to delete a Downloaded Custom Level (This is annoying as I stated not all levels are moderated. Therefore, if you download a bad level there is no way to easily delete it within the game. This is annoying as it fills your list of custom levels with a lot of potentially unwanted ones making it hard to find the ones that you actually enjoyed and work) â™¦ Has impossible times in highscores rendering them broken (Highscores just work, however some scores are obviously impossible and hacked in some way. There needs to be some sort of moderation of highscores or a global reset to make number one even achievable) â™¦ Pressing escape to go back to the main menu at times loses the mouse cursor making the menu unusable (This is annoying as not being able to use the mouse on a menu means you canâ€™t actually select anything. This ultimately means you have to close the game and re-open it to continue playing) â™¦ Alt+Tab brings up a pause menu that doesnâ€™t act properly (When you press Alt+Tab and return to the game it brings up a pause menu, which is nice ingame but out of game on the menu it still comes up and trying to return to the game or close this menu doesnâ€™t function properly) â™¦ Makes use of Steam Global Leaderboards via Steam Stats but they donâ€™t function (This is a nice feature to have, but for whatever reason there are no entries in these leaderboards and one of the level entries is â€œTestâ€ which shouldnâ€™t be the case)  Overall, even though gameplay seemingly works and is fun, the game is cheap and has a decent amount of content, I canâ€™t recommend this game. I canâ€™t recommend it because there are too many minor errors within features of the game that should have been eliminated in early beta stages. Plus, having no cloud storage is a big factor for me not to recommend a game like this.
101	0	a	I can't really say Snuggle Truck is worth playing on anything apart from a mobile device. There is no point to this game being on PC since it would be perfect on IOS.   The aim is to finish an obsticle course in the quickest time while also carrying lots of 'snugglies' in your trunk, so there is alot physics involed in not letting your truck tip over.  The game only explains the keyboard controls, however you can play with an xbox controller (and I recommend you do, if you play it).   User created levels will add replayability here, but don't waste your time playing.
102	0	a	i like the idea of this game, especially as smuggle truck where youâ€™re transporting immigrants across the border. unfortunately the steam version is only stuffed animals to â€œda zoo,â€ is very noticeably buggy, and i donâ€™t enjoy the levels that much either. luckily i got it through humble bundle for android 2, so i can install smuggle truck on android where itâ€™s less buggy. if youâ€™re like me, you may as well run the steam version long enough to get the cards and actually play it on android.
103	0	a	Once upon a time I played a flash game where you drove a motorcyle over ugly blocky terrain and did tricks and stuff to get through increasingly difficult levels.  This game isn't half as engaging as that flash game was, so I got bored of it pretty quickly. The levels I played were all just straight drives from left to right with slightly modified landscape. Boring.
104	0	a	In this game you're the proprietor of a white van with tinted windows. Your goal is to drive around the town and recruit various children who are loitering around the school after hours to help find your lost puppy. When you pick a child up it is then your duty to brutally and savagely anally â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ them. This is the 'snuggle' part of the game. You then must drive down a secluded road miles away from their home and dump them off in the middle of the woods.
105	0	a	Just another port from a free mobile game. Way too simple to enjoy for longer than 20 minutes. It used to have an offensive gimmick when it was called Smuggle Truck, and you were smuggling Mexicans. Now it's even worse.
106	0	a	Rubbish!  Hill Climb Racing Fail!  Android games are better than this.
107	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this casual piece of manure, belongs on phones and nowhere else.  Ok, it's not that bad but seriously who would seriously spend money on this?
108	0	a	Go buy yourself a hot coffee, then, remove lid and put it in your car. Now, drive a bumpy road somewhere with jumps and watch your coffee being spilled all around. That's what this game is.

110	0	a	Games like this has been done multiple times before this one. Snuggle truck is one of the worst ones though. It doesn't add anything new to the 'genre' and the level design is horrible. It feels like something that was done as a school project in 2 days.
111	0	a	Snuggle Truck is a physics-based driving game where you must deliver your cargo full of 'Snuggies' as fast as possible to the zoo. On your travels you will encounter various obstacles and will have to overcome them with the various power-ups that you are provided with.  Snuggle Truck's gameplay is decent, and can be challenging if the player wants to unlock all the medals the game has to offer. However the game has definitely lost character since its late production change from 'Smuggle Truck' to 'Snuggle Truck'. Rather than using a rundown pick-up truck to smuggle immigrants over the border you have to transport stuffed animals to a zoo in a similar fashion. In other words, they are both the same game.   Overall, Snuggle Truck is an average game which has sadly had its unique concept ripped out from underneath it via censorship of Apple. Like many games of this nature it is great for those that are looking to lose a few minutes. I would recommend 'Smuggle Truck' instead as I believe this is the game that Owlchemy Labs wanted their audience to experience. You can only access the original from their website.
112	0	a	A simple racing/physics game.  Your goal is to get one or more stuffed animals to the finishing line (with a raising flag a la Mario) in the shortest time possible.  The simple premise is good, but the art/sound direction leaves a lot to be desired. Words cannot describe how irritating it is to listen to those pesky stuffed toys' squeaks. My goal quickly changed to tossing those animals on the ground then to roll all over them, back, and forth, back, and forth.  Overall, there's not that many levels, but the last ones are quite challenging. Then you can also create your own levels with the built-in level editor, and even download levels made by other players.
113	0	a	Pretty much a phone game to it's core, barely done any improvements on PC version if any at all. Resolution is upscaled pretty badly and the meniu is just eye mauling. However it's pretty good for little kids, it's a mobile game, but it's still blows mobile version on 24 inch monitor in their mind.   Either way would not recommend spending more than 1$ on this.
114	0	a	The camera is too zoomed in, you never know what obstacle is ahead of you, which means you either have to repeat the levels over and over to get a good result or you need stupidly good reaction times.
115	0	a	Has a brony mode. Buy it only if you don't want to be on my freinds list.
116	0	a	While fun, not very fit for a PC game, buy it on mobile instead.
117	0	a	I bought this game because i wanted more steam games and it was like four bucks. I don't know why i did it. Should've stopped me.
118	0	a	Too childish. I can't play such a game. Maybe if you want this for kids, it might do.
119	0	a	Basically, a 4$ flash game. A good one, but still not worth the price (cause of lenght and gameplay).  SCORE: 40/100

121	0	a	Snuggle Truck is like one of those Trials flash games made by some bozo. It seems like it should be fun in a Trials kind of way, but the physics are absolutely not up to it and the truck just kind of clunks around the terrain in the introductory levels before you uninstall it.
122	0	a	Snuggle Truck is physics-based vehicle game where you need to keep you cargo in your truck. It's ported from mobile platforms. These kind of games used to be flash games on the pc and you probably have a flash game somewhere on the internet that is the same. But the absolute worst thing about this game is that it has a brony mode.
123	0	a	'It's like Trials with animals' -IGN    Neh, 1/10
124	0	a	Snuggle Truck sounds like a creepy van where you will either get murdered or â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
125	0	a	Wow.... Just wow... *shudder*
126	0	a	Punch yourself really hard if you actually paid money for this. No seriously. Do it. Then kick yourself in the balls as an encore.
127	0	a	Nothing to look here...
128	0	a	This is a $5 version of Happy Wheels. It's not even worth the $5 either. It's not a bad game, because it's stealing for Happy Wheels, but it's not a good game because your losing $5 for something that you can get that's better for free.
129	0	a	A game about balancing the contents of your truck as you go over terrain on a 2D plane. It's simple and difficult. But it couldn't hold my attention. It felt like I was playing an old flash game from the 90s. Something that you'd play around with on a lunch period at school.   They also try to push the stuffed animal thing a bit to far like it's some hilarious joke and I just wasn't on board.
130	0	a	A simplistic mobile game with awful controls.   PROS: -Graphics are amusing  CONS: -Controls are awful and heavily oversteer (in a game with 4 buttons total that is all about speed runs and control...) -Mobile game -Awkward, exaggerated physics  The game itself is extremely simple: you accelerate your truck (going from left to right) with a bunch of animals loose in the back. As you hit bumps, jumps, etc, you have to even out so the animals dont fall out of the back of the truck.   Sounds simple, but due to over-exaggerated physics and awful controls this one leads to a frustrating experience. The 'Easy' levels were enough for me.
131	0	a	Great music, great visuals, but more frustrating than it is fun.
132	0	a	A game with Bronies in mind. Amusing for 5 minutes and that's about.
133	0	a	IT SUCKS DONKEY â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ NOT WORTH THE 5.49. MY FRIEND BOUGHT IT FOR ME AND I REGRET IT. I HATE THIS GAME! 
134	0	a	There's really not much to say for Snuggle Truck... It's an okay mobile game but there are plenty of other games (both casual and hardcore) where your time would be better spent.
135	0	a	Do i even need to say anything about this one ?
136	0	a	Extremely amusing little game, but far too little content even for just $5. Fun lasted for about 30 minutes. There's only so many times you can drive along various bumpy trails and watch stuffed animals fly around before the comedy in it dies out.
137	0	a	It's like a well-made flash game that gives about half an hour of fun. Once you start achievement whoring it's not so fun though, because the physics can feel very unpredictable. Nothing is more frustrating than thinking you've done everything right only to lose all your cargo because you hit a quirk in the physics.  Ultimately the novelty is fun for a short while, but any further than that and the charm wears off fast. I got it in a bundle and I still wouldn't recommend it for any price.  (Also the reason why my play time is so high is because the game wiped all my save data when I only had about 10 or 20 medals left, so I had to start over. I won't hold that against the game, but it was still very frustrating)
413	1	a	Very well built physics based game. Good strong deep intellectual story line Great complex characters. I'll never forget the final boss fight.. nearly put me to tears. Highly skill based. I would not be surprised if this game was considered for MLG. Not for everyone however. The competitive edge will turn some casuals away. 10/10
415	1	a	This is an evolution of the human race. Only in my dreams have I witnessed slimy gumballs sloshing around in different gamemodes! Don't even get me started on the only server! It's the best server you can imagine, based in the czech republic. If I went on this review would be at least 4 pages long. BUY THIS NOW!!!  UPDATE: The game really is just a mediocre flash game that you have to pay for. Has frame rate drops, buy this for your friend, not yourself. You're not missing anything.   Pros: Kinda fun at times  Cons: Too easy Broken Multiplayer (I started my own server and couldn't even join) Framerate drops  Just no  UPDATE # DOS: I recently made a steam group for this game, join if you want!!
417	1	a	So much fun if you have only a few mins to play and just want to goof about
419	1	a	Good game when U have friends, but if U are alone it is boring
421	1	a	Bought this came because I needed to make a purchase in order to get me some of those sweet cs:go skins. And let me tell you, I was not dissapointed. This is the cheapest game on steam at the moment, yet it's still fun, I dont know why. I'd recommend for kids, or casual gamers.   The sounds are awesome. Controls are a bit icky, but you get used to them. Gamemodes are fun. AND AWESOME PRICE.
423	1	a	Great horror game.NSFW. Is very scary. Up there with Gubble. For more reviews, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you
425	1	a	If you haven't tried this, I pity you. 10/10
427	1	a	Quite addicting.
429	1	a	not bad but not best i see so much greater F2P games and that game for money?I dont know why but I dont have problem funny,amazing but its not have story ou other gamemodes so its not for me 
431	1	a	This game changed my life for ever. A stunning mix of gameplay and storytelling. One of the most underated games on Steam. 10/10
433	1	a	This game taught me how to jump like professional.
435	1	a	for the 19c VERY GOOOD
437	1	a	10/10 would play again
439	1	a	It's not that bad....for $0.29. No, but this game is actually kind of fun. The controls take a bit to get used to and the levels ramp up in difficulty pretty quickly. I would recommend a controller, but the keyboard and mouse options are fine since the control scheme is pretty basic.
144	0	a	Unless you enjoy talking balls that make engine sounds and jump around in a small arena, I would not get this game. I only paid $0.29 for it, but I just don't like it. I closed the game after 5 minutes and never played it again.
441	1	a	10/10 would play again
443	1	a	great game for having fun with friends
445	1	a	10/10 would bang (into the AI, because they help each other to win just to spite my obviously superior skills.).  Also made me fail my A levels.
146	0	a	please dont buy this game, there are troll reviews etc and i knew they were fake but at 14p i bought it anyway. the money wasted isnt what bothers me... it is 6 mins of my life
147	0	a	I don't believe that this game was worth the quarter I paid for it.
447	1	a	dont waste your money even though its only 29 cents. dumbass game.
449	1	a	Possitives - Great multiplayer - Czech game ;-) - It takes only 56 MB on your HDD Negatives - Maps those you can play 2 times and after it they comes annoying as f*ck - My friend canÂ´t connect to multiplayer :/  It suck as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ !!! But itÂ´s so great ^-^
451	1	a	This game is a true work of art. You know you're getting quality when the person running the server sets your framerate. 9/10 because there is no 10 pack available
149	0	a	It's a cute game to play on free time, but it's more fun to play with friends but many people are reluctant to buy it also online servers are very RARE almost no one playes it, it'd be fun with more people but on your own it gets a bit too repetitive
150	0	a	Probably the worst game I've bought. I was glad to have gotten it for only $0.50 on sale. Right now I can run crysis 2 on high with DX11 on at full fps but this game lags like a benchmark running on a potato. I'm not the only person to complain about this. Perhaps if you fix it, it might be worth your time.
453	1	a	Baby sitting tool !
455	1	a	This changed me

467	1	a	My buddy and I couldn't connect our gumboys together. This is insanity! Don't buy this game, don't gift, and do not buy 5 other copies. I'm bad and I should feel bad.
155	0	a	'Game of the Year 2006!' - A very very dismal year. This game has it all: horrendous optimization, the tinniest voices my ears will never hear again, the disgusting artwork, and o top it all off I bought this game  twice , I want my $0.88 back and all 31 minutes of my life back. 10/10 would hang myself with my laptop charger before getting this game for free. Thinking back on this, I do wish I killed myself before playing this atrocious pile of code called a 'game'.
469	1	a	Obviously you must realise the art work that lies deep inside the game. It's deep inside the subconscious of a young child in pre industrial America where you are forced to thrive off of others in a anarchy like goverment, yet being deep in the past the gumboys predict the future with movements and smiles. What lies in the cores of gumboys is something that is deep and dark that is covered up with looks of pleasuring happiness...you must find this out on your own. Only you can learn the secret art of the gumboy. Find it...  
158	0	a	if you like this you're either a baby or an iphone gamer
471	1	a	Fun gane, I love the pace it has, too bad there ain't not any players online!!! try it !!!!!!!

477	1	a	cumboy tournament
479	1	a	This was an epic game Gumboy Tournament is a semi-follow up to 2006's 2D side-scroller Gumboy: Crazy Adventures. What's unique about Gumboy Tournament is that it's not a linear, move-from-the-left-of-the-screen-to-the-right-of-the-screen platformer in the vein of Super Mario Bros. The game's levels are closed-off arenas, and the view usually allows you to see most of the level,
481	1	a	i like because its a tourtament game.
483	1	a	Pretty awesome game! Never knew!
163	0	a	imagine getting gangrene on your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ then having to cut it off with a dull filet knife  that is getting this game to work on multiplayer

169	0	a	I remember playing it outside of Steam, it was great. Too bad it's Steam version has extremely low framerate for some reason which is important for such a fast-paced game. There is no way to solve this problem.
495	1	a	Get it while its on sale, it worth 0,19 â‚¬!
173	0	a	This game sucks so bad, that makes Bad Rats look like Titanfall (but no seriously, Bad Rats was really fun, that i made 3 hours from the first launch, even i unlocked an achievement).  I am sorry for the people who bought it for full price. Atleast i spend 20 cents for this.
174	0	a	Holy mother, this game is absolutely pointless and pathetic. The conrols are irritating, the music and voices are annoying, and you can beat it in less than half an hour. I only bought it because it was sale for 29 cents, and its not even worth that. Even if you think that you can 'appreciate' an indie puzzle game like this one, you definitely should not buy this unless it's for a younger sibling or as a joke gift to a friend.

184	0	a	Lame. You play as a sticky ball that rolls along the edge of things and tries to beat other sticky balls to the objectives. It sounds lame because it is. It has local co-op, which I didn't try, but I'm sure that would still be lame. But do check out the video for this game in its Community Hub, which is hilarious.

521	1	a	 Early Access Review
523	1	a	And the long anticipated day has finally come, Super Toy Cars is fully released! Originally released through Early Access in March, Super Toy Cars has gone through months of updates and polish and is the better for it. It's definitely one of my favorite racing games on Steam, if not one of my favorite games on Steam, period.  The mechanics of this game are more influenced by physics than most other kart racing games I've played, and though it takes a little bit of getting used to, is very enjoyable once you get the hang of it. I'd highly recommend checking out the guides I've written to understand things like  the drift system  when you get started. It took me maybe two hours before I got proficient at it, though with the refinements to the system since I picked it up back when it was first available you'll probably get the hang of it much quicker.  Track design is pretty good, though the art for such is not as inspired or unique as something like Mario Kart (which of course has a long history of games to draw on). It's certainly by no means bad though and will keep you going as you progress through the game. Car design (and  here's the relevant guide on that ), on the other hand, is much more interesting, drawing on a number of real life cars, and providing lots of cosmetic options to keep you from getting bored. The cars also handle very differently and provide their own unique challenges, though they do fall into a few general categories. The difference between the light and heavy cars is far more pronounced than it is in other kart racing games, and some cars can really keep you on your toes!  The career mode is probably where you're going to be spending the bulk of your time. There are a large number of challenges to complete and it will probably keep you occupied for 5-10 hours.  One of my guides  goes in depth on each game mode so I'll spare you the details. Completing each one will take some work, especially in later levels, but is definitely do-able.  This game has both local and online multiplayer, with support for up to 4 and 8 players, respectively. Unfortunately I don't have anyone to test the local multiplayer with so I can't say if the game handles splitscreen well (for example, in the recent Mario Kart 8 people have noticed reduced frame rate with four players). Local multiplayer is also where you can choose any track or mode to play singleplayer. Online works well though, with no bugs in the netcode to speak of. Hard to say how many people you'll find online at this point, though I don't expect the player population to be able to match that of AAA racing games on Steam like Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed. I have played online a few times and found it quite fun. There's AI to fill in for missing players, and it's generally pretty competent (both here and in singleplayer).  Now for some miscellaneous details. Steam Workshop support is a thing in this game, and there's a track editor that uses it. Performance is pretty good as well. My computer (a four year old mid-to-low tier laptop) can run the game at a stable 45 FPS at low settings, and the game looks pretty nice turned all the way up if you've got an actually good computer to handle it. The achievement list is fun, with a good balance of challenge, and it's one of the few games I've bothered to 100% the achievements in. The devs are great people and are very open to feedback, making this one of the best-handled (formerly) Early Access games on Steam I've seen. The price is fair, and if you enjoy kart racing games you can't really go wrong with this one. In short, this game is great!
525	1	a	Fun little racer (pun intended). It's as the title indicates: you are a toy car racer. The tracks are set up in some kids bedroom, lol. Anyway, although this game isnt super intricate, the car upgrade system works well and the car choices present you with options based on your driving preferences. They all look like the Mattel or Tonka or wahtever...toy cars we grew up on, so points added there.  The music is catchy, the tracks look cool, and the cars handle well enough. There is no realism involved necessarily, but then they are toy cars, so why would there be? btw, there are power ups throughout the course which give you weapons or boosts. Those add another fun element to the races.  This is just simply a cute and fun little racer. I played a bit offline, so my total time is a little skewed, but yeah, easy to recommend this one.  One sad note though...while there are some cool tracks in the workshop for this game (and btw...creating your own tracks is super simple as is sharing them on the Workshop), the online itself is largely dead, so if you really want to play against other people, try to make sure you have friends with the game (and/or be a good friend and buy them copies).  All in all, good simple fun. I give this one 7.5/10

537	1	a	I'm a sucker for the arcade racing genre, so I purchased this game early on (it might have been early access, I don't remember now), and I pretty much immediately wrote it off. More than anything the chunky hit boxes and punishing reset mechanics made for an infurating experience. That said, I'm glad I re-downloaded and gave it another shot. It's still not perfect but it's a whole lot better. In some ways the racing experience is among the most satisfactory of the arcade racers I play (among them, Bang Bang Racing, Mini-motors EVO, Little Street Racers) because it feels like the AI cars neither cheat nor are handicapped in an unrealistic manner. What remains imperfect are the hitboxes on some areas of some maps, which occasionally will find you stuck on parts that should clearly be traversable. Also, the heavily-mined elimination maps in career mode are almost hair-on-the-tongue annoying, at least if you're the sort that tries to get first on every map. I would rate myself as mediocre at this genre, for what it's worth, so if you're an ace at driving games, this might be too simple for you.

553	1	a	Super Toy Cars=Super Fun!!!  Its simple, yet challenging. I played it one weekend, and finally, just dominated every race. I was kinda disappointed, as I enjoy a good challenge. I then got busy for the next 3 days. When on the fourth day, I tried it, I was surprised at how rusty I was that I even failed at a race challenge that I usually had no problem with!  One down side is, that the online mutli-player lobby is usually empty. I first tried an online race, June 14, 2014. I was the only one on. I tried a second race. Again, only me. So I checked the time. 9:27pm Eastern time. This game will be complete once the online lobby fills up completely with racers.  This is also the perfect game to try to get used to racing games, bumper car type games, games where you get items to use against the other racers(such as MarioKarts.)  Ill be keeping my eye on the multi player lobby. Hopefully, it'll start filling up and I can fix the part of this review and say multi player is going smoothly.
555	1	a	Slightly better than RC Mini Racers, the car control is good and the AI is different from level to level.  Have fun and enjoy is all i can say.

559	1	a	Great Game! Many hours of gameplay, especially when trying to win on every track with the Sputs Golem! Great for evading mines but the top end and short duration of the boost made it very difficult, at least for me. There was another car that i spent quite a few hours trying to win in, but i forget now. Once you do win with one of those cars though, it's like 'YESSS!' The devs, namely Barkley, has been here since day one and is still here solving any issues that arise and just letting the player base know that the game is being backed by Eclipse Games , the creator of STC. I am impressed and hats off to Barkley!
561	1	a	A very nice game, I completed the main part in nearly 3 hours. Its fun! Not only can you get new cars, But you can get styles for cars and stuff. Very nice game.  8/10

573	1	a	 Early Access Review
575	1	a	This game is beast.
577	1	a	I really love this fun racing game because of it's many games modes. There's Career, Quick Race, Online Multiplayer, and Track Editor. All of these game modes are super fun and worth the time. There are some downsides like 'bad' physics but the creativity of this game balances it out.
579	1	a	I see a lot of future potential in this game! It is a very simple concept but still very fun and challenging at times. With a good multiplayer base, this could be a really interesting online play experience. It could use better graphichs though, it is a bit rough.
581	1	a	SUCH fun. Recommend to anyone who enjoyed Mario Kart and who wants a very casual co-op game on Steam. Really annoyed by the music but it's easy to turn that off and play your own stuff in the background.
583	1	a	Very good game.
585	1	a	My first few races I didn't really care for this game, but after you get use to the drifting and boosting, it becomes really fun. You can drift nearly the whole time, even on straight aways, and it makes it way more fun trying to see how long you can keep it going.
587	1	a	It's cute, neat and somewhat fun. If you don't mind the other cars being overly touchy, your car extremely fragile, frustrating courses with even more ridiculous events, along with annoying beeping sounds, you might enjoy this game.  I only wish I could give it a neutral rating instead of yes or no. Wait until this game goes on sale or risk wasting 10 bucks.
589	1	a	Nice music. Online's a bit dead.
591	1	a	  racing for the kids :-)
593	1	a	If you enjoy racing and drifting around at the speed of Super-Fast HotWheels cars this is the game for you! With different modes and car customizations too. The game is also easy to 100% Complete.  9.5/10
595	1	a	Great game. Love playing it. Would be even better if you could go through campaign in co-op mode.
597	1	a	Played it through in about 4 hours and that's probably it for me, because it looks like Multiplayer mode isn't available on Mac (the main menu item is disabled). The achievements aren't working with steam either. Other things I think are annoying:     Some objects have invisible walls so you better shouldn't cut the corners to much.    The music. Especially this track that changes pitch all the time (or is this also a bug?)   So at the end of the day: Yes, it's a fun tabletop racer, especially on the higher levels, but there are better ones, like TableTop Racing (iOS, Android). With the bugs fixed it would be a little bit better, though.
599	1	a	It's no Trackmania or Sonic All-stars, but it's an ok way to while away half an hour or so.
601	1	a	highly recommend if you just want to have a fun with friends family or girl/boyfriend
603	1	a	48 career races and a nice amount of cars, people keep complaining about this game, but i dont know why. its a fun mario kart spin-off for PC, and it looks and feels nice to play. You can easily get a couple hours out of this game, although, at full price, im not so optimistic about this game, but if you get it on sale for 3 bucks, i definetly recommend it.
605	1	a	I just bought this game today. And I really enjoy playing it. Because the game sometimes plays for you. Giving you the opportunity to watch how the tracks are designed and how the car controls ever move. Except for flipping.   But there was one other reason why I bought this game. I was interested in the Workshop feature. For creating a track and then clicking share. Which I'd assumed it would've uploaded it to the Workshop. But after I exit the game and view the uploaded Workshops. Super Toy Cars track that I had shared that I can see with my other Workshops are blank. There doesn't seem to be any writing which I did include a name and description. Also the screenshot. But the Workshop content is bare. I would've not recommended this game but since the main game theme is marvelously designed. I would still recommend this game, regardless to the Workshop problem which I hope will be fixed in the future.
607	1	a	Not long ago I came across a pathetic remake of ReVolt, it was even insulting to see a beautiful game like revolt copied in such a pathetic way.   But Super Toy Cars, is something else. It's fun to play. The tracks are Re-Volt-ish style, but are original.  Pros: I like the idea of building your own tracks and sharing them. The driving is very responsive, and definitely more realisting than some other games on steam. The soundtrack is really good, even though there are only a few songs.  Cons: Sound Effects are missing on some spots on the tracks. Multiplayer is there, but unfortunately nobody plays. The graphics may be improved, maybe adding more objects that drivers can interract with on the tracks. I think also that if not improved the price should drop significantly.  Even though the game can be improved I enjoy playing it, I'll definitely play until I unlock all the cars, paints styles and achievements. I can't wait to play this game with friends, I'm sure it will be a lot of fun.
609	1	a	funny good racing game! good graphics! good music. race car control physics are ok.  i have a nvidia 960m (laptop), game graphics are nice and good!
611	1	a	The game have its limitations, but it 's pretty enjoyable. Fun physics and car interactions! Driving a toy car at max speed avoiding hitting cereal or chocolate has never been so much fun ;D
613	1	a	Amazing game. Perfect solo casual racer.
199	0	a	Super Toy Cars feels like a game that escaped out of early access with a reassuring smile and a lot of fundamental issues unaddressed.  As I was playing through it I kept having to double check that it was indeed fully released and not still undergoing development, with so many prevalent bugs and a general lack of basic racing necessities popping up as if I had somehow been slipped a beta build in place of the final game. But Super Toy Cars is indeed 'finished', or at least unlikely to receive any major future updates, so we're left with the game we've been given and it's a rather disappointing end result to something that started off with such promise.  Super Toy Cars wants to occupy a space between kart racers and somewhat more realistic arcade racers, with the handling and track designs of the latter and the zany power-ups and silliness so often associated with the former. In reality it adheres almost entirely to traditional arcade racing, with the inclusion of power-ups being rather unnecessary and pretty useless on the whole. There was rarely an instance where launching a missile or dropping an oil spill gave me any noticeable advantage, occasionally being a slight annoyance but usually something I forgot was even there.  I think a lot of this though has to do with how spaced out racers inevitably get over the course of a race. After the first lap I would often be so far behind or ahead of everyone else that there wasn't any chance I'd be able to hit someone with a power-up even should I want to, and even in the rare instance I was in the middle of the pack it so often felt like I was the only one driving. It's a mystery to me how so many racers can exist on such a small track and remain largely entirely separate from each other, but it definitely makes the game feel rather isolating when the only reminder that you're racing against someone is the fraction in the upper corner of the screen.  Again this is linked to another issue in the game, that being how unbalanced the different cars are and the laughably inept AI racers the game pits you against. Drift is by far the most important stat in the game, so much so that it means cars with a high drift rating will almost always be far and away the best vehicles in the game, rendering all but two or three cars impractical to try and drive. After only a few races I'd settled upon the Panther and found myself dominating every race despite driving like an absolute madman and crashing into things on a near constant basis. If the game starts out easy it trickles down to a virtual void of challenge, as I blew through race after race wondering if I had somehow been caught in a loop and wasn't actually moving forward in events.  Keeping with the trend of every issue being intrinsically linked to another, that feeling of consistent repetition is the result of an abundance of redundancies in track designs and event types. There are only twelve tracks in the game, and at least half of them feel almost interchangeable with one another, with the others being iconic mostly for their backgrounds and not any interesting track layout. The handful of different event types again double up on each other, with checkpoint and single lap time trials feeling nearly identical and the only alteration between elimination and evade being the obnoxious mines placed along the track. There's already a noticeable lack of content in Super Toy Cars, but having so much of it feel so similar to each other and stretch on so long somehow seems worse than if the game had just been half as long.  The monotonous grind of repeated events robs the game of any sense of progression. You aren't looking forward to new tracks because there aren't any; you aren't looking to improve your skills because the AI is never challenging you. There's no desire to buy new cars as so many are useless, and upgrades are needless and so inexpensive you can be fully upgraded after only a half dozen races or less.  And then there are the usual hallmarks of unfinished games: glitchy audio, constant collision issues, hitting invisible walls and clipping through solid ones, random frame rate drops, and a rather embarrassingly bare bones online mode (which doesn't even support private lobbies or inviting friends).  I like what Super Toy Cars is going for, and I think with a few more months of development it could have become a lot more than it did, but being ostensibly finished it feels pointless to hold out hope that its problems will ever be fixed, or that it's even in a state that could be remedied with a few patches. I'm not sure if it was pushed out the door early or its developers really thought it was finished, but the end result is still a game that's in need of attention it won't receive.

200	0	a	Now, lets set somthing straight before we get started  I was raised on Re-Volt, Crash Team Racing and Mario Kart  Do you now what all 3 of those games have in common? They are all interesting with a fair bit of replayability   Re-Volt made you feel like you were handling actual toy cars, in addition to having an impressive selection of cars/tracks Crash Team Racing was just the best. Small-ish selection for cars and tracks. But the power-ups and the sheer uniqueness of the entire game made this a gem Mario Kart was the great grandfather of kart racing, and had a fairly large track selection and had plenty of multiplayer mayhem  Does Super Toy Cars do this?  Yes. For about an hour and a half. Then it gets *really* dull *REALLY* quickly  The number of tracks described in the description is slightly wrong, or at least pretty misleading. They mean there are 12 tracks TOTAL, and there are 4 different locations TOTAL. It doesnt mean 'there are 12 tracks in 4 locations for a total of 48 tracks' Moreover, the tracks are very simple affairs, nothing really unique about them at all  The cars are meh. Between the hitboxes being helariously random (as they collide with the track funkily, making drifting a chore when you clip a tube wall wrong, or get bumped out of a drift by a guy 3 feet away). This also makes ramming quite literally a hit or miss situation  Also, each car has stats that determine how they run. The only way to see these stats is to go into the campaign mode and memorize them, as you cannot see the during 'quick race' or 'multiplayer' modes. But again, unless if its an extreme stat (insanely high or low) you will not notice a difference. Without fail the high speed models (formula 1 car generally) will have a piece of cake for the races, where as the more maneuverable or more weighty models get lapped constantly with very little balancing  The powerups are lame. There is not much really to be said about them other than they feel weak because of the funky physics on the car's part. If a car gets hit with an 8ball (a very powerful weapon) it kind of gets spun a little... It also has the annoying feature of replacing your powerup whenever you drive over a new one. Making sure that you cant save them for when you need them  So in summary, I would give Super Toy Cars a 4/10  Its not a bad game, just a game done poorly. Pick it up if its on sale for 4 dollars or less, but dont expect much   TL:DR VERSION Ok racing game gets boring quickly. Spend 10 dollars elsewhere
201	0	a	Looks nice, but the cars' handling feels off and I got stuck in the track a couple times. Maybe if it's really cheap, but you're probably better off waiting for a sale on Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed instead.
202	0	a	This was pretty obviously made by people who loved the hell out of Re-Volt on the Dreamcast. As well they should, because Re-Volt owned. This one tries but is a little too buggy and unpolished to make the mark. There's a good variety of cars but the tracks are pretty samey, with no good gimmicks or unique features and some frustrating invisible walls. The drifting mechanic is also pretty weird and stiff if you're used to Mario Kart, but I got the hang of it eventually. Races aren't too hard if you keep buying and upgrading new cars, though it should be mentioned that there's zero rubberbanding, which is both a blessing and a curse. If one CPU driver pulls away from the pack he can be impossible to catch, forcing a restart if you want gold. Most races are basic time trials or eliminations, but there is one neat one called Evade where the track is covered in mines, and the last place car is eliminated every 15 seconds. Those races are more about driving carefully than fast, and they can be pretty intense. It's not a bad game, just an unpolished one. I got all the way through it but I wouldn't recommend it unless you are dying for an arcade racer right now.
203	0	a	Not recommend for most everyone. Recommend to those who are already big fans of racing games.  [I really don't like steam's simplistic yes/no review system; this isn't a bad game, but there are many better games in the same price range]  PROS: -Variety of cars  CONS: -Wacky physics -'upgrades' on the cars are pointless as they just improve the car. It isn't some type of loadout where gear is a tradeoff....you just buy each piece once and once your car is upgraded thats it.  -Invisible walls -Pointless weapons and poor weapon system (if you run over a box while already having one, it replaces your current item...this means the person in front will get all the boxes but at the same time if you want to save a specific item you have to dodge the other item boxes...) -Lack of HUD/UI elements (you seem to only be able to drift above a certain speed but that speed is...??) -Online playerbase is dead (no online games)
204	0	a	- Feels unfinished - Controls and collision detection are a bit off. - Speed is rather slow  Note: One cool feature this game has.  When you lay a bomb behind you, a little rear view window pops up and stays on screen until someone hits your bomb. So you can see if your placement was any good... Thumbs up for that..
205	0	a	This looked fun, but it really isn't. This game is plegued with issues. Vehicle handling is horrid, some cars stick to the track like crazy and others with start drifting if you turn even slightly. Really bad aliasing issues reguadless of the setting, Boring power ups. Hitboxes on cars are terrible and invisible walls are everwhere. maps are so-so nothing really special. the toy cars simply don't feel like toy cars. Go grab toybox turbo or blazerush instead.
206	0	a	Originally voted for this on Steam Greenlight, but i'm dissapointed. I was aware of the bad reviews before I got the game, but ended up getting it in a bundle so tried it out anyway.  Like some reviewers have said, it's obviously inspired by Micro Machines &amp; Re-volt, but unfortunately the result is a game which has too many issues to be fun or even worth playing. I only actually played (and completed, the campaign is 1.5 hours long) the game for the trading cards.  Overall, it feels unfinished, and it's not really worth the time to play, unfortunately.  Positives + The models of the cars are decent quality. + The music is okay (at least the first few times it plays). + The micro machines-like concept of small cars in a big world is a good concept.  Negatives - Physics are clunky and floaty, in a bad way rather than a comedic way. This breaks the game for a few reasons:  The game's 'stuck prevention' mechanic will occour seemingly at random. I had occasions where I was in 1st and the game would randomly respawn me in 8th place for no reason. Other times you'll hit one of the many invisible walls and completely slow down, then be respawned way behind the other competetors. Or hit a wall which is only partially sold, get stuck and then be respawned in 8th.  The game has physics objects which act as obstacles. The only problem is that all of them share the same similar floaty physics, meaning that they will often stop you completely if you even slightly collide with them. It's also extremely difficult to avoid these objects as they happen so frequently throughout the races.  Essentially, the main issue is that the game is constantly slowing you down or teleporting you without reason.   - The game doesn't handle speed well, which is a common problem in racing games. At times it doesn't feel like you're really moving, but at other times you'll suddenly be going so fast that it will be impossible to control. Also it's another racing game which relies heavily on drifting to get boosts.  -It feels like there's a lot of missing sound effects. You'll constantly hear the same engine sound, and other sound effects like objects bumping into each other are missing, which sounds strange.  -Although the car models are good, the environment objects are really mixed in terms of quality. Most of the objects in the environment look either low quality, or very stretched for some reason. Also, the roads are way too reflective or shiny and it looks odd.  Minor issues: Boosting seems like it will occasionally not improve your speed at all. Drifting will sometimes get stuck and you'll still be drifting even when you're not holding down the button anymore (could be an issue with using the PS3 controller)  
207	0	a	 KAMGUSTA's mini Review   At first I tought this was a Micromachines clone... but the horrible gameplay, the terrific hit box collisions, the boring scenaios changed my mind in just a few minutes. Do not let the screenshots fool you! It really feels like an unfinished early access game. Stay away from this thing!   Score 4/10 
208	0	a	Looked like it might be fun, but the drifting/boosting mechanic in this game is over-the-top completely broken. With cars that have high enough drift/weight characteristics (tier 3/4), you can literally drift through the entire track and boost yourself almost constantly. Ruins it.  That and there's only a handful of tracks/environments.
209	0	a	Subpar game in all regards. Music is decent but vehicle sounds and general sound effects are very crude. Gameplay is rudimentary and isn't satisfying. Mario Kart gameplay without the awesome.
210	0	a	A crap Mario Kart. Get the vastly better Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed instead.
211	0	a	This is exactly the kind of game a bunch of people who got together one night got drunk and accidently made a quick game.  The only positive is the fact they used colours, and i like colours.
212	0	a	Another Early Access Failure...
213	0	a	Buggy as hell, this is far from a finished product. I won't even go to game mechanics flaws (unbalanced cars, silly AI). Things as basic as online play or track editor are not working at all (at least not in the mac edition)  Having said that, my kid loves this game. I hate to have to play it.  Old revolt is still WAY better than this thing.
214	0	a	This is one of them trashy games you pick for a few pennies or from a cheap bundle. Game play is okay I guess but itâ€™s fairly buggy with random crashes and invisible walls. Decent amount of cars with extra boosts and power ups but it gets old after a short while. Again okay amount of tracks but they have the same or similar design. The tried with this game but failed and itâ€™s differently not worth itâ€™s 6.99 price. If you can get it cheap enough, then try it but you may find the game to get old very quickly or as I found a little too easy on some racers after youâ€™ve got all the fast cars with their upgrades.
215	0	a	 Early Access Review
216	0	a	This game is pretty awful. I wanted to try and like it, but there is very little here to like. The track editor is just annoying to use. The cars range from not handling at all to soap bars with wheels. The Mine Race mode is the worst thing ever. Physics and collision boxes are just completely random. There's only 4 different variations on track themes, which don't add anything except a different look to the tracks. It's almost hard to believe that with such an enormous breadth of games to draw inspiration from that this somehow ended up being worse than any of them.
217	0	a	This game is good and bad.  - Poor Controls - Poor Soundtrack (only like 3-4 tracks, and they kinda all suck) - VERY poor sound effects for the cars - Somehow low handling makes cars drift nonstop (which is silly) - Mine Levels are extremely annoying - The power ups are kinda pointless.  + The tracks and level design are very appealing with lots of stuff littered around the room. + You can buy / upgrade vehicles.
218	0	a	This is horrible! You can drive thru some obstacles, and others have invisible walls.  The physics are wonky at best, useless at worst. You can't invite people to multiplayer or actually start and/or end the races. You have to wait for a rediculous timer. 'Online multiplayer' seems to mean lan play. Every time you get back to the lobby, your car and color choices have been reset.  On the plus side, you can turn off the music.  
219	0	a	Table of Contents: - Foreword - Graphics - Gameplay - Sounds - Controls - Quality - Overall Experience   -Foreword I expected way more than i got. I've played a RC Car game yesterday which was like 10x more enjoyable.  -Graphics The graphics are really bad. Some textures are only loading when you're in the range of 10m.  -Gameplay The gameplay was weird. Quick races are only for local multiplayer, so i've only played one race of the carrer. Didnt even try the multiplayer. I cant expect many people to play it. And even less i believe that it works flawless.  -Sounds Thats the main point why i quit the game so fast, besides to it being weird and bad. The Sound Effects had such a low bad quality, only the music quality was good, i didnt like the music though. There is no sound for crashing into a wall, which is definetly way more important than many other sounds it actually features. Well, all sound bad.  -Controls The game uses the arrow keys when started first. I changed it to WASD, Handbrake was on CTRL btw...  -Quality The overall quality was just really bad. I know some people will probably say i cant judge about a game after 10 minutes of playtime, but i think i can. Its clearly much worse than other 'Toy Car' games. Also, the game says 'Are you blind man?' and something else when driving backwards and then just resets your Vehicle...  -Overall Experience Bad. Seriously, i would not recommend you to get that game. Search for other games instead.

228	0	a	I really wish I could reccomend this game because I had rather high hopes for it, but I just feel like I wasted my money. I suppose you can't expect much from an indie game, but there are a lot of things that need work. The graphics aren't terribly interesting, and most tracks just look the same. The tracks themselves aso feel very self-contained, and not like they're part of a bigger world (which is what I'd expect from a game about tiny cars in a big house). The soundtrack is a few rather forgettable songs from some indie band you've invariably never heard of, and it will liekly leave you muting it and playing your own choice of music instead. And last but not least, the whole thing seems like it took big ideas from other racers (small scale, wepons, upgrades, etc), but didn't grasp what made them good. If you're looking for a new Micro Machines or Revolt, try something else. This just doesn't live up to its peers.
229	0	a	NOT for children! While the childish imagery might suggest it's kid-friendly, it is NOT. This game contains a music track titled 'Slam Van'. The song is about the titular vehicle that is a sex-orgy-on-wheels.

233	0	a	My friend gave me this game and we are no longer friends.
234	0	a	This game suxx. It's not the worst racing game that i played but it quiet realy realy bad. the soundtrack is only 2 tracks so you turn of the sound very very fast. The race suxx as hell. you alway play on the same 3 maps on the absolut same 4 game modes (elimination, time attack, race, minesweeper) against the same stupid drivers (in diffrent cars) theoretical there are cars that can be choosen, but why should anyone drive another car than the beginner car to the max (in under 30 min) and after you buy it you have already the best for all races. For the gameplay itself its mario cart on very bad copy. you drive and maybe drift, than pickin up some powerups that you fire at your enemys. the problem is that the AI is so damn â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that the always ram and not even try to avoid a collosion (with you or enviroment)
235	0	a	Yep! Old micromachines were better. What I didn't like in this game: permanent camera view, camera is too close, there is no ability to drive out from the road, too strong drift effect, turbo is not for this game.
236	0	a	This game is merely a merely competent cart racing style game with absolutely nothing that makes it stand out. The vehicles handle pretty differently, but there's little reason to not use the fastest one you can afford. The collision detection isn't great, you can drive through some objects and get stopped by blank space sometimes.  There's no real reason to play this over existing games in the genre like Mario Kart, Re-Volt, or RC Cars since it does nothing unique or exceptional.
237	0	a	Worst racing game i have ever played, and one of the worst games ive ever played of all time. DO NOT BUY. unless maybe its for your 5 year old kid. i had originally purchased this game thinking it would be something like re-volt and it come nowhere close to being the same. anyways yea dont buy it sucks.
238	0	a	The game plays extremely poorly.
239	0	a	This game is bad.

244	0	a	Has a very weird sound glitch. All of the sound is very low besides the music. The control sucks and so does everything else. It might be fun for ten minutes if you are a toddler though. It came in a bundle I got for something else and made me glad for the alt+f4 function on my keyboard.

247	0	a	Bad Game. -No content. -Game play sucks. -Multi broken.  Dont buy it
248	0	a	Not the best game Feels like its and alpha release.
249	0	a	Not much to play. You've seen everything in two or three hours. Not worth the investment.
250	0	a	cons  - pretty much everything (driving, drifting, respawning, bugged environment) - had to write review 5 times+ before it was posted
251	0	a	Very wonky controls, collision bugs, strange drifting mechanic. Overall just not very enjoyable
252	0	a	I found the game to be to easy, along with poor balancing problems. The stat drift becomes so much better then the other stats which is upsetting. Very limited number of tracks and the ai is poor.   There are better games out there that do a racing style kid game better.
253	0	a	It sux wtf ? If another car it you, you crash and the game respawn you, if you hit the wall (or a lego (obstacle on the road)) you crash and the game respawn you, if another car run too fast and hit the back of your car, you crash and the game respawn you... Overall, with the sound/graphic the game sounds cheap and amateur...
254	0	a	This is a poor relation by any standard. The look and most particularly the feel of Super Toy Cars does make you realise just how much research and development goes into big name titles such as Mario Kart.  If you're of a mind to have fun with this type of racer, this is certainly one whose concept, features and artwork jump out at you. But it's a disappointment in almost every department.  The fact the Update History page shows the last entry as 5 Jul, 2014 should be all you need to not make the mistake of buying it.
255	0	a	The Idea is great  The execution is bad  Sound and fluidness is terrible I switched of the music after race 10 because it was always the same song  Overall the game is kinda ok to play if its for free, to actually pay for this game is a no go.
256	0	a	It is fun and maddening at the same time.  Controls are really wonky for a driving game.  Was looking for a mario-cart replacement and this would have been wonderful, if not for the aweful controls.  Graphics are cute and nice to look at. Too bad it wasn't just that little more polished.
257	0	a	Not much to play. You've seen everything in two or three hours. Not worth the investment.
258	0	a	I'd say this game was child friendly, but in reality they'd probably find it more frustrating than I did.  Visuals are fine, and there's a surprisingly punchy soundtrack, but it fails mechanically.
259	0	a	Horrible gameplay, full of bugs. If you get it on a bundle, then give it a try but no way it costs 10 dollars ...
260	0	a	I found the game to be to easy, along with poor balancing problems. The stat drift becomes so much better then the other stats which is upsetting. Very limited number of tracks and the ai is poor.   There are better games out there that do a racing style kid game better.

262	0	a	From the name of the game and some pictures of the game, I thought this would be some Micro Machines clone. It is not. Treating this as its own racing game, it just is not very fun. For most of the game the racing is not very entertaining, while at the same time being far too easy. Later levels get a bit harder, but that just means you need to buy a better car and some upgrades for it. If you want a 'toy car' racing game that is fun, buy Toybox Turbos instead.
263	0	a	It looks like a fun game, then why the negative review? I cant control the car, I have a 360 controller, an xbox one controller and mouse and keyboard, for some reason, I CANNOT throtle, or break for that matter with anyone of them, even after rebinding keys for the keyboard, but I am able to turn the camera... I wont even bother to unplug the controllers to see what is causing the conflict.
264	0	a	With Xbox 360 controllers there are huge mapping and acceleration problems, especially in split screen mode. This is a complete showstopper for someone purchasing this game for local multiplayer! Especially given that there is no option to configure controls. Also once someone has joined there is no option for them to leave the game. Otherwise a promising racer except for insane amount of bugs and early access feel. And the developer doesn't seem committed to fixing the issues with the game, so don't waste your money.
265	0	a	The drifting in the game is really, really bad. The default setting of respawning for whatever is also dumb and, more often than not, bad for you. Car handling is so-so. There is an interesting selection of cars and tracks, but that's about it.
266	0	a	When I first heard about the idea of this game I though it would be really nice. The idea is nice indeed. More than that, I was curious to check a game made using Unity 2D. However, the final game has some bugs that just could'nt be there. The collision system with some objects is weird. I thing is all about rectangular colliders and that's it. Also, I get errors in the HUD that could'nt be there... For example, everytime I finish a race I get two HUDs that overlap each other, present same shortcuts for different functions... It's just bizarre... Moreover, my achievements are being tracked/sync in Steam.
267	0	a	An extremely tepid, generic, forgettable experience. It's a decent time-waster, for sure, and I genuinely have to admire the sense of scale and speed, as well as the colorful track design. However, the concerningly massive number of typos are a first sign that the experience is a bit slapdash, and the downright uncomfortable drifting mechanic makes Ridge Racer Unbounded seem comparatively intuitive (this game has two ways to use the handbrake and neither really works well).  AI competitors are inept to a childish degree, and I don't mean how a child plays a video game like this. I mean when they're bored inside a real car and run the car up a wall and then keep bumping it against the seat. I watched in amused awe as no less than three of the AI at once all decided not to take the turn ahead and instead wedge themselves into a corner, respawn before the corner, and do it again. And again. And again.  Visually, it's a mess. I mean, it's very neatly modeled and colorful and well designed, but this is all marred by a very questionable blurring effect that applies depth of field or... something, extremely wonkily. It just looks like vaseline smeared on random parts of the camera.  Audio-wise, the actual vehicle audio is decently okay. The pop-style soundtrack is genuinely impressive, except for the very repetitive main menu tune. Like, seriously, I see why the soundtrack provider is shown prominently in advertising for the game and on the first loading screen. It's pretty damn good. Though with lyrics about having women in one arm and booze in the other, it makes me figure this isn't supposed to be a kid's game, which makes me wonder who it actually IS for. Bored twenty-somethings and up looking for a bit of nostalgia of the good old days banging toy cars against each other like myself, I suppose. In any case, I totally want to find more of the musician's work, because it's really great, really serene. The high point of the game by a long shot.  I have extremely fond memories of Mad Tracks, and absolutely love racing games in general. Toy car racing games are a rather rare niche, especially outside of top-down games in the vein of Micro Machines, but even then, this fails to stand out. I obtained it in a bundle with many other cheap indie racing titles. I switched vehicles and noticed that the one I picked, the WRC4, bizarrely steered itself around the track for some reason. After that and a rehashed mission type with mines added where it turns out all the AI immediately steered into mines and blew themselves up, only for me to hit one and launch ahead  faster  and win, I gave up. Not terrible, but there are so many great racing games crying out for your attention, time, and wallet that this just isn't worth it. As it is, I'll likely just leave it running for cards and not bother booting it again.
615	1	a	In case your confused Flatout Ultimate Carnage is Flatout 2 with a few extras. Basically Flatout 2 with a DLC in it would be the best way to describe it. In truth it was a re-release of Flatout 2, not exactly sure why.  I hate racing games. So for me to like a racing game it must be pretty damn fun. A garage where you can purchase and upgrade many vehicles. Your car takes lots of damage and so do the other cars. You can visibly see the damage of all the cars. You can totally wreck your car out of the race and you can also take out opponents by causing enough damage to the AI cars.  Some of the best feeling cars in a simulation. It doesnt feel 'arcadey' yet cars become very managable at high speeds. There is even a crash durby mode.  WARNING - Don't even think about Flatout 3. Totally different company did that one and unless you want to see an example of the worst race game ever don't bother. Flatout 2 is the best in the series.  SERIOUSLY - No idea if the forum is still up for Flatout 3 but at some point I was wondering if they were going to shut it down because of SOOO many complaints. Have you ever bought a game programming book with an example race game in it? Flatout 3 was worse than that.
617	1	a	I've played the retail of this game, the not retail, the steam release on another account and a few times on this account..   So.. What is Flatout UC and what makes it tick?  Basically, an upgraded Flatout 2 with some chievs and stuff. But saying that isn't helping much so lets just do a list of pros and cons. Cons first.    Cons:  - uses GFWL - that glitch with rubbish on the road that normally should just bump from the car but that one critical time impales your car thru the middle and makes it vault into the air when you could have got that new lap record or won a hard race. - online races are either stomps or annoying - not the best graphics, but good enough - you might not like all the modes of the game. personally i think stunts are fun in between some normal races with friends. Not a fan of the derby mode, timerun or unbalanced online games. - way too much nitro as default   Pros:  - you can overshoot the bowling lane to spell 'BO...NG' - the commentator in stunts when he gets all excited  - seeing a ragdoll AI driver overtaking your car briefly as you hear the car had crashed behind you - half a lap behind when only 2 laps remain? NOT a problem. You might still win. - getting that flatout (doubletap throttle and hold) turn in the curve going exactly as you wanted  - playing close races with friends and then continuing racing online together against the world - old but still going strong. same applies to game. - more fun than many other racing games out there. the pioneer of derbylike racing games. - no clichÃ© storyline, just start racing and have fun.  - do you prefer to race on gravel, at racetracks or to demolish a shopping mall with your car? Look no further. - match options are ok and exist. typically put 100% upgrades, no bonus and half or less nitro + only half damage and it's pretty cool.   If you like arcadeish, not too serious derbyracing with some amount of destructive environment with a flair of stunts, sterotypical AI characters, non-copyrightinfringing carbrands and something slightly more than flatout 2 i'm not sure why you're reading this after watching the trailer, just put it in the cart already you scrub.  8/10
619	1	a	The Best Flatout version!
621	1	a	A timeless classic! There is nothing more to say. No other arcade racing game has such awesome feel and handling, at least no other racing game that i know of (and i know a lot). Especially in multiplayer mode this game is addictive.  In order to play FOUC you need to install Microsoft GAMES FOR WINDOWS LIVE. You should be able to install WINDOWS LIVE by doubleclicking the exe [LiveUpdateLauncher] located in the game directory. The game directory is usually [C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Flatout Ultimate Carnage]  BTW: We are still playing it online via 'Games for Windows Live'. The Microsoft announcement from June 2014 that 'GFWL' will be closed at 1st July was false. Microsoft told us that 'GFWL' will not close anytime soon.
269	0	a	This game launches but it still needs Windows live which is unfortunately not supported with Windows 10. It keeps giving error. Even compatibility and run as admin CANNOT FIX THIS. Sooo....until this problem is fixed, Sorry I cannot recommend this game (for Windows 10 Users beware)
623	1	a	The game is fine, what is absolute crap is the Windows Live integration. Be warned. Like me, you may NOT be able to actually play what you have purchased!! Problem now solved, but I'm not happy with Windows Live.
625	1	a	This is one of the best games on steam you can buy period.
627	1	a	+ Lots of game modes including a (sort of)campaign, custom play, online, party mode and carnage where you can do stuff like high jump, football, pure destruction racing/derbies and more + Physics and graphics are excellent(nothing fancy but it plays very well) + Catchy music that can get boring after a while but you can just disable it and play your own + Adrenaline! + Many different leaderboards to compare your best times and scores with the world + Many cars including different colours + Many tracks + Servers still online + Barely any bugs at all(I've noticed maybe one or two in total)  - GFWL...! - Upgrades in the campaign are terrible - Unfair AI further in the 'campaign' - even when fully upgrading most cars they(AI) WILL be faster than you(this is most noticeable on tracks without many turns) - Game can get boring after a while after you've completed all the solo things - Not many playing online(usually one or two people/groups at any time, when I checked)  Nothing else I can think of at the moment but even before I bought this game for a second time from Steam I had put at least 100 hours into it, even though I've always had many other games I could've been playing instead(which i didn't because this game is great!)  8/10
271	0	a	This game used to be awesome when Windows Live was still around and stored all of your progress. Now that it's gone, every time you play you have to start all over. Steam has to be aware of this, yet they still sell the game, knowing that you will never unlock all of the best cars which take weeks of playing to aquire. I already have the CD of this game that cost me 5 bucks, but quit storing my progress when Windows Live shut down. Now I have the 20 dollar Steam version that does the same thing. Selling this game with no fix is BAD BUSINESS.
629	1	a	An eyecandy for those who loves seeing:  -Cars crashing -Burning -Exploded down to it's frames -Drivers ejected through the windshield -Head-on crashes -Rocket cars -Stunts -Bowling with a car -Rocket cars -Being a ball in a football game -Using expensive cars in a derby -Have i said that you can use rocket cars?  One of the greatest game on it's age 9.5/10
273	0	a	This isn't a review so much as a warning: You have to have a Games for Windows Live account even to save progress in single player. It gives no warning of this so I lost a couple of hours gameplay and I'm lucky I didn't lose more.  Add to that the mess of trying to set up a GFWL / Xbox account and I'm really not impressed.  Which is a shame because the game itself looks pretty good.
631	1	a	Classic. This game will never get old.
275	0	a	FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage is a port of the original FlatOut 2 to next-gen (at the time) consoles, combining the original's engine and gameplay with HD graphics and Games For Windows Live support.   Pros: is Flatout 2 in HD  Cons: with Games For Windows Live  conclusion: just get flatout 2.
633	1	a	11/10  No doubt my favourite racing game. Alot of cars , which are in different brackets. Theyre also upgradable. Very good graphics , and im playing this in 2016. Good,various maps , destructible environment.Various gamemodes. Great music. Amazing gameplay in multiplayer and single player!
276	0	a	This game doesn't work. GFWL should die in a fire.
277	0	a	Broken Product, this should have been fixed a LONG time ago when MS announced the closing of windows live. I can not reommend this product anymore. If this is ever fixed I will change my review. Until then Steam should remove this game due to it being broken.
635	1	a	great game, loved it for ages now =], songs on it are awsome too!!!  tho it states its 'Keyboard' only, i am able to play it with a 360 controller as there is that capability in this game!  well worth getting if you love racing, smashing stuff up and just pure carnage with fast tempo rock music!
278	0	a	Be careful - this is just an upgraded version of FlatOut 2. The steam page doesn't like to mention that. I made the mistake of buying both, only to find out that they are basically the same thing.  Also, GFWL is REQUIRED in order to save the game in singleplayer mode, or to play multiplayer at all.
637	1	a	Games is fun, just like Fallout 1 &amp; 2. Works great with Nvidia 3D Vision.  I was about to refund it for not working because of GFWL..   BUT  you can download gfwlivesetup from   http://www.xbox.com/en-GB/LIVE/PC/DownloadClient  use your account or make a new one (not tested). Give it a try.   I can play it now and it saves my savegame! 
639	1	a	The best racing game I've played, on any platform, in thirty years of gaming. The cars have weight, the graphics are clear and crisp, the environments are realistic and destructible, and there are enough game modes, single- and multiplayer, to keep you hooked for a long time. According to Steam stats I've logged up 400+ hours. 'Nuff said.
280	0	a	I would recommend this game if it would install. seriously. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ games for windows live
641	1	a	The best driving game on PC by a mile. Unpredictable racing, high octane tracks and a blast to play. It's a destruction derby fantasy wet dream... go on treat yourself!
643	1	a	If you liked flatout2, you'll like and hate this one. It's the same game with a few tweaks here and there, prettier graphics and much inferior soundtrack.
645	1	a	I'll recommend this game to those who love arcade-style racing with a twist of destruction. Not only you get just pure racing, you also get these mini games which are enjoyable to play. The vehicles look very decent, even if they look like a utterly mess.   The soundtrack is very outstanding, it keeps you movitated in annihilating your competitiors from the road or anything that stands on your way.   My rating will be a 9/10
282	0	a	It's a good game but you have to wrestle with the gatekeeper of GFWL before you can get at it. Really disappointing.  Edit: Initial review was 2013. Here in 2015 the game is NON-FUNCTIONAL. The GFWL servers aren't responding so the game can't authenticate anymore. What a joke.
283	0	a	windows live is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
647	1	a	I've played the series since the first game,and it always has been one my favorite series of all times.As there might be some 'bugs' its all about the fun and destruciton.  PROS: -Kept the stunt event -4 new charaters -Added garnage mode -Some new sick cars -Kept all the bonus cars from the last games  CONS: -There aint none unless you count fun a 'waste of time'
649	1	a	This is a very fun arcade racing/derby game with great controls (with 360 gamepad anyway), graphics, sound, and music. It runs great on my fairly crappy PC, too.   There's a very large variety of races/classes/vehicles.  It seems to work just fine even with the Windows Live Marketplace shutdown, I've had no problems and can even play online. You still get the XBOX (games for windows live, but it hooks into your xbox gamerscore) achievements, too.
651	1	a	Basicly Flatout 2 with (somewhat) updated graphics especially water and some textures. No LAN play but does support online play with Windows Live. The game however is super slick Bugbear at its best. I love the action and physics and have very fond memories of playing this with friends.
653	1	a	One of the best arcade racers I have played.
655	1	a	FlatOut 2 was a great followup to the original FlatOut. It didn't take itself seriously and had nice graphics and style to boot. In 2007 BugBear decided to tweak it, repackage it and call it Ultimate Carnage. It's basically the same game but with some added modes and upgraded visuals. There's better textures, water, debris effects and reflections on the cars themselves. On the audio side the soundtrack has been replaced with lesser known tracks but they're mostly good although it gets repetitive after a while.  This is kind of a tough game to judge. It's fun, entertaining and has a lot to like but if you've played FlatOut 2 before then you'll feel more than a little sense of DÃ©jÃ  vu. It has the same cars, same tracks, same game engine and even the same physic glitches. It's pretty much FlatOut 2 with some new paint and chrome which is more than a little disappointing. Fans of the series would eventually get a FlatOut 3 from a different studio but the less said about that the better. 
285	0	a	Games For Windows Live is still active despite the service being no longer available. Although you can log in with an offline profile, you will be unable to save your progress. This renders the game effectively broken, unless you enjoy the thought of playing the same track over and over with the same three cars.  Until the game is patched and GFWL is removed I can not recommend this game.  Definately one to avoid.
286	0	a	you must have Microsofts stuff installed before it will even try to work
657	1	a	Pros :  - No DLC , everything is purchasable with in-game earned money   - Old but still decent  - Long , very long to complete  - Power Slam satisfaction  - More than just race mode   - Lots of positive stuffs etc..  Cons :   - No steam achievements ( only GFWL achievement )  - Online is dead  - Car sounds ... better play with muted
659	1	a	Best arcade racer I've ever played. It's almost the same as Flatout 2, only this game is better looking, has more opponents and I believe more maps and stunts. Only complaint I would have is that the soundtrack isn't as great as Flatout 2's soundtrack.
661	1	a	FlatOut: UC is a really fun arcade racing game that brings out more shiâ€Št-talking from you than Mario Party does. Buy it when it's on sale though, because I know $20 is a bit much for you cheap aâ€Šsses. Don't even whine about Games for Windows Live.
663	1	a	The second best Flatout game after Flatout 2.This Flatout has improvements from Flatout 2 like Deathmatch Derbies with power-ups,4 new drivers,new cars for Derby class.New modes.Some drivers from Flatout 2 has improve their skills like Frank Malcov.He still is the worst driver but he is trying hard to get the podium but sadly for him he get wrecked because of his bad skills and the other drivers (inlcuding me).Also i found stunts to be more harder in UC than in 2.Also CArnage you will get fun and nightmare with this mode for GOLD hunters like me.Only the con i can give is you need Windows Live to save your progress or at least an offline account.The price 19$ is too high for an old game,i got it in summer sale with 2,84$ and i was very happy to see it in sale.Also in game is achievements but it will only unlock if you have an ONLINE Windows Live account.In the rest the game is ok.Also the soundtrack is nice not like Flatout 2 ones but still a nice one. Final note:8.5/10
665	1	a	 FlatOut 2 patch?
667	1	a	Itâ€™s the spiritual successor of Rush. Itâ€™s Mario Kart for almost grown up adults. Itâ€™s the racing game for people who find continually trying to drive the perfect lap in Forza or GT tedious yet kind of sort of actually secretly like it. I am a Forza/GT fan who typically despises games like Need for Speed, but I loved this. There are some annoying things like Microsoft basically holding you hostage nearly forcing you to make an account in order to play the damn game. Or the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ port aspect â€“ all menus have prompts like press â—‹A and the mouse curser isnâ€™t even supported even when friggen annoying Microsoft menus pop up in which you really need a damn mouse. On the plus side it supports non-Xbox controllers. That being said, itâ€™s really a decent game. The racing aspect is super fun and it controls well although thereâ€™s obviously a bit of plasticity as itâ€™s a smash up racing game. Youâ€™re encouraged to run into other players and take high risks in order to get more boost as opposed to just straight racing, so go ahead, have another one and drive sloppy. Thereâ€™re plenty of upgrades for cars albeit not as in depth or complex as Forza or GT. Thereâ€™s a good amount of cars as well so you wonâ€™t get bored; thereâ€™s always something to look forward to. And to top it all off thereâ€™s a ridiculous arcade and mini-game section where youâ€™ve got to do silly things like make the biggest crash and fling your driver as far and high as possible. This section is particularly fun when you are too high/drunk to actually race. In summary, despite it being poorly ported and having Microsoftâ€™s greasy finger prints all over it, I strongly recommend this game to anyone who wants a fun and ridiculous racer. Having not played any of the other ones in the series, it seems like Carnage is all you need. Apparently it has virtually all the features of 1 &amp; 2 and more and it doesnâ€™t blow barnyard animals like 3. Cheers. 
669	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ wreckfest  i can play this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ forever    O L D T I M E S :')
671	1	a	Amazing game, amazing developers, amazing engine, everything about this game is amazing. It's basically an arcade game on steroids. Fast-paced, adrenaline-inducing racing, and the music selection just adds to it. Even though it was made in 2008, it's still one of my most favorite games of all time. After all of the fun I've had so far, I still have yet to play multiplayer! 15/10
673	1	a	I bought this game in 2009 (cd version), and it was a blast, i always liked Flatout, especially FO2, this game brought a new life to FO2, making the best destruction racing game ever made even better, its perfection at its finest, the graphics were the best, and the addition of the carnage mode made existing modes more fun... the only thing that i missed was the LAN mode for multiplayer but online was good. After 7 years the game held up kinda well, the graphics continue to look good (needs a bump in refletions and some textures), but what made the game lose some of its goodness was Games For Windows Live, i can't log in with my old account where i had all my progress because many changes were made in microsofts accounts and GFWL is abandoned and never got updated to accept those changes, so i was forced to make a new account to be able to play online, not a big problem for me, but Games For Windows Live DRM will eventually disappear (in my belief very soon) leaving the game dead, one solution would be integrating it with steamworks but  Strategy First  doesn't do anything (tipical from this publisher), and the developer says they can't do anything because they don't own the rights to do such thing (similar story happened to FO2 when Gamespy closed and left the online multiplayer dead to this day)... but if you are not concerned about the future of the game and your pc supports GFWL (some w10 users report not being able to use it) i recommend getting it, as it is a great game and in my opinion a must-play game.
675	1	a	Very fun and forgiving racer for people who aren't great at racing games. Lots of extras and other events than just racing. Uses a control pad not a wheel.
677	1	a	Not too many racing games grab my attention, this one is an exception. Leans heavily into the arcade side of racing games, it has gobs of debris and destruction everywhere as you drive (kinda like how they would lay out food in front of Jerry Springer guests for them to throw at each other). This game really succeeds at keeping you on the edge of completely wiping out at all times (challenging) yet not becoming frustrating. The races really can get your heart pumping esp the ones in the 'race class' cups.
679	1	a	This is hilariously fun.  I love the racing mechanics and the destruction derby-style jockeying. The music is great for the most part. The engines sound amazing. You can customize your car. There are multiplayer servers.  Only one downside.  Games for Windows Live.  It's not really that bad, considering the fix is easy. The copy that comes with the game is broken, uninstall it and grab the one from Microsoft's website. That one works and well.  10/10 would fly car into billboard again
681	1	a	Just crazy, stupid fun. Cars exploding, enviornments collpasing around you.  However, there are minimal graphics and sound options, and I would heavily recommend a controller.
683	1	a	I heard everyone talking about Flatout on the Next Car Game forums and I enjoyed NCG so much I saw a Flatout bundle for 8 bucks and wanted to try it. I was not disapointed. The racing is fun and competitive, Carnage races are even better. There are Demolition Derby's although not as fun as NCGs in my opinion. Also the stunt games are great. If you like nitro induced racing this is a good game. If you want realistic demolition derbys I recommend getting Next Car Game by Bugbear Games.
288	0	a	It's a great game but I can't recommend it because it doesn't run out of the box, and doesn't tell the user what's wrong.   To get the game to work on Windows 8.1 and 10 you need to manually download and install 'Games for Windows' from the official xbox or microsoft site. If you don't, the game will not start and not even pop an error message. If you installed 'Games for Windows' before, or if it was installed by a different game already, you won't have this issue.  Windows 8.1 has been out for well over a year. I cannot recommend a game where the necessary 5 minute fix to the installer has not yet been done.
289	0	a	DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! It uses Games for windows live, meaning there is no online play unless you have xbox live gold.   EDIT: GFWL is still up and running, but you do still need xbox live to play online.
290	0	a	GFWL, uh wow. I wish I knew of this steaming pile of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t software being in this game. I would have never bought this game. Bugbear, you disappoint me with that decision. First two's local save set up worked fantastic why the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥? I wish I never wasted my 5 bucks on this broken piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
685	1	a	Cool. Much better then prequel.
687	1	a	You crash into things whilst trying to become 1st.
689	1	a	A great arcade racing game, definitely one of the best racers on PC. Even after 7 years since its release.  Lots of game modes, good physics, (almost) bug free, small learning curve, AI is challenging, brilliant graphics (for the time) are the fortes of this game.  Also, you still can play this ONLINE, the servers are still alive, I've just done it a moment ago.  The only (actual) cons are no LAN mode, and GFWL, but you could just simply went through it easily (only took me 10 mins to configure my account). I also wish it has Steam achievements, Live achievements is a nice thing to have but i can hardly show it to anyone..  Overall this deserves a: 9.5/10
691	1	a	*I don't have much time but I had this game on XBOX*  Overall it is a great game and I think it is the best game in the series. Graphics where good at the time and still look alright today. One think about this game is setting it up for the first time. You have to make a Games For Windows Account which is pretty difficult considering it isen't really supported anymore. Just to launch the game you have to have it installed but you can still get the installer from the Microsoft website. Once you get into the game you HAVE TO connect to Games For Windows to save your progress. Which isen't hard but it has to happen lol. As far as gameplay goes it is like any other racing game but I think it is better in a way. There a minigames and stuff like that and has come to be my favorite racing game ever. Yea sorry for this rant.
693	1	a	Great fun, great physics.
695	1	a	i crashed into â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ 10/10 would crash again
697	1	a	Won't Launch---&gt; donwload windows live -----&gt; game launchs but won't save and the mouse doesnt work in full screen mode.  Very fun game, i playied when i was younger and downloaded now again, but whithout the option of saving it loses alot of points.
292	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing garbage. controls are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, gameplay is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, game cheats 
699	1	a	carnage... that is all
701	1	a	You race cars but really they just pay you to break stuff, especially if you happen to be going fast at the same time
703	1	a	If you loved FlatOut 2, but you think the graphics are dated, this is the game for you.  Game for Windows Live is cancer, but it didn't interfere with the game. Just be prepared for the game uploading every race you complete to the leaderboards.  
705	1	a	It's just a better looking Flatout 2
707	1	a	A really solid arcade style racer. Good fun throughout as you blast opponents while trying to stay on the best race lines. This game doesn't take itself too seriously but it nails the gameplay and execution of everything. It stinks to see some of the leaderboards ruined by cheating but it is what it is.  On a side note, for some reason, I keep getting my save file deleted. I have no idea how and perhaps I'm accidentally doing it myself but it sucks :(
709	1	a	They took a game that was already pretty great and added to it making it excellent!
711	1	a	  I wish the online worked and that the game was a little bit more stable. Great way to recapture my childhood.
713	1	a	Not a bad game. Also, 'Games for Windows LIVE' wasn't closed on 1 July 2014 as Microsoft claimed, so you can still play the game and multiplayer, if that detered you from buying it initially.
715	1	a	this game is basically a upgraded better looking version of flatout 2 whith some perks added more racers , online mode is better, and alot of new challenges to beat AWSOME!
717	1	a	As a remaster of FlatOut 2, and being a FlatOut player for over 10 years, this game feels refreshing arcadey and VERY nostalgic.
719	1	a	Awesome game, awesome tracks... awesome wrecking :D
721	1	a	As a remaster of FlatOut 2, and being a FlatOut player for over 10 years, this game feels refreshing arcadey and VERY nostalgic.
723	1	a	The game where an umbrella can take you out of the road!!! A BIG Yes for this one!!!
725	1	a	I'm playing this instead of DS3 and The Witcher 3. That has to say something. I love this game, despite it taking over most of my free time.
727	1	a	Cars.
729	1	a	this game is good BUT  you need games for windows live  rating 8/10
731	1	a	Very good arcade racer, with beautiful cars that sound loud and crisp, handling feels more sophisticated than flatout 2, nice physics...and the graphics are very good, nice shaders and finally the lighting isn't static and overall looks good today still..the only thing i don't like of this game is gfwl, it SUCKS. Otherwise, fantastic racing game, BUY DIS
733	1	a	If you have people to play, it is totally worth it! A lot of fun with friends playing online destruction derby :D
735	1	a	Best sountrack ever introduced in a video game!
737	1	a	Really fun. Didn't have much time to spend on the game yet, but the graphics are amazing, the cars look cool and the driving feels amazing. Stop reading, buy it now!
739	1	a	Instant Classic! fun game. look up graphics upgrades. ;^)
298	0	a	The forced link to Windows Live shoots this one down. And its not different enough from Flatout 3 to be worth the buy. Just glad I got the Flatout bundle on sale. Had I payed for price for each, I'd have been alot more upset. Just can't suggest buying this one. Updated graphics with no real content change.
741	1	a	The best racing game! Everyone should own this game.
743	1	a	9/10
307	0	a	If this copy of flatout 2 with multiplayer by windows live - its the bad multiplayer. Cause its slowest multiplayer what i see.
745	1	a	I FlatOut love this game.
747	1	a	Cars that go VROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOF
308	0	a	This game crashes after startup. When I load it, the configuration menu appears, I click OK after verifying the video settings, and then there is nothing but a black screen and I'm forced to reboot my computer. What a waste of money.
309	0	a	...
749	1	a	it's good game
751	1	a	GET THIS GAME. THE GAMEPLAY IS PERFECTLY OPTIMIZED AND COMPARABLE TO BURNOUT PARADISE. IM AMAZED.
753	1	a	Demolition Derby meets Crazy Taxi meets Dirt, they have a three-way and this is the glorious result. Hours of gameplay brilliantly done.
755	1	a	This game is just a re-make of FO2. It has way better graphics and 12 player races instead of 8. Other than that, it's the same. Still worth playing, knowing how great the second Flatout was, but I kinda expected more. Knowing that, this game was still a lot of fun. Multiplayer servers are up, so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing around with friends is possible :D
757	1	a	Awesome game for race lovers
312	0	a	6/10... At Â£4 I think Iâ€™ve been screwed a bit ïŒ  ITâ€™S A â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING COPY!  Take Flatout 2: Copy and Paste! Thinking about selling a DLC... think better of it, Welcome to Flatout 2.2 ok maybe 2.3 since there are a few more cars, tracks and bots...  But SERIOUSLY.... WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT. â€“ZERO originality! A masterpiece of copy-craft.... Goodness me HOW did they pull this off? Honestly I think somehow they tracked down EACH and EVERY SINGLE team member to ensure the game was AN EXACT COPY... And SOMEONE FINANCED IT! â€œAs you were; tinker with a bit more... Add a little more content then give it a little polish.â€   Personally more venom can be directed at:  'Balance' (too many bots now!!!)   A shocking choice in music I've turned it off.... I thought it was THAT BAD.   Needing to install games for windows live (in 'support' directory)  Very easy to get caught on scenery  The positive changes, some of the rear wheel drive cars ARE driveable now.... This might triple the number of driveable cars?   The game is something of a giggle... but I fear the same shortcomings will doom the game. Letâ€™s wait and see? Be warned however.
759	1	a	Pretty fun game but 10 points off for the soundtrack, the music is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing awful.  0/10
761	1	a	Just FlatOut 2 with some new environments, new cars and slightly better graphics. Buy if it's extremely cheap or you didn't play FlatOut 2.
763	1	a	This is one of the best racing games ever made.
313	0	a	Would be still ok if the game would start. But no. Game for Windows Live is breaks the game and I can't even seem to start it.
314	0	a	i wouldnt recommend this to anyone you need to be on GFWL for it to save your single player progress i had derby beaten the night before i leave come back few mins ago before writing this all my progress is gone total â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t why the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ would they set it up like that what â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing idiots made it like this!
765	1	a	.
767	1	a	flat out 2 with upgrade to graphics, whats not to love
315	0	a	Great!!  ...on an Xbox.  It's very badly ported to the pc.  Though you can customize the controls - like other bad ports there are some binds you simply can't change. Also buyer beware - you must have an Xbox Live account to play the game at all or it simply won't launch.  Yet another game that requires you to have an alternate online account on some external website or program... I'm beyond sick of that.  The game itself would be fun but I'd recommend just getting it for xbox and not to bother with the pc port. People who say skyrim is a bad port should try this, this is just flat out terrible (yeah, bad pun)
316	0	a	Force to use Game for windows.
769	1	a	Is gud buy dis nut da turd juan the turd one is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
319	0	a	Never don't buy this GFWL sucks!!!
320	0	a	See all that crazy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in the previews? Yeah, prepare to spend hours driving some dad's wrecked up muscle car through boring back woods to get there. Very slowly.
321	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING PEICE OF â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ GAME WONT WORK ANYMORE ....WINDOWS 10 INSTALL ...
771	1	a	I played this loads when I had my laptop. As soon as I got my PC it didn't work because of windows 7 :*(. I cri evry tim.  But on a positive note this is an amazing game and better than all the other FlatOuts. Would defanitly recommend it.
322	0	a	CANT SET NATIVE RESOLUTION. Game won't start! Are there any solutions to this?
323	0	a	This would be an alright update if it had more than a graphics upgrade. Maybe like more cars? More tracks? If you don't have Flatout 2, then by all means, get this. Otherwise, don't bother
773	1	a	Great :tradingcard:
775	1	a	Good racing game
777	1	a	Have a FFB wheel? Remeber how good it was for FO2, if yes do not buy this.. This really really sucks.. I mean come on, WTH? FlatOut 2 works great with my g27, with this all get get is horrible vibration : (  It is an updated version of FO2 and I expected at least that part of it would work the same...   ok I edit this review. game is good.. well its ok.. when using controller it isnt too bad.  Fun but apart from graphics Flatout 2 is much better.
333	0	a	Games for Window Life, Ubisoft Game Launcher, Origin, Ñ‡Ñ‚Ð¾-Ð¶Ðµ Ð¶Ð´Ñ‘Ñ‚ Ð½Ð°Ñ Ð² Ð¿ÐµÑ€ÐµÐ´Ð¸..
334	0	a	Simply not FlatOut.
335	0	a	You have to create microsoft profile to save in this game
336	0	a	its great when it works. but using games for windows live as a save? â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Does it work on windows 10? no, do you have to play musical games for windows live installs to try to get one working? Yes! Will it be worth your time trying to reverse engineering the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ programming to get it to work? No! Is it as fun as using a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up and gutted origin based command and conquer series? Yes, which is to say it makes you want to drive your boot across the faces of who programmed this and their bosses. This is a 5 out of 5 â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ yous
779	1	a	THIS IS THE GOOD GAME. DO NOT BUY FLATOUT 3 IT WILL MELT YOUR BRAIN.
355	0	a	im convinced anyone who plays and likes this turd kisses women but fake and bad of course.
356	0	a	Dont buy this stupid game instead go buy Dirt Showdown if you want to play these types of racing games!  Note: You dont have to take my words that serious 'but i have played almost evry game on earth so know what im talking about..
357	0	a	This game has invisible walls everywhere. Collision detection is something awful. Controls are a joke.
781	1	a	This is basically a recreation of FlatOut 2 with much better graphics and online play love it !
783	1	a	What this said....VVVV  http://youtu.be/kbwYIcfmhkc 
785	1	a	A classic! Running through the campaign every two years or so and it's always a refreshing feeling to play this game.
787	1	a	Ahh... FlatOut Ultimate Carnage oddly a game of my childhood, showed me by swearing like a drunk scot that just got kicked the manly area... You always played better.  But in true fact, I love this game no matter how old it is and to this day will be one of my all time favourite games.  I could moan and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t about the game more but meh I'll leave you to make up your mind on buying this game.*     *I'm too lazy and can't review for sheit is what I'm saying.
789	1	a	This game is ultimately fun! ;)
791	1	a	I bought this game shortly after its release in 2008. It is a masterpiece and made me absent of social life and human interaction for two and a half years. Unfortunately, the game isn't as populated as it used to be, and the small player count is based off people of the same nationality and have their own lobbies. They don't usually want other players (especially of different nationalities) and tend to kick you from their lobbies. Other than that the game is outstanding. 10/10
793	1	a	Nice and fun game. Probably the best wrecking racing game out there.
795	1	a	One of the best arcade racing games I have ever played. The cars look amazing ! I highly recomend it.  PS: the only drawback is this: 'Games for Windows â€“ LIVE requires you to have an account set up to play online Multiplayer Games. '
797	1	a	Finaly a game true 2 the first Flatout. Its all about steering. Best way to get it to steer is get a fast as possible car en get a new set of tires as fast as you can. I love how easy I get an other try. Same menu layout but more options. I do hope 2 find some people that have the game 2 just 2 see if I can race against them and NOT die.  I was surprised I needed a Microsoft Life account though.  But Player3767340988 is an odd name, so I went and changed that 2. 
799	1	a	I strongly recommend all of you buy this game. FlatOut Ultimate Carnage is better in all ways, graphics improved (everything), better musics... i just say, flatout 2 is more for PS2 age, one year later, came the UC, made for PC, seriously, im not joking, you will feel a huge difference playing this game. WORTH BUYING MORE THAN ANY THING. 
801	1	a	Heaps of fun. Great carnage-filled racing and surprisingly good physics. 8.5/10
803	1	a	Best one of them all! You will have fun playing this game. Once you get good at it it's all cookies and cream. Good graphics and nice game play as well The A/I is not perfect but good. They did put thoughts into this game. don't buy flat out 3 it's horrible game not even worth for free. the good = once you start getting cars the bad = you have to log into windows most annoying thing ever!
805	1	a	This game is imho the best attempt to revive the Destruction Derby franchise in a decade. More games have attempted this succes formula, but more often than not the quality of these games is crap. Here it's fun to ram into vehicles and destroy the environment while the racers crash out of the cars. The racing mechanics are decent enough given the nature of the game. There's minigames too which are a fun change from the derbies. All in all a fun game that shouldn't disappoint.  Warning: you need to create a WindowsLive account in order to play, which is annoying but takes about 3 minutes.  PS: Don't think of getting FlatOut 3, which came out later. It's really bad.
807	1	a	I have nothing to say.... It's a great game!!!! - Just 2 thing i'm not liked: + â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing GFWL. REALLY!!!!!!!! + No Steam Cloud. It mean you'll lost your save game if you not back up that.
809	1	a	Find it CHEAP and the stunt mode can keep you entertained for hours.
811	1	a	This is a great PC game with full Xbox-Live / Windows-Live integration. Fun destructive racing with bonus points for damage and style. Very quality game, reminds me of BurnOut-Revenge from Xbox-360 with an outdoor country feel.
813	1	a	best game to play with friends
815	1	a	Still one of the best racer / crasher game for me, Brutal feeling, adrenaline bomb, and still really good graphics. the multiplayer STILL WORKING! I can play this game right now, with the GFWL account. Worth the price. Come on, join to the multiplayer, more players needed!
817	1	a	This crazy physics destruction derby arcade racing title provides more evidence that its developer, Bugbear, might hate cars almost as much as it loves making games about cars. The numerous ways the vehicles in this game can be dented, smashed, crashed, crumpled, and shredded may well make petrolheads weep tears of dismayed sadness, but then, that's the fun of it. The entertainingly visceral physics engine, that sees cars and environments alike torn apart violently at the slightest touch, provides a fascinating look into what the Burnout games might be like if cars were continued to allowed racing after the otherwise fatal takedowns.  It refines and expands on Bugbear's previous FlatOut game exponentially, which makes it slightly infuriating that there are unforgiveable surface blemishes on an otherwise impeccable arcade derby racer. The inclusion of Games for Windows Live has basically all but guaranteed that the online community for this game is dead as a doornail, but perhaps worse, in my opinion - and certainly more invasive - is an absolutely wretched soundtrack. Seriously, I don't think I've come across a worse use of licensed music in a videogame. The cheap, faux-metal pop-rock that found its way into this game's soundscape is utterly painful, and I had it switched off almost immediately. I don't quite understand how these music choices were made, save that they were the only they could properly afford. At any rate, the music is abominable, and while I must stress that, that is my opinion, I will also stress that my opinion is, in the case, unquestionably correct.
819	1	a	Great fun game, the Flatout series are peerless when it comes to physics based racing carnage.
821	1	a	This is a lovely game with gorgeous graphics....very fast indeed, great with xbox gamepad.. be mad , be very madddd  One of the few games you'll never get tired of !  According to some people flatout failed to start up, So you need to install DIRECT X SDK (winsdk_web.exe) first then re-install DirectX from ulitmate carnage's folder..  you may need to delete the DXError.log file in the windows folder.. C:drive&gt;Windows&gt; (scroll down the page and see both) DXError.log file.  If this dosen't works(above) then try download GFWL client  http://support.microsoft.com/kb/977844   If you can't log in WLive 'cos you need to have the same password from your microsoft hotmail
823	1	a	Best from the FO series.
825	1	a	so cool play this game u guys should get the game its fun and funny 
360	0	a	It was fun buti just could not still get the fun out of it for too long but deffinatley reccomend it to people who love extremely arcadey racing games.
827	1	a	The most funny arcade racing game ever! I love the excellent physics and damage model of cars. :D
829	1	a	The exact kind of arcade racer that Steam needs more of. A couple of things are dodgy here and there (hitboxes for some parts of some tracks are dodgy, objects and other cars tend to stay on your car for too long, either slowing you down if it's a car or obstructing your view of the track if it's an object), but aside from those few criticisms, it's great fun.
831	1	a	Holy crap what can I say about this game? Uhhh...uhmmm...ehhh.... Oh I know!   GREATEST RACING SERIES EVER?    That's kind of all I need to say  
833	1	a	Man I love this game . Just can't get enough. Ya I see where bug bear tried to duplicate it uh huh more like took the scrap code and sold it to make a few bucks . Next Car game my eye. JUNK but this game how ever is what it should have been like . Thanks Bug bear for the lousy rip off game The Next car game HA jokes on me
835	1	a	i like to play. but windows for live...
837	1	a	Burnout beu? Wil je meer demolition derby? Meer flatout racing? This is the one I recommend. :)
839	1	a	really fun, if you enjoyed flatout 2, you'll enjoy this too.  one thing though... windows live... not a pleasure, why do I need to log into 2 accounts to play a game I own? 
363	0	a	No instructions. WTF. Utter crap.
841	1	a	This game is great. If you love crashing into stuff, explosions, and rediculous minigames, I would definitely recommend it. Ultimate Carnage is a remastered version of the original FlatOut 2. If you played that game than you already know how great this is going to be.
843	1	a	10/10
365	0	a	Ultimate Carnage is probably what second game should've been from the beginning. Comparing to the FO2, they made graphics look really good. They fixed water, tuned picture saturation, removed bad post effects, added normal mapping, improved overall detailing of the original tracks... and it looks seriously good.  The bad thing is that the core gameplay and physics are taken directly from FO2, which is boring BurnOut wannabe (unlike the original game). It seems like they actually tuned handing a bit, so the car is an actual car now and not a paper box on a wheel, but I bet it will get worse as you progress.   Honestly, I didn't play much, just a few cups, but it's just enough to say that the game is better than FO2, but still not good enough to get positive. It's funny how this game has 83 versus 92 of FO2. I guess that is related to GFWL used in this game, but you can create local account and I don't really care about multiplayer. So after playing 2 classic FOs, I tell you go play the original one. That one kicks yass.
845	1	a	Everything Flatout 3 should have been, however...it feels like they kinda copy/pasted alot of stuff from 2 but hey, still fun as hell to see how far you can throw your dude in crash outs. 
847	1	a	awesome physics based throw yourself out of your seat kind of game.
849	1	a	i cant update LIVE it gets stuck when downloading..... please help :(  FIXED: I had to change my resulution and graphics settings
851	1	a	Sum it up with just one word? Okay. EXPLOSIONS!!!!!!!!!!!!  9.4/10
853	1	a	Playing this game since 2006 for its great realistic driving feel &amp; crash's. Play on a cockpit view all the time just to feel the adrenaline rush of the game and really challenges you when it comes to driving, Great dynamics, Great breakable sorroundings &amp; beautiful environments, Great graphics &amp; Soundtracks. It just never gets old rather gold.  Driving a muscle car going through high speeds on dirt &amp; tarmac like a rally race on a deathwish 10/10 would drive into a billboard sign again
855	1	a	If it doesn't run try this:  1.If another game is downloading, then it's a steam setting that doesn't allow a game to be run. (in Download settings) 2.Install manually from the game folder (C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\FlatOut Ultimate Carnage) the GamesForWindowsLive application (XLiveRedist01.02.0241.00) and it will run 3.If that doesn't work either , then install manually everything from the Support folder from the before mentioned path. It works after any or all these steps!
857	1	a	This has the best mini games in a racing game I've played, shoot myself through the windshield and skip across the water like a stone? Worth it. I don't think I have even touched a race yet..
859	1	a	  A verry excellent racingf game ,can easily compete with the newest NFS games.
861	1	a	Requires GFWL to save progress --&gt; Logging in to GFWL is not possible --&gt; can't get progress  EDIT:  You can create a local profile, now you can save and that is awesome.
863	1	a	Windows Live sucks bad at the start, and there are not that many players online. But if u get past the Windows Life sign up â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and have some friends u can play it with, its tons of fun! And the Singleplayer is also very good. So recommended for all guys who want to smash their freinds around!!
865	1	a	an amazing remake of Flatout 2. instead of 7 opponents in the events for Flatout 2, you get 11 opponents in the events for Flatout: Ultimate Carnage for more DESTRUCTION!
867	1	a	This is a racing game. With a lot garbage in the air and road. A like racing with a lot of garbage in the air and road. BetterthenDemolitionRacer/10.
869	1	a	This game is awesome i have it for xbox.
871	1	a	This game is awesome. It has alot of cars, beautiful destruction, derby, speed,and pure crazyness. I love it.
873	1	a	This is actually pretty fun and the physics are decent.
875	1	a	Improvements compared to Flatout2: Prettier and slightly easier tracks with daytime/nightime, heavier cars for better control, more analog controller settings (controlled opposite lock  drift with Speedevil :-), private slots for stable friends-only multiplayer over internet. (no more Hamachi).  Multiplayer Gametype Updates:  derby: Respawn! And powerups! race: head-on type where you have to turnaround at the finish line and drive back head-on, Lolz!  Major Improvement over Flatout2, expensive at EUR20, a steal at EUR1.90.
877	1	a	This it the best flatout game untill bugbear finish the next car game. Great graphics, Nice phyisics, fun to play with friends, and really funny in that garry's mod way of being so dumb you just have to laugh. also you can lanch yourself at a giant baseball bat. wheres my flighy ragdoll in The NCG, bugbear?
879	1	a	Bugbear did a great job (as alwalys) FLATOUT is besides Flatout3 one of the best racing games in history !! Trust Me !!!!
881	1	a	Awesome for LAN-play
883	1	a	Love this game This game takes me back to when I had FlatOut 2 for my PS2 back in the day. It looks better feels better drives better it is just great and is a must for people that love to see their car get crunched when smashed into a wall
885	1	a	This is the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥iest game i have ever played in my life.
887	1	a	Fantastic Game. I am so glad I got it for $4.99 when I got the chance. It is incredibly well made and the game is still fun even when it gets frustrating. My only problem with it is that it can be inconsistent at times. I've hit a parked car on the side before and it threw my character out of my vehicle, but another time I hit an AI vehicle in the same place after it spun out and I hardly got dinged. I even got an achivement after that. That can be frustrating sometimes but it is not something that should keep you away from getting this game. One of the best racing games out there which I feel is underrated in my opinion.
889	1	a	HD remake of FlatOut 2. Pretty fun. Don't know if it's worth the normal price of $20 but it's certainly worth the $5 sale price.
891	1	a	It's a rehash of Flatout 2 with worse physics. Good job Bugbear. Also, it does not launch on my computer because for whatever reason, steam decided I purchased the CANADIAN version of the game so I can't play my legally purchased the rights to play version from steam and instead had to pirate it anyways. THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST.
893	1	a	What a Game... I love racing games, but this one takes the cake. Destruction like you have never seen before. Better than BLUR, awesome game modes, and totally worth the price, even after all these years of Release  Do note, Flatout 3 is Totally CRAP and this game is flatout 2 plus more, so dont buy flatout 2 either.
895	1	a	A wildly unrealistic racer that rewards breaking things and smashing into other people. Great fun. Just make sure to mute the soundtrack because good god is it horrible.
897	1	a	Cannot recommend this game enough. It is simply the best most enjoyable arcade racing game I have EVER played! Packed full of loads of content, loads of wanton destruction and the perfect middle ground between challenging and fun. Seriously buy this game!
899	1	a	if u like arcade raceing at it best then play this game it real cool
901	1	a	The best and most fun 'trash rally' game there still is.
903	1	a	great and fun racing game and if you have xbox live can sign in and get XBL achievements to up your gamerscore
905	1	a	The BEST car racing game in ... well EVER!!!
907	1	a	Best demolition arcade racer series, best game out of the BugBear FlatOuts.
909	1	a	If you can't choose which FlatOut you need, get this one!  It's got great multiplayer support, and it doesn't suck like the latest one.
911	1	a	First things first, this is really Flatout 2.5, it's the content from Flatout 2 with a facelift for porting to consoles. Better graphics tech than flatout 2, but I actually prefer the graphics from 2, That being said there's some interesting challenge modes added. If you don't have flatout or flatout 2 already, then this is the one to get. Very fun demolition racer game.
913	1	a	The best Flatout and the only Flatout you need
915	1	a	This game is not as bad as you thought it would be. This is the ultimate derby crash'em up car racing game that have a level of soft body car desgins that every racing game can't achieve.
917	1	a	God this game is entertaining. You drive at an insane speed. Nope, it's not realistic but it's not the intention here.
919	1	a	One of the best and funniest driving games ever!
921	1	a	If you like wrecked cars and upgrading your rides you'll gona love this. And when you get tired of racing there are still a lot of goofy games like bowling and high jump.
923	1	a	Smashing a sports car with a fire truck brings a tear to my eye :') So much fun if you can pick this game up for cheap like I did.
925	1	a	Solid carnage! 9/10
927	1	a	Very good racing game. If you previously owned FlatOut 2 and enjoyed yourself, this is a nice little refresh which adds a few tracks and restructures the campaign mode. You get the same fun physics and chaotic racing as you did in the original, and despite being more than five years old, it holds up reasonably well graphically.  It can be a tad frustrating at times, with causing huge crashes and winning the race becoming mutually exclusive, but overall it's a barrel of laughs.  The soundtrack leaves quite a lot to be desired, however. You'll have heard most of the songs in the game within an hour of playing, most of which aren't particularly great, say for a few exceptions.
929	1	a	not a big fan of racing games but put funny deaths and destruction into the mix then its ace
931	1	a	I know this game from many years and i like it
933	1	a	From what I know, BEST derby stuff you'll find for online play... It's a remake of the second release, though.. Straight soundtrack and hours of lol'ing! Why da HELL they sell these for 2$! Â¬ People underrate it...
935	1	a	I have had this game a while now since I bought the flatout special complete pack at christmas for Â£5, I decided to play it yesterday and it was not the game I expected at all! I bought the pack because I knew flatout from my childhood playing it on the origional xbox and I loved it.  I played this and it's a pretty good racing game, great damage physics and such as all flatout games have, ability to upgrade your vehicles with credits earned in games and special events.  It's a shame it uses Games for Windows Live which I hate so much :l Oh also the game seems to not support using the mouse at all.  8/10 If you like racing games, maybe get it if the price drops from Â£16.99
937	1	a	its flatout 2 but with better graphics and gfwl stuff
939	1	a	fun game but nothing new and similar to Flatout 2 in all manners, so stick to FlatOut instead
941	1	a	I got this game as a gift way back when it was first released. It was the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. I lost my Disc, and then the Files. I just bought it again, and it still is the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
943	1	a	How to winzip a car lvl 1000 :D
945	1	a	Car go all zoom and fast n â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ I recomend you pop some pills and drink some cleaning products from under the sink before you play it.
947	1	a	One of the best circuit driving games I've played. Excellent physics that don't detract from the racing. Wide variety of game modes. Only problem is it still prompts you to push the Xbox 360 buttons. But I can easily look past this as the game is fantastic.
949	1	a	Has one of the best physics for its time. If you have played Flatout 2, I don't recommend getting this game (same game but just more drivers). But if you've never played the series, this is the right game for you.
951	1	a	Take my word for it, not a dull moment in this game, just good old fashion fun. When you're not crashing into stuff or other stuff you're tryin' to keep it under control.
953	1	a	Best. Racing. Game. Ever. Well, since Need For Speed: Porsche Unleashed anyway. The physics are incredible, from the weight and handling of the cars in general, to the way they drive on various terrain types. The audio is amazing, changing the sound from hard revving engine and squealing tires on asphalt to dirt and gravel hitting the undercarriage when off-road. The AI drivers are a nice mixture of fairly easy in the beginning to downright dirty â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s at the end. The 122 hours I have on record at the writing of this review are all actual play hours (vs. the game just sitting, open and ticking). If you like racing games at all, this game should not be missed. Make sure you have a game pad or wheel. Keyboard can be done with reasonable success at first, but unless you have a gaming keyboard that allows more than the average simultanious key presses, you're going to hit a wall (pun intended) about a third of the way into the game.
955	1	a	Great Burnout-esque, but does strange things to graphics drivers on big crashes. Right now it's restarted my PC twice and then filled it with static like I was racing slenderman.
957	1	a	A great game if you love crashing/wrecking cars, insane speeds, and awesome flipping. (For the last one, you'll have to find out how yourself. ^^ )
959	1	a	Heyyo, this game was the last good entry in the FlatOut series. The graphics, the music, the silly games and the destruction derby were loads of fun and multiplayer with friends was always a blast.
961	1	a	After you get past the windows live thing its a brilliant game , multiplayer would be amazing if more come online .. worth the hassle of sorting the windows live xbox thing   heres a link that gets the game to load or you will need to get the game past the non loading problem   http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5549 
368	0	a	FlatOut 2 carbon copy - just slightly extended and better looking, with annoying Microsoft LIVE feature on top.
963	1	a	The game is good.  You should play the game.  It's hella fun.  Does not require wheel / controller to play, controls are very forgiving.  The game is good.  Soundtrack is A+ ( but fairly dated at this point )  The game is good.
965	1	a	I've played 100s of racing games, but none keep me coming back to it like this one, my steam time does not justify the real game time i have on this game, I've spent 100s of hours on the 360.  If you want a fun racing game, with damage, this one is for you, i find simulation racing games very boring. I can play flatout for hours on end and not realise time has passed.  Probably the best destruction derby type of game on the PC.  Note: for people moaning about Games For Windows, you install it from googling 'Games for windows' takes you to an xbox site. You don't need to sign it, just needs to be installed then once you are in the game, you click okay once. No big deal.
967	1	a	The Windows Live thing is nothing to concern yourself with. When the game starts, it logs into Windows and then the main menu appears without a hiccup. The achievements you receive are actually recorded through Windows Live. So again, there's no problem here, you can play with or without it.  The graphics are NICE, man!  MUCH better, shinier and sharper than I would've imagined.  I have it turned all the way up on every setting. It looks gorgeous; much like the hi-res screenshots you see up top (not that video or any YouTube video you come across). It'll leave tire marks on the road when you turn sharply or burn rubber. When the gas station gets ran over, the fireball blast is really sweet. The car models were done with care. I love the junkyard body and paint jobs. Excellent lighting and visuals that can compete with any ENB+SweetFX modded Grid game. The collision damage is NOT on par with Grid, let's make that perfectly clear; but it does get the job done.  The framerate is spectacular.  There are no FPS drops and the game runs smooth as butter. Even Grid has a problem with this from time to time on the best systems (google it). Not this Flatout version, though. Every race has been nothing short of fulfilling track drama at the highest of speeds. Only Gas Guzzlers races are faster...and more...insane!  Customizing your ride is awesome. Every upgrade has its positives and negatives; but I didn't realize that at first. I tricked my first ride out with all the upgrades, thinking it would be able to just drift to victory with ease. Nope! It was too heavy and beefy to carry all the speed upgrades. So it turned out to be a general ride instead of the General Lee. It gets me 4th place with consistancy. Thank of it as an M1 Abrams in a muscle car frame...with speed enhancements.  The Tracks!  Here is where the game comes alive. The tracks run more like Gas Guzzlers Extreme; so you have variances throughout the race. I don't think I've ever made the same lap twice in a single race yet. Almost everything is destructible like in GGE but even more so in this game. I also like the fact that they incorporated ramps to lauch off of. There are times when I really do feel like Beau &amp; Luke Duke in the General Lee. My ride is flying 50 feet off the ground with my confederate flag license plate hanging on by a screw and mud spewing from my undercarriage. We race (and crash) through dirt, asphalt, water...highways, lumber yards, farms, back roads, suburbs, cities...with a combination of each at times. It's awesome, man.  Flatout: UC is what racing should be. Just a few good ol' boys &amp; gals racing cars meant to be raced! I still find glee in telling my buddies how I hit a wall, flew out of my front windshield, ragdolled on the cement, and got ran over by my own car moments later.   I love this game. You will too.
969	1	a	The game is good it really is, cuz graphics are good, gameplay is a bit easier, and the soundtracks will make you feel like a badass behind the wheel.  But its bad that Games for Windows LIVE had to exist and almost bricked the game.  I wish this game had steamworks, to make online racing on this one possible.
971	1	a	Great by your self BUT fanstic with friends in school buses
372	0	a	Save your money and buy flatout 2.  This version seems more buggy, had games for windows DRM (xbox live), and features the exact same maps and stupider unrelated to racing activities.
973	1	a	Awsome game 10/10 other than FO3 FOUC IS AWSOME. Complete remake. 
975	1	a	Bought this on a whim as I already had the first 3 Flatouts, and was aware of the comments that it was basically a remake of Flatout 2. Ignore the reviews that say don't bother with this if you already have Flatout 2. It's got all of the high octane fun of Flatout 2 with none of the frustrating bits. The gameplay is so much smoother, the handling better, and the higher res graphics mean that you can better see what's coming up and act/avoid accordingly. And at the moment it's in a bundle with all of the other Flatouts, which if you own none of the other titles makes it a complete no brainer. Even if you do, buy it. I did and I'm loving it.
977	1	a	First off, amazing racing game. The graphics are very decent, fluid, and the game runs well overall. The tracks and extra events are great too. It requires GFWL to run, though, which sucks but isn't a deal breaker for me. Every race is a chaotic mess of debris and hazards and I absolutely love it.  That said, the one thing that has always bugged me about this game is its *awful* music. They really couldn't have picked a better lineup of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ bands. The worst offering is by Manafest, a song so horrible that I always have to devote some focus while going as fast as I can to changing the song. Fred Durst would have been a tender mercy compared to the lead singer of Manafest, who has a voice that I will sum up thusly: nails on chalkboard.  And I find myself spamming the change song button pretty much constantly, because too stubborn to bother with MP3s. However, you can turn the music volume down to zero, keeping all other game sound effects intact and allowing one to use the steam music player, which eliminates all bad in this game in one stroke.  Easily one of the best racing games on offer from Steam.
979	1	a	Incredible amounts of fun! Great damage, good range of vehicles and easy to drive with both keyboard and controller. (However, does use windows live rendering online useless (look it up)). Well worth the purchase, especially when on sale.
981	1	a	I've only played 2 and a half hours of this game, But i am making this post to help anyone having problems playing this game with a controller like i had. ( At the bottom of this past i will leave a review of the game. )  How to fix:  1. You will need a program called better DS3 if you are using a ps3 controller. ( Not sure if the program will work with PC controllers. )  2. You go to the opions and find controller configeration, Click that menu and once you have done that, At the top you will see keybored, Go right and leave it set to Xbox 360 controller,   3. Enjoy the game  I really just gave up and thought that there was no controller support for this game. But after looking at what i wasn't doing rigt, I felt like a jackass. I hope this fixes any controller problems you are having.   Might as well review the game down here of course.   This game is easily a 9 out of 10 game. Being one of the last good flatout games, It really stands out on gameplay. It's a upgraded version of flatout 2. And it is worth the money. As long as you like slamming cars off the road and looking at damaged cars, This game is for you. The flatout complete pack is on sale right now. The only one out of the pack that sucks is of course, Flatout 3. But i think you already know that game was a failure from the start. But i haven't really got down to the pros and the cons of this game yet because of the fact that i only have 2 hours of gameplay from this game. So far it is a blast playing it.
983	1	a	This is a fun arcade style racing game with HUGE amounts of replay value, good laughs, and even some good times with friends beating and banging in races. 8 player multiplayer through Game for Windows Live and you are set. The singleplayer is ok, but this game is mostly for the derbys and the stunts. I know of quite a few that already have it, so you would not be alone in getting this game. Good time gaming that makes you feel great at the end and coming back for more. ^_^
985	1	a	Good racing game, focused on more destruction than racing lines, but still a really good racing game, multiplayer as well.
987	1	a	GFWL Code entry and steam doesn't allow you to copy paste so you have to manual enter or copy to notepad and copy paste from there. Controller support is full but takes intermediate level setup. Not as fun as the console versions. Leaderboards are maintained by GFWL. Probably not going to log a lot of time on these games. If you are a fan of the series this is the only version actually playable with a controller on PC. Good for nostalgia and an example of a game with full potential but no love for the end-user. It's like sitting in the seat of a concept car. Great idea but it never comes to fruition.
377	0	a	Too much like FlatOut2.  My thumbs down for an attempt to sell the same game twice.
989	1	a	one of the best game for a lan party, always fun to smash your freinds :)
991	1	a	Racing + Carnage = Happy Rincewind! =P  Its just so satisfying to rip into a fence, power poles, and your opponent's cars... And Flatout is a game that knows its more fun to hit things on purpose instead of by accident ;-)  I originally owned this game off Steam, hence the low number of hours played.
379	0	a	Awesome game, awesome series. This one is an upgraded version of FlatOut 2 with extra cars &amp; tracks. Unfortunately it's broken by having Games for Windows Live in it.  Get FlatOut 2 instead, available at  GOG.com 
993	1	a	Very fun game i suggest the minigame sports, and the physics are very swell i give it a good 9/10
995	1	a	Insanely fun racing game, definitely recommended for everyone who likes their arcade racers with some BOOM. On the other hand, it's just a slightly better version of FlatOut 2 which you can get at only half the price. So why buy this one? Well, for once it looks a lot better than FO2 and is completely compatible with gamepads. It also has a bit more content to offer and the number of AI cars in races has been increased from 7 to 11 which causes a lot more of that chaos we all like so much.  But beware: This game uses GFWL to save. This is also what most of the negative reviews are about but it can be fixed with a small patch. You can just google it or add and dm me and I will provide you with the download. Plus, if you live in Germany I can also give you the link for an uncut patch so you don't have to deal with those ugly crash dummies.  So go on, buy it for the 2,50 bucks it costs on sale, you can't do anything wrong.
997	1	a	This game is incredible, stunning visuals, fast paced fluid gameplay and a brutal competitive experience, definitely a remaster worth getting.
999	1	a	I love this game, it's one of my favorites. Average choose of cars, lots of destuction and flying drivers! All those things are making this game legendary)
1001	1	a	Great Game, just make sure you create a offline Games For Windows Live profile in order to save your progress.
1003	1	a	I'ts a great party game. I'ts a great single player game. Its great online. Graphics and driving mech are perfect. only downfall is GWL, but really guys, get over it. sign up and make an account and stop â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing. Then have fun. I would spend my last $5 on this game.
1005	1	a	This is really fun. Very fun when you have friends playing with you (so you can run in opponents &amp; make them ragequit (ahem ... (I'd never do that.))). Buy it, man! HF!
1007	1	a	that's one of games of my life!! Relaxing game!!! Best racing games!!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZocbjeQi9lM   Only thing I have is that I canno't chat ingame. when I press enter it opened sommthing and when i press A or B.
1009	1	a	Amazing cart racer/smash-up wacko physics car racing game, not beaten (much like Burnout Paradise) by any contemporary racer yet.
1011	1	a	Well... it has better graphics and physics than FlatOut 2 as well as really awesome carnage mode, yet the soundtrack is awful (still remembering the PERFECT playlist from FO2). Just turn off the music, compose own list and go for a rumble!
1013	1	a	I am not much into racing games, but once I saw Flatout in action I had to try it out. It is not simple racing game, but destruction race as well, you do not need to finish 1st, it is enough to crash and destroy all opponents - therefore you are only one in the race and you win automatically. All the tracks are full of destructible objects and they look different in the start and in the end, when all the rails, trash and destroyed cars of opponents cover the track. Plus the soundtrack â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing rocks.
1015	1	a	A very fun actionpacked arcade racing game Play it with a couple of friends and i will guarantee you will have loads of fun
1017	1	a	This will always be Bugbear's masterpiece, seeing as Wreckfest is stuck in early access limbo and nothing seems to be changing any time soon.
1019	1	a	Old but gold. Still one of my favourite racing games. I just love arcade racing with flying parts. :D
1021	1	a	Crazy, nutty racing fun. Seem to have lost carreer mode save information due to GFWL.
1023	1	a	For those not being able to play/save due to GFWL issues:  Just google for 'download gfwl'. The top Microsoft link should point you to the last and latest GFWL client. (Re)installing the latest GFWL client solved this issue for me many times on several OSes up to Win10.  Good luck and have fun!!!
1025	1	a	Install xlive from data files, works with x360 controller and it seems that it has two players
381	0	a	I wish there was like a 50/50 button for reviews. This game is just that.. 50/50. It can be fun but it can also be extremely boring and repetitive. The carnage mode is kinda fun but some of the goals are just nutty. If you are looking for a racer with a slight change of pace then give this a go otherise its probably worth a miss.
382	0	a	The game uses Games For Windows Live. GFWL has been shut down, permanently.  ONLY buy this game if you intend to play the singleplayer.   There is no LAN multiplayer, and since you can't log into GFWL with anything but an offline account, multiplayer effectively doesn't exist.  Thanks, Microsoft.
1027	1	a	I LOVED this game when it first came out. That said, I loved ALL of SCS's trucking games throughout the 18WoS series. The game has decent control, great economy and company management and brilliant truck ownership detail. Before I get ahead of myself, however, here's a real list of pros and cons to this game:  =PROS= - Decent graphics: This game may be old, and it does show it's age, but the graphics still look alright, if a little dull at times. - Good control: This game is no ETS2, but it definitely feels right. Its a bit slick at times, but you have to remember you are driving a heavy truck. - Company management: Manage everything from the trucks, to the drivers, right down to the contracts and companies. - Truck AND trailer management: ETS2 fans will like this... You can BUY TRAILERS. Just a little bit of extra management and a bit of extra content to buy.  =CONS= - AGE: This game shows it's age... alot. The sound is low quality, the graphics are dull as stated before... it's an old game. - Bugs: This game has its share of bugs and issues. I personally have problems with the fov not setting properly. I have to manually set it for it to look right. - Fatigue: The game's fatigue system is realistic to the game time, but the distances to game time are not realistic. I woke up at the edge of a city, and by the time I got to the other side, I had to sleep again. I suggest turning fatigue off in the config files. - Scenery: This game also shows it's age in scenery. It's a bit dull and repeatitive.  I enjoyed the game, and I still go back and play it occasionally. I would reccomend the game to anyone who likes other 18wos games, or trucking games in general.
1029	1	a	18 Wheels of Steel: American Long Haul is a Trucking Simulator. You start off with a truck, which you will use to pick up and drop off delivery jobs you choose to accept. From refueling your rig, to stopping at weigh stations and getting some sleep, 18 Wheels of Steel is a pretty decent sim. Even on Easy mode, you need to be careful of how you drive and make sure to obey traffic laws, such as turn signals and stop lights. I started playing it thinking I would put in the bare minimum just to get a taste for the game so I could write about it, but found it to be mildly addictive. I have yet to complete my first haul, but I am confident I will get there soon.   18 Wheels of Steel does not have a playable tutorial, so you will learn on the fly. From what I understand of the game, the rigs you drive are based on real life trucks, so there is an element of realism the makers have brought into the game to give you an immersive experience. There are dozens of cities across North America, each with their own unique layout, making some of the deliveries an interesting challenge. All in all I thought it was a pretty fun game. If you like Simulators, this isn't a bad one.
1031	1	a	The 18 Wheels of Steel series has come a long way since its humble beginnings back in 2002. Tagged as Hard Truck: 18 Wheels of Steel (which was a sequel to Hard Truck 2: King of the Road), it was the first that used the Wheels of Steel tag name as the game play differs completely from racing trucks delivering goods. Since then, there were another four instalments where, besides the graphical enhancements, many changes were made like Mexico being left out then arrived back, sleep timer comes and goes and so on. It seems that every game after the first, developers ValuSoft couldnâ€™t make up their minds what to leave out or to use. Well, the sixth game in the series, 18 Wheels of Steel: American Long Haul, it seems ValuSoft finally made up their minds and just chuck everything in from all the previous series thus making this game the â€˜final copyâ€™. And it certainly shows as this simulator will be the closest you ever get other than driving the real thing.  So my real purpose for playing this game is for the love of driving. America / Canada and bits of Mexico has a diverse range of landscapes to discover and thankfully, the gameâ€™s visual aspects is quite decent. Nothing ground breaking however still pleasant to look at. In addition to the pretty decent physics, you have a good feel driving around with a massive haul trailing behind. For instance, delivering glass was pretty easy going however when I delivered those oversize tubes through the Rocky Mountains (i.e. from Calgary to Vancouver), with snow smashing on my windscreen, it got my adrenaline running as I need to be very careful dodging traffic as well as ensuring my truck doesnâ€™t tip over. And because you can play your own music using the truckâ€™s radio player, itâ€™s a great experience to have (yet the music needs to be on .ogg format).  So whilst the gameâ€™s intent is to build an empire, I felt it failed in that respect as thereâ€™s no competition at all. You can sit back, relax and listen to your radio channel whilst having the cash rolling in. Granted, the beginning is quite rough as you need to do some real repetitive jobs (X â€“ Beyond the Frontier anyone?) however once you have the money to buy another truck, trailer and hire additional helpers, the gameâ€™s difficulty level gets a lot easier. However, if you, like me, like to drive the open world and seeing vast landscapes, you will enjoy this game as America is a pretty country to see. With its majestic mountain ranges, endless deserts, Great Plains and of course, bustling cities, developers Valusoft chose the correct country to display all of this. However, because it also plays on as a business simulation, it missed the mark.  Full review:  http://www.gamespot.com/18-wheels-of-steel-american-long-haul/user-reviews/2200-12653156/   8 / 10
1033	1	a	If, like me, you are too impatient to wait for American Truck Simulator to be finished then this game is the best when it comes to driving trucks across the United States from coast to coast.   It is by no means a perfect game but it is one of the best in the 18 Wheels of Steel series. The series includes seven games, but only three of them are on Steam. Most fans prefer the previous ' 18 Wheels of Steel: Haulin' ', but I think that's only because the modding community was more active for that one. Unless you absolutely need replicas of popular trucks then I think it's okay to do without them. Other than that, both games are nearly identical to each other. The only major difference is that American Long Haul has more cities to explore. Not only is the mainland United States traversible (not Hawaii and Alaska), but you can also visit parts of Canada and Mexico. I think that alone makes American Long Haul worth playing over any other trucking simulator.  Like I said, the map is huge; covers all of the country with most major cities being represented. The ony downside to this is that there is no route advisor. A world map and a mini-map on the screen are the only tools that can help you get get around. It's kind of annoying at first having to go back and forth to the map to familiarize yourself with the roads. But then I started liking the challenge because it reminds me of the old days before GPS was available and drivers actually had to use road maps.  One thing I really like about this game and which I think is sorely needed today is the CB radio feature. During your travels you can hear other drivers on the radio asking for weather and traffic reports and you can actually respond to them with a response menu by pressing the 'v' key. It doesn't appear to do anything at first except give you a warm feeling inside, but apparently it helps your reputation grow and opens up more drivers for hire later on.  There's no option for using internet radio like you can in other SCS games, but you can import your own music. In that case you must convert your MP3s to the OGG format and there are websites you can use for doing that without downloading anything. I imported a few radio stations from GTA and they sound very nice and natural in this game.  My biggest gripe would have to be the steering. There is a mod somewhere that lets you steer with a mouse, but I prefer using a keyboard for steering. It works for me in other driving games, and until I actually buy a steering wheel that is what I'm going to use. Unfortunately, in this game, the wheel auto-centers itself too quickly so you're having to constantly jam on the 'a' and 'd' keys when making a sharp turn. It's not a total inconvenience, but it takes some time to get used to. If it bothers you that much then I would suggest a controller.  Hard to believe that SCS made this game so many years ago and there's actually more ground to cover than in any of their recent games. American Truck Simulator was released with only two states and Euro Truck Simulator 2 is being finished by modders. But they have stuck with the same formula over the years and, aside from graphics, their games have remained the same.  American Long Haul is not much different from ETS 2 or American Truck Simulator. You're still a truck driver managing your own company; you take jobs and deliver loads; you hire drivers to work for you; when you get tired you pull off the side of the road and sleep; when you need gas you go to the filling station; police give you a hard time; and when you get money you can buy more trucks. And really, what else do you need? Why not just skip the DLC fest and play this game instead?
1035	1	a	This game runs perfectly on Windows 10 still. The fact is, it's an old game from SCS published around 2007 as one of 18 Wheels of Steel series. SCS is also the author of the overwhelmingly postive Euro Track Simulator 2. Theme of this game is logistics, you buy a tow track, transporting stuffs like evacuator, to destination anywhere you want from job list.  However since this game is pretty old, it has poor sorta suck 3D support IMO (Prism3d engine? Not even heard of that), plus AI is dull to hell. When you meet cops, just cut out the engine and wait there. After a while you can continue, or just save &amp; reload (a little bit tricky). I coulnd't find anywhere like this amidst countries I've been to.  A simulator of real life circumstances/experience should provide acceptable graphics for targets at least, but this game is not that case. If you enjoy truck driving, buy it without regret but don't expect too much. It can't offer you endlessly fun in game, but only driving, what, you mean you want to enjoy the landscape? You will feel sorry about that again. For kids in new era, don't expect them whiling hours in 18WOS ALH.  I suggest you all buying ETS2 since it has massive imporvements of graphics, less bugs like falling from ground or suddenly out of screen, and more intelligent elements regarding AI, and so on. If you insist on buying this for whatever reason, do it during sales.
1037	1	a	Always has been a favorite from my childhood up until now. Love that the company is making a new American Truck Simulator.
1039	1	a	This game is an excellent precursor to the euro truck simulator series as well as the upcoming American Truck Simulator from SCS. It has few minor issues that may deter many gamers from giving this classic title its due.   The cities are not fleshed out. They are essentially hubs to drop cargo and get new assignments. The Fines for stopping too far over the line at red lights seems rediculously high, and the braking distance for a bobtailed tractor is a little far, but oh well. The meat of this game is spent driving miles and miles of bland landscapes sharing the road with what appears to be all students on their first day of drivers education classes.  Having said all that, however, I still enjoyed playing this game and finding out by trial and error what we were supposed to be doing, other than delivering and picking up cargo. If you enjoy simulation games, this may peak your interest. If you are more of the Need for Speed type, pass this by.
1041	1	a	i saw a ufo flying in the sky
1043	1	a	i have a complaint. I had it before on wild-tangent games and i played the heck out of it then a weird thing happened, when i tried to play it another day it said that the game was corrupt. so i figured if i bought it on steam the game may be fixed. But nope its the game not program. so i would like my 10$ back. overall though i liked the game and i would reccomend to play it
1045	1	a	This game is definately worthy of it's 100 metacritic rating, not only is the story immensely well thought out, the graphics beutifally detailed and the game so massively atmospheric but it's also a gameplay experience like no other. The only reason critics didn't rate it higher was because there isn't a number that could be big enough to accurately measure how good this game is. This is a game that should be owned by all people.
1047	1	a	One of the first games to tap into the anti-authoritarian aspects of the Citizen's Band (CB) radio craze, '18 Wheels of Steel: American Long Haul' is basically a movie-length car chase and a pleasantly insipid slice of late-'70's Americana. The tissue-thin plot has good ole boy pals running a load of fosters cross-country on a tight deadline while trying to avoid an assortment of less-than-bright cops.   The player jumps into the part of 'the trucker', a heart-throb for all white-trash trailer dwelling women, to a tee. SCS Software does an impeccable job of bringing to life the role of the backwards southern lifestyle. The soundtrack was an instant classic, combining folk, bluegrass and country, and leaving the player with an urge to recite the lyrics for days after. As you can tell by my gamer handle screen name, I love this game. I do regard this video game as an all time favorite, VGA material? Certainly not. But who cares. A must play for all serious game players.  2/10
1049	1	a	this game is out standing, I have to let you know a fiew hints when in canpain mode.  1st choose easy. 2 get a loan 70,000. 3 choose routes that has H   bosten to montrial has 2 I think there's one from wahington orlando.  If you are using steering wheel dead zone mustg be all the way up  note It such a real life game that the heavier you're trailer is the harder it will be to turn. the best way is slow down on turns, ps breaks have same rule.
1051	1	a	Good game. Fun to play. Have lost time getting into this game.
1053	1	a	if you haven't played this game before this is definatly a game you should buy mainly because it an affordable and fun depending on who you are and if you have played it but dont own it anymore its just filled nostalgia.
1055	1	a	A really old but fun game. Good for truck driving across America, and part of Mexico and Canada. Don't expect state of the art graphics with this game. It's a old game.
1057	1	a	trailer will not stay hooked up
1059	1	a	Fun simulator. Can be a bit hard to understand at first if you have not played 18 WOS before.. Over all fun game and its worth the 10 bucks if you need a fun truck sim to kill some time.
1061	1	a	trucks mcdonalds america hamburgers fast food imported beer pr0stitutes  all the things i like in one game 10/10
1063	1	a	Graphics kinda suck, and there are a few bugs. i can say that if youre looking for a fun big riggame these are some of the funest series
1065	1	a	One of the Best 18 WoS version!
1067	1	a	Get fined 3 times for the same thing 10/10 would drive again
1069	1	a	Bad Game, don't buy :(
387	0	a	18 wheels of bore: don't even buckle up  This game is really boring. I would recommend it only to those players who like such titles.  ----------  For anyone interested in joining in on completing your own backlog; check it out here -  http://steamcommunity.com/groups/completingthebacklog/discussions/5/530645446320364338/ 
1071	1	a	It's Alright. The ai cars drive awfully slow which Is annoying , also the truck takes a while to brake and stop especially if going at high speed , as a result I had several red light violations and rear ended many cars. Other than that the game is pretty good if you love trucking just don't expect anything fancy.   6/10
1073	1	a	This game is amazing. It is extremely in-depth, with many different controls, as well as having realistic stops and keeping a trucker's log. A really good game for being not so young. Just as good as Euro Truck Simulator
1075	1	a	Get to point A to point B in a fast time and that's pretty much what you get with this game! If you ever dreamed about what it would be like to be a trucker and be on the open road then this game is meant for you. Its a pretty easy game which is fun to play when you have a couple hours. It gives you the feeling of what it would be like to really drive this truck in America. Its a good game just make sure to get it on sale before purchasing it!
1077	1	a	A game that makes full use of the 900 degree rotation on a logitech G25/27! This game is all about running your own trucking company - you can pick your cargo, destination, truck, other drivers etc. Build a company with a fleet of trucks and drivers to dominate the haulage across America.   There is something quite soothing about driving in this game - it removes pressure from driving that you normally experience in most driving games. It is replaced with different kinds of pressure - such as juggling sleep, not damaging precious cargo and even avoiding speeding fines).  It is reccommended you do use a wheel for this but not essential. Would imagine that anything else apart from a wheel would take away from this fantastic sim! There are even communities that have virtual companies you can work for!
1079	1	a	Eh it's a old game.
1081	1	a	overall the game is allright
1083	1	a	This game is preety â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ don't buy it unless you wanna get aids from a semi
1085	1	a	This game is amazing. I dont have a single thing bad to say about it. As my father is an over the road driver i feel this game brings is closer and makes us connect on a different level. Thank you creater of this game for taking time outta your, im sure, busy life to bless us with this accomplishment.
1087	1	a	it is what it is...straight forward nothing too fancy...but if you wait for low sale price...it's good if you like these type of games...like me. I'm a former O.T.R. driver.... coast to coast. Something about the sound of windshield wipers flap'n in this game brings a smile.
1089	1	a	The right game if you're into serious simulation. And driving heavy trucks on highways is way more meditative than fast-paced racing.
1091	1	a	dose this game work in windows 7
1093	1	a	can carry big log 10/10 is game good
1095	1	a	This game is more than ETS 1 and 2
429	0	a	Can't turn right on a red. 0/10 unplayble.
1097	1	a	This is a game that someone made.
1099	1	a	What's not to love about long hauls and trucks?
1101	1	a	Amazing game. Stunning visuals and an incredible story make for one game I won't soon forget
1103	1	a	Although this game is good, I do not know how to play multiplayer. Is there by any chance you can play mmultiplayer on pc???
431	0	a	updated game now i cant play it
432	0	a	STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM THIS GAME UNLESS YOU LIKE 2 INTERIORS ONLY.... VERY BORING. GET EURO TRUCK SIM 2 INSTEAD!
1105	1	a	Nice trucking game.  In short: Visually nice, truck drives were nice. Random accidents on the road, heavy traffic during daytime.. and then rain.. yup thatÂ´s how it goes sometimes.   Remarks: As said and recommended by others: turn cops and fatigue off makes it more relaxing to play.  Recommend: Yes.
1107	1	a	NICE old school game. If u played ETS2 Alot.. u need to get used to the Graphics and the handling/controlles. But I played the older games of 18 wheels of steel. so I know This is A Classic game. Rember The technics are way better than before. so It's an Old NICE Game!   I'm very glad about the new American Truck Simulator! Gonna buy it Also
433	0	a	Now here's a game for Real Men! Imagine the power of a massive 18-wheeler at your fingertips when cruising along the interstate! With a manly paint job! Of flames!!  Portal 2? Pfft! For â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥!! 18 Wheels of Steel: American Long Haul; you don't play it, you live it!  (Seriously though, it's pretty bad.)
1109	1	a	This is one of SCS Software's oldest games. As such, it is nowhere near as good as their later offerings like Euro Truck Simulator 2. But for its age, this is a pretty decent game. You get the whole United States, some of Canada and some of Mexico. Steering is a little rough compared to ETS 2, but OK. The graphics are nowhere near as sophisticated as they are in ETS 2 (they resemble the graphics in Bus Driver, an SCS game of a similar vintage to this one). But for the era that this game was made, they're pretty good. Physics are not as good as ETS 2, but they're acceptable.  If you want a truly great truck simulator, buy Euro Truck Simulator 2. But if you want something a little more 'old school' and want to whet your appetite for the upcoming American Truck Simulator, you could do a lot worse than give this game a whirl.
1111	1	a	Old game, but I REALLY LOVE this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. #ELDER#
1113	1	a	i liked it but it failed to start. 
1115	1	a	Cool Game :3
1117	1	a	This is the best '18 Wheels of Steel' game of the brand.  It's a truck simulator, very fun, played for hours, and still playing some time.  Bad graphic, but good simulation.
1119	1	a	Greatest game ever my friends, definitely buy
1121	1	a	This is still a classic game! Highly recommend it to players who want to truck on USA's highways!
1123	1	a	really good game, but it really shows being almost 8 years old... i wish SCS would come back to 18 wos and give us an updated version. there is SOOOO much potential really.
1125	1	a	if you like trucking you will enjoy a lot of countless hours :)
1127	1	a	if you like simulation or RPG games or even tycoons, i bet this is the game for u.
1129	1	a	The most fun I never knew I could possibly have driving a fake truck across the country. This game is a blast. It's therapeutically pleasing, and really relaxes me after a stressful day in the real world.   Extremely highly super recommend, especially if you like big trucks as a kid.
1131	1	a	I played the 18 wheel of steel pedal to the medal. i had abouslty fun with this game. i had lost the cd for it and i couldnt play for year. beecsaue my computer was not able to run the solfware somthly. so my freind try out steam and i able to find the game that i wanted to play for years. Thank you to steam
434	0	a	This game used to be where it was at, but that place is no longer there. Eurotruck Simulator 2 completely smokes this game, but you don't get the American trucks though. I have actually owned several of the 18WOS games but they just do not stand the test of time. If you want this game, either find it in the WalMart bargain bin for $5 or wait to see if it available on Steam for $2-$3.   Now, if you still want to play this, go ahead. It isn't a bad game and there are tons of mods out there. The problem is that it is really old and has a very 'stiff' feel to it.
1133	1	a	Not a bad simulator. I've driven and worked around trucks before and I like it. Not perfect but entertaining. Cons: Some of the world limits aren't visible so sometimes you bounce off invisible barriers. If you purchase the oversized load trailer and try to take it, it freezes the game. I even tried reinstalling and got the same issue. It needs a tutorial. I had to wait until I got fined to figure out what I was doing which means save regularly because some of the fines can break you off the bat. It's hard to tell what you need to do to be able to hire new employees which btw can be found at hotels. Not sure if it's by the number of contracts or garages or completed shipments.  Pros: It's quite similar to starting a company. You can take loans, buy better equipment, add accessories, hire employees. It's open world so you can just drive around or choose which company you want to ship for. All in all I'd give it a solid 4/5. Enjoy!
1135	1	a	8/10
435	0	a	Do Not Recommend.  Graphics engine is unstable and will crash when changing trucks. Some trucks work while others will crash it.  If it were patched and fixed I would recomend.
1137	1	a	After years and years.... coming back to it made me feel like a kid again, that used to drive miles and miles... and never got tired of trucks along U.S. roads.  The map is just enourmous, deliveries can take hours, which makes it more fun while listening to some music, the game may look old and the gameplay can feel a little like driving a vehicle with bald tyres, but that doesn't matter because if you are that type of person who enjoys landscapes, long 'hauls' this game is a good fit.  My only cons is that its a bit annoying to stop the truck and you must follow every road procedure or else your wanted bar will increase more and more(it'll decrease when you play it cool), also plan very well the deliveries you don't want to run out of fuel right?  P.S: If you think you'll do repetitive deliveries like in ETS, you're wrong you can choose any delivery destination and any company to grab any type of trailer :3  10/10 Because nostalgia
1139	1	a	Wish they would make another game and if they do make more cars like Migets. Dwarf cars, Late models, but over all I love the game
1141	1	a	I personally love dirt track racing and try to watch as often as my local track run. Sprint Cars Road to Knoxville is a great game IF you love dirt track racing. The game is very specific to dirt track fans, and while not perfect, is the best one that is still readily available. Although to be frank, some playstation 2 models were indeed better games but are harder to get ahold of now. If you cannot race with a keyboard, I wouldn't bother because some seem not to work. The car sound can occasionally be garbled, and sounds bad but isn't detrimental to the gameplay itself. Also, I've seen many gripe about creating drivers taking forever. You don't have to, as long as your driving you can hire the cheapest driver and get to work. If you love dirt track racing, I think you'll find this game soothing enough to eat up some of your day.  Good luck and hope this was helpful.
1143	1	a	I enjoy this game a lot. My only negative that bothers me has to do with the audio, specifically with the cars; they sound garbled, hit-and-miss, inconsistent. I don't understand why this is the case and would hope it can be fixed soon please. But I still enjoy the game overall.
437	0	a	This game being as old as it is could be a great game still . But it lacks any kind of wheel support . I have scoured the web for files and there are no work arounds. wont even work with an old R440 wheel I have. If you are a keyboard driver you will love it
438	0	a	Hmmm... I don't know... I played a little bit and it's missing something... Some 'wow' factor...  This is a situation where the 'maybe' button would come in handy.
1145	1	a	game was fun there needs to be a new one
1147	1	a	Great game! i had trouble with the sound working right, but im a die hard dirt racing fan so i got over that real quick! Ai is okay sometimes, career mode youll pretty much win every race by laping everyone once or twice wish there was a little more challenge there but if you like dirt track racing this is the game! Fun game overall, out of the handful of dirt track games ive owned this ones right at the top.
1149	1	a	You get to drive sprint cars all the way to Knoxville, and if you don't stop at the gas station in Nashville you're â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed because these cars get like 2 miles to the gallon what the hell.
442	0	a	wont even load for me 
443	0	a	0.9/10 - Something smells fishy about these reviews!  I simply don't understand it. This game has mixed reviews? The most helpful reviews are all positive?! INSANE!!  Old. Ugly trash. I spent 90% trying to create a career. The other 10% was racing. Everything was going good on the first lap; I was thinking positive things... Then I realized my car was unresponsive somewhat. I took my hands off the keyboard and the car continues to drive and compensate for my errors. WTF.  Can't believe this is $10. Don't buy this.     Accidently Reviewed
444	0	a	I loved this game on PS2. Just as fun as i remembered but the game is pretty crap..
445	0	a	Simply NO! This game is an oldie but not a goodie. This game was crap your ago and its absolut crap now. Don't even think about wasting your money!  This game has absolut crap graphics (was on release trash as well), absolut s*** gameplay and makes absolut NO fun!
446	0	a	OMG this is not a good game at all. Sure, it's one of the best sprint car games, because there ain't many more. 0.5/10
447	0	a	:((((((((((
448	0	a	Absolute piece of garbage. Loosely based on previous sprint car games. All I want to do, is start a career and race, working up as I go. After spending 20 minutes trying to create a driver.......
449	0	a	Controller support is practically non existant and game stutters.  If you want a good sprint car game, find the sprint car/dirt track racing games from Ratbag games.... they're older but so much better than this...
1151	1	a	Insane FUN right here. The oldest of the series and it's DAMN FUN. I'm getting ready to purchase the newer ones because it's quite addictive. Play with keyboard or controller. Hang on and fly high!  Easy 2 thumbs up.
1153	1	a	Awesome physics, but the difficulty is high. I see players on YouTube running through the tracks full speed, but I have trouble even finishing. Still fun to play.
1155	1	a	A great physics game. Difficult and strangely addicting. Very rewarding when completing a difficult level.
1157	1	a	This is a fun game, but only worth it if its on sale... :P
1159	1	a	I started playing trials with Trials HD on the Xbox arcade where I would build my own tracks and try and beat top scores over and over.  This edition of the game is great and feels good when doing a perfect run. The mechanics of the bike and the physics-based rider makes the game have a funny side as well.  I give this a 8.5/10 for being a great pickup and play game.
1161	1	a	IT MAKES ME ANGRY BUT IT IS WORTH IT FOR THE MASSIVE HAPPY YOU GET AT THE END!
1163	1	a	Best game ever, true story.
1165	1	a	Excellent game full of challenges and a high level of replay value great for both adults and kids of all ages.
1167	1	a	Trials woo hoo!
1169	1	a	Do you hate yourself? Do you love being frustrated? Does the desire to break your screen and keyboard bring a smile to your face? Then Trials 2 is made for you.  That may not sound like a ringing endorsement, but some people like these kinds of games....you know who you are.
1171	1	a	Great game. Addictive, with huge replay value.  A controller is highly recommended.
1173	1	a	this game is probls the best courtroom drama simulater on the personal computing platform. u get 2 play as redlynx a hotshot lawyer and u do trials about ppl who have done crimes and u have 2 get them off w/ it 
1175	1	a	ARCADE WIZARD'S REVIEW  FUN: 5/5  GRAPHICS: 3/5  SHOULD YOU BUY IT?: YES
1177	1	a	If you don't mind extremely frustrating games, this one can be great.
1179	1	a	made in unity everyone
1181	1	a	this is by far one of my favorite little games, way more challenging then the newer titles
1183	1	a	OMGWHYDIDN'TIKNOWABOUTTHISâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥INGGAME?!?!?!?!
1185	1	a	PURE AWESOMENESS! Controls are a bit tricky but once you master the controls, this game gets very intense! I have WAY more time in-game than Steam shows as it is playable while offline...not many games offer offline play these days. I bought it back in the day on sale for $2.49 but would gladly pay the $9.99 standard price since the game is so much fun!
1187	1	a	Moreish. Perfect physics and very punishing.
1189	1	a	this game will make u hate your computer!
1191	1	a	Nothing but sheer fun! Easy to pick up and play.
1193	1	a	The little man on the bike you control is a former Motocross champion turned serial bomber/killer who is forced in the afterlife to ride a bike in order to get all of his limbs painfully broken. You are the executor of his punishment.
1195	1	a	Redlynx Trials is one of those games which is easy to pick up but very hard to stop playing. You control a trial bike rider across a wide variety of indoor courses, some of them truly awe-inspiring in their complexity. You're supposed to get the rider from one end of the obstacle course to the other, but the endless faceplants, rashies, crashes and bashes are almost as much fun as safely navigating the course. Never have broken bones been so much fun. For added enjoyment, try playing this with a friend - you can take it in turns to see who breaks the most bones.
1197	1	a	if you liked the flash game this one is 10x better
1199	1	a	Most addictive masochistic gameplay!
1201	1	a	very addicting, tough to master and fun for hours, play with a friend in the room and take turns at beating the tracks. I use an Xbox360 controller it's very hard with a keyboard to be percise on this game WHICH YOU HAVE TO!! (you can play with a 360 controller on most games because 'PC is Microsoft' and you just bought another controller from logitech or something??)
1203	1	a	wow if you want the apolyptic vision of the future imagine no further. take your bike on a spin around the tracks and see what can do. you can do a flip and land it, despite yourself. don't give it too much thought just ride like romantic image of motorcycles from the books, and when you had a thought about playing this game you should.
1205	1	a	Great !
1207	1	a	Dat. First game &lt;3  Payed 2.50â‚¬ Go make some stunts and break your neck. 
1209	1	a	Do yourself a favour and buy an Xbox controller to play this game!
1211	1	a	OMFG this game is reeeeealllllly hard......it makes me almost cry. But if you like challenging game, this is right decision for you. This game will show you what is challenging.
1213	1	a	This is a really fun game but it is much better on the Xbox. If you use a controller the response is very slow and even using the trigger for accelerating you either get off or on full. This makes the hard levels much harder than they should be.  I will recommend this game but would say if you want to play it properly, get the Xbox versions as this just seems to me as though the programers got it looking good then just said 'meh!' to the controls.
1215	1	a	if you liked the flash game this one is 10x better
1217	1	a	This game is just AWESOME!
1219	1	a	Most addictive masochistic gameplay!
1221	1	a	Be prepared to break every bone in your body, including your controller!
1223	1	a	Never have I loved a game more. Never have I hated one so so much. Trials can be very addicting trying to get that 'perfect run' but at the same time oh so frustrating when you fall just short of the end. The best part is that it is never the games fault when you fail. And you always know it. It is incredibly rewarding to finally get through a track without falling, or shaving off just a few tenths of a second off of your time. It's a game that you can play when you only have 10 minutes to play, but can spend hours absorbed too. The controls are tight. There are only 4 buttons to push, but control is deceptively deep and nuanced. The crashes can be hilarious. The tracks are well designed and the difficulty ramps up appropriatly from carefree first levels to the insidiously difficult hard tracks. There is a fairly punishing learning curve about 60% of the way through the tracks, but so satisfying when you get some of the more advanced techniques down. Most games I get excited about have a whole lot to do with the story or the atmosphere of the game. This is one of the very few in recent memory that stand pretty much 100% on the merit of the gameplay itself.

1231	1	a	The little man on the bike you control is a former Motocross champion turned serial bomber/killer who is forced in the afterlife to ride a bike in order to get all of his limbs painfully broken. You are the executor of his punishment.

1235	1	a	Remember that stuntbike game you played on Miniclip? This is it, looking great in the Source engine.
1237	1	a	This is one of the most exciting and addictive game that I've already played. When you start playing, you won't stop until break your records, you'll want to be better in each track you play. And in the March 22th will be realeased the Trials Evolution: Gold Edition for PC. And will have a lot of inovations for the game be more atractive and competitive, for spend a lot of your time in the game. This game is like drugs, when you start, you'll never stop, but I think that is a good drug, or no. So, if you want a reaally good game, that will help you when you'are bored, this is the perfect choice!
450	0	a	The physics are way off. If you're leaning all the way forward and you go off a ramp, you shouldn't spin backwards.
451	0	a	Bone crunchingly hard...even with a game controller. The game mechanics and physics just seem completely abnormal and take all enjoyment out of the game letting frustration take over.
452	0	a	This game is a piece of $h!t. If you own it, it's because it was on-sale.....again.
453	0	a	Waste of money as the demo is as entertaining as the game. Small cost at least.  Have about 10+ hours in this game.
454	0	a	Christ this game has not aged well. Dodgy physics and little-to-no controller support really kills it for me, stick to newer Trials games I'd suggest
455	0	a	If you came looking for more Trials after playing Trials Evolution, this is a big downgrade. Mainly the controls are extremely sensitive and finicky and just handle poorly, which makes this whole experience much more frustrating than it needs to be compared to the others in the series, which are much more fun.
456	0	a	This game easily the most brutal and unforgiving game I have ever played. If you can mange to get it to stop crashing and freezing your graphics card, you will be treated to ridiculous elasticy physics and frustrating glitches (like your bike folding in half on a regular basis).  The learning curve is extremely steep, which is reflected by the nearly impossible achievements. In order to become half decent at Trials 2, you will need to study replays and practice infuriating sections of track for hours on end, and even then you have no hope of touching the leaderboards.  So unless you have a lot of time on your hands, and like extremely difficult challenges, think again before you choose this game.
457	0	a	I'm never quite sure what to do with these games. I play through the Trials until I get stuck, and then I don't quite have the motivation to play them over and over. If you enjoy the racing and physics tedium, it might be enough to hook you.
458	0	a	Got this in a bundle of two games for like 5 bucks, still got ripped off.... I wonder if the developers had ever ridden a motorcycle prior to the development of this game. Unfortunately, Steam won't let you return digitally purchased games, no matter how awful they are...
459	0	a	Good game, but the PC version of Trials Evolution: Gold Edition has a much more refined engine and all the levels of this game (plus many many more levels on top of that). Pick that up instead.
460	0	a	Crap controller support, crap sound, crap sense of speed.  Expected anything like the old games or trials HD, got nothing.
461	0	a	It's a piece of crap it doesn't work
462	0	a	i started on hd see this on steam though id try a earlyer 1 not a good idea this feels horrid, floaty and tracks just arnt fun
463	0	a	WUT? .... xbox version has editor, but not PC version? ... :(  That's the only reason i played it.... waaaaaaa! :'( 
464	0	a	The painful absence of true controller support, no analogue and controller doesn't work in menus, leaves this game feeling like a shoddy half baked port that plays much much better on the consoles than it does on PC. If you want to play this game, buy it on Xbox.  
465	0	a	Bought this cause I love Trials HD on the 360. Contols felt totally different to the point of I just couldn't play it. Gave Up on it. Then Trials Evolutions Gold came out. Was afraid to waste money again but found it on sale and took a try. Felt exactly the same Trails Hd on the 360. How same you might ask, well Evolution Gold includes Original Trial HD levels. My times are for the most part exactly the same. I most likely will never reinstall this game. Get Evo Gold instaed of this, just my 2 cents..
466	0	a	This is bascially a set of mini-games that involve stunts. You calc the strength, distance, direction, ect for stunts. You get score based on the outcome.  Its not bad, but also a bit more limited than I was hoping for...  Its ok for what it is.
467	0	a	great concept.graphics are good.let down by frustrating levels that require bunny jumps (hold back then push up at end of ramp).this move is a paradox as performing it causes you to flip.who thought of this move is an idiot.it should be straightforward balance and gas control.unless you are a master gamer with perfect hand-eye coordination then avoid.could have been a brilliant game if it had been engineered for the general gamer buts its not.so if you dont have the patience of a saint or the hand-eye skills of a cyborg then leave well alone.....
468	0	a	While the game itself is fun, it's a horrible port. It's definatly gamepad focused so there's no excuse why the menues can't be controlled with a gamepad. It's also very poorly optimized.  Don't buy this, buy the excellent Trials Evolution instead, which is a far better game and has all the things this game is missing.
469	0	a	Playing Trials 2 is like going to a restaurant, and ordering the chili.  First, you're impressed. It's pretty good! The meat is tender, the onions and beans are flavorful, the broth is robust.  Then, the cook comes out and adds some Cayenne pepper, to give it just a little spice. Superb! Well done!  And then the cook comes out again and adds some more Cayenne pepper. Well, I mean... why? It's quite good the way it is. You can still taste the other ingredients, and it's not bad, but things are kind of getting overwhelmed by the spice.  And then the cook comes out once more and dumps a gallon if Cayenne pepper into your dish. Now you're irritated, but you know there's good chili in there, right? You take a bite, and try to ignore the spiciness, but even when you find a great big chunk of meat or something, all you can taste is spice. Spice, spice, spice.  Difficulty is good in a game. A little spice is more than nice. But when your game's gimmick is that it gets so difficult that you can no longer taste the enjoyable stuff, well... what's the point? Who wants to eat THAT dish?  A bad chef is one who sucks at chili. An unforgivable chef is one who ruins good chili. The same goes for game devs - good game, ruined because some idiot was all like 'XTREEEEEEEM MEANS HARD, RIGHT?' I will not be purchasing any games by Red Lynx again.
470	0	a	Compared to newer entries in the Trials series, Trials 2 feels incredibly dated. Its lack of polish, unrefined and floaty physics, and just general quality-of-life features show just how far RedLynx have come over the years. This is a very barebones game, but it was necessary for the devs to get to the point that they're at now. As it stands, this is a decently fun little time-waster, but the Miniclip sponsorship signs in the background show you exactly what kind of mindset you should approach this with.  Overall, I recommend skipping this version and picking up Trials Evolution or Fusion instead. Or, you could even play their mobile app, which is also very good.
471	0	a	This game is fun when you're bored, but it also lags a bit so it's very frustrating when you're bored.
472	0	a	Why have you lied to me, Chris Livingston? This game isn't really fun at all. Maybe for like 2 hours. What the hell!
1239	1	a	wroom wroom. An easier version of Trials 2 HD, in which you can only go fowards and backwards.. kinda like elastomania.
1241	1	a	A Trials HD game with monster trucks. Oh yeah!
1243	1	a	Hahaha this game..... cant describe it JUST PERFECT! not really...
1245	1	a	My brother's son enjoys this game, he is 4. Several of the levels are easy to finish. IMHO it'n not a bad game, but it's not good either.  For some reason it doesn't work on my Win8-64 bit PC, but works fine on Win7 and Win8-32 bit.
1247	1	a	Simple control... gas, brake, forward tilt, backward tilt, nitro... but really have to judge speed and landing aim well to get the best times and the gold. Good graphics. Engine sound is okay for this type of game, but could have been better. Challenging levels. Reasonalbe menus. Cute design.  But considering the game is already 7 years old, I don't think it's worth $19.99... more like $4.99, or no more than $6.99.  I recommend this game, but not at a highway robbery price.
1249	1	a	There are so many things I could tell you about this game, but I can't because then Valve would be forced to remove my account.
1251	1	a	A game with tons of potential for all types of players - whether you want to just plough through the levels no mater what the final result and finish all maps, or go back to perfect your score even more, this game is very nice to have. This game can be played for hours on end, or just a couple of minutes when you just want to have a quick race to enjoy short pleasant monster-trucking.
473	0	a	clearly the test game for the TRIALS series. It's playable. 5/10  Do not pay anything above 1.99 for it.  
474	0	a	It's rare to find games that are so horrible, it just isn't even worth writing about them. Monster Trucks Nitro is one of those rare games.
475	0	a	Jump. Jump. Jump.  Jump.  That's it. Nothing else. Hit the gas and jump.  It also somehow still sufferes from lag on systems far more powerful than the recommended requriements.
476	0	a	This has to be one of the worst games I have ever played. Stay far away...Even if its free!!!
477	0	a	Won't run, crashes to desktop on Mac
478	0	a	lol I played a few minutes and did a few jumps. I thought... this is cool. Turned it off and never turned it back on.  You are just jumping but you do not actually control the trucks, you just do the set up and gas, but no turning. So no reason to play more than 20 minutes of fun in my opinion.
479	0	a	At the time of this review the price is currently Â£16.99 ...... whoever ramped up the price that high should be ashamed of themselves. This game is worth no more than Â£0.99 in sale.  Shame ...  Could have been up there with the Trials games.  It appears like the devs have lazily ported an app version of this game to the PC.  When booting the game, a config page is displayed, but selecting my resolution of 2560 x 1440 meant that all textures in the game were so garbled and messy I had no idea what was being said/displayed.  I read a fix for this which says to start the game at a low res like 1024 x 768, then use the in game resolution changer (NOT the 1st config page) to set the correct resolution. But, the textures don't seem to be optimised for higher resolutions like 2560 x 1440. The clunky way of clicking through every screen resolution before hitting the right one is quite annoying ... was it really too much like hard work to add a drop down selector?!  Not made for PC. Should be sold very cheap to reflect its value to the PC gamers.  See screenshot for textures issue - the textures display fine at low resolutions:         Monster Trucks Nitro&nbsp;
480	0	a	Worst Piece of trash i've ever had on Steam, everything is super glitchy, colors are super bright, and i don't understand why it doesn't want to work properly even after changing so many options, the menu still super blurry (i use Windows 8 but this is the only game that can run but doesn't work properly), i don't recommend wasting time on this, even if it were free, not worth it, it's waste of space, at least i got it for free, Deleted within less than 10 minutes
1253	1	a	Where do I start with this...  Need for Speed Undercover has been bashed, beaten &amp; overall just despised by the entire Need for Speed community, often described as 'one of the absolute worst Need for Speed games ever made'. But, judging you see that giant blue thumbs up, you obviously can tell that I don't think that way.  Now, those of you who really hate long reviews (because there's gonna be quite a lengthy one ahead), here's a short pros-n'-cons review to not waste your time:   Pros:
1255	1	a	It is a really short game, but I loved the story. Plus there are very good tunning system, it is absolutely worth the price
1257	1	a	Great game! Graphics are amazing for the time it was made, and cars are much easier to get than NFS Carbon. I beat the game in less than 30 hours, and it was great every step of the way. The cutscenes are terrific, gameplay is amazing, everything is perfect. The car customization is one of the best I have ever seen! Would recommend. 10/10 Rating.
1259	1	a	Think of this game as the younger, try-hard brother of NFS: Most Wanted (2005).  It's like MW, but this time... - Cops don't go airborne when you hit a roadblock - It has oversteer and understeer. And everywhere-steer. - The heat system no longer makes sense - Crashing into traffic still counts as a 'near miss' (lol) - You can't get cars out of impound - It's got bad music - Physics are somewhat buggy when you do manage to get airborne - Multiplayer servers are completely shut down  ... however... + Feels like it's directed by Michael Bay  + Cool graphics! + Visible damage + Well-paced story + Not just racing; attempt to 'take down' (bust) racer criminals + Extensive list of 'modern' cars (more or less) + Minimal menu-stuffing-around  Cool game you can knock off in a short amount of time. Doesn't quite retain the feel of the edgy Most Wanted vibe, but it has its replay value. 7/10
1261	1	a	Most underated racing game of the past generation. Solid mechanics, great driving feel, kinda on the unglier side, but still super fun. Not as good as Most Wanted 05, but that game isn't even on Steam so this is as close as you can get.
1263	1	a	One of the most underrated series of nfs. It has lot of cutscenes, and nice storyline to follow on. Only two problem makes this game underrated than it has to be.  First problem is the ridiculous difficulty on some races such as I need to beat SLR Mclaren with EVO. But it is not that big because you can get pinkslips as you clear other missions and easily collect money and buy a better car. The biggest problem is physics which breaks the game and makes player difficult or sometimes almost impossible to control the car. But overall great game with big open world, Which is the last nfs with STORY, COPS, TUNE UPS, and FREEDRIVE. See what happened to NFS these days. They are just burnout series with supercars. No more storyline, unique tune ups, and thrills which really suck.  ê°„ë§Œì— í•´ë³´ëŠ”ë° ë½€ìƒ¤ì‹œí•œ ê·¸ëž˜í”½, ìŠ¤í† ë¦¬ë¼ì¸ì´ ì¢‹ìŒ  ìµœê³ ì˜ í˜¹í‰ì„ ë°›ì•˜ë˜ ê²Œìž„ì¸ë° ê±°ê¸°ì„œ ì•Œìˆ˜ ìžˆë“¯ êµ‰ìž¥í•œ ê°œì í™”ì™€ ì©ì€ ë¬¼ë¦¬ì—”ì§„ì„ ë³´ì—¬ì¤€ë‹¤ ì©ì€ ë¬¼ë¦¬ì—”ì§„ì´ í˜ˆì••ì„ ì˜¤ë¥´ê²Œí•˜ì§€ë§Œ ê¸°ë³¸ì ìœ¼ë¡œ ë½€ìƒ¤ì‹œí•œ ëŠë‚Œê³¼ ì˜¤í”ˆì›”ë“œê°€ ì¢‹ì•„ì„œ í• ë§Œì€ í•˜ë‹¤.
1265	1	a	One of my childhood games. Looks ugly, but the gameplay... An awesome nfs, probably one of the last good one. Other than The Run. If you like car games, please give this a try, ignore the visuals.
1267	1	a	Last intersting 'Need for Speed'. The following parts is trash.
1269	1	a	alright arcade racer. nothing comes close to how awesome need for speed games were backin the day though.
1271	1	a	It does what any good arcade racing game does best. Amazing picture perfect graphics which take very little power to run, has free roam and a ton of awesome cars to choose from. The story mode is just what you need it to be,crazy chases, wrecks or just good old racing with long tracks spanning miles on end. The physics aren't as realistic but this is an arcade game, a great one at that. 
1273	1	a	This is by far my favorite game to play on steam! I have no issues and I have put 510 hours into this game! Amazing!
1275	1	a	It's like Fast &amp; Furious, but without Paul Walk(er). 
1277	1	a	There's a good bit of variety and a fair story to go along withe driving, even if it is a bit short. You can choose to drive from race to race, which I find one of the best aspects of these games.  Graphics are smooth and, because of its age, it will probably work on even cheap modern hardware.
1279	1	a	I wish there was a 'Maybe' option when it comes to recommending games, because it would be very useful right now.   Short Version:
1281	1	a	Need For Speed Undercover. Intended to be a true successor to Most Wanted (The 2005 version...not Burnout Paradise 2), this game has received its fair share of hate and throughout all of these years, i never understood why to be perfectly honest. After the less then stellar Pro Street, i was extremely hyped for this game at the time and when i played it, initially i thought it was an absolute blast and lived up to Most Wanted in every way.   But again, that was in 2008. How does the game hold up to today's standards?  Well. Suprisingly well id say. Its not even close to how good i thought it was back in the day (Bare in mind, this was back when i loved racing games and i was a Total NFS fanboy) but its still a pretty exciting racer and the hate it received wasnt exactly what it deserved. It truly was the last TRUE Need For Speed, before the series would become Burnout (Hot Pursuit was basically Takedown, MW2012 is Paradise 2, as stated). That being said, lets get a few things out of the way. If your expecting a truly engaging story with memorable characters, unexpected plot twists and perfect pacing with pitch perfect acting...then just stop, like seriously. The story is completely disjointed and random. Stuff happens for no reason and characters come and go without any rhyme or reason. And the cutscenes...my god...the dialogue is without a doubt completely unbearable. Most Wanted and Carbon were cheesy, but in a way that gave it style. Here, it just feels forced...that or these people cant write or act at all. A particular character, Rose, is without a doubt the worst. Her dialogue is just the worst ive heard in awhile. Suffice to say, im sad that the story failed. The idea of being deep undercover of some kind of crime syndicate always intrigued me and EA couldve really did something here.  Anywho, enough of the story. The racing and cop chases are where this game strive off of and i feel that while its not at the heights of Most Wanted, its still good enough that you can see yourself having allot of fun with this game. The sense of speed is crazy, and the car handling is less torpedo like and allows you to casually cut corners like a pro, which goes really far into making you feel like a real bad â™¥â™¥â™¥! The courses are layered out with plenty of ways to overcome other racers and you always feel like you have a chance even if the race isnt going good. Then the police chases, which is one of my personal favorite mission types, are just pure intensity, particularly when your Wheelman level goes up and the odds against you get higher and higher. Also, i love the small touch of being able to press a single button to hop into another race on the spot. It allows you to simply hop into a match without surfing into map screens and i for one love the small touch. The game is extremely easy to run too. Throwing it on max settings shouldnt be too difficult and 60FPS isnt going to be far from reach either.  This might be a preference thing, but the keyboard controls are Meh at best. You can totally work with it, as i found it atleast playable...but if you have a 360 Remote laying about, or any other form of Gamepad, id highly reccomend using it. The game feels much more slick this way and it really pays off.  Now for the things i didnt like. The AI is inconsistent to say the least. In races, expect to always see the opponents lag MILES behind you. Even towards the end of the game, this happens pretty often. Im under the assumption that you could EASILY beat this game with the starter vehicle, which is kindda sad. Then theres the 'Master Races' which is the perfect showcaser of why the series frequent use of Rubber Banding is a joke. You literally have to ensure you make NO mistakes...yet even when your doing perfect, someone will be glued to your â™¥â™¥â™¥ like a Magnet and side swipe you when your close to victory. You can try to rear end them but they stay glued to the road as you plumet to the side of the road in shame. At these moments, i really wish we had the progression of Need For Speed Most Wanted, where the game got more and more difficult as you made your way down the blacklist. Hell, even Carbon with its Rubbery AI had a feeling of progession. As for the cop chases...they have issues too. Dont get me wrong, they are still fun, but the Police are just too forgiving. Cops often stand back, allowing you to easily out run them, and even in the higher intervals, they give you space to escape being boxed in. Also for whatever reason, they eventually call off all their units after awhile, abruptly ending a chase. The only thing that really gets you off guard is the Spike Strips, but thats only because you never even really see them.  In the end, the game is definetly flawed. But id say its worth it. Especially now that its cheap and easily attainable through Steam. The racing is fun, and the chases can be a blast. The awful story and Inconsistent difficulty drag it down but nowhere near to the levels of a bad game. Its a solid racer and if your looking for something to play, look no further. PERSONALLY though, if you still have a Playstation 2 or a Nintendo Wii (Or a Wii U even), id reccomend hunting down a copy of Need For Speed Undercover on one of those consoles. It may not be the prettiest versions, but the AI is much better and consistent, the cars feel and handle better, the cop chases are a challenge and it just overall just feels more like a Most Wanted sequel then this version does.
1283	1	a	The broken physics and the AI gives me a cancer.
1285	1	a	I like the playstation 2 version more than the pc version
1287	1	a	This is the best 'Need for speed' game i have played, one of the best 'Arcade' racers out there.
1289	1	a	In 6 easy steps I can show you what the steering and cornering is like in this game   1: Get very drunk. This will account for the extreme motion blur within NFS Undercover 2: Find or construct a table fit fit for a banquet  3: Get 1kg of cheese - the sliced pieces. Lay these out on the table leaving no spaces 4: Get 1L of Mountain Dew and pour this all over your beloved cheese 5: Now jump up onto the table 6: Start surfing across the table (whilst dabbing furiously if you generally use manual controls - this represents gearbox in game)   Enjoy !  Always practice safe driving
1291	1	a	This got quite a lot of bad press, but for me it was one of my favorite Need for Speed titles because of it's open wold like feel. It was quite similar to the first Test Drive unlimited, tohugh with slightly better graphics in that you could wander aroun the large area covering several smalll towns and pick up missions as and when you felt like it.   It's well worth picking up when Steam have one of their sales. you'll probably get it for a few pounds. It doesn't have race tracks, basically this is a road racer unlike the next two titles in the seris. :)
1293	1	a	It was cheap.
1295	1	a	This game is my favourite nfs game over all nfs serial.. the best over all of them?  .. emm hard to say that maybe... but this game rocks!
1297	1	a	Great game one of the best need for speed games I have played:) 
1299	1	a	Very entertaining old style Need For Speed with modern graphics and gameplay facilities
1301	1	a	First time playing this on PC. I played this in the Wii version. But I wasn't expecting that it would be different in the PC version. I just finished the game but I still have more races to play.
1303	1	a	4:3 resolution Unbalanced cops and robbers mode Most â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up drifts Can't even play with steam friends EA Nation EA Nation EA Nation Dem light shafts   I love it
1305	1	a	Honestly... when I first played this game, I had a great time. Usually I don't enjoy playings games without friends, but this one kept me busy for hours on end. The racing controls, even for a keyboard, are amazing. Most racing games on a PC with keyboard and mouse are frustrating, but this one is satisfying.   It's not some Triple A game, and it shouldn't be compared with those sorts of games. It does what it does very well. A lot of people say the story is bad, but the story really isn't all that important in this game. It's about racing, and I feel like the story is just there to give you a reason to be racing.   I'd definitely recommend this game if you're looking for time to kill. It's no masterpiece, but it can be a lot of fun.
1307	1	a	Fix physics But the game is very good
1309	1	a	dull &amp;boring but enjoyable car racing game. predictable plot, not a whole lot that's original, races are very easy 2win on the 1st try. cops don't do much other than bang on your car and yell at you, and after a while they sort of fade away on their own. the game lets you instantly jump to the closest race, which i think provides a good incentive to make it through race after race.
1311	1	a	One of the best game from NFS series, from my point of view. Iis in Top3 NFS games, after NFS Most Wanted 2005 (no.1) and NFS The Run (no.2).
1313	1	a	Im going to start off by saying yes it is an old need for speed game but it's graphics are good even stannding up today and it makes me keep playing the game but lets get to the gameplay  The gameplay can be slow at times but the game makes up for it through all the type off things/races you can do. You could go from going to escaping the cops to a highway battle to making your car better and it goes on and on. The cars are even cool to look at even when not fully customized the graphics on high makes everything better.  The graphics are amazing. I know the last good new graphic was advanced warfare on the ps4 but graphics cant make up for gameplay but the graphics here are good even to me. Say you played advanced warfare then played this game on all high and you would say wow because it stands out for a racing game which is amazing but if your thinking to buy this for $5.00 do it. It's worth it in the long run
1315	1	a	This game I played many times over very fun!
1317	1	a	Great game
1319	1	a	Those other people dont know what they are talking about. I believe that the developers at EA and BlackBox have outdone themselves once again to bring enjoyment to the racing game scene. I understand there are other racing sims out there but none like the Need For Speed Franchise. I have owned every version since the beginning of the franchise. I own it for both PC and PS3. EA and everyone else that was involved in the making of the game... keep doing what you do best and that is making the Need For Speed franchise better and better every year
1321	1	a	it is a nice need for speed game even though it's a bit old
1323	1	a	*Plays this game*  -Be an undercover cop who pretending to become street racer  -Still gets chased by police   10/10
1325	1	a	The best than Need for Speed Most Wanted 2005.
1327	1	a	Great racing game! Does the need for speed series justice. Great vehicles and graphics are nice. Great selections of vehlicles and customizations. The storyline is pretty good but can be pretty boring at times kinda a storyline you would expect out of a need for speed game very similar to others. I would give it a 7/10 rating a good racing game for the racing game lovers out there a must buy for them.
1329	1	a	Best swaying car similation, would crash into any AI car again, 10/10,
1331	1	a	*Plays this game*  -Be an undercover cop who pretending to become street racer  -Still gets chased by police   10/10
1333	1	a	This is a good game and would highly recomend to anyone the likes the need for speed franchise.
1335	1	a	Amazing game. Love it so much. The graphics are bad but it was made in 2008. Gotta give it credit for being great~ 
1337	1	a	I love this game, and all of the other Need For Speed games. The only issue with this game is the controller support can be screwey at times, specifically with a playstation style controller.
1339	1	a	I like the way closing the game under Task Manager.
1341	1	a	Multi-player is good :D recomend buy
1343	1	a	Love it, not like the bullsh*t that criterion games gave us in 2012, controls are good and comftoble as long as you adjust them, and the pyhsics are acceptable, good range of car and custumisation, it will work on windows 8.1 (mine) and windows 10, also on almot anything older than 7. I rate it a 7/10, but amazing price for value. would reccoment to any petrolhead or a person wanting to relive the nostalgia from need for speed most wanted 2005 or nfsu2.
1345	1	a	Definitely one of my favorite games from the NFS Series. A lot of cop chases and races. Great story. Great graphics. 'You are not good and you are not bad. You blend and you listen and you don't trust anyone. Once you go undercover you are on your own.'
1347	1	a	One of the best Need For Speed games ever made.
1349	1	a	super fun, too easy tho ... i though old games were harder ...
1351	1	a	You should buy it if it is on sale. not full price. I liked the story line. I played this game on PS3. It was my first NFS Game on my PS3. and grafics arent bad. When i played it on my PS3, i was kist 8-10 so i didnt understand a thing. Lol. Alot of good and old cars like Dodge Charger R/T(1970) and SRT-8 and Dodge Challenger. Nissan skyline, BMW, Porsche, Lamborghini and much more. You can aslo customize your cars wich is my favorite! You can also customize your cars, which is my favorite! Good Sountracks too. It also was my first PS3 Game and i got the PS3 Early when it came out, still have the PS3 and the Stearing Wheel i used. Good times. 8/10 for being an old game and i played it at PS3 arround when it came out. had alot of fun in free roam :P
1353	1	a	I know it says I have little time played but I have plalyed it for a long time on the PS3(Not Anymore) But I figured I'd leave a review for the hell of it...  In the end I vote the game 8/10.  The story is cheesy and feels like almost no work is put into it, you see scenes with cops, handling stuff... Chase Linh shooting a guy... and some gangsters, but in the game play itself all you have is driving, most of what the player does doesn't feel connected to the scenes/story line.  My goal each time I have played was to complete the lame story ASAP to unlock the map, tracks, cars, etc..  Those are the best aspects of the game. You get all the good vinyl cusomiztions from older games like NFS Carbon. You get an extensive car list, featuring EU, Japan, and American models.  The track and world is the largest map(I have seen in a NFS Title) - and I've played every NFS since HP II on PS2.   You have your standard freeroam, and cop chases like the old Carbon and Most Wanted did.  There is a huge selection of tracks and game modes, like High Way Battle where you struggle to gain 1000 feet ahead of the other car, while avoiding HUGE levels of traffic(comparing traffic to other NFS games).   My personal favorite track is 'East I-85' its the best track for me because it's an all interstate course, and you can really test the handling and top speed of cars.   Next I will discuss the handling and driving, it is not bad, it is different from other NFS games.  You can do more realistic moves with your cars than in other games, but some times the handling is overkill, put max parts on a high end car, you can catch yourself turning, then snapping into an object as if the object were attracting you.   It's easier to drive if you don't hold it left or right for too long, or use nos while turning.   Next I will discuss the glitches, there is lots of them. I've plalyed online matches where players could, on some tracks, exploit the driving engine and launch over clear barriers(and basically access a online-like freeroam)  There is also this god-awful(but halarious) falling glitch, where you begin a race and upon starting you fall in the ground, stuck at 460mph(rounded that up), and the car doesn't reset. This glitch happens randomly and you basically have to wait to loe or quit :P  There is other glitches... I turned too hard eon time using the Audi R8?(Le Mans?, forgot) and hit an object, bounced several hundred meters in the air doing almost endless flips.   You can also reset your car during freeroam and quickly drive inside a civilian car before your car becomes solid, then pause, swap cars, and you can twitch, flip, and do odd stunts involving yourself and your little civilian :D I made a semi truck literally bounce away doing that one.   The glitches are fun, helps make up for the bad textures and story.  Yeah the sky textures, and ground textures aren't great. The ground almost seems yellow, yellow concrete... ew. The car details are great, and that's probably the best part.   Then we have the music. It's what you expect from any EA game, you get a random list of songs(that were popular when what ever game was released). Rock, Rap, and some Techno stuff, similar to MW 05 song list and Burnout 3.  8/10 game, would launch the semi again.  
1355	1	a	An awesome delivery of the need for speed sand lot experience.
1357	1	a	My favorite racing game ever! The graphics aren't as good as newer ones, but the gameplay, and overall feel fo the game are great. also the custimization if fun... buy it!
1359	1	a	Honestly, just finish the game offline and refund it
1361	1	a	I am getting more into this game :)
1363	1	a	Good game, very arcadeish but cool racer, good story and the hottie Maggy Q stars in the story. Still my favorite NFS has been Most Wanted, too bad it didnt make its way to steam to have a digital copy.
1365	1	a	you can go pretty fast so its good
1367	1	a	A classic but very good game!
1369	1	a	This is a great game if you love racers. There are tons of cars and lots of customizable parts. The story line is really cool and the races are intense. Beating the storyline takes about 15 hours and 100% completing the game may take around 24 hours. It is an incredible and cheap racing game and you should definitely get it.
1371	1	a	The best NFS for me! And awesome soundtrack
1373	1	a	I really don't understanf why people say that this game sucks
1375	1	a	hd mode... more details and modes on wii but i like it good drift and annoying cops lots of replay wish could network play still oh well
1377	1	a	Well since NFS-world is full of malicious hacker wanna-be losers now... &amp; NFS-Shift is a melodrammaqueeen's loser SIM &amp; Hot Pursuit is lame &amp; plays more like a BAD burnout game then NFS I guess this is the ONLY decent NFS game ON steam. Unless you wanna play it online... then it's ruined by punkbuster.
1379	1	a	Great Bad-â™¥â™¥â™¥ racing game! smooth graphics! Great cars and chases! Definitly recomended!
1381	1	a	Let me get the elephant out of the room first, this game is what I would consider a 'REBOOT.' When a franchise is stale, it tries to relive the successes of yester-year (EX. Most Wanted (2005)) and sometimes it works, unfortunately for Undercover, the sales at launch say it was too late. Carbon had at least a 7 million unit sales DECREASE! Then ProStreet lost another 4 million unit sales at launch! Before you click away, this is NOT the same as bad, just for Undercover, it was a day late and a dollar short.  Gameplay:   The game tries to mesh ProStreet's engine, with Most Wanted's narrative format. This was an... INTERESTING result. We got control that was MILES better than ProStreet's, but still wasn't as great as Most Wanted (2005)'s. There are new modes such as highway battles and outruns. These do add some variety, but don't really feel, (to me), warranted. The car selection is the best of the series. We got your typical street cars like your RX-8's and Camaro's, but then you got LFA's and Pagani's, holy ****,. that is awesome!  Graphics:  This is to me, the game's key strength. The shaders look real, and the textures look superb. The car modeling and damage are so fun to see your hood fly right off your car and fly away to no man's land.   Music:  Eww, I know most people bash on this, but to me this seems like a sign of how the times can change over the course of 4-8 years. Where'd did the good jams go?  Verdict:  Yes, this game has some issues, plenty. But most are not game breaking and this game gets too much hate despite no one knowing how tight this game's development was. EA Black Box/EA Canada was split in 2007. one team made ProStreet, the other made Undercover. Knowing what they accomplsihed with only half the team makes me want to give this game 4.5 stars, but I can't. It tries to be Most Wanted 2.0, but fails in terms of gameplay design and music choices. I can only give this a 5/10, which is not a bad score, in fact, five is a middle ground. It's the most subjective score I can give it.

1383	1	a	just a basic NFS
1385	1	a	This was AWESOME!!! Beat the game in under a day FTW.
1387	1	a	it is an great game and actually I love all of the 'need for speed' games they are great!
1389	1	a	very very good game,and nfs is so best
1391	1	a	EA's Need for Speed franchise has been in an odd position the last couple years. While the franchise often worked to mix up the formula from year to year a decent bit, the release of EA's own Burnout Paradise posed a bit of a conundrum for the publisher. With Burnout switching to an open world setting, it meant that it competed directly with Need for Speed in that space. Last year's Need for Speed ProStreet was a diversion for the series from recent years, going to track-based racing, plenty of tuning options and focusing entirely on the events than exploring the city or running from the cops. ProStreet didn't turn out too well, so Black Box went back to the drawing board and returned to an open world setting with this year's Need for Speed Undercover, but that wasn't the only design change. Undercover also seems to be directed right at the casual market, both in terms of presentation and its extremely relaxed learning curve.

1395	1	a	This game is awesome!!!! But too bad nobody plays it now :(  Add me if u wanna play an online racing with me :D
1397	1	a	This game is great!
1399	1	a	Help, i cant run it at this pc with Windows 7, AMD Phenom II X4 955, GTS 250 and 8GB RAM
1401	1	a	this game is awesome and if you can get it a at a cheap price and get a friend to buy it as well its a blast to play still not as good as most wanted 05 though (still wondering why that game is not on steam)
1403	1	a	too fast tÃ´ furius it like the version of the movie
1405	1	a	Doesn't quite live up to the original NFS: Most Wanted, but a decent game nonetheless.
1407	1	a	old game but if run on max settings has reasonably okay graphics. cutscenes are a bit lame though but all in all good game
1409	1	a	looks like a good game if it would stop crashing in the first play sequence.
1411	1	a	A very cautious recommendation  A mix of fun and frustration can be found with this game that feels like a direct sequel to most wanted.   Pros: Arcade style action racing A large variety of cars and locations Battling cops is a rush Game has a great sense of progression with new cars and upgrades  Cons:  Game frequently presents races that are beyond your current cars ability Spike strips are instant game over (and of course the cops are immune to them) Cut scenes are super cheesy &amp; overall plot is subpar Experiencing all the cars will take multiple playthroughs  I enjoyed and would recommend, but dont expect something extraordinary
1413	1	a	Of course it's not on same level as NFS MW, but still not so bad.  Better watch gameplay in youtube or buy it during sales if you're not sure.
1415	1	a	still a good game, workes great on pc.
1417	1	a	remove the yellow filter and you have a good game.
1419	1	a	need for speed for life man
1421	1	a	very fun i could play it all day
1423	1	a	perfect game :D
1425	1	a	Very much race, such classic customization! Love the garage and brings back nfs Underground Memories&lt;3
1427	1	a	Wait, wasn't there a storyline? Oh, right! 'Storyline'! Haha!
1429	1	a	Ok, for car racing lovers.
1431	1	a	NEED FOR SPEED BEST GAMES EVER! 9/10 The Online is dead
1433	1	a	i love the game its the best
1435	1	a	The best/worst racing game ever, it's so bad, it's addicting!
1437	1	a	COME ON , LET'S PARTY !
1439	1	a	Best of the Need for Speed series. I love everything about this game. The music, the sounds, the gameplay.
1441	1	a	Fun game, If you are looking for a game with decent graphics, plenty of car customization and fast paced action, this is a good game for you. However, if you are looking for a modern game, you should probably look at a newer title, the newer need for speed game have much more to offer.
1443	1	a	Good old school Need for speed love the game!!
1445	1	a	one of the best racing games ever
1447	1	a	This game is one of the worst titles in the series. The storyline is okay, but gets boring quickly. The graphics are barely any better compared to Most Wanted and Carbon, but there is no guarantee the game will run smoothly.
1449	1	a	BEST GAME I EVER PLAYED IN FIRST IT WAS LOW GRAPHICS BUT THEN IT STARTED TO WORK FINE
1451	1	a	The Best Game from NFS series..
1453	1	a	this game game sucks â™¥â™¥â™¥ waste of money. i have a new computer and the wheels dont even show up it looks like cars that float. the map is not 'need for speed' this is a terrible game. i want my money back
1455	1	a	I love cause I use to own this game I wasn't allow to customize and now I can. I feel lik its a Need for Speed. Cars to get Tier 4: Lotus Elise Tier 3: Nissan Skyline GTR-R34 Tier 2: Lamborghini Gallardo LP-540 Tier 1: Bugatti Veryon or Mclearn F1 Trust me these cars work out for me and I hope you guys have fun.  Ps: I'm great at Need for Speed so I help you out if you need it through videos I will make.
1457	1	a	The police chases are the best part of this game. I suggest downloading a save game and then simply getting into cop chases. It's where the game shines for sure
1459	1	a	Very good fun with friends. plus manual gears :P 9/10
1461	1	a	If all you're looking for is a racing game, this one is great. Graphics are good, different types of missions are amusing, cinematics are with real actors, but with some swagger filters. Only problem is the lack of support for 16:10 monitor resolutions
1463	1	a	It's not too bad, people who are expecting something like Most Wanted or Carbon would have been disapointed when it came out i guess. Plus it had a fair share of performance issues. For what it is, it's not that bad of a Need for Speed game but just a few pointers:  -Challenge Series is not available for Steam edition. But minor loss. It doesn't impact the main career mode at all. -While the Origin verison comes with the Challenge Series, the Origin version is horribly unoptimised. No matter what the Origin version will run at a significantly lower frame rate than the Steam version, no matter the settings. Not sure why, but it just is. A few threads on the internet from long ago mentioned the EA Download Manager (now Origin version) had performance issues, so it's a semi known issue.  -Setting affinity to a single core or just two cores can help smooth frame rate a little, but difference is minimal. Game runs fairly well on todays hardware, not as well as it should but it's playable for sure.
1465	1	a	Not the best game of the series but definitely not the worst either.  A real nice arcade-styled racing game with decent costumization for some fun hours!
1467	1	a	Not the best work fro EA games. But its an ok game.
1469	1	a	For an old-gen or current-gen game, I am very impressed with the port and the graphics. The graphics make the game seem a bit realistic, the game has beautiful scenery, and its fun racing or getting chased.  9.3/10 - Would High-speed to avoid arrest anytime (well, in the game)
1471	1	a	Need for Speed undercover the game that ign does not like but i love, and guess what its in HD. but it was made in 2008, the game in my opinion gave me three things I wanted, money, Cars to waste my money on, and infinite combinations. Its all about the winning the races and making a car that can get a 0 - 60 in 5 seconds while plowing through police cars. That being said, the story seems good till you play and in the end youl forget it, but thats not bad, its not good either. But today the racing games have you driving stock cars with nitros installed, so I can't complain.
1473	1	a	The story is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ but you knew that. Cars go vroom, cops go woop woop, It's not bad.
1475	1	a	its an older game but still very advanced for the time
1477	1	a	very good racing game
1479	1	a	Honestly, this is probably one my favorite games of all time. The graphics are fairly decent for the time, there is a good amount of cars, and for once, it's a NFS game with a partially decent storyline. I don't know why I love this game, I just do. The only problem I have is that gamepad support is abysmal. The sheer force of my thumb lying on top of the Joystick is enough to make the car always lean left. Also the AI is awful.  TL:DR Pick it up on sale if you are afraid of a bad game, don't expect perfection. 9/10
1481	1	a	Jeers: -Bad A.I. - A weird mix of rubberband and non-rubberband A.I, can be really unfair at the times. -Story was abit off - Could have gotten into more deeply into the undercover scene with twists in the plot along with a clear drawn story line on it.  -Cop A.I. doesn't catch other racers or give a flying â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on the matter. (and sometimes doesnt even notice you pass by at 160kmh) -Some of the music choices arent really that great(,but there are some that are quite alright.) -First impressions of the driving controls I had, coming from the older need for speed games on pc, were awful. (But I got used to it.) -My version had occasionally civilian cars spawning from the sky and sometimes in the in-game cutscenes, the car's bodies were invisible. -Steering wheel support? You can dream about that.  Cheers: +Cop A.I. itself seems to be more agressive, more willing and more realistic than the previous need for speed games. +They carried over the most aspects from need from speed ProStreet in regards of tuning (though I would had wished for total exact experience ripped out from ProStreet, 3 Engine tuning stages etc, Is simply not enough) +Get a top tier level car and it feels like a god damn spaceship, sort of fast. +Gameplay itself seems solid, along with the graphics seem to be, well... as good as 2008 EA can put out. +Large map full of all kinds of roads  Overall:  Its quite fun game, would recommend if you would like some fast paced adrenaline rushes (although for that, I'd more likely recommend the ''Shift'' - series) with â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing some cops up. Also you get a girrrrrlllll in this game too as your waifu, as was seen in the same way in Most Wanted and in Carbon, but that's besides the point. Basicly its a trainwreck, but that doesnt mean trainwrecks cant be fun.   I give it a 7.2/10 
1483	1	a	i bought this thinking it was need for speed most wanted which i was unable to finish because my friend borrowed the game and i didnt ask for it back for like a couple years. its okay but i already won this one.
1485	1	a	I've not experienced a title as interesting as this within Need for Speed for a long time. Where do I even begin? The endless flaws and general glitchy gameplay? The hidden charm?  Let's start with the positives first:  + The smoke seems as good a place to start as any. It is gorgeous! In ProStreet, EA BlackBox (the developer) gave the tire smoke a new look and it was stunning as it wrapped around the tires in a drag race. It is the same here, with the smoke seemingly blurring your car amidst it. It even changes to brown if you're driving on dirt!  + Car selection is slightly more positive than negative I'd say. 54 cars in total with a great variety of muscle, exotic and tuner. There are no SUVs but I will never care again if they forget about SUVs entirely. They were terrible in Underground 2 lol. Each car can be upgraded (albeit with not a lot to choose from) both performance and aesthetic wise.  + Core mechanics. What I mean is the underlying gameplay, where you find the genuine fun of NFS Undercover. If you look at Undercover at the surface, you'll find something drasticly wrong with it. But scratch underneath that and you can see EA Black Box tried something a little different. The cars handle differently to any previous NFS before it, giving them an incredibly unrealistic but extremely fun feel! This is due to the 'Heroic Driving Engine'. It certainly gives the cars a slidy feel, but it's not to the point of feeling like you're driving on ice. You can do doughnuts easily, and then suddenly pull away. You can be driving at over 150 MPH and then suddenly veer off round a corner going nearly the same speed. You can pull off J-turns like nothing at all. It offers the chance to drive easily but with some flair.  + Graphical tuning. Undercover actually offers a pretty nice list of graphical fine-tuning for you to choose from. From anti-aliasing to texture filtering, adjusting the car detail to world detail, it provides some good things for you to match the game to what your computer is capable of.  + Photo Mode. I love taking photos of my cars! I've taken advantage of 'Photo Mode' in every racing game, not just NFS however. So an inclusion in this title is no different! The graphics are... average... but they provide enough for some sweet photos.  OK, I have to admit this is where the positives end.... erm... yeah, so on to the negatives I suppose.  - The AI is the most FRUSTRATING, BROKEN, IDIOTIC and UNDECISIVE piece of CRAP. I have never felt so angered than I have playing Undercover. Let's start with the traffic: what traffic?! If you're driving along on your own, or in a race, it doesn't matter because the world is dead apparently. Every so often it will breathe life into a race with a car or two, but that's it. The ONLY time you'll find a busy stretch of road is during a Highway Battle. That's it. When you're in a Circuit Race, the civilian cars will randomly drive THROUGH the barriers and suddenly smash into you as they come out, or they'll drive into the barrier and get in your damn way as they turn off! When they're changing lanes, I kid you not, they LOVE to do it when you're about to pass them! They'll suddenly veer off to be in front of you, and completely screw you up! I have even found them to turn a corner and actually come off of the road... for NO viable reason. They just swerve suddenly and come off the road. It's so broken it's hilarious. And they randomly crash too! I drive over hills or around a corner, and I find a small pile up of cars, or cars that have somehow crashed into the wall... As for the bloody racers? They're just as bad. RUBBER BANDING. Why the HELL is EA still allowing this kind of crap? You had rubber banding in UNDERGROUND 1! And that is 11 years old! I could be scraping the rear end of an opponent, I make them hit a wall, I then use some Nitrous to get away, and the opponent is somehow matching my speed. I mean, how is that possible? I know NFS is not realistic in any sense of the word, but rubber banding takes the biscuit. I detest it.  - Unbalanced difficulty. I guess this just relates to the AI again, but I feel this needs its own category. In a Sprint Race for e.g. I would be so far ahead of the competition that I could not even see them on the map. I didn't need to even think about them at all. And for the most part it would be like that in most races. As soon as I crash because of the poorly designed AI traffic, or my car decides to skid off the track, within seconds the opponents are closing in extremely fast! And because of the rubber banding, they can suddenly keep up with me. It's a joke. In other races, I've been struggling to even keep up with the racers in 1st or 2nd. I had a Mazda RX-7 with 'Street' level tuning, and I struggled to keep up with a Nissan 240SX. It was endlessly overtaking then falling back again. Eventually I would win, but not without difficulty. And what about the cops? Man oh man are they strange. As soon as I slow down they go nuts! They smash into me like there is no tomorrow. But when I speed up they trail off, leaving me to wreck the joint. One more thing: when I'm literally cruising along the street in my car, and I cruise past the Police, they suddenly go after me, claiming I'm speeding or whatever. It's useless and this just proves how messed up the AI is.  - Useless display of points. I'm not sure if I'm missing something, but when you perform tricks etc. you seem to rack up 'points' for lack of a better word. They add up, but they add up to nothing. And I can't seem to figure out why there are points in the first place. There is no tactical advantage, no bonus, no unlocks for gaining a certain amount of points. It's the same when you smash a fence or hit a car and you see some money pop up for the damage. I understand you causing the 'State' money during a pursuit, but whilst cruising in free roam? What's the point in even having either come up?  - Unbalanced tuning. Let me put it this way: My Mazda RX-7 with 'Street' level tuning could OUTRUN a LAMBORGHINI. Lamborghini, do you even tune brah?  - Most pointless story I have ever come across! Again, let me put it this way: You're a typical nameless nobody with no voice or face. You are an undercover police officer trying to worm your way in to a drug-smuggling ring of 'thugs' (EA's terminlogy, not mine). It literally takes ONE race respectively to impress the top guys and you're suddely their new favourite pet lmao. And before you know it, within a couple of missions, you're already taking them all down by smashing their car's into a thousand pieces. Story writing at its utter worst.  - Also the shortest story ever. You'll complete it I'd say in 5 - 6 hours at best. If you put in maximum effort, I'd say possibly under 5 hours. What a joke.  Look, I could go on and on and on and on with this review, but the truth is, there are SO MANY NEGATIVES and things wrong with this title that I would never be able to recommend it.  After everything however, I can honestly say it has heart. This is a game aimed at the most casual audience possible. This would be enjoyed by young teenagers and children. But I'm 23 years old (today lol it's my birthday!) and I want a game waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay more polished and fleshed out than this. There is some fun to be had with the driving thanks to the 'H.D.E.' and it will offer something to do for a few hours, but this will quickly dissolve into boredom. EA's more recent efforts with Hot Pursuit 2010, Most Wanted 2012 (despite what people say, it's a great game) and even Rivals (amazing first effort from Ghost Games!) is enough to keep you coming back. I'm not surprised EA Black Box was wiped away as even EA stated that they were being overworked. Here's to 2015, and hoping that two years worth of development time can give us the Need for Speed we've all been waiting for.  VERDICT: The police busted me for driving slower than the traffic. 5/10
1487	1	a	Good fun, like all the NFS games - and a storyline to follow too!
1489	1	a	Pro - Race through beautiful Florida streets with nifty new events, cop chases and free roam Con - Nothing will ever surpass Most Wanted 2005
1491	1	a	It isn't Underground 2 or Most Wanted (2005), but it's better than the garbage that's still released nowadays. In my opinion, this is the last good NFS game to have ever been made so far. And for $10 to get a pretty damn good racing experience, I say get it if you don't already.
1493	1	a	Do you like speeding recklessly through highways and interstates while making sweet 360's to get away for the (sometimes utterly stupid) police?  4.5/5 stars.
1495	1	a	There is a ramp to a rooftop that cops can't get to. Lose any wanted level by sitting a few feet above the police  10/10
1497	1	a	Fantastic! I prefer this game on other Need For Speed like Hot Pursuit and Shift.
1499	1	a	Definately one of the best NFS games that has been released. This game although the graphics are simple provides the perfect storyline and the perfect gameplay for anyone. Even if your computer is not very good for most games this game has low specs so that almost any computer would run it. NFS Undercover runs with no lag and offers accurate versions of cars and what is most to love by any car enthusiast is that it includes the almighty 1969 Shelby GT500 and also includes the other great cars like the classic Dodge Charger. This game is perfect from head to toe and is a no brainer to purchase. 10/10
1501	1	a	PLUS  Very Arcade - for me thatÂ´s fun. You can use your keyboard or a controller - both works very well.  Clean graphics.  Nice Soundtrack. Gives you a feeling of speed - you seem to flow.  They use real persons as actors - gives the whole the right cheesy feeling.     MINUS:   The pictures on STEAM are quite misleading - thereÂ´s no blur at all.  No damage model nor do you take any damage - although you can also crash - but  either you go frontal into a pillar of concrete or you only are informed of it.  Not much to do. Story is predictable. You infiltrate the racing scene as a cop in order to catch some car thieves.
1503	1	a	amazing , one of the best Need for Speed games made
1505	1	a	Not the best work fro EA games. But its an ok game.
1507	1	a	This is the last good Need for Speed game. Runs fine at 60fps and is totally playable. RIP NFS franchise.
1509	1	a	If you like your racing games to have even the slightest realism to it, skip this. This is a traditional acrade racer. The cars all handle the same, like they are on rails. The graphics have aged badly, the soundtrack sucks and the acting is terrible. BUT, if you can get over all that underneath is a pretty fun arcade racer. If you are a fan of Rage Racer, Over Rev, Daytona USA or any of those style games, be sure to give this a go. Especially for the price, you can't go wrong.
1511	1	a	Great game, vary little lag for me. I can turn with no latency compared to nfs shift.
1513	1	a	it was very lag in win7,but it was fun
1515	1	a	Ok game. Good graphics and fun cop chases.
1517	1	a	A Need for Speed game, what else can I say? Love this racing franchise. :)
1519	1	a	For an old-gen or current-gen game, I am very impressed with the port and the graphics. The graphics make the game seem a bit realistic, the game has beautiful scenery, and its fun racing or getting chased.  9.3/10 - Would High-speed to avoid arrest anytime (well, in the game)
1521	1	a	its ok. after this the NFS series went downhill.
1523	1	a	The nostalgia is very real.
1525	1	a	I have realy enjoyed this game then again ive liked all the need for speed games and if you want to go fast in a safe enviroment then id recomend this game it is fun to play and not to hard for even newcomers so give it a go.
1527	1	a	It's more fun than I had on the ps3 years and years back... but it's not that good actually. I seem to have really bad lag for no reason. I'll run Driver San Fransisco on High res, high quality without ANY lag and this is just wow horrible for no reason. It looks like crap and it runs like crap. But... it's still fun. That's why I'm still recommending it, buy it on sale, couple of bucks, why not? But what I don't get is why the worst NFS's are on Steam? Where's Most Wanted, Underground 2, etc. I mean this one is alright but it doesn't look or feel anything like the better ones. It's still fun though.
1529	1	a	Become an undercover cop that wants all other cops to crash and somehow survive
1531	1	a	Pretty good just dont understand why slr is tear 2
1533	1	a	Do you like speeding recklessly through highways and interstates while making sweet 360's to get away for the (sometimes utterly stupid) police?  4.5/5 stars.
1535	1	a	its ok. after this the NFS series went downhill.
1537	1	a	Like the other people said itÂ´s not Underground 2 or Most Wanted, but I still like this game as well.   Gameplay any good and does it work well? Nice BMWÂ´s.. The gameplay is REALLY smoother on the pc than on the PS3, works on my win7 home premium 64 bit. The steering is really nice on my rumblepad reacts instantly, works well on widescreen, got all settings maxed out and still works smooth. Autosculpting is really nice with my rumblepad 2, works a whole lot better than the mouse.  What I do not like: Cops, so many cops.. it's almost like they are doing a parade in the game.  Gaming gear used: Logitech Rumblepad 2 corded.  Bugs: Had no startup issues playing the game. Few crashes like pc freezes were a common occurrence it seemed until I bought a different pc. Had one bug at the transporter mission, crashed to windows. If you get this just drive to the race and activate it.  Note: If your videocard is going nuts then try vsync in options, helps to calm it down alot. This happens even when you have a really good graphicscard.  Recommend it? Yes, the cars sound so good in this game.. I can almost smell the fumes playing it.
1539	1	a	amazing game, have a lot of fun with it, but ea is tricking you with those pictures
1541	1	a	This has been my favourite car game since i first played it a looong time ago :)
1543	1	a	I had a great time with it.
1545	1	a	This is the newest good open world Need for Speed game. None of the open world games after this are any good. (In my opinion).   Pros: You can customize, tune and upgrade very well The soundtrack is amazing The story is good No DLC  Cons: The graphics are old You have to kill all of your friends There are a lot of cars they should have had in the game You can't have neon lights under your car It's made by EA :(
1547	1	a	One of the better games in the NFS series, good storyline and nice to have free roam of the map rather than having to follow a specific route to get to the finish line.
1549	1	a	This is a Action Racing Game with Great Plot/Story Line Great Effects And COOl Cars This game is highly recommanded it has mystery, Action, Comedy And COPS So Race Like hell And Make A mess In This gAME
1551	1	a	Graphics are decent. Controls are awesome. ( your car at the start may seem it's too sensitive, but you get better ones around the 20-35min. mark after doing some the story line races )  You are an undercover cop, desgized as a street car racer. Your mission is to bust the thieves and crime lords ( ones selling the cars )  Enjoyable game if you want to kill off an hour or so.  7.5/10
1553	1	a	I absolutely LOVE this game! The racing, at least for me, has the best overall performance for a keyboard-driven racer. The acceleration, the handling are superb, and crashing into the side of the road or wiping out is not a deterrent to continuing the race. In fact, the overall handling and performance is so good, I have to look at all the other racers I've bought through Steam with some disdain. For this game, which seemed lukewarm in reviews, to completely outshine games better reviewed, more expensive, even flashier racers, makes me re-think racing games. Most of all, in regard to this game, is the crazy amounts of FUN I find myself having...racing on crowded streets (or mildly crowded...you can decide this) and being chased by the police with a realistic feel and the rush that comes with it is astounding, and the fact I can continue the race or chase even when I hit a pole or other car or even spin out of control makes me look at all other racers differently. I bought this on sale, and have rarely been happier with a purchase. I'd pay full price for this, especially when it's priced lower than other NFS titles. But it's all about NFS for me, from now on! AMAZING value, AMAZING capability with a keyboard. I just wish Steam would pick up the NFS Most Wanted line-up and DLC's. I did get Hot Pursuit because of this game, and it's really good...but the handling is best with Undercover.
1555	1	a	7 out of 10  Go under cover to take down some crooked street racing types.  A very good racing game. Its not the best racing game ever but by far not the worst.  The Good:  1. Good racing action.  2. As with all Need For Speed titles this one has a solid sound track.   The Bad:  3. A bit repetitive. Well its all about street racing isn't it?  4. Its not a new games which shows, but the action makes up for it. 5. A very limited choice of cars.   The Ugly:  6. Some of the cars you are forced to go on mission with are down right pathetic.  7. Some of the latter optional races are near impossible. You can still complete the main story without winning these races.   If you are looking for some enjoyable racing action look no further.
1557	1	a	Good fun, like all the NFS games - and a storyline to follow too!
1559	1	a	good game but its no nfs most wated old school edition
1561	1	a	I find it fun You feel amazing when your running from cops and you know something down and then find more on you. I love trying to drift and I love when you lose control it feels amazing I like it but yea the scenenry is kinda dull
1563	1	a	One of my favorite Racing Games, A must Buy!
1565	1	a	Fun game, the car customization is not so wide, but that did not bother me for this game, it was not really needed to be honest.
1567	1	a	'I must say ive always liked the nfs games and this one really brought movie action themed racing to you hands for a newb to racing games on the pc the controls were very simple to get used to' I give it a rating of 7.9
1569	1	a	I got it on sale for $2.49 and I played it on xbox and I loved it (but then it wasn't working not sure why) so I got it on pc 9.7/10 love it but if you look at it on lowest it looks awfull luckly I can run it on almost max and it looks great I think it is a amazing game and if you don't like racing games then idc what you think of it I love it one of the best need for speed games out there (well atleast i think its one of the best NFS games)
1571	1	a	Losing the cops once you've captured more than the tiniest bit of their attention is the most impossible thing. Ironically, you yourself play as a cop.
1573	1	a	9.4/10
1575	1	a	same old need for speed.. excellent as always
1577	1	a	I got it on sale for $2.49 and I played it on xbox and I loved it (but then it wasn't working not sure why) so I got it on pc 9.7/10 love it but if you look at it on lowest it looks awfull luckly I can run it on almost max and it looks great I think it is a amazing game and if you don't like racing games then idc what you think of it I love it one of the best need for speed games out there (well atleast i think its one of the best NFS games)
1579	1	a	Its a very good game especially on highest settings but only has 10-15 hours of gameplay. It is a 7/10 on challening my racing skills.
1581	1	a	This is a Action Racing Game with Great Plot/Story Line Great Effects And COOl Cars This game is highly recommanded it has mystery, Action, Comedy And COPS So Race Like hell And Make A mess In This gAME
1583	1	a	The Need for Speed trillogy has been an all time favourite for me ever since most wanted to Undercover, This game has shown a great deal of what it would be like to move throught the streets with a great deal of speed.   I personally recommend this game but if you dont like racing games or have the patience for it this isnt the game for you.
1585	1	a	it good game bet game alll
1587	1	a	Awesome game love the graphics and story.
1589	1	a	i love this game but whenever i play it, it quits on me after 20 mins... why???
1591	1	a	This is a fun and mentally challenging game. Well worth what it's worth!
1593	1	a	For so far that i like this game (Ofcourse it is, its a blackbox production) but i dont like the music theme its a bit, how i say it.. let me just say the music sucks.. more hip hop! 
1595	1	a	If anybody wants to play with me in 'Online mode' make sure you have EA account and add me if you do! lets play together!
1597	1	a	I honestly enjoy this game a good bit, as this was my first time playing it in like 3 years.  Some people seem to dislike it, but I myself find NFS: Undercover to be quite fun. Great for passing the time when you are bored. I'm making great progress in the story mode, it's not too easy, but it's not too hard either.  I'd personally recommend it, it's a good racing game with a pretty interesting storyline.
1599	1	a	My favorite Racing game of all time.
1601	1	a	One of my favorite arcade racing games. It has pretty bad graphics even for a 2008 game, it's quite buggy, it has a crappy menu system and poor controller support, and also has unskippable live-action cutscenes that fail to convey anything even resembling a story. However, it has just the right amount of customization, the cars are very fun to drive no matter if it's a Tier 1 or Tier 4 car. The game world is diverse for driving, though again, not in apperance. There's winding country roads, city areas, and long highways where you can take your car all the way to the top of its abilities. 252mph seems to be the speed limit in this game, with a fully upgraded Bugatti Veyron. The police system is just a tad too unforgiving, but it's relatively simple and it is a very, very easy game to learn and quite difficult to master. The game is oftentimes too simple in the beginning no matter what car you choose, but if you choose the wrong car later in the game, you'll have a hard time beating the game. Highly recommended considering its base price on Steam is $10. One playthrough will last almost 20 hours.

1605	1	a	i'm going to finish it with the 240sx
1607	1	a	Always been a fan of the Need for Speed series. I'ts a shame the last few games are not that good as there previous ones, i really like this game i would recommend it definitely!! graphics are not that out dated if you set that at the highest as you can get. story is good aswell, like the cars and that they are subcatogorized in the shop by the country the are from.
1609	1	a	Not the best game of the series but definitely not the worst either.  A real nice arcade-styled racing game with decent costumization for some fun hours!
1611	1	a	Typical NFS.......
1613	1	a	After all those races I won and all of those criminals I shut down... I'll still never be able to repay the damages I caused to the city.
1615	1	a	Need for Speed undercover the game that ign does not like but i love, and guess what its in HD. but it was made in 2008, the game in my opinion gave me three things I wanted, money, Cars to waste my money on, and infinite combinations. Its all about the winning the races and making a car that can get a 0 - 60 in 5 seconds while plowing through police cars. That being said, the story seems good till you play and in the end youl forget it, but thats not bad, its not good either. But today the racing games have you driving stock cars with nitros installed, so I can't complain.

1619	1	a	NFS Undercover is a classic game with a large collection of tuners, classic muscle, and exotics. The Graphics may be outdated .
1621	1	a	Fun game :D - Doing this for badge.  Cops are a bi**h though
1623	1	a	Better than Carbon, not as good as Most Wanted, still a very fun game.
1625	1	a	i have a laptop and it runs with the settings at high or medium plus its very fun though confusing at times
1627	1	a	doesn't work for me in multiplayer mode I join the acc but throws reason CD key do something that operates here need some aktyvation code
1629	1	a	10/10 would resolution again
1631	1	a	Good game overall. A decent departure from the typical racing game.
1633	1	a	uh this game is uh pretty uh good uh the cops uh are uh kind of uh annoying uh yeah
1635	1	a	AweSoMe car game!
1637	1	a	TFW the cops are more agressive and harded to evade than NFS 2015
1639	1	a	I have realy enjoyed this game then again ive liked all the need for speed games and if you want to go fast in a safe enviroment then id recomend this game it is fun to play and not to hard for even newcomers so give it a go.
1641	1	a	Good graphics, great story,perfect gaming style. 10/10.
1643	1	a	One of the better NFS games with quite good customization to each car, good selection of vehicles and quite large open world map. My only frustration was the last mission which was freakishly difficult to complete with all the nonsense of the enemy ai where i wasted hours just trying to finish it.
1645	1	a	too keep things short this is the best NFS that ive played that feels like it could represent NFS UnderGround 3 with all the customization and personally my favorite of the series, also i cant see why it was given such low reviews when theres more gameplay options and story then most of the newest NFS on the market.
1647	1	a	
1649	1	a	This game taught me that US police are hardcore.
1651	1	a	One of the best ''need for speed'' game. I really like it.
1653	1	a	this game is good, not bad, not great, just good.  its fun to customize cars, but cars, race around with the stiff driving controls, but thats it. the game has lots of flaws.  you dont go to spesific places to activeate events, you just press tab and the event starts, nomater where you are. races are way to easy (but the other peoples cars do look cool). it lacks a good tutorial  but buy it still. its worth it.
1655	1	a	Played the PS2 Version of this game 10/10. Got it on PC Complety Differnet. They remade the WHOLE game 10/10
1657	1	a	For so far that i like this game (Ofcourse it is, its a blackbox production) but i dont like the music theme its a bit, how i say it.. let me just say the music sucks.. more hip hop! 
1659	1	a	If anybody wants to play with me in 'Online mode' make sure you have EA account and add me if you do! lets play together!
1661	1	a	It is all nfs stands for, racing and police. the multiplayer has died already, shamefully, but the single player is still awesome. too bad i already finished it.
1663	1	a	This game is awesome I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this game to people who are fans of racing games or who love Need For Speed like me or for people who have not heard, seen, or played racing games I would also recommend this game to them aswell so yes deffenetly I would recommend this game ; )
1665	1	a	I've just experienced the Need for Speed
1667	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ play this game avoid it !!!
1669	1	a	This is a fun arcade racing game. Graphics may be somewhat dated, but it looks OK on maximum settings. Very blurry and cool, you can feel the speed, especially in first person view. Music is okay, too (not terrible enough to turn it off).  The game picked up my gamepad without problems, which is quite an achievement (I've got a cheap Chinese gamepad, and not many games support it out of the box).  Cons: - it requires fiddling to run on newer systems. I am playing this on a Windows 8 PC, needed to set compatibility to Win98, and then it started in a 640 by 480 resolution. This brings back memories. Of dinosaurs and cavemen.  - draw distance is meh, on maximum settings cars manage to pop out of thin air a bit, especially noticeable when driving on a straight highway.  Recommended if you like arcade racing with physics of Disney's 'Cars' cartoon. (This is neither a bad nor a good characteristic, the game not realistic by any stretch of imagination, but it's fun at the same time, so why not.)  You will hate it if you don't know how to set up compatibility, or if you expect it to be a driving simulator.   Update for Windows 10: compatibility is fixed, doesn't require fiddling anymore.
1671	1	a	  Highly addictive, not as beautiful and customizable as Burnout, but the controls are easier which makes it my go-to driving game whenever I feel like having a ride at 400 km/h !
1673	1	a	The graphic is amazing, the car selection is vast, &amp; the story fits. But it's too difficult for me.
1675	1	a	Need for speed undercover its one of the best need for speed games, it has one of the best gameplays in years, with a nice story it will have you having fun for hours,totally recommended for everyone who likes a good racing game.
1677	1	a	I used to play this back in the old days. Feels great to play it again. The only problem is just the game crashing after I customize my car.
1679	1	a	Sure this game doesnt follow the story of the original game in the Playstation version (not sure if it was on xbox or not), but the game still has the idea of taking down an illegal street racing crew. You the protagonsist, must venture and meet new friends and rivals as you tear up the fast streets and highways in a suped up car (gameplay progression of course). The car you start out with is your basic starter. A slow, but decent car with steady acceleration. As you play, you can get better cars like the wonderful Bugatti Veyron. The vehicles can go so fast you cannot control them (if you upgrade it that way).  The police are as typical as the police in the most well known game of Need For Speed Most Wanted (Early 2000's). The cars can be crashed into sending pieces flying off, and even using freeroam pursuit breakers to evade. Pursuit breakers are the objects around the map that allow you to smash and have the FEDS' vehicles be totaled.  Over all the game is fast paced and fun, and I really recommend you should play this game, (not to mention the crazy mods you can install on this game).
1681	1	a	This game would be great, as it was on the console, if they had ported it correctly. Quite a few notable glitches, one of which being the game has a chance to improperly close (it just goes into the background). I could list many others, but that's what a forum is for. For some reason (of which is beyond me), it was seen fit to lock the resolution to a 4:3 ratio, making the game look rather uncanny, to say the least, on any other monitor resolution. There isn't even an option in the game settings, that's just how it is. Needless to say, with all the changes they made to it, along with poorly optimizing the game for PC, this has to be one of the worst PC ports I've played in a while. The game is still fun to play, but it could have been far better than it had turned out.
1683	1	a	Nice old school game, brings so much memory.
1685	1	a	Pros, great NFS game, good selection of cars, mad nitro boosts, cant total car easily. Cons terrible performcance on PC, designed for console, terrible story and actors, repetative. Overall awesome game, play it now! You will hopefully shrug off the cons and enjoy the game for its fast paced racing.
1687	1	a	Very nice and fast game.i enjoyed it. i really liked all the mods and also the different characters. too bad there arent any players playing it because bots are too easy...
1689	1	a	Customization is pretty cool on this game, And pretty funny when playing with mates.
1691	1	a	A fun low-budget multi-player arcade racing game similar to Mario Kart.  Surprisingly, it features many game modes, which not always involve racing per se. The controls are arcade-ish and the power-ups are always fun to use against your peers: 'EAT DA LOVE BOTS FOOLS!! MWAHAHA&lt;3' (there's an achievement for this). Customizing your vehicle and avatar is enjoyable as well - just take a look at what people posted on the steam hub!  Unfortunately, they never added new content and the game is no longer supported by the developers. Although the game is moddable, it never really got any attention from the modscene.  Buy the 4-pack (during winter/summer sale, it usually goes for US$4) to play with your friends since most public servers are deserted nowadays.
1693	1	a	This is a very fun kart game with some very unique minigames. If you do like games like Mario Kart then this is a nice pick up. There are some weird physics with this game sometimes but it is very enjoyable and fun when playing with friends :)
723	0	a	Zero Gear is a cart combat multiplayer online party game. Its more than eight player racing, the maps have a variety of objectives such as three-on-three European and American football. There are battle modes such as using boxing gloves to knock other cars over the edge of a sumo ring into the abyss below. Other maps are skeeball and even a pachinko machine with your cars. Its a true party game for anyone that has seven other friends online with this budget game. The game does offer a four pack for the price of two, which is always incentive. If you have no friends, the real problem is that five years after its release, there is no one playing.  The game plays easy with an accelerator, a nitro boost, a mini jump for sharper turns. You can gain nitro by drafting behind other competitors or touching a floating dreidel. In fact almost touching it is good enough. The boost will put you at your top speed in an instant rather than slowly increasing speed or shooting you forward, so its just as useful to use the boost when you've got the minimum or maximum amount. In other words, just hold down that boost button. If you ever fall off a track or stray too far from the path, you can use a respawn button. There is optional full mouse camera support and even a free aim button so you can target another competitor.  Like all cart combat games you have weapons. In this case there are two buttons to use a weapon in front or behind you. Its shallow in term of weapon variety and you get them by driving through hovering boxes. There is a bubble shield, a boxing glove, a pink love robot that will follow and then hug on the nearest driver until it explodes. You can also get a mine to drop, and a tornado that will throw anyone caught in its winds. Ice blocks will freeze an enemy and send them gliding forward with no ability to turn. Even frozen in ice, their tires will spin, so that feels like an overlooked detail.  Perhaps the most context sensitive item to use is the spring that lets you jump. While the spring can be used to jump over things, I consider this to be more useful for doing backflips and barrel rolls to get more boost. When you're in the air with any jump, you have full tilt control of your vehicle.  If you're all alone you can play with bots, but victories feel hollow without a single player campaign or cup of any sort. You can setup quick matches and assign the fifteen events you want to play. With the quick matches its just you and three other bots playing the same even twice for whatever reason before you progress to the next map. You can always setup a more complex server, but it takes a bit longer.  In terms of customization, you have a lot to chose from. Your car, your gear, your helmet and your face wear. Everything is customization and adds a lot of silly character to the game to make you stand out from the pack online. You can be a hovering brain wearing a clown nose with blonde pig tails driving a boat car. A nice option is randomization, so you can end up with a pink squid wearing a moon helmet driving a bomb with spike tires. Speaking of spike tires, when you use them, you can tell if you let off the accelerator the tires stop completely even if you continue to move forward.  As for the tracks themselves, the races are all closed circuits with only two or three laps. The shortest course has eight laps, but it feels like a strict circle.The driving surfaces are needlessly wide so the focus is more on the weapons instead of the driving skill. Each course has a few ramps and jumps here and there. You'll even go down a bumpy ski slope, a wavy slide and a water slide. Each course is bright and colorful. Its all very appealing to the eyes to make that quick fun joy ride feeling.  There's a lot of creativity with the courses, a pool and water slide, driving on a billiard tapble that connects to an air hockey course. Even the standard race track circuit shows a lot of flair. The desert themed track has you racing outside and then through a crystal mine across wooden roads. The creativity and effort shows, but the thing that holds the design back in my eyes are the lack of hazards. There's a dirt stadium that could use some slowing mud. These wide tracks just need something else on them like a shallow river. The water park has a lot of water, but it has no affect on you even if the water slide can rotate you backward as you go down..  Then there are quirky events such as the basketball, American and European football events that have you trying to score a goal with a gigantic sports ball. While I like the idea, the practice of it in Zero Gear is lacking, its dull and imprecise. Speaking of dull, nothing can trump the tag chase event in terms of boredom. The tag chase has a timer where only one person's time increases. The one that fills their meter first wins the event. Well this takes forever, because everyone else's meter goes down. To make things interesting, the mode will change where the one that is it will decrease in time, making a long mode even longer. These cars are so tiny on such an open wide map that its tough to tag anyone. If the person that's it falls off the level, its up for grabs in the center again.  While a lot of the other events are fun and unique, they feel thrown together such as the pachinko and skeeball games. These are simple games based on points. You use your car to drive off a cliff or ramp and fall down into the pachinko or fly into the skeeball. The skeeball feels like skill, the pachinko feels like dumb luck. This is strictly filler content to flaunt as a frill.  There is controller support, just not in the menus. Default controls needed to be adjusted because some of the buttons were forgotten about. Even adjusting the controls, there is no menu button to adjust, so there's no pause with a controller. In fact there is no pause, because an online game keeps going even with bots. Instead there's a menu with no way to rebind the menu.  Zero Gear feels like it can benefit from from better events and a single player series of races against more intelligent opponents. There is something good here, but it needs to go deeper and bigger. More weapons, more races, more hazards. I'm sure it was fun when its multiplayer was still alive, but with such a small budget game, I wonder how alive it ever was. The game lives and dies on its multiplayer. Judging from the 25% of people with the first achievement, people went into the game, saw that its multiplayer only and went right back out.
1695	1	a	This game was a great surprise. It has a lot of different game modes, the items are well-designed, the controls are responsive and it's a lot of fun to play with friends. A solid game overall.
1697	1	a	Best game 10/10 would pay for again Only play with friends when you're really tired.
1699	1	a	It's cool if you like cart racing stuff or have played Hot wheels, it's fun to play, though not many people play it so you might have to play with bots most of the timesl.
1701	1	a	GOOD GAME  0 SERVERS ADD ME TO PLAY IM SO LONELY WITH BOTS
1703	1	a	Reminds you of the good old mario kart. I suggest you get it while it's still 0.99â‚¬
725	0	a	  This game is kind of fun with many different game modes (some are very boring, others not so much.) The thing is, you can't play in single player if you aren't connected to the internet which means you have to be connected to the internet  at all times  in order to play. honestly, that is the main reason I dislike this game. the graphics are OK, however, the colors on some maps are way too bright; I had to adjust the color settings on my monitor (I would go blind otherwise). I'm definitely  not  playing this game again.
1705	1	a	Really Nice game it's seen like mario kart 8 but very different you can customize your own charater a lot of nice stages :D    10/10
1707	1	a	ONE of the best games to play with friends. Yes the charaters are custonmizable and thier cars as well. Sometimes cant have enough of this game. Just laughing
1709	1	a	Despite the cartoonish graphics, it is an amazing and fun game to play! Even if you don't enjoy racing games that much ( Like me) , buy the game, you won't regret it :) And we will not regret it either, because we will have another person to play with sometimes. :) Add me as friend if you want to play togheter. :)
1711	1	a	This is the best fun based racing car game i've ever played. Its ultra super fun 10/10 would buy again. The only bad thing is that there is no one who plays this game (multiplayer).
726	0	a	  -Quick Review-   Zero Gear is an indie Racing game, the community is pretty much dead, but if you don't feel like you've had enough kart games, here you go, just for you. Disclaimer: I'm voting it down *not* because it's a bad game, but because the community is dead, you will play by yourself 9 times out of 10. (Maybe you don't mind that? Maybe you want to play a racing game by yourself? Go ahead and get it, lol)    -Detailed breakdown review-    Story:  Instead of a telling the gist of the story (there is none) I'm going to tell my own story. The first time I loaded this game I listen to the soundtrack and though 'Woa! This sound really good' I called my brother over and said 'doesn't that sound like it has good potential?' I clicked 'quick game' and  BAM  all my hopes and dreams were crushed... This was in fact... a racing game.  To provide a back story, I've always strongly disliked racing games and driving games. But Saints Row 3, Mafia 2, and Just Cause 2 have all forced me to learn how to drive in video games.   Game Play:  The first game I played was some type of 'Soccer' (or 'Football' for those whom aren't in the USA), this is probably the worst game in the batch. There are several game modes: Tag, Race, and Soccer. All of these can be played and learned, however it takes a bit of getting used to the turning style... Much to my frustration when learning the basics of the game. Soccer/Football/Hockey, your goal is to get the ball/puck into the other team's goal (pun intended). Race is where you drive in circles for a few laps and try to beat the NPC's, because humans don't play this game anymore. Tag, for those of you with no childhood; is when you run away from one person because he/she was designated being 'it', whatever it is, who knows? In this game it's reversed. You WANT to be it, so you can score points and win.   Achievements:  There are 45 Achievements in Zero Gear, Most of them are easily obtainable, however a number of them are bugged, and still more require the assistance of one friend.   Price  the price for Zero gear, is $4.99 that's pretty fair, if you really want this game just wait for a steal sale, you can probably pick it up for a couple dollars.   Conclusion:  AHHH a racing game. *deletes the devil from my computer*  Again, I'm giving it the thumbs down because most people probably won't want to spend time playing this game. The game works, and I could go one way or another, but with my friends interest in mind; probably should just skip this game. You could get a more delightful indie games for the same price.
1713	1	a	Bro it was 0.99 cents what was I suppose to do not buy it?
1715	1	a	I've play'd this game a lot with Friends while i was on Teamspeak with them. It is a really fun Game to play, similar to Mario Kart. It has bugs, the handling of the Cars is a bit tricky, but those Maps like 'Sumo Arena' are just too much fun! Get it in Sale for some Bucks, its worth it !
1717	1	a	So many laughs were had, would reccomend.
1719	1	a	Very good game omg so fun
1721	1	a	Zero Gear is like Mario Kart for PC. Tons of customisation, great characters to choose from. Nice to play with bots and multiplayer. Whilst most people would prefer to just get out their DSes and play the actual Mario Kart, this is a flawless alternative for PC gamers!
1723	1	a	Nice racing game.
1725	1	a	Really a fun game, tons of customizes,Funny and raging gameplay and if you have friends playing it, it's so much fun! I love the minigames too like hockey,football or pachinko, not only races!  10/10 I love this game
1727	1	a	Offroad drive is a real offroad game. it isnt traditional racing, it is time trials and u can turn ghosts on to see opponents while playing. When i say real offroad game i mean you have to use winch and watch the pressure so you dont break cable, you can turn 4x4 on/off and lock in hubs to get diff types of traction when/where you need it. It also has prettty nice mud and effects for vehicle interacting with it and making tracks and ruts and it affecting the physics of the vehicle. Mud washes off if you drive thru a clear water river or creek and can get muddy again. Overall fun game but different and captures real offroading pretty dang well and its obvious the ydid their research on this game. Its a shame the market for it is kinda niche cause they did a good job on it.
1729	1	a	As someone who offroads IRL, I can say this is one of the only games that can crunch my desire to rock crawl and drive through mud. I highly suggest it to any offroad fans out there.
1731	1	a	Would be even funnier if it had wheel suport, kinda nasty you have to have a 360 controller to drive this,other then that, yeah kinda good game.............and yeah,kinda late review to :-/
1733	1	a	This is some good off road fun its not free roam you are bound to a track, the game is a little dated now but ran fine for me best used with keyboard or game pad.  if its on sale grab a copy try it out
1735	1	a	Realistic mud The ability to use a winch when stuck Graphics are great Sound is great Vehicle physics are great Game engine is great   The only thing this game is missing is free roam, and support from the developer. They dont have any updates or dlc.   Highly Recommended
727	0	a	ORD wants really badly to be an off road SIM-style game, but it just falls short in too many aspects.   From a gameplay perspective, the game just overdoes the multiple obstacles and approaches and throws them all at you at once. Imagine being taught how to build a birdhouse in a tutorial then the first race asks you to build an entire apartment complex on your own. Even with 5 hours under my belt there were simply some courses I could not win.  Now from a game design perspecive, ORD is almost an embarassment. The graphcis are... Okay at best. This would have looked good in the PS2 era of gaming. There are sometimes neat lighting effects and the draw distances are surprisingly detailed but everything else is left to be desired. Also the game cannot and will not remember your control configurations. So unless you want to use the up, down, left, right, arrow keys, you'll be remapping your control scheme every time you open it up.  I'm willing to let all of that pass... but the one thing that really gets under my skin is the AI design. Basically if you don't win 2 out of the 3 courses in a circuit and place SECOND in the one you don't win... you will never come in first in a circuit. The same AI driver WINS... EVERY... SINGLE... TIME. There's no coming back from any finish less than 2nd place in any given race. That's just awful game design.  Even if you absolutely LOVE anything offroading related, I cannot possibly recommend this game. It's just underdesigned on so many levels and in the few places that it does shine, it overly complicates things to the point where they are frustrating. Skip this game at all costs unless you are a fan of mental toture and self-harm.
1737	1	a	if this game had free mode, i would say it is the best driving game on pc.  but it doesn't, so i'm going to go drive my feroza in real life instead
1739	1	a	a must have for all offroad fans, center diff,wheel diff,tire air pressure regulating,winching,mud boggin,rock climbing,dune riding, big offroad rigs like Top Truck Challenge? then this is it
728	0	a	Pay as little as possible for this game if you're an off-road sim enthusiest or a fan of racing/arcade titles in general. I'm initially disappointed but maybe repeated plays might sway my opinion. I'm sitting at less than an hour of game play, if it exceeds more than a few hours then I guess I was wrong. Chive On
729	0	a	5/10, this game is not worth the money, or the time. it is not 'true-to-life' at all. 1C should get their Ish together and make a decent game or gtfo. How do you expect us to play an offroad game where you can not go offroading? All you can do is follow the racetrack, that's it. physics are crap, suspension is not realistic by any stretch of the imagination, the sounds of the engines are too similar. Looks like they rebooted one of their old offroad games with fancy graphics. that's the only good thing about the game...the graphics.  My advice: go download rigs of rods (for free), if you want an offroading game where you can do some offroading.
1741	1	a	VERY VERY GOOD!!! but for the love of god 1C-Company always include free roam mode in driving games, i'd give this game a 9/10 if it had free roam but without that its gonna have to be 8/10 even for todays standards this is a very good offroad sim physics could use a bit more polish but its spot on none of the less
1743	1	a	If any one can help me on how to create a multiplayer game that my friend can join that would be great,  -NOT LAN -Internet -even if i can use hamachi it would be fine -please help
1745	1	a	ENG:  Basic good Off-Road Drive -game! Can like or not, semi-good game. I recoment 'Insane 2' -game. :3  FIN:  Perus hyvÃ¤ Off-Road autopeli! TykkÃ¤Ã¤ tai ei...keskinkertainen peli. Suosittelen 'Insane 2' -peliÃ¤! :3
730	0	a	This game is buggy and lacking content. It's good for what it is, an offroad simulator. But you NEED a wheel (which I have) to get any enjoyment out of it. Not recommended unless its on sale for dirt cheap.  It's really the only option you have for stage based offroading in buggies, trucks etc, and that's disappointing.
1747	1	a	I some what enjoyed this game but I did not understand the keys and how you do stuff.  I did the tutorial but to me it did not make any sense to me, I was still confused.  For the short time I played the game, I enjoyed it.  It was nice to take a slower pace tackling some insane courses instead of throwing all your power into them and driving like a bat out of hell, you play this and slow right down and drive logically because you can drive in at the wrong angel and get stuck easy.  Enjoyable game, just wish it had more people on the multiplayer.  I actually got mine cheap as hell from a Bundlestars bundle which was amazing for me!
1749	1	a	Great Game! But could be better. Can you make a free roam mode multiplayer that would be great!!! And no time either and if possible fix the xbox 360 controller setting, game resets the key binding after you quit game that is really frustrating. But other than those issues game is fun. Love playing it when I get the chance.
1751	1	a	This game is awesome in so many ways
1753	1	a	Exellent ,under-rated game. Very good simulation of off-road competiton racing. Bit of trouble getting it to run initially but once i sorted that everthings good. Is it worth Â£29.99. Probably not (come on steam,lower the price and let more people enjoy this great game). I got a cheap steam key off ebay and its definately money well spent.  8/10 IMO
1755	1	a	Nice game! Unjustly underrated. Ok, you can't free roam and have to stay on the tracks but the rest is good.
1757	1	a	very fun and i love the game  
736	0	a	Could have been a good game, the overall campaign is pretty decent though is hampered by a few issues. Multiplayer is broken beyond repair. Buy only if you are a off road fanatic, it happens to be on sale and you own basically all racing games off of steam.
1759	1	a	one of the best goof around 4x4 games i have found graphics are ok vehicle choices are good a little hard to get used to controls on keyboard but when remapped on my xbox 360 controller its much easier
1761	1	a	Outstanding game for the Off-roaders in you, with great real features, that act in the same way. Needs a tad work on the graphics and the physics but overall great game for getting muddy with out the washing.....
738	0	a	if u like being your own man raising hell blazing your own path like a wild man. Then this Game isn't what your looking for. it a timer dont even face the wrong way for 2 seconds be4 a reset of ur trucks kinda game. theres almost no animations and when you do get to do is a crawl
1763	1	a	If you like off roading and rock crawling in 4lo and both axles locked this is a great game to kill the off-road bug when you can't get out there for real! Adjust/change tire pressure, ride height, spring tension, tire size/tread, 4hi, 4lo, lock diffs. Choose the correct line and approach to get over obstacles. If that don't work you got a winch too!
739	0	a	u just get stuck then have to restart the race only to get stuck again. The only updates to the game are to add more languages. whats the point if you cant even play the game. How about adding the universal language of game that doesnt suck!
740	0	a	Dumbest off road game ever...camera angles suk...can't move on unless you finish all tutorials...can't play internet games as other players can't see the game that's been set up...worst $.74 ever spent!!!
741	0	a	Just save your money and buy Spintires this one is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
1765	1	a	Bought this game and cannot play it!! Very unhappy that i paid for a game and cant even play it!! :( 
1767	1	a	Good driving mechanics. A bit dissappointing once you find out that this game requires some precision input but it doesn't really support controller. Worse still, it doesn't support force feedback. Not the one that makes your controller vibrates but the one that transmit surface, road-feel, grip level and such through your wheel, it doesn't have that.  Anyway, if you want a good looking game but don't care much about controller support then it's a jolly fun game. Once again it doesn't support force-feedback. You have been warned!
1769	1	a	Quite a fun game if you enjoy offroading, has different tracks and customizable vechichles for the price of the game its a no-brainer.
1771	1	a	This game is for offroaders, what else is there to say. It has plenty of cars that can be tuned to different terrains that consist of mud, sand, rocks, obsticles and more. There are multiple races and different events to attend across the map and each one has something unique.  It isn't really an easy game to play at first and needs some getting used to and the multiplayer funcion doesn't really work for some reason but overall it's an awesome Offroad Racing, it's hard to get better than that, maybe if the multiplayer functioned and the game had free ride mode with some open areas.
1773	1	a	it is great fun but they need a freeroam so you can roam the track and do things your way and a big map to go with it
1775	1	a	A pretty fun, technical game. It not for those that enjoy really fast racing but rather for people who like taking a slow approach to getting round complicated obstacles. Worth 5quid, seems quite short though, I've gone through most of it in less than 6 hours, so get it on sale, if not give it a miss.
742	0	a	This game doesn't worth the 5$ I spent on it.  Basically, it's supposed to be an Off Road game, but do not even try to go outside the racetrack, you'll get stuck right away. I mean, do I drive a 4x4 or a freakin' golf caddy ?? I can't even call that 'driving' since controls are horrible, I didn't even manage to finish the tutorial !!   Al least graphics are not that bad...
1777	1	a	game that forever captured the gaming space . Off-Road Drive - players are given the unique opportunity to participate in various international competitions , had never before is reflected in computer games. All virtual match exactly reproduce the real ... SUVs in the game recreated based on the technical features of real prototypes .

744	0	a	Well I have completed the game and only then came to the conclusion that I have been waisting my time, so decide for your self, well for me its better than the crew and other mindless arcade recers.
1779	1	a	This Game Off-Road Drive is the best offroading game i have played in a long time an i have many gaming systems an this game has mp on it but from what i can understand when it came out in 2011 pple could not get the mp to run so i guess they all just gave up but i have mine working an i host games all the time only 4 players tho thts the max in game...But tht all being said..If u can figure out how to make it run in mp its amazing there all tracks but u can put around on them if u want not a free roam game but fer 15 bucks..it really cant be beat guys....an belive me im a seasoned offroader an i have trouble in some tracks there tht real..the water an the mud an the textures are amazing very smooth renderd game an YES IT DOES SUPPORT XBOX 360 CONTROLLERS AN U CAN FULLY REMAP THE KEYBOARD lol..There no mods fer the game tht i can find but i really didnt work tht hard lol but the trucks tht it comes with are awesome an they all resemble real trucks...lol but yea it u have 15 bucks to spend an yer lookin for a great truck game This is a winner everybody....2 BIG THUMBS UP FOR THIS ONE...
745	0	a	Heart breaker. This game has more potential then one could imagine. But, the developers published it and bailed.   No multiplayer No open world You have to stay on specific trails  Sad sad sad
746	0	a	sry bu this game was horrible it has bad controls (vry touchy) on keyboard or xbox controler the grafix are really p[ixelated even for my hd screen (hd hp pavillion) and the game wasnt as exciting as i anticipated overall
1781	1	a	well great game but need american trucks plz dodge and chevy ford plz and make it sound like one of those trucks should plz would be great and also make a free roam with multiplayer i could get 90 people to play this easy thats just me if u do this lmfao
1783	1	a	
1785	1	a	Not worth the money. Too fiddly, and I got bored straight away. Would really like my money back..
1787	1	a	If you like off roading or racing or driving sims this is the love child of all three.
756	0	a	i had heard a lot of good things about this game but alas it was not ment to be huge dissapointment
757	0	a	CRASHES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Going to get a refund now! My computer can handle the game on high graphics, but most levels crash at laoding screen :( Of the 1 level that I CAN play is quite good... getting a refund now...
758	0	a	great game if you have a laptop .. but â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game if you have a desktop .. i Payed 14.99 usd for the game on steam and thought it would work ... but i was wrong and now im looking for my money back on the game that does not even work .. it starts with the two trucks with off road drive logo and sits there never even starting and instantly goes none responsive .. worste 14.99 i have ever spent in my whole life ....... end result removed from my computer ... 1c company didnt even help ANYONE on their forum .. they Even removed peoples posts for asking for help to get the game to work ... if you ask me that is poor customer service ....
1789	1	a	One of the most relistic driving games iv ever played. it is fun, beautiful, and overall a great game. i have only one complant, THERE IS KNOW FREE ROAM MODE
1791	1	a	Who likes octane adventure in nature that must play this game.
1793	1	a	Love this game. It can be fiendishly difficult in places, the controls are many and you'll need to adjust them to be able to play, but it's so refreshing to find a game that is genuinely challenging, rather than just frustrating and cheesey, or just plainly too easy.  I build RC rock crawlers. Playing a game based on the full scale vehicles is about as close to my dream game as I think it is possible to get. The complexity won't be for everyone, but it's definitely one of those games that when you get it right, it all comes together and you effortlessly get your rig over that difficult obstacle, you will find yourself cheering.
1795	1	a	Best $3.74 I ever spent(on a game). Off-Road Drive &gt; Spintires. The only thing Spintires has going for it is the mud simulation(which is 100x better). Other than that though, this game is the real 'Ultimate Off-Road Driving Experience'. I'm, also, so glad I waited to purchase it until after being so disappointed by Spintires. Helped ease the pain a bit. Just wish someone would hurry up and make Off-Road Drive 2.
1797	1	a	Great surprise! I found this gem when I was looking for another game, I saw the screenshots and it sorta looked like a revamped, trials focused version 4x4 Evo with a 'lil bit of Spintires thrown into the mix. I added it to my wishlist and to my surprise it went on sale a week after that, so I bought it, played a bit and I wasn't dissapointed.  Indeed, Off-Road Drive reminds me of 4x4 Evo 1/2 and Spintires, even better cause the latter, from what I've watched and read, looks like it doesn't offer much and gets old quickly. This game offers many different tracks, vehicles and customization options. You race against the clock and other opponents but you don't see 'em during the race tho, except for a ghost of the first and second cars when they're getting close on you, so it feels kinda like a rally game in that regard, you still feel the competitive pressure and rush; During each race, depending on the surface you're on, you'll have to change the drive mode, gears, differentials, tire pressure and you'll even have to use the winch to attach the vehicle to a tree -or something else- a few times in certain levels just to get out of the most difficult situations.  A really fun game overall if you're into more 'cranial', simulation-y type of racing games, specially off-road ones, I truly recommend it.
1799	1	a	Although Spintires is much better than this game. It is very impressive because it was made by a not very well known developer. The game is also fun and has a good mud simulation.
772	0	a	well, i figured id buy this game while im building my trail rig, and i must say.. this game suuuucks! if they would improve the mud and quick sand id probably like this game, but io know for a fact that mud and quick sand are not like this in real life. i also hate how the multiplay does not work.if the developers would fix the damn mud, quick sand and all the sloppy sh*t to make the game more realistic, i would probably like the game. but just because of those, i absolutley hate this game. i would not recomend it to anyone, ever.
1801	1	a	add Russian trucks like spintires trucks 
1803	1	a	do you need a serial key i cant play multiplayer plz help
777	0	a	the game is ok but dont buy if u want 2 play with your friends on multiplayer becouse there is no multiplayer and u cant get the cd key
1805	1	a	This is much more enjoyable driving game than the metacritic score (60 / 100) makes it look like. Different kind of racing, offers hours of fun for single player gaming. Can also be quite challenging (in a good way) at some points.
779	0	a	This game sucks!!!!! Throw to the garbage this tutorial, make easier menus. Make open worlds and more to make a good game.  Instead that, this game is a piece of crap!
780	0	a	Half decent game. No free roam. No multiplayer.
1807	1	a	Simply an amazing game, one of the best off road experiences out there today, a true off road adventure.
1809	1	a	This game is fun.
1811	1	a	I used to go racing in a Land Rover with a mate back in 87, for real I loved it...It's about time that a game, gave you the real impression of what it is like to be there, doing it, without the cost of broken diffs etc
1813	1	a	just got this game but so far it is exactly what i expected. HARD CORE OFFROADING! dont forget to put it in low gear!
1815	1	a	you should add steam workshop so people can make trucks and levels and other stuff Please
785	0	a	my pc specs can definitly run this game or should but i found out that it is the game that i buggy and laggy. Off-road drive is more for console, not pc. when i first started playing this game is seemed that when the game runs, to much is focused on the enviroment. cpu runs bad ONLY when this game is running. i can play mw3 on med specs just fine, but these system requirments for offroad drive are lower than mw3 yet it still runs like poop. i wish i never bought this. oh and did i mention that multiplayer is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up beyond all repair!. never worked for me and also people on the forums. i wish this game ran smoothly because i would actually consider playing it again.
786	0	a	dont buy this game
1817	1	a	I think its pretty good for what it sets out to be. Its fun especially if you are in to offroading
1819	1	a	Great game. Love the graphics and choices of 4wd's. I really like the slow rock crawling maps. The suspention flexes around and the choice of bigger tires is great to. I would ask that you fix something in the settings, i change the left and right controls to A and D but every time i exit the game and reopen it, the settings arent saved. it never saves?? Its just annoying having to change the settings everytime i play it. I also wanna suggest that you ad a free roam, so that you can explore the maps at your will without a time constraint or points, just so you can have a bit of fun and get some screen shots and stuff. Cheers
787	0	a	rip off waste of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in money game citch most times and u cant respawn 
1821	1	a	every time i try to play this game it says it stopped working PLEASE FIX
1823	1	a	I bought Off Road Drive awhile back, and I can honestly say it's the closest to reality out of all other off roading games I've played. It's awesome, almost as fun as off roading for real. But, it's not without it's flaws. The first one I noticed is that despite it's description there is no snow courses in the entire game. Another is that for game modes you have a choice of career or.. career. While you can go back and replay courses, you can't choose the exact track you want to play on, rather you have to play an entire series of tracks. Oh and I should note that if you lose in the series while replaying it will override your previously clearing it and possibly make trucks you've unlocked unavailible. But the biggest flaw is that the game does not have a free roaming mode, and is abosultely humorless if you try and do anything other than drive on the course in the exact way it wants you to.   I wouldn't have bothered with writing a review if I hadn't noticed that 1c just released a French translation a short while ago, which must mean the developers still care about the game on some level, and perhaps they'll listen to me. Please add a mode where the game doesnt force you back on to the track. Possibly add inverted courses to change it up a bit. And maybe add some snow tracks if the first two things end up being easy fixes. Don't let this game's potential go to waste! :)  TL;DR Game is good if you get into real off roading, but don't expect to have as much freedom as you'd have in an older game like MotorM4x.
1825	1	a	Fun fun fun! Not your typical arcade off road racer. There are actual elements of off roading. For a couple of bucks it's definitely worth it.
1827	1	a	i totaly recomend this game 
1829	1	a	Its fun if you like 4x4 games. you can use winches and everything to get out the mud. the tracks are small but i have only played for 1 hr. they have alot of different tracks with good career mode. and online asks me for a serial key.
790	0	a	Boring. No free roam. Vehicles have poor customization. Unrealistic physics. The trucks get act as if they weigh as much as a toy truck, so jumpy and light. I dont race, but I do off-road in real life. Id recommend Spintires.
791	0	a	WTF is this? Looks like an arcade racer, tries to be an offroad simulation, ends up playing like an unfinished demo.
1831	1	a	Need more 4wds and different upgrades but overall a good game
793	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ games lots of bug
794	0	a	Terrible. Don't bother.
1833	1	a	fun for a few hours, then go play smething else
1835	1	a	I don't know about you, but I just tried this game and I really enjoyed the experience.  This is not a fast paced driving game. It's more than just accel/brake, and turning. You have to adjust tire pressure, trigger 4x4, use the winch, and more. It's about trying to sort obstacles, and deal with different types of terrains. Not for the short tempered. You have to be really patient sometimes to pass through a course...  I like the in-game music, and graphics are awesome. I do like the fact your car gets all dirty and muddy and doesn't remain cherry clean like it used to happen in many old off-road games back then. Also, runs wonderfully on my 2007 PC.  It has took virtual driving experience to a whole new level for me. I really recommend it to anybody looking for that!
1837	1	a	i bought this game yesterday from steam but i cannot play multiplayer mode. This game asks serial number. Anyone can help me?
799	0	a	The game name says Flatout. But do not think of it as Flatout. It is not even made by same developers as the original Flatout, Flatout 2 and Ultimate Carnage. This is made by Team 6. Team 6 has not made a single good game ever. And this is not exception.  This game is absolutely horrible, I do not recommend it for anyone. The physics are one of the worst I have ever seen in racing game. Crashing does not feel good when it should in this type of game. The graphics look just ugly. Even the first Flatout from 2004 looks better than this in my opinion. There is not even a proper career mode, just a boring challenge mode that has random single races you can complete. This game is overpriced, it should cost 5â‚¬/5$ at max, and even then I would not recommend the game to anyone.  Play the good old Flatout instead, or check out the Next Car Game by the developers of original Flatout games (Bugbear Entertainment). That will be a true demolition racing/derby game.  DO NOT BUY FLATOUT 3
800	0	a	This game is rubbish, if you loved flatout 2 or UC then don't buy.  Flatout 3 features cars that have some of the worse systems of damage e.g. you trade paint and explode, you hit someone face on no damage. Maps that have the track missing in places e.g. a map where you have to jump across a black hole and never make it (including the AI). Zombies that should be road cones (they don't move). Graphics that are worse then flatout 1. Maps that have nothing in them called off road maps.  This game was not made by bugbear it was made by Team 6. Think Pizza Dude and Taxi Raser. It is the same quality
801	0	a	I was not able to complete even one hour game Flatout 3: Chaos &amp; Destruction. I at least when I bought the game expecting a Flatout 2 with slightly better graphics and either innovation in gameplay, it's true I did not expect much out of him, but what I saw is unbelievable.  Cade the excitement of each race in Flatout 2? There is none of that here. This is a completely different game, where every minute in this game, seem hours. If you played Flatout 2, please DO NOT buy this game. Guarantee dissatisfaction.
802	0	a	Flatout 3, or The One Where The Flatout Franchise â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Down It's Legg The first two Flatout games were good fun, but it's third installment felt like a step backwards so big that I would have believed you if you told me that it was released before the first game. The biggest issue with the game is one that writes the whole experience off: the physics are horrible. Cars don't FEEL right. Their acceleration, turning and collision feel simply horrible. You can really tell a different developer made this title.  Can't Drive Stick out of Ten
803	0	a	Heyyo, DON'T BUY THIS GAME! It's an insult to what Bugbear, the original developers of Flatout created. This was made by some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥-budget-Russian 'game' 'studio' and it's every bit as bad as its Metacritic score of 23 / 100. The text is poor, it feels like a free game a college student made in a week, and it's nowhere near the price they're asking for. This game deserves to die. Buy any other Flatout game or Bugbear's upcoming 'Next Car Game'
804	0	a	Awful in every sense of the word, ESPECIALLY when you compare it to its predecessors.  But, before I begin, there's something you must know - The first two FlatOut games were made by Bugbear Entertainment, and they were phenominal racing games, especially FlatOut 2. This game? Totally different company that completely misunderstood everything Bugbear had done right.   First things first, the AI is pitiful. I know the name of the game is destruction, literally, but it's a RACING game, and I'd rather have people using force to win the race than veering off the track in the first lap to wrestle in the grass like kittens.  On this note, *everyone* targets you. I went into one demolition derby round, and it was hilariously stupid the way it worked. As soon as the countdown hit zero, the twenty-or-so other non-player racers veered to the opposite side like the Persian army and all ganged up on me at once, with the exception of, what, like, two motorists smashing each other's bumpers in. I mean, I played FlatOut 2's derby mode religiously, and it sometimes feels like the AI prioritizes you over their brethren, but even in it worst state it was nothing compared to this insanity.  Now, it's time to compare it to its predecessors - Yes, Flatout 3 was made by a different company than the first two, but being a sequel by its title, I have to rate it in comparison to its past successes in the franchise.  The other NPC's -- The way this development team tried to recreate Bugbear's non-player character gimmick is awful. If you haven't played FlatOut 2, lemme give you the jist of things - There were seven NPC's that were the only opponents in the game. They all had distinct driving styles, color schemes, and skills in different racing areas. They were so memorable thanks to this that you had those names ingrained into your brain after your first couple of races and figured out very quickly whose names to curse every time you launched out of your windshield.  Well, 3 messes this all up. There are something near 15 characters, and some of them are so similar that you have no hope of remembering them. The character models are all very idealized, if you catch my drift, and there's one fully anonymous man wearing a motorcross helmet with practically full-balanced stats that you'll choose every time if you're sane. That's another thing, too - Unlike the original, where you were your own identity, you have to choose one of these punks.  Anyway, 2.5/10, because it technically functions, I guess. Go buy Next Car Game instead, it's made by the same company that made the other FlatOut games. Speaking of which, go buy the other FlatOut games, too, they're super cheap and also on Steam. It's a shame those two don't have online multiplayer anymore, because if they did, I'd force you to buy them at gunpoint.
805	0	a	I'd rather tea-bag a Bear Trap than to play that ever again.  Go play Flatout 2. Now!
806	0	a	A spit in the face of all people that enjoyed any of the previous installments. Created by a different company. Offensive, ugly, disjointed, bloted and hardly playable game.
807	0	a	best uninstall simulator I have ever played.
808	0	a	Don't be stupid like me and don't buy this game, it's total garbage. If you want nice destruction derby game, get FlatOut2: Ultimate Carnage, soo much better than this crap. Or get Bugbear's new game called Next Car Game, thats a great destruction derby game (but still in making).  The real problem with this game is, that it isn't made by Bugbear but by some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ company. Graphics seems (at least to me) like downgrade from FlatOut2. It have horrible original 'music' and not licensed music from rock bands like the other flatouts. From what else i saw in that half hour i wasted on it was horrible maps like simple square with some houses around and thats it, thats your city race track. No destructible props at all. The 'throw your driver out of car' minigames are worthless, so much better in FlatOut2.  My verdict? It's 1/10. One point for cool name that can charm fans like me who played and loved previous FlatOut games. Seriously, don't buy this crap, hell, don't even pirate it, it's just waste of time.  P.S. On the other hand, if you want to torture some clueless friend, get this game for him/her. He/She will get this monster big mindf*ck and will do anything for you, just not make him/her see this game again.
809	0	a	Worst Flatout game ever.I used to play flatout before I had a steam account.I have played Flatout 2 demo for atleast 15 hours.(It has been some years though).But look at my activity on this game.I Couldn't stand it.Atleast I bought the flatout complete at a big sale so I didn't waste too much money on this awful game.
810	0	a	It's bad  I used to believe it was good  I was stupid at the time  forgive me
811	0	a	I'm absolutely speechless.  This 11GB piece of crap is disgrace to the Flatout series! It's like Bad Rats on wheels! 1/10
812	0	a	Unfortunately Flatout 3 is a big disapointment for me and many fans of previous parts.  What went wrong?  Gameplay has lost this 'catchy' spirit making this game addicting. Controls has changed and physics as well. You don't have any feeling of the vehicle You driving. The game seems to be at faster pace. Too fast form me :) Too many explosions and destructions out of a good taste. Soundtrack is flat and colorless. It isn't bad but... There is no tracks of some famous rockbands as previously. Graphisc has not made any progress. It has made a step backwards as it stay in place.  Flatout3 has a lot of game modes some of which are not playable at all.   I like SPEED Mode it has something good :)  The rest is kind of fun ... for about 5 minutes. There is no career mode :(  To be honest : Flatout 1 &amp; 2 have their own style and leave in gamers' minds an unique impresion and lots of good, warm memories. FO3 does not...
813	0	a	This is too childish. Bad physics, bad gameplay, bad graphics. All flatouts look better than this, a lot better. I don't recommend it and I think that there are no people who liked this game.
814	0	a	Take Flatout 1, add a little flatout 2 and then smash it together like a toddler with cake, throw it at the wall, eat it, digest it, vomit it back up, scrape it up and hey presto flatout 3
815	0	a	The best feature was the uninstal option.
816	0	a	I lasted 10 minutes. How long will you last?
817	0	a	I really loved Flatout 1, then Flatout 2 and Flatout Ultimate Carnage (although they were pretty much the same game, the latter graphically a bit tuned up and 'more to do'). So, since I bought the FO1/FO2/FOUC/FO3 package, why not play Flatout 3 although I've heard some pretty nasty stuff about it. Note: one of my Steam friends told me to keep my memory of Flatout as it was: when I did install, he uttered 'don't play FO3, uninstall and never look back'   Naturally, I rejected his advice, because I wanted to form an opinion that I made myself. How I wished I had listened. The game has graphics worse than Flatout 1, driveability worse than Flatout 1, a damage model worse than Sony's F1 2005-2009 (and that was horrible) and looks like a game made in....1998 at best. No, even the Half Life 1 graphics were better. 1996, 1997? For the Dutch in my list, it looks like A2 Racer. The first one.  Just one race, but enough to scrape the pieces of my Flatout memory to what it was after Ultimate Carnage. Don't buy, and if you do, I hope you are buying the other 3 Flatouts with it, because this game should pay you to have you play it.
818	0	a	The worst FlatOut of them all infact probably one of the worst racing games ever made which is ashame because i really like the FlatOut games especially ultimate carnage the gameplay honestly isnt that great it sucks infact its terrible, there isnt much of a career its prity much just random quick race events and game modes, car selection is not too bad i suppose, AI is very ruthless they will shove you out the way if they get the chance, menu music is INSANELY LOUD and so is the sound effects from the cars and engines. also the controles are just dreadful  You wont like it its not a good game dont pay full price for it 1/10
819	0	a	Brought the Flatout pack a few days ago and played this one first..... I shouldn't have done....  Graphics----Poor Gameplay---Poor Everything POOR  Please don't bother with this game.   I'm going to uninstall it now...
820	0	a	If you love FlatOut, DON'T PLAY THIS. EVER.
821	0	a	  Don't...
822	0	a	Worst. Flatout. Ever. DO NOT BUY
823	0	a	this game is a shame to the original flatouts, if you think this is good, you're an idiot, and let me go into gtreat lengths about why:  1: has no damage model. a flatout game without a damage model is like nfs 2015 without customization  2: no career mode. this dissapointed me greatly because all other flatout games had one  3: horrid controls  4: blatent rip-offs of todays popular cars, like the mitsubishi evo x (scroll through the car list and you'll see what i mean)  5: the biggest one, THIS ABOMINATION ISN'T EVEN MADE BY BUGBEAR! this is what really gets me, because it's in a pack with games by bugbear, and those games were and still are awesome to this day.
824	0	a	Avoid This Game at all cost! Ruined The FlatOut Franchise! I'd pay Steam to remove this game from my list!
825	0	a	Flatout 2 was WAY better. This one had terrible physics, collisions, and just annoying when you ram someone full speed to only do a tiny fraction of their health. Only to realize someone else tapped you, and you lost more than half of your health. Just stick with Flatout 2, better yet, stick to Flatout 2: Ultimate Carnage.
826	0	a	Worst flatout wouldn't recommend it, even for free.
827	0	a	I picked this up in a multi-pack with several other games as I had played previous games in the series before. Honestly, I think I might have been better off paying more to buy the rest of the pack separately without this one.   Avoid this game and here is why: The graphics are at best mediocre. However, despite this expect to find the game stuttering and struggling to keep up (especially when turning corners). This quickly becomes more than a minor annoyance when you find yourself losing control because the game has stuttered on a corner. Textures applied to the walls around the track (such as graffiti on the concrete) will flicker. (Keep in mind this is on a PC with an i7 CPU, 8GB of RAM, and a GeForce GTX 670).  The car handling is distinctly fishy. Half the cars will stick to the road like glue. The other half will be sliding all over the place. There is nothing in between.   The AI is even fishier. When they go around corners expect to see carnage as they drive straight in to walls. To make up for this the AI will quickly catch you on the straights â€“ passing your car with no problems even when youâ€™re burning nitro.   The damage modelling on the cars is all or nothing. Where Flatout Ultimate Carnage slowly added damage to the cars depending on the impacts in this game your car is either brand new or has been completely crumpled. There is no damage in between these two options. As soon as your car scrapes against anything expect to see the whole car appear as if it has been squashed by an 18 Wheeler.
828	0	a	Quite possibly the worst racing game of all time. I spent 13 minutes on this game, which consisted of looking at the vehicles and characters for 10 minutes then uninstalling halfway through the first race.
829	0	a	Flatout was one of those games that I found on GOG and decided to try. I didn't expect much, but there was a sale, and I picked the game up for $1.90. The instant I got into a race I knew that the game would be good. There was mayhem, car bits smashing everywhere, tires all over the road, explosions after colliding with barrels. The game was fun, and to this day the original Flatout is one of my favorite racing games.  So when I heard that there was going to be a Flatout 3 (Sequel to Flatout 2, which was also a great game,) I was excited. I waited the week until it came out, (I should've known something was up, they only announced the game a week before it was released!) and promptly bought the game off of Steam. Once it had finished downloading, I started the game up to see if it was a worthy successor to the game that I had loved.  The first thing I did was check out the graphics options. I have a fairly fast computer, so I maxed everything out. I headed into a race. There were several classes of cars to choose from, and one of the classes was Classic. The car looked decent, so I chose it. After a loading screen with an unmoving bar, I was in. From the start, I was shocked. I won't tell you the specifics of this race, I'll just break it down by category:  Physics One of the best things about the previous Flatout games was the tight sense of physics. It wasn't quite a simulation, but it was realistic enough that you had to be careful not accidentally hit something solid and crash. It also had excellent car damage, and the cars dented and crunched realistically. With Flatout 3, all of this was thrown out of the window.  Cars in Flatout 3 handle like they do in those racing games at the arcade. When you're driving them, you don't really have a sense of control like you do in a real car. They feel way too fast, and also very light. They are also very difficult to control. The cars in Flatout 3 have all of these traits. They just don't have the tight sense of control that previous games had. Instead, they feel like someone modded the game files to make things more hectic. Honestly, it just feels bad.  Gamemodes If there was one thing that I thought Flatout 3 had going for it, it was itâ€™s gamemodes. It has a varied lineup that looks like it could be fun to play, but still manages to fail. The modes are: Race, Stunt Man, Big Battle, Battle Arena, Monster Trucks, Speed, Nightshift, Offroad, and Challenge.  Race is the obvious one. Race around a track, and the first to complete the predetermined number of laps wins. Nightshift is actually identical to race, the only difference being that all of the courses are at night. Race mode lacks depth, but this can be forgiven seeing as thereâ€™s only so much you can do with a lap race. Even so, the mode really isnâ€™t very good. I wouldnâ€™t say itâ€™s bad as it is, itâ€™s just kinda boring.  Stunt Man is the classic minigame mode from the previous games. In it, you launch your driver through the windshield to accomplish various tasks. An example would be the high jump. You would drive down a long track until you reached a high net. You would hold down the nitro button to adjust the angle, then release to see how high your driver would be launched. It sounds horribly sadistic, but it really was quite fun in the previous Flatout games.  Not so in Flatout 3.  The reason for this is simple, and this is essentially the reason the game is so bad: The physics engine quite simply fails. You just can't launch your driver like you could in the previous games. It feels cheap, kinda like a bad iPhone game. The physics just donâ€™t perform like they should in the situation. It ruins it.  The next two modes are Big Battle and Battle Arena. In these modes, 8-24 cars are thrown into an arena. A car wins by destroying all other cars in the arena. This is essentially the Derby mode from the older games. This mode sounds fun when I describe it (and it was in the last two games), but itâ€™s terrible in Flatout 3. The reason for this is (once again) the incredibly poor physics engine. Cars fly around as if they were made of paper. A car trading paint with you does 50% damage to you, whereas a T-bone collision only does 20%. And donâ€™t even get me started on the explosions. Unfortunately, this gamemode feels like a cheap knockoff of the established mode from the other games.  Monster Trucks is unique, and it is the highlight of the game. In this mode, your only cars are (guess what) monster trucks. You can then choose from five gamemodes. The first is Search and Destroy, which is a timed dash to destroy 40 barrels on the map. The second is Bring the Light, in which the goal is to bring 5 objects into a container. The next mode is Catch the Bus. In this mode, you have to knock over 5 double decker busses as fast as possible. The fourth is Royal Flush, where players roll a mine into the sewer. The final mode is Dude, Whereâ€™s My Car, which is similar to Search and destroy, only with car wrecks instead of barrels. These modes arenâ€™t terrible to play like the other modes, and can actually be enjoyed. Unfortunately, this enjoyment is short lived, and it soon falls to the mundaneness of the rest of the game.  Speed attempts to play like a F1 racer. All of the cars are Formula 1 cars, and the tracks are similarly themed. However, this simply doesnâ€™t work. The combination between Flatout 3 and F1 2012 is a match made in hell, and the mode fails horribly.  Offroad is kinda interesting: The goal is to get from Point A to Point B in as fast as possible. Playing the game reminds me of an old game called Fuel that I once had. The premise is interesting, but thereâ€™s so much junk everywhere on the track that its a nightmare to drive, especially with the physics engine that stubbornly refuses to go away.  The final mode is challenge. This basically sets up specific scenarios in the previous gamemodes with goals you have to complete. This could be something like a time trial, or a race where your goal is to deal a certain amount of damage or wreck x number of cars. It fails to impress, just like everything else in this game.  Graphics Sometimes graphics can warrant the purchase of a game. You may buy a game just to show off your computer, and thatâ€™s alright every once in awhile. This isnâ€™t one of those games. The graphics are flatout terrible! (See what I did there!) The game just doesnâ€™t look good. The cars always seem kind of squashed when you look at them, and they're low enough poly to be in a GameCube game. In fact, the entire game looks like a GameCube game. Hereâ€™s some examples to prove my point:   If the GameCube one were higher resolution, it would beat out Flatout 3 easily.  Sound Er, no. Just no. This game has terrible sound. The main theme gets old and repetitive. Cars sound like RC cars. Collisions have no force in them. And just about everything else sound really bad. It doesnâ€™t help that this game has no soundtrack, which means youâ€™re stuck listening to crappy music that someone wrote in a day. Words canâ€™t describe just how bad it sounds. It really is pathetic.  Conclusion If you havenâ€™t figured out by now, this game is terrible. Unfortunately for the studio that made this, the reason I feel it was so terrible was because of the Flatout label. Everyone who had played the original expected it to be the same. It just wasnâ€™t. This game might have been decent it it wasnâ€™t called Flatout 3, but because it was, it is terrible. There really wasnâ€™t anything going for this game, and Iâ€™m truly sad to see how a previously excellent franchise fell flat.  Graphics: 0/10 Horribly dated graphics manage to look worse that Flatout 2.  Sound 0/10 Just no. Almost like they realized they needed sound a day before it was released.  Controls: 3/10 Racing games should not be played on the keyboard. When a controller was used, cars randomly careened out of control.  Gameplay: 3/10 Very little enjoyment in the game. 
830	0	a	The worst incarnation of this series; this game was not developed by the original dev team of Flatout 1, Flatout 2, and Flatout: Ultimate carnage.  While the previous titles sported a delicate balance of racing, wrecking, and arcade-like elements... this game throws it out the window and shares little in common with previous games aside from the genre of being a demolition-style racing game and it's title.  Visually the game looks worse than it's predecessor. The two are not even comparable; It looks more like a game I would have expected to play on the originally PlayStation or maybe an arcade.  Game-play-wise the cars have no real 'life' to them, and again feel like something I would expect from an arcade game I pop $1 into. In previous iterations, cars felt like they had weight; you could slide beautifully around dirt corners, drift through tight turns, and could manipulate AI cars by using your force/speed/inertia. All that is gone in this game; even the most difficult looking turns are easily mastered by simply momentarily letting off the gas and simply hitting your left or right key; gone are the days of worrying about oversteer, understeer, or compensating for loss of traction. Even the ways cars bounce off each other seems more like you are in a pinball machine getting popped around by the bumpers --- you don't really have much control or force over other AI vehicles so you are at their mercy if their 'line' gets in your way.  Also gone are the days of customizing your car tuning. Probably one of my favorite parts of any racing sim or, for lack of a better term, any 'car game' in general is the ability to swap X for Y and make your car, YOUR car. All the white knuckle driving done to take 1st pays off for that next much wanted upgrade. Not here ---- you pick from the standard layout of cars, and then you can pick from 2 or 3 different pre-defined 'tuning' settings which invariably just give you more speed for less durability or vice versa. But in reality, it doesn't matter because EVERY CAR FEELS EXACTLY THE SAME.  I'm not usually too harsh but I cannot recommend this game to anyone. If you are looking for an arcade-style racing game I am sure there are many alternatives that would be better. If you are looking at this game because you've player previous FlatOut games, then skip it entirely as it is not the same development team and therefore not the same game at all. I've just installed 'DiRT Showdown' and while it seems a little different than flatout, it has many of the same feelings and elements and a bit more up-to-date graphics. I have also heard that the original developers of FlatOut have been developing/developed already a new demolition racing game which I will be eager to check out, so maybe do a quick google if you would be interested in that!
831	0	a	One of the worst games i 've ever played..Don't waste your money for this crappy game..
832	0	a	The biggest waste of 10 minutes ever.  No, seriously, is that supposed to be a part of the Flatout series?
833	0	a	This has to be the worst game I have ever played/seen in my life.... and I have played some bad games, so trust me when I say this one beats any game in ther pure â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥'o'meter!!!!
834	0	a	Absolute garbage, nothing to do with older versions, even the straight consoleport of ultimate carbage is much much better. Only buy if you got enough cash to wash it down the toilet.   TOP TIP, AVOID AT ALL COSTS. 
835	0	a	For me this is simply not a Flatout-Game. The whole feeling is different, the driving feels like another racing game, but not even a good one. I enjoyed the Zombie and Destruction Mode for a few rounds but that was it for me.
836	0	a	Absolutely the worst racing game I have ever played and a contender for worst game ever made. I had noticed that it wasn't made by Bugbear like the others but I paid no heed and prepurchased on day 1. I thought 'ehh, how badly can they â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it up?'  Pretty badly as it turns out. What a joke. Yes, I did only play it like 10 minutes but that was about 7 minutes longer than I needed to realize this was a big steaming pile of crap.
837	0	a	I bought this with all the other FlatOut games for 5 dollars... still feel ripped off...
838	0	a	Boring cars, repetitive gameplay, clunky physics... just skip it.
839	0	a	All the other flat out games are good and fun......  This game is neither. I played it for a little then uninstalled it.....  IMO this game should be buried in the desert like Atariâ€™s ET game as itâ€™s a steaming pile.  I do not recommend this game to anyone....  After playing please go and get some therapyâ€¦ And no not mention the words flat out 3.
840	0	a	One of the worst games ever made. The other FlatOut games are AWESOME, but this piece of shet was developed by another studio. AVOID AT ALL COST.
841	0	a	Terrible optimization terrible controls and an â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ load of forced post processing effects you cant turn off. This game isnt even worth your money if it was only 3 cents. This game is worse than a rushed unity game slapped on greenlight as early access
842	0	a	piece of sh!t.
843	0	a	Is this still on steam? wow
844	0	a	This game is freakin HORRIBLE!  Its borderline unplayable! I mean you can play the game..... But I assure you, you will not enjoy your experience. Absolutly the worst controls I have ever had to try and use in a racing game.  I luckly got this in a bundle for the other Flatout games which I hear are all really good. So I thouht I would try out the latest one first since it had steam achievements and had modern graphics.   Well at least I have the other games of the series that are actually FUN to play. So ya... If you get this game, It had better be beacuse you bought the Flatout bundle like I did. And when you do pick up the bundle (for cheap) make sure to hide this game in you're steam library.   Step 1: Find Flatout 3 in your Library under the 'Games' tab. Step 2: Right click Flatout 3 and click 'set Categories' from the list of options. Step 3: Click little box near the bottom left corner that says 'Hide this game in my library' &amp; finally Step 4: Have the peace of mind knowing you hid an embarassing game from your steam library. And people that may look on your Steam profile will never know you had this garbage amongst your collection of ACTUAL games. :-)
845	0	a	I LOVE Flatout, Flatout 2 and Flatout Ultimate Carnage (even though UC is a rehash of Flatout 2) and so I bought this without a second thought. That was a mistake. This game is NOTHING like the originals, the car handling is dreadful, the graphics are awful and the gameplay has none of the originality and all out fun of its predecessors. Avoid this title at all costs. To call it sh*t would be an insult to faeces. Instead buy the first three games and mourn the fact that we'll probably never see a sequel as good.
846	0	a	This looks lke some sell out bullcrap you would find on  flonga.com ... if you want a good flatout game get any of the 3 games that are not this one or get next car game. this is a total waste of money.
847	0	a	Very disapointing, the other games in the series are excellent, play those instead.
848	0	a	Someone was either high, drunk or both when coding the driving physics for this game. Absolutely atrocious and not at all like its predecessors (and sequel). Do not buy.
849	0	a	I'm a fan of the FlatOut series, and I bought this on release thinking it would be the latest and greatest. But this game is tough to get into, if not for the fact that the controls operate like your gamepad is begging for an immediate and swift death. The adrenaline of Ultimate Carnage is ill-supported here and the game lacks a lot of the punch that made past titles great.  Worth noting - this game was made by a third party studio, not the one responsible for the earlier games.
850	0	a	This might be the worst game I've ever played. Literally nothing in human life can be worse than this. Surely this is what rock bottom looks like and I can only go up from here.
851	0	a	waste of money, the cars handle poorly. i wouldn't reccomend the game even if it was free
852	0	a	Easily the worse racing game I have ever played.
853	0	a	One of the worst games made. Still waiting on a good follow up for Flatout 2...
854	0	a	Absolute crap. Threw away everything that made the series great. Aweful gameplay. Mediocre graphics. Terrible multiplayer. They even screwed up the stunts!  Don't buy this.
855	0	a	Unbelievable . . . I remember when I was a kid having a homework deadline and throwing it together at the last minute not caring for the details or the quality .. That is exactly what this game is. If you don't believe me, go ahead and waste your money on it. The first FlatOut is a MAJOR improvement over this latest release. These guys must have given up or just not cared?? I don't know, but it's just plain awful.  0 Stars (I would vote negative if possible).
856	0	a	I own both Flatout 3 and FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage, which is a improved Flatout 2. Flatout 3 was designed by a different team from original FlatOut series. And it totally destroyed the name of the franchise.  The control and the present are so bad compared to FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage. Other cons I can't list here, it would consume all the storage of steam.  So don't buy this, buy FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage.
857	0	a	A little bit better controller support still terrible. Not recommended for xbox controller unless you feel like tweaking the game frustratingly.
858	0	a	Even Flatout 1 is much better than this crap.
859	0	a	this isn't a Flatout series game.  the new developers only develop â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, look at the other games of 'Team 6 Studios' to understand how much awful is Flatout 3 compared to Flatout 1, 2 or Ultimate Carange.  AND! is the first racing game that i see with glitches in the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing direction when you turn (yup, left/right).. i can expend half an hour trying to get used to the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing new physics that the devs though optimal (they are not), but how im suposed to get used to a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing turning glitch? It happens once every 2 races minimum..  :cry:
860	0	a	I played flatout ultimate carnage and i really liked the game and respected ! but this one... I dont know what is this ?!!
861	0	a	God damn this game sucks. Flatout 2 is awesome. This one is utter â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
862	0	a	Just don't, okay?
863	0	a	Unplayable horrible crap. Don't waste your money for that piece of garbage.
864	0	a	Well.. This is definitly not FlatOut. This might have been a decent game some 10 years ago, totaly not worth the money. They tried something with physics, which are way off. Graphicaly the game sucks, neither cartoonish nor real. There is no ingame music. If you ever loved the flatout series, stop with no. 2. I cannot believe someone would publish this and think it is an okay game to follow in the flatout series.
865	0	a	By far the worst game and greatest missuse of a game series name ever. Don't buy, in fact: run away, fast.
866	0	a	This game is not worth a single penny. Don't buy no mather if it's 110%off on sale. FlatOut 2 was a great game. I'm not sure what went wrong here but something did and it's really bad.
867	0	a	Could this be the worst game ever made?
868	0	a	 Racing with a Broken Axle
869	0	a	Just Don't.
870	0	a	I am a big fan of Flatout 2. I couldn't believe all the bad reviews about Flatout 3, after all... how much can go completely wrong if you expand upon a great game?  Basically Flatout 3 is completely different. And it has no redeeming qualities. Stay away.
871	0	a	This game is trash.
872	0	a	It's so bad that I can't even find words for it. Feels unreal, looks ugly, plays horrible. Go and play Flatout 2: UC again, not this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t.  -1/10
873	0	a	this game is not worth $30.00, its not even worth $1.99 i bought it for with the other three games
874	0	a	Flatout 3 is a joke to the great Flatout Franchise, You are better off checking out Ultimate Carnage or Flatout 2 for your destruction derby needs.  The game is something else, car handling and menus are some of the worst i've seen and you can really feel that this game has been thrown together to just grab your money. Stay the frack away from this title.  The main reason why this game is so diffrent (and therefor worse then Flatout 1/2 and Ultimate Carnage) is because its diffrent developer for this game (Not Bugbear). So i can't even call it a 'Flatout' Game... this is... something else.
875	0	a	Joke. I describe this as a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, non-organized stack of codes. There is no graphics, nor sound, nor gameplay. Upon opening up this program, all that is left in you is complete pain. If you loved Flat Out series before, continue playing those old games because this is done by completely different people, who most likely have no idea how to create a playable game.
876	0	a	The best feature was the uninstal option.
877	0	a	Played for 5 minutes and already hate it! It was impossible to come in first place even if I didn't wreck the entire race. Drifting was pointless since the physics were garbage. I should have listened to all the bad reviews when I bought it, but thankfully I didn't pay full price.
878	0	a	you would think that since this is one of the most hated products on steam that they would get the hint that it sucks and drops the price especialy since it came out in 2011 and it is 2016 and in that time no one has ever liked it.
879	0	a	One of the worst racing games I have ever played.
880	0	a	They totally â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ a good series with this game.
881	0	a	There are -bad games, -horrificly broken games, -horrificly broken bad games,  ...and then there's Flatout 3.
882	0	a	Team 6 studios dropped the ball so hard on this one, I can't even find words to describe how bad it is.
883	0	a	A few years ago, I baught the FlatOut Complete Pack when it was on sale. when I tried to launch this game, it would never launch and I spent hours searching on the internet on how to fix it. I finally got it to work just so I could find out how terrible the game is (even not looking at it as a FlatOut game, its terrible) 10 minutes of gameplay and I asked myself, why did steam just throw in the #1 worst rated game on steam with 3 great racing games? And WHY does it cost more than the ones bugbear made?
884	0	a	Wow, Just WOW.  Ok, I'm just going to tell you my experience with this game. My entire 8 minutes, That's all I played of this, and that's all I will EVER play of this. So, I've heard past reviews, I've seen videos of it, And I was convinced that this was a disgrace. So how did I end up with it? Because I bought the pack that came with it. I legit only wanted Flatout 1 &amp; 2, and this thing tagged along with Ultimate Carnage (can't get that to work, but that's probably still way better than this). Because of that, I decided to try it. 'Maybe it isn't so bad,' I thought to myself. 'Maybe it's just a letdown and that's why it's lower rated than Ride to Hell: Retribution.'  Oh, I was wrong. So, SO wrong.  So, after this thing eats 11GB of my hard drive (yes, 11 Gigabytes of valuable space), I hit play and brace myself. The loading screen pops up, the game loads, and I configure my controller. I choose a race, select my car and character, there's another loading screen, and the race starts.  Now, here's my first of many problems with this game. The visuals. Why do all the cars look like the toy cars from that Burnout Paradise DLC? Excuse me, even worse than those? Not to mention the stage I was racing in was completely bland and uninteresting, with only right corners. Yes, only 90 degree turns in this stage. Even Flatout 1 had curved corners in it's first track. And yes, I know this was done by a different studio then Bugbear, the original creators, but still, have some variety in your stages to get the player interested (not like I was to begin with).   Second of all, and by far the biggest complaint from everyone who's played this, the controls and physics. DEAR GOD. The car turned so stiff around the corners. It was literally the most unresponsive control in a racing game I've ever experienced. And the physics? Do you know how crazy and wacky the physics were in previous Flatout games? Well, there's little to no physics here. When the car hit the one ramp in the stage, it was like it was on a preset jump path. It only went up and down, it didn't even turn to the side. It was kinda like that jump in the original Ridge Racer. Except this isn't 1994 or on a Playstation 1, this game was released in 2011. Also, do you know what was one of Flatout's main selling points or what made it fun? The crashes and ragdoll physics. Here, you tap one wall going 30 miles per hour and explode. And there's no ragdoll cam. And it doesn't even look cool. Have any of the developers who made this even play or SEE a Flatout game before? Because it doesn't feel like it.  And now for my last point which kinda ties into the physics point, the stunts. That's right, I actually played a different mode after the race. I tried something that I don't think anyone did before. I went one step further and tried a stunt event.  So, after the stunt stage loads, I hit the accelerate button, press eject at the ramp and.... OH MY GOD WHAT? If you don't know (which you probably don't), you can pick different characters/ragdolls at the menu. I picked the first guy, who has a trenchcoat on. When I launched him during the stunt, it cut to a ragdoll camera for once. And, well.... You know how sometimes games have that bug where a hair piece or piece of clothing stretch out in an odd way? Like into a wall or something? Well, my ragdoll's trenchcoat did that the first time. Then I retried the stunt, and it did it again. I actually think the developers gave up after the first stage of this game and never bug tested it. You hear that a lot with â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, undeveloped games, but I truly thought that when I saw it.   So.... in conclusion, don't buy this. Please don't buy this abysmal mess. Even if you got it with the pack, don't download it. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ graphics, controls, physics, this game has it all. Did I mention that this takes up 11GB of space? I did, but did I also mention this game costs $30 normally? THIRTY DOLLARS? You can actually get Flatout 1 and 2 on sale, which are way WAY better than this for less. Even when this thing is on sale right now (at the time of posting this), you can still get the original 2 for less.  I now know why everyone despises this game. Why it's the lowest rated game on Steam. And it's still up.  Don't waste your time with this game. It took me longer to type this than play it, and this was a better experience than that.
885	0	a	'Feel the cringe pulse through your body as you barrel through boring and ugly race tracks against braindead AI, unresponsive controls, muddy graphics and horrendous sound-desing.'  Thank you alot, Team 6, for destroying my absolute favourite game franchise. This kind of garbage should never have been created...
886	0	a	Wow, just... wow. I know people are saying this game is bad but you have no idea until you've played it. I honestly don't know what they're smoking to be charging Â£24.99 for this. It's just awful. You know a game is bad when half the recommended reviews are negative reviews.   The graphics, especially on the cars themselves are terrible, even for 2011 and on top of that it runs like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on Ultra and I couldn't stomach what I saw when I turned the graphics down a few notches. I don't even think it has a licensed soundtrack which is like, 70% of what makes any racing game good (for me, I'm well aware the percentage is a lot lower for most). They should erase this game from existence and call Ultimate Carnage FlatOut 3. Unless you buy this in a bundle with the others don't ever let this one near your library. You will get a headache like Michael Flatley was dancing on your face.
887	0	a	Is this even FlatOut? This game is really bad. It would be good if this was a tablet game but for PC is this some kind of sick joke? Even the first FlatOut had better graphics. This game is total fail. It Should be called Chaos and Destruction.
888	0	a	Do not get.  If you want a racing game based around destruction then get flatout 2, because this game is not anything like it says. this game is TERRIBLE!   If you play the previous flatouts, you will understand why i hate this, this THING more than Ride to Hell.
889	0	a	Horrible. I'd rather cheer on my own firing squad than ever play this game again.
890	0	a	SUCKS BALLS!!!! the 1 one and the 2 one were the best!!!
891	0	a	It came with the flatout pack, i regret playing this one.
892	0	a	ItÂ´s bad... I mean absolutely horrible
893	0	a	Avoid at all costs. Worst flat out game in the series. Unnatural controls and visually unnattractive for its time.
894	0	a	  0/10  
895	0	a	Let me give you the TL;DR right now. Worst game ever.  I played a single race (yes I made it that far, so I earned the right to judge the game). I immediately remembered a really funny parody of the FPS games of that era. Duty Calls. Now for those who aren't familiar with this name, let me describe it briefly. Duty Calls is a parody of many FPS games, based on Call of Duty franchise. It was made as an advertisement for Bulletstorm, whose trailer played at the end of this mocking game, with the message being 'nowadays FPS are like the one you just played, here is what it is supposed to be like (Bulletstorm trailer begins)'. Flatout 3 felt exactly like that. 'Here is a crappy racing game to depict everything wrong with racing games today, and now, real Flatout 3 begins where you get to have super fun just like you had in the previous games, even ultimate carnage, which was basically flatout 2 re-sold to you suckers, but turned out to be pretty good anyway'. Disappointment begins... It was no joke, no 'real' Flatout 3 started. Flatout 3 really is the horrible.... ummm..... I can't really say that it's a game.... It's...... a software...... where you control...... no not control........ more like........ watch a car that was based on the drawings of a drunk newborn...... cruise in a city designed by a band of autistic apes...... and think that you contribute to its behaviour by pressing certain buttons on the controller.  Ok jokes aside. Graphics are extremely unfinished. Simple and undetailed, but not intentionally, just due to lack of skill and/or effort. Just look at the screenshots. At the first glance they look pretty decent. Now look closer. Inspect details. Don't tell me it's a 2011 game. Compare it to DiRT or just Flatout UC. You will see it has horrible graphics.  Controls just don't matter. You don't feel in control of the vehicle, not even a little bit. The car just goes vroom vroom. No realism, no control, no fun. For those who will bash me for looking for realism, just go play the previous games. You will see what I mean. Junker cars used to slide, drift, bump, etc. Now they just perfectly hover over the asphalt. When you try to turn, it either doesn't turn enough (if you're too fast), or turns successfully (if you're slow enough). It doesn't drift, slide unless you pull the handbrake. But if you use nitro when your car is aligned with the road, it just immediately and magically stops sliding and continues it's hovering over the road. Here is a short list of games that offer a better and more realistic driving experience: Asphalt 8 (iOS and Android), The Need for Speed (1994), FIFA '96. Also, I'm using a Logitech F710. When I set the controls to the gamepad, it stops working. If I set them to keyboard I can use my gamepad with xinput mode. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ logic!  Sounds. There are 4 sounds in total. One of them is the menu sound 'click'. Three in game sounds are 'vroom', 'bfffttt', and 'dufff'. Now 'vroom' is the engine sound made by the cars engines. The sound was produced by a pair of bored game devs, that just made the sound with their mouth. I can almost hear one of them saying 'screw the consumers, they will buy our games anyway', in the middle of the sound recording session, faintly hidden behind the sound of the engine. 'bfffttt' is the sound nitrous makes, and the artistic creation of this amazing sound was most likely based on an air refresher spray. 'dufff' is the collision sound used in every single collision to every single combination of objects. Again, it was probably made by devs dropping a heavy pillow from a distance.   Music. Literally non-existent.  Car tuning. Do you remember the simple, yet fun car modification system Flatout used to offer? It's gone. Here is the new system. 'Would you like to tune the car?' [Yes/No]. If you choose yes, then the car is 'tuned' by standards seen fit by the devs. I swear to god, I am laughing at the stupidity of this, as I'm writing, while crying on the inside because it isn't even slightly exaggerated. Ladies and gentlemen, a new era of modification begins where cars are either 'tuned' or 'aren't'.  Please just watch a single gameplay footage from any source. Even the official game trailers give you an idea of how ridiculous this game is. Don't take any of my word for it. Just look it up on youtube yourself. Watch some videos and see for yourself that every single sentence you read here, is describing that video.  I bought the Complete pack for 10$. I am not sorry because I love Flatout games. I played them on PS2 for long hours. I am glad to have 1, 2 and UC in my steam library for just 10$. But if you want a Flatout game, just buy UC. 2 was better than 1, even though 1 was a pretty solid game itself. And UC is just a graphically and realistically superior game, that is essentially Flatout 2 with additional content.
896	0	a	Worst of Flatout series
897	0	a	Just pretend this game doesn't exist.  Buy 'Wreckfest' instead, it's made by the people that made Flatout 1 and 2

914	0	a	The worst game I ever played....... The waste!
915	0	a	~~~~~WARNING~BAD~GAME~~~~~  this HAD potential, it has loads of different race types and minigames BUT BE WARNED this was NOT made by the same group that made the other 3 flatout games.   this disaster of a game has worse driving mechanics than one of those free cell phone games. the music, graffix, gameplay, driving physics, damage models, racetracks, and non-existant distructable enviroment ALL SUCK beyond what even EA at its worst made.   NOTHING ABOUT THIS GAME IS WORTH BUYING
916	0	a	This game doesnt deserve the flatout name for sure, the game doesn't feel or look like a flatout game, some of its maps are good, arena mode has to be the best of all modes but yet nothing compared to the real flatout, handeling is bad, crashes are bad, jumps feel terrible, visual damage is meh, cars are meh, multiplayers doesnt seem to work, graphics are blelow standards of its time and heavyish, and most of the stunt modes are crap, the game had potencial, maybe if they refined some stuff and fixed the game bugs it could be something good, but wat it really did was ruin a great franchise... I Just got this game bc the flatout complete pack was the same price as this game and it was included, otherwise i would never buy this game.
917	0	a	No long winded review. Bottom line, this game fails on every level. The new developer released a pale imitation of the original BUGBEAR classic. It's not worth anything above FREE.
918	0	a	Flatout 3, simply put, is just bad. This is what happens when a different developer tires to take advantage of an existing franchise with 3 previous titles. The first time I played this, it was so very different from the previous FlatOut games I didnt really know what to think. After a few hours, I was disappointed. Flatout 2 and Ultimate Carnage are a better choice.
919	0	a	Complete â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Worst flatout game ever. Even flatout 1 was 10 times better than this piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
920	0	a	this game is one of the worst racing game I've ever played. Graphics is really bad too. First flat out have better textures than this crap.  Definitely don't buy this game!
921	0	a	I'd rather have a brick thrown at me then play this game.
922	0	a	In this review, I will put as much effort as they have put into this game.  Don't buy it.
923	0	a	I got this on sale and I didn't expect much. But ho-ly crap this game is awful. This is not the flatout in have grown to love. Its... it's... just horrible game with cars in it and don't get my started on the physics. You could ram some one at full force and it.  
924	0	a	---
925	0	a	Honestly, not good. Not flatout. Poop. This game is just poop. Smelly, painful, sick poop.  Poopout 3: Poop and Pooping.
926	0	a	This game would be an alright game if it didnt have the flatout name. Its actually kinda fun, just get used to the framerate. Nothing above 60 for me. On very very low settings. (AMD quadcore 2.2GHz cpu and AMD Radeon R5 1gb. Not the best, but i should be able to run it better.) You get to unlock tracks and race in unique cars. I had fun playing this for the first time, but i cannot recomend it.  Pros: -unlocking tracks if fun -racing is satisfying -unique cars and gamemodes (i.e. you can kill zombies, drive monstertrucks, ect.)  Cons: -terrible framerate -poorly optimized -doesnt feel like flatout -physics are TERRIBLE -ai isnt great -graphics arent that good for the fps -feels like the devs focused on making more characters, which have no effect on your racing, than real content  Graphics: 4/10 Gameplay:6/10 ai:5/10 satisfaction:7/10 overall: 5/10  GET IT ON SALE IF AT ALL
927	0	a	This game is horrible, it is not the flatout we know and love (if you are a fan). I was a fan of all of the previous flatout games, but this is trash with my reasons for calling this below.   1. The physics of the car feels like you're driving on ice, and the cars don't respond as expected at all. 2.The menu system is horrible. 3.It looks like they picked random models online and gave them names and a random bio. 4.The game is no-longer made by bugbear interactive, this is probably why its completely different. Its still published by the same company however. 5.This game doesn't feel like a member of the flatout series at all, i wish they would have released it as something else.  Things they got right?: 1. Integrated music player, its nice having your own music.   I really wanted to like this and i was genuinely excited to see it appear, but now i'm just â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off one of my favorite racing game series has been ruined completely. Stick to flatout 1 &amp; 2!!!
928	0	a	Not the worst driving game ever, but if you loved the hell out of FlatOut 2 and/or FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage, then this release by a different developer will be a big disappointment. Still, it's not all that terrible, really, if you're not familiar with the older games (but they did make good effort to address issues). I would still recommend FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage instead (or FlatOut 2 for older computers); and/or if feeling adventurous, the next-gen early access Next Car Game from the ex-FlatOut devs. [Other great similar ones: Burnout Paradise, DiRT Showdown]
929	0	a	Worst racing game of all time? Quite possibly.
930	0	a	Kind of hard to belive how bad this game is.
931	0	a	Horrible game not even better than flat out 2. Do not buy this s*itty game. Not even made by bugbear. Like a insult to Bugbear the horrible creators of this game.

933	0	a	This is a FlatOut game in name only. It shares none of the good qualities the previous games had. The first sign I knew that this wouldn't be a quality title was the developer: Team6. If you know anything about the FlatOut series of games, you'd know that all of them were developed by BugBear Interactive. Still, I was stupid and went ahead with the purchase (only $7.49, but still, I could have bought a better game). Expecting something at least halfway decent, I got a buggy, crashing, and barely playable pile of mess dumped upon me. The physics are arguably the absolute worst thing about this game. Cars don't handle like cars, they handle like ice cubes lubed up in a messy bowl of KY His and Her jelly and butter. The graphics are just awful and look worse than the first FlatOut game, which, for reference, was released in 2004, a wopping 7 years before this pile of fail. I guess the only nice things I can say about it are the car designs themselves, the amount of them, and the amount of game modes included in the game. Other than that, avoid this like the plague. If I could get my money back, I would.  Rating: 1/10. Buy the other FlatOut games and BugBear's Next Car Game instead.
934	0	a	this is the single worst game i have ever played. some sunts are quite random, you do not have enough control and have a degreeof stupidity way beyond what was before  the racing is lame, control of vehicle is poor, some 'f1' cars understeer like a brick and grip like soap, bus drives like the moon, the car similar to the batmobile like in the anctient game gpega  you can not customize vehicles like the older ones, graphics have gone from decent to bad there is a very annoying glitch for stunts menu is worst than old one, music as well and there is splatout, just run over zombies till you die of boredom  please do not buy it, maybe wondering what about my playtime seems to generous... just hunted some achievements, which were easy (partly)  p.s. if someone recommends you this game it is because they hate you
935	0	a	Worst racing game of all time? Quite possibly.
936	0	a	Absolutly horrible. Bad physics, bad crashes, bad steering. Everything about this game is bad.
937	0	a	Not the worst driving game ever, but if you loved the hell out of FlatOut 2 and/or FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage, then this release by a different developer will be a big disappointment.

938	0	a	Kind of hard to belive how bad this game is.
939	0	a	a total scam the previous ones were wayy better then this one !i don't recommend it
940	0	a	Garbage... One of the worst games I ever play..
941	0	a	Can run every other Flatout game (which are all way better) on Ultra and cant run this for crap   Car Handling Sucks   Everything about this game other then the fact Flatout is apart of the title is bad
942	0	a	No! Never! Don't!   Enough said.
943	0	a	This game was horrible. This is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥tain on the good name of Flatout. Don't buy this garbage, even if it's on sale. Don't download it if it becomes free.  What a bad game.  
944	0	a	This is the largest load of of worthless crap ever. I mean, I demanded a refund, and I know games. Look at the metascore. You need a labotomy to actually enjoy this game.  I've bought bad games before, but never saw a game that came from a line that got progressivly better, and then melted in a game this bad.  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!! Team 6, diaf...
945	0	a	No. I can't belive they would price this game at $30!!! Ok here is why this is a negative review: It isn't anything like the other Flatout games, since it was a different developer, And it is very laggy. Also no one makes any multiplayer servers. Also it is really hard! So don't but this game! Go with the other Flatout games made by the other devs. Because this is not what your looking for!!
946	0	a	Graphic sucks, engine sucks. This game has absolutely nothing to do with the flatout series.  DON'T BUY! Don't even think about 'finding' it.
947	0	a	This is not made by Bugbear Entertainment, but a even smaller development team. It is utterly bad. Physics are not available. Keep away.
948	0	a	Only one thing! I WANT MY MONEY BACK !!!!
949	0	a	Racing games are easy to make. You put some cars on a track, make them drive around in a circle, and award the 'win' to the guy who completes the track. That's how almost every racing game works it's a simple formula.   You start at easy races, and then as your player gets 'skills' you continue to make the races harder, until he is racing almost perfect lines   Flatout 3: Chaos and Destruction doesn't seem to agree with this. It gives the player options of modes to play. There's a lot of variety here, that would be a good thing. The problem is the difficulty of this game is extreme. There's no tutorial, and the game just is very hard. If you turn the difficulty and number of cars down, the game is better, but still quite difficult.   There's no tutorials, which means there's no explanation of the boost system (it seem it awards boost for style points when near other cars, maybe?) and the AI is INCREDIBLY difficult. If you don't race near perfect on Easy, you'll lose. Even when racing perfect, you better be boosting. At medium, you don't have a shot, you probably need perfect boosts, and even then there's no rubber banding if someone gets ahead so expect to lose often.   The game has the following modes.  Race, (standard difficult race)  Challenge mode (Seems like race, couldn't beat the first challenge)  Splatout! (Kill zombies, race around the track for points)  Offroad NightShift (night driving?) Speed (Faster cars, easier to crash) MonsterTrucks Battle Arena (fight)  Big Battle (Bigger fight)  Stuntman (a variety of annoyingly hard challenges)   All of those would be amazing if done competently, but I would say none are properly executed on. Sad because I love racing games, and high adrenaline games are fun, but this does everything except get the blood pumping.   A shame but this is a very firm 'Do not recommend' If you like Racing, Dirt 3 is good, if you like carnage, Burnout Paradise is bar none the best. If you like killing 'Zombies' go play Carmageddon. But what ever you do, don't even boot up this game. It's not worth it.
950	0	a	So much â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥!
951	0	a	What has happened to one of my favorite Raceing Games ;-;
952	0	a	Very strange, I dont like it it sucks even first flatout is better!!!
953	0	a	The hell happened? This is the Worst Fallout from Fallout Series... really..
954	0	a	The worst game ever i seen. This game is not Flatout.
955	0	a	This game does not deserve to be named FlatOut.  It was NOT made by BugBear.  I'm not being an arrogant â™¥â™¥â™¥ when I say that it looks more like it was made by your 10yo brother as his first attempt at making a game.  FlatOut 2 is the one you want. FO Ultimate Carnage is an upgraded version of FO2 with both benefits and downsides. I'll go and say I like FO2 better because the Bullet GT was ... well ... nerfed, I guess... Too bad, they could have buffed the other cars instead =/
956	0	a	!!!DO NOT BUY!!!!!!DO NOT BUY!!!!!!DO NOT BUY!!!!!!DO NOT BUY!!!!!!DO NOT BUY!!! I loved the other flatout games and where super happy that this game would come around.  What i found was absolute Trash and i would not have bought it if i where you.  Graphics are rubish. the cars feel wierd. and i had FPS lag with a AMD 6970!!!!  !!!DO NOT BUY!!!!!!DO NOT BUY!!!!!!DO NOT BUY!!!!!!DO NOT BUY!!!!!!DO NOT BUY!!!
957	0	a	I love the Flatout series..I really do love it! And I heard from alot of sources that Flatout 3 is like the unwanted child of the series. But I couldn't believe it..I looked at so many reviews and tbh I thought that the gameplay doesn't even look that bad. So I tried it just now..I never ever regretted playing a game that much.  This series was once known for it's incredible driving physics and its fun races including a partly destructable circuit..well forget about that in Flatout 3: Normally you would slow down when you aren't driving on the track but offroad..well here the speed is always the same and therefore nobody drives on the track. The car flips after every single â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and the environment is non destructable. If you ram a stone then you have to respawn. Also respawning makes you stand still for a few seconds which is a huge disadvantage. There is no career mode and you have all the cars from the very beginning which sucks. There are a lot of modes, but they are either other car models or the challenge mode, where you have to complete 50 random challenges. Also the 'Stuntman' Mode is back, but because of the poor physics it is no fun.  The handling is so bad that it doesn't matter if you take a car with good handling and bad speed or bad handling and good speed, because the handling is exactly the same..utter bull****.  The Graphics are slightly better than Flatout 2 but because of the overused motion blur it looks stupid. And the best feature: If you finish below 1st in any race you automatically lose and have to start over the same â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ again..  DON'T BUY THIS JOKE OF A GAME FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!
958	0	a	I really enjoyed Flatout 1 and 2, but this here, was one of the worst games I've ever played.
959	0	a	Survived the menu. Wouldn't go further...
960	0	a	waste of money &amp; time
961	0	a	OMFG! This game is BAD. Dramatikally bad... like PS2 games... its 2004 or 2012 ??? NOT RECOMENDED AT ALL! AVOID AT ALL COST!
962	0	a	The worst 10 â‚¬ I've ever spend on STEAM D:
963	0	a	A very sad and poor shadow of what was once a great game.  Looks more dated than the original, loses all it's character and feels completely uninteresting.  Avoid.
964	0	a	Such a disapointmet... Flatout 1/2/UC are one of my favourite racing games, but this game is just terrible. Graphics are worse than in Flatout 2, but it lags as hell, even though my pc runs Crysis 2 on high settings without any problem. Music is worse, physics and camera are much worse, interface feels very uncomfortable. The only good thing about it is that it doesn't have GFWL support, when the UC did. Overall it is a really, really bad game. It wouldn't be such a big deal for me, if it wasn't a sequel to flatout games, but, unfortunately, it is and it makes it the worst game i have played in a last few years.
965	0	a	I can't belive i paid money for this tripe. Flatout 1 is worlds better than this. Do yourself a favor and get the previous titles to this series. For starters, the gameplay is absolutely broken with garbage physics,  nonexistant handiling, and incredibly bad AI there is no reason to try to play this game. The visuals are late PS1 early PS2 quality, with way too much motion blur and bloom that can cause siezures there should be a warning to those that have epilepsy; the courses themselves are unimaginative and poorly put together. The cars look and feel like rejects from a Hot Wheels game along with some that  were foisted from the previous FlatOut titles to give some impression that this is a sequel.  There is no structure to the gameplay mechanics, for starters the damage calculations are randomly generated so hitting an opponent can result in either doing little to no damage to you or taking most of your health away. There are no boundries on the tracks so you pretty much can drive where you want with no penalties. There is no way to regain boost except crossing checkpoints; hitting cars or objects does nothing here. If they want you to use boost to 'heal' your car then they should have more ways to obtain it.  The tracks seem to be made to fully expliot the nonexistant handling and for most of time you are riding the handbrake to get around the corners. There are tuning options for your car but they make no difference here.  The AI is the worst seen in any racing game; from the start they just smash into each other and into objects for no reason. In derby mode they all pile up on you and in no time your car is running on a sliver of health while your oppenents have most of theirs.   The game modes themselves are poor attempts at variety, speed mode is depressingly easy to win on account of the absymal AI. Offroad is the only mode that elevates this game to very bland. Nightshift is almost impossible to win because of the deplorable handling. Stunt is probably the worst here in that the requirements to win are so arbitrarily steep and each stunt course can only be figured out through trial and error( there is no tutorials here like in the previous titles) as well as being poorly put together that when you do win it you have no incentive to do it again. Challenge mode is just an excuse from the developers to extend gameplay. Even monster truck mode had any fun removed by the lousy handling, bad physics, and damage calculations.  There is nothing to say about mulitplayer because that is simply broken.  This game is nothing more than a cynical cash grab from Strategy First to profit from the FlatOut name along with the technical incompentence of Team6 games in developing this sorry excuse for a game it can be safe to say that the FlatOut we know and love is now too badly damaged that there is little hope that it can be brought back.
966	0	a	This game is not from Bugbear (original Flatout-Series). The graphic, enviroment and driving mechanics is totally bad and looks and feels like a free to play student project.
967	0	a	The devs for this game RUINED IT!!!! Bugbear had such a good game in the first two, but this is GARBAGE!!! so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Glad I got this on sale.....
968	0	a	Read the forum first ! If you've played the other flatout games first and think this is the same bewarned it's not. It's a really poor attempt to cash in on the previous game's success. Also for some reason my gamepad suffers from dreadful input lag. Can i be bothered to search for a cure... no, not really. I will write the cash of as a bad investment and make a mental note to read the forum first before buying anymore of steam special offers. Steam you should really look at what your offering people!  Cheap does not always = bargain. :(
969	0	a	Not even as a gag gift.
970	0	a	This game has nothing to do with the first great two instalments developed by Bugbear as it's developed by a bunch of other people. This game is bad on so many levels that it is hard to find the right words. Do yourself a favor and avoid it if you liked the first two Flatouts, otherwise you'll vomit after 5 minutes into the game.
971	0	a	Buy it when it was -75%.....Worst spended 4 bucks ever in my life, Flatout 1&amp;2 much more better than this piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥,   Nearly month ago i played in NFS III Hot persuit (1998 year game) with my wife for fun (There 2 players can play on 1 PC) - that game also much more better than this)))))
972	0	a	Of all the racing/driving games I have ever played, and I've played alot, this has got to be the absolute worst steaming pile of runny dog turd of them all. The physics are bad, the controls are bad, the car damage is bad, the sound is bad. IT'S JUST PLAIN BAD! These game developers have got to know they are making a sh*t game and they are making it. It just feels like this is the first game they have ever made. Luckily I got this on sale as a bundle with all the other Flatout games. I'll stick with those.
973	0	a	Please for the love of god don't buy this game not even worth Â£1

977	0	a	This game is nothing like the previous game in the series (and i don't mean it in a good way).It's totally different than FlatOut 2. And you know what I say about Flaout 3? IT FLATOUT SUCKS!
978	0	a	Survived the menu. Wouldn't go further...
979	0	a	I really enjoyed Flatout 1 and 2, but this here, was one of the worst games I've ever played.
980	0	a	Bad: Graphics, worse than FO1 Worse: Physics Worst: It carries the name 'FlatOut'  Good: You can uninstall it Better: It actually DOES uninstall Best: No one forces me to ever pay it again.  13% of positive Reviews (as of March 2016) You have been warned, they are right.
981	0	a	this game is a complete ripoff, I want my money back, I want the time I wasted downloading back. I want someone at steam to feel the pain I feel for being ripped of by them It's like a kick in the nuts. luckily it was the summer sale and they only ripped me off for half the price of this garbage. I believe I may have made my last steam purchase.
982	0	a	If you were a fan of the origional Flatout Series, this Isn't the game you're looking for. This game has an arcade type of feel versues the origional Flatout's more realistic feel, and quite frankly I hate it.
983	0	a	Do NOT buy this game, it might say Flatout in the name, but it was not made my the same developer. Not that a different developer could do a good job, but in this case it is horrible. I bought this game back when it was new, because I blindly assumed I would be getting Flatout 3, not a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ arcade racer made by â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ monkeys.  Buy all the other Flatout games, 1 &amp; 2 they will give you entertainment. The original developer Bugbear was even so dissapointed with the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Flatout 3 that they are now working on a REAL Flatout 3 called Next Car Came:  http://nextcargame.com/ 
984	0	a	I bought the complete FlatOut Bundle just because it was on sale. I knew that FlatOut 3 is a completly mess and it was made from another developer studio. My idea was to buy all the three FlatOut games and ignore FlatOut 3. I can't even remove this  â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥  game from my library, if i do then i remove all the FlatOut games completly. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you Team 6 &amp; Strategy First, now i have AIDS on my library.  Forever. 
985	0	a	What were they thinking??  Flatout 2 &gt; Flatout 3 I feel like Flatout 2 was released after Flatout 3...
986	0	a	almost nothing like the first. series went from being a fairly original game to another generic burnout clone.
987	0	a	How is this even real?
988	0	a	flatout ultimate carnage is better
989	0	a	This game has the worst graphics, the worst physics and everything. Its waste of money. If you want to play FlatOut, get FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage. Atleast it was created by the original creator of Flatout. This Team 6 has totally â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ the great game.
990	0	a	worst game ever played! has absolutely nothing in common with FO1 and 2 (except for the name)  bad physics, crappy steering...
991	0	a	I don't uusally trust Metacritic but this time the score for this game is right, FlatOut 3 was a complete mistake, I have no clue how this can even be called flatout, I have played bad generic racing games in the past but this takes the cake. It actually does have a lot of game modes but with bad gameplay like this they're basically worthless, avoid this game, if it's even called that.
992	0	a	An absolute shocker of a game. Poor graphics, driving physics. What were they thinking when they released this? If i could get a refund i would. The sort of game that should have been strangled at birth along with whoever decided this was fit for purpose!!!
993	0	a	I hate this game,  I loved the first two flatout games. this one just does not feel like the flatout games i'm used to.
994	0	a	Absolute worst game ever made! Steer away from this!
995	0	a	Don't ever think of getting this, no matter how cheap. I'm a fan of FlatOut and FlatOut 2 and didn't even finish the first race in this.  It's bizarrely bad, the kind of bad that makes you pause in awe of its epic, sweeping suckitude and instills you with the immediate urge to warn other people lest their lives too will be tainted. There is no point in getting into details about the different aspects of this game. Just assume it's worse than any racing game you have ever played in every aspect.  I'm not exaggerating. Don't be like me. It's not too late for you. You can still save yourself.  Don't get FlatOut. It doesn't run on modern machines. Don't get FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage. It's Windows Live. Get FlatOut 2 and wait for Next Car Game.
996	0	a	Absolute worst game ever made! Steer away from this!
997	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
998	0	a	Even web flash racing games are better.
999	0	a	Flatout 3, looks visually better than Flatout 1 and Flatout 2, but the controls and gameplay are utter rubbish. This game is nothing at all like the first two and should never have been released. Complete waste of time.
1000	0	a	I think this game keeps crashing because it is my computer looking out for my best interests. Because when this game works, it is the equivalent of self-inflicted pain. Thankfully it came as a package deal with FO1 and FO2 so it wasn't a total loss.  0/10
1001	0	a	Maby I was expecting too much. What I wanted from this game was something like Flatout 2, with that fun, cartoony art style and derby/racing game. First off, this game has aggonizingly slow load times and I run this game on a fairly modern computer! The soundtrack is so dark and mysterious which doesn't help with that fun part either. I also dislike how if you looked at Flatout 2 and Flatout 3, you would not see anything that represents each other. Set aside the bad stuff, I do like how this game looks, it looks absolutely goregous and I have to say I wasn't expecting Flatout 3 to be looking this good. I also like how you can finally choose your character which was something that was highly requested throughout the Flatout franchise. I also like how there is a whole new selection of cars to choose from. I don't like how there is no car from any of the previous Flatout games in Flatout 3. The number one thing that really bugs me the most, is the physics of this game, they are NOTHING like any other Flatout games, same with the camera angles. I won't get too much into detail with that because I have so much to rant on about with the camera angles and physics. I will probably play this game again being me who doesn't want to accept the fact that one of his most beloved franchises is now ruined by one simple game. I'd give it a 5/10.
1002	0	a	Bad bad game. Weak controls. Horrible track design. Races rely too much on gaining and using boost to instead of good driving skills while the track design tries to discourage using boost because of an insane number of tight turns on the tracks.   Stick with any of the other previous Flatouts or jump into Next Car Game.
1003	0	a	I know what you're thinking. It can't be that bad. You're thinking 'I liked Flatout 2 so this will be like more of that'. It's not. It's like an N64 game graphics, even on ultra. It's terrible.
1004	0	a	Horrible physics, horrible experience, horrible audio, cringy characters. Buy Ultimate Carnage instead
1005	0	a	Don't bother. Just play the original Flatout and be happy. At least that game seemed to be complete. Production values (and spell-check) were just abysmal here.
1006	0	a	i got the whole flatout collection while it on sale. I understand why the views are so bad now lol. Just lol. Still though 3 out of 4 games in the collection are great. If you bought the collection don't waste your hdd space with 3.

1013	0	a	It took me 2 minutes to find out that this game is a complete disgrace to the Flatout franchise. The next 3 minutes I spent playing the game consisted of idling in the main menu to be eligible to write a review of the game. Awful!

1018	0	a	Take Carmageddon, take out the gore, the good gameplay, and add some new cars to it, upgrade the graphics to  Worse-Than-FlatOut 2  tier, mix it with horrible performance and put it in the oven for 25 minutes at 200Â°C.  Wonderful, you've got FlatOut 3! Except it's not wonderful. In fact, throw it in the trash and think about what you just did.  This game is the downfall of the FlatOut franchise. Not only because it was made by a game dev studio that usually does Wii games. No, this game also lacks of pretty much everything that made FlatOut fun. Realistic damage models, good driving physics, nice visuals, funny minigames, multiplayer fun. This game has nothing of those. In fact, it is probably the purchase I regret the most. Not only because the game is not worth the money, but also because you get nothing for your money.   All your good expectations are shattered in the very first race. The driving feels awful, the physics are horrible and don't get me started on the damage model. You'd expect a game that looks like this to run smoothly, but it doesn't.  I don't even know if I want to go trough the pain of writing a full review here, but there's not much to say than  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU EXPECT THE FLATOUT EXPERIENCE .  Please support the  real  FlatOut 3 instead, Bugbears 'Next Car Game' which you may find in the recommendations above.
1019	0	a	not such a gud gaem would buy ultimate carnage over this but this gaem is gud for people that like fast stuff that they do not understand
1020	0	a	I once started playing Flatout (1) as a demo. This was car racing the way I like it! The stunt modes were fun, but not a part I find necessary in this game. It was the arcade style of driving, not too difficult for anyone. It was the focus on damage, so you could earn money for new cars even by driving the wrong way! The upgrading system is a bit RPG-ish and keeps you going for more. I have bought all Flatout games since then. Flatout 2? Better. Flatout, Ultimate Carnage? Better again. I still play it every now and then, it's still parked on my HD. Just because it's fun without restrictions.  So, everyone considering buying Flatout 3: DON'T DO IT!!  Go for the old one's instead, preferably Ultimate Carnage. Flatout 3 is everything the earlier games aren't. It's from a different developer and they managed to mess up everything that gave Flatout it's distinct quality. Racing arcade style is no fun anymore, there is hardly a damage model. It's a WASTE OF MONEY!  Keep an eye on Bugbear, they still exist. I do not pray, but for a good follow-up of the old Flatout games? I am on my knees..
1021	0	a	Dont â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ yourself up dont buy this game.
1022	0	a	the biggest piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ive ever played they took a mentally challanged kid and let him make the physics and animations with a crayon no offence if your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. this game isnt worth the $2 i payed. flatout 2 was better then this piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ or even better that glitchy â™¥â™¥â™¥ goat simulator was better than this piece of horse â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ shit. id rather cut my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off and eat it. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it out then have it sewn back on rather than playing this another 5 seconds. this is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t if you buy this BE WARNED this game is 100% â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. they make it look good for kids and young adults then you say oh nice game. (flatout 3 says) GOTCHA â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ grabs you by the hand and pulls you in its glitchy â™¥â™¥â™¥ white pedo van and glitches itself allover the road while you are stuck bounded and tied while getting it anal by the creators. SUMMARY dont buy it ever.
1023	0	a	I would like to at least get some steam achivements out of this game. The Game sucks so bad its really hard to want to play. The only reson this game will get any play from me is for the achiavements, but I will hate every minute of it.   If this game was like 4.99 then I might not feel ripped off, but I still would not like it that much. Even at 4.99 this game is boring. It dos not even feel arcadey. I was not expecting a sim. I was expecting something fun. Only the players with the least of skill may like this game, like young children.   May be Good for children under 7
1024	0	a	DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was under the impression that Steam retailed reputable games, to later find out that this is total garbage, I have owned this game for a long time and have only been able to play it for a few hours, I can understand the lack of support because there are no micro purchases in the game for steam to make extra money off, I personally believe that steam should show some integrity and dignity by refunding or compensating the people that bought this game and were dissatisfied with the end product, Steam Credit would be acceptible,  The Fact that steam would sell such an inferior product goes to show a lack of integrity and poor customer support to the people who, at the end of the day, support them.  Be wise with your purchases people, just as with many retail/sales people/companies, they will promise you and tell you everythin you want to hear, but as soon as the transaction is done, any misleading information, inferior quality product will be left in your hands and you will be told that it was your fault for not researching the quality of the game or services.  If this was an automobile, It's a LEMON and just like car dealers, Steam does not care as soon as you drive off the car lot, they got their $$$$$ why should they care about you anymore?
1025	0	a	9/11 won't recommend   FlatOut 1 is still the best
1026	0	a	After playing the new one only for about an hour, I tend to say that every other Flatout part is more fun when it comes to the mini-games. I will keep you up-to-date, when I have digged a bit more into it.  But you can't go any wrong with Flatout 2 or Ultimate Carnage. (Only Flatout 1 and 2 are moddable!)
1027	0	a	Rating: Abysmal 0.5/10  one of the worst games released on Steam
1028	0	a	DO NOT GET THIS GAME ITS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Flatout UC was an awesome arcade racer and this is just crap. The gfx even seem to be worse!
1839	1	a	It just looks really ugly. Also, you're a car magnet, apparently.
1841	1	a	'Is it really bad that I actually enjoy this game despite how crappy it is...I mean sure the Cars feel like driving HoverBoats and what not and the Damage physics compared to the rest are crap...But for some damn reason I semi enjoy playing this game despite all of the Graphic's and the Game Concept..I wouldn't really recommend this game for anyone else but some people out there may enjoy this game..I guess'
1843	1	a	Pretty fun game to play only the graphics are a bit low :S  6/10
1845	1	a	This most be the badest game EVER! 1. The craphics are F* up 2. Too many opponent cars 3. No realistic fetures (real speed limit, driving posibilities etc.) 4. NOT A SINGLE GOOD MUSIC TRACK
1847	1	a	POSSIBLY WORST GAME EVER !!! dont buy it !!! it has more glitches then it will ever have players !!!!!!! it is SOï»¿ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ !!!!! ur cars are clued to the ground they NEVER lift off (when i say never i mean never)! So annoying :(
1849	1	a	So far I've not had any problems with this and I'm having fun with it. Sure it's not worth the full asking price but when it gets discounted then it is maybe worth a look. It might be because I've not played the earlier games in this franchise, but I don't see why everyone seems to hate this game so much.

1853	1	a	NEVER BUY this 'game', arcade conversion from console, nothing like FLATOUT or FLATOUT 2 :(
1855	1	a	Ok, I was honestly expecting that the latest release of Flatout will be the best so far. I have never been so wrong in my entire life and yet they got the name right: 'chaos&amp;destructrion' which fits perfectly to my hopes and dreams about this game. But here it goes, allow me to start with the good parts of this 'masterpiece':  +it has steamworks +it has achievements +it has multiplayer and works well with the steam incorporation +it gives you a good reason to appreciate the classics and your life in general +it has wacky looking characters and vehicles, always good for a good laugh (since this entire game is a laughing matter)  And now...for the long and tedious negative list...I could probably just sum it up to: 'It sucks!', but I will mention just a few of the downgrades (in comparison to it's predecessor it seems lesser of a game) and downfalls of the game:  -it crashes, sudden unavoidable and uncontrollable exit of the game (I have everything up to date, but not only for me, but also for others...it just gives an error and crashes) -bad handling (not sure if this game was supposed to have handling that you would only see in those old car games, really rudimentary and quite disappointing) -bad graphics (I know I played it on low, but I wasn't expecting to look worse than the first title) -no community (hmm, I wonder why? *sarcasm* ) -the crashing effects suck (apparently every time you crash, you lose all of your wheels and other unaesthetic looks for the crashing events) -from what I noticed, it lacks the story part or something related -the physics are broken most of the time -limited maps, barely new features compared with the previous titles etc. -it was not worth the price I paid at the time  And the list can easily continue for a lot...this is my experience from only an hour or so of gameplay...but, I will still recommend this game, because it really helps you to learn to appreciate what you have and, heck, how knows, you just might enjoy this game while you are drunk or feel like doing something really dumb, so why not keep it close for just those special occasions when you 'dare to be stupid'. This game really deserves it's metacritic score 2/10 .
1857	1	a	This game is very good and runs perfectly on my windows 10 pc with over 35 fps
1859	1	a	I love this game. It's awesome and really cool. I had seen the the other reviews and some of them said, 'lololol th1s g4me 1s t3rr3b1e' I do not say that. THIS GAME'S PROS: Cool Cars, Nice Tracks, Lots of gamemodes and a lot of chracters. CONS:It's pretty hard.
1861	1	a	Not as good as Flatout 2 but I still enjoyed this game.  I don't know what these peoples issues are. I've used this game on multiple PC's and it's never had any issues. It was working fine on PC's without the best parts either. No lag on a GT 9800 with a AMD Athlon II 2.91 GHz dual core, 4GB DDR2.  The controls are no worse than other games. Burnout Paradise, Need for Speed.. There's not much difference. I mean, you can re-map them if you hate them, so.. what's the issue?  I tell you to take the fact this game is 12% overwhelmingly negative with a pile of salt. Buy the game, try it, if it works, enjoy it. Don't just take confirmation bias to your head and hate it just to hate it.  This is a good game made by a good company.
1863	1	a	it did not live to its brothers flatout 1,2 and uc in graphics and storyline it was just terrible 
1865	1	a	Baddest game in Flatout series, I could say that plan of the game was perfect... all those ideas with zombiemode, monster trucks, offroading etc... but handling was worst , and in game graphics was just looking like in some cartoonish racing games. Offorading, Monster trucks and Speed racing was fun... but racing itself at 'Race' was just impossible... really... But there is just few good things too... Choosing characters including beautiful women, Lot of vehicles and their even looking cool at menu, but not in game, and ofcourse easy steam achievements... thats why i am playing it, i am achievementer. Also fun was offroading and monster truck missions, but there was just only few of them. I Would respect this game, if it would use Flatout 2 or Ultimate Carnage game engine with nice handling etc, but as it is right now... its just not worth... atleast not worth this price. Thank god i got it as extra for FlatOut Complete. It just should not own 'FlatOut' name.
1867	1	a	THis is my favourite of the series. Highly recommend.
1869	1	a	I honestly didn't like it, but I only played one race I just didn't like the cartoonish style for a racing game. . . I will try it again after some time and revaluate it, but I have a lot of games that i will start to evaluate. . . i will leave fan factors out till the end of each game review.  Fan factor time! I really love the flatout series I used to have test drive and flatout(but my step dad wouldnt let me play flatout) along time ago, and I got the games mixed up and pretty much about the flatout carnaige pack, preparing to play the game I onced loved for its cusomazation (test drive: eve of destruction), I was very impressed during playing the series. I have yet to play the final game in the series but I will soon get to it! till then DONT GET HIT BY A BUS IT'S NOT SANITARY!
1871	1	a	Great to play with a bunch of friends.
1873	1	a	If you like offbeat car racing games, Flatout 3 is a game worth buying. It has 9 modes that include all of the old modes such as stuntman and demolition derby, Thereâ€™s also Monster Trucks, Speed Racing, Off Road, one called Night Shift where you race at night and another that has 50 different challenges. Many more than previous titles in the series.  That said, I was really disappointed with the graphics and vehicle handling. Graphics seem to have taken a retrograde step and handling is much more difficult in Flatout 3. Overall I donâ€™t regret purchasing this title, but itâ€™s not what I expected. If you are familiar with the previous Flatout titles youâ€™ll see what I mean. Bugbear Entertainment disappeared back in 2007 so a new developer has created this new title and probably explains the differences. At this time, after trying all the modes I much prefer the previous game Flatout: Ultimate Carnage.
1875	1	a	Best game 10/10  Physics are incredible, the textures look amazing and the characters you can pick are so varied it hurts.  GOTY material.
1877	1	a	 bad FlatOut game. fun game when running properly
1879	1	a	Pros.  - Epic 5.8 gb download.  - Array of game modes.  - Array of characters.  - Array of vehicles.  - Rag doll physics on fleek.  Cons. - Epic 5.8 gb download. - WTF game modes don't make sence. - Crappy controls.  Decent game if you get it on sale and haven't played any of the other Flatouts.  #TrashORTresure
1881	1	a	now i know this is like the third worst game on steam but to be honest you all are going to hate me for this but i love it the graphics are ok and the cars are cool and theres a charecter in the game that looks like vin deissil (if i spelled it right) so yes pls if you have the game give it another chance it not that bad i actully love it 100.01 tumbs up lets make this game a mostly positive game can we do it i think we can pls dont say no to this game
1883	1	a	Don't know why people give this game hate, just cause it was made by different devs doesn't mean it's bad. Infact it's much better than the previous games and here's why:  Much more responsive controls Many more game modes A lot more fun Just much better really  No this isn't a troll it's a damn fun game actually.

1108	0	a	This is so bad it's not even funny anymore.
1109	0	a	Probably the worst game that i own. Don't ever buy this. Get the 2:nd game or ultimate carnage
1110	0	a	This game is horrible. If you love any other game in the Flatout franchise, dont buy this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
1111	0	a	RIP company who made this game, never gonna sell good again
1112	0	a	This sounds (pun intended, since there is no music) like a open beta of a never-released racing game.
1113	0	a	 DIS IN NOT FLATOUT WHAT THE HELL, MAN?! 
1114	0	a	This is the only game is recent memory I've demanded a refund for. It's a blatant cash in on the Flatout name, and has nothing to do with the original developers. It has bad graphics, horrible physics, appalling controls. Stay as far away from this 'game' as humanly possible.
1115	0	a	Stay far away. They ruined the franchise.
1116	0	a	All I can say is: Don't waste your money for this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥... This has nearly nothing to do with the previous series of this game... Buy one of the other titles instead.
1117	0	a	From what little I played I would NOT recommend this game. It is definately a step back from Flatout 2 and miles behind Flatout Ultimate Carnage....which is a better version of Flatout 2, &lt;--- get this one instead, it's better.
1118	0	a	This game is basically a piece of unrespect towards bugbear, this game has been made by another studio Team 6 and they not only didn't maintain the original Flatout idea, they smashed it and not even in the good way, the physics are pure rubbish, the cars look like matchbox toy cars (forget nice flatout 1 or 2 bangers.), The car tuning is just a text saying what changes to the car (seriously? are we back at text rpg's?), Oh I forgot, the graphics even if I do not need nice graphics to love something, here they are disastrous, there is the bloom and motion blur effect on everything and you can't turn them off.    I bought this in the complete flatout bundle, just because I wanted all flatouts since i had owned 1 and 2 on disc but played them so much they got scratched and didn't play anymore. But this Is just a huge piece of unplayable material, I mean even 3 years later on a SuperPC compared to it's requirements I got screentear and graphics buffing.   This ain't worth a dime, maybe a nice try for a indie studio trying to make a name with forgiving fans and a pricetag of a handfull of dollars but not a game called: Flatout 3:Chaos and destruction, the only chaos and destruction you get here is the game itself.    Installed, started it up, found it funny looking... tried it out... uninstalled, piece of utter rubbish.
1119	0	a	i DONT RECOMMEND THIS POS GAME, this is the worse in the flatout series. Ive been a big fan of flatout games for years, and this is just horrible. Wont work with your steering wheel, gfx are horriable, AI is shi t, its just a big peice of donkey poop. If you want to waist your money then go ahead and buy.
1120	0	a	It isn't good as Flatout 2....
1121	0	a	worst game in the franchise, the only good resource in this game is the monster truck idea.

1128	0	a	Let mighty steam customer JeT LaGGeD guide you through the Steam store safely before your wallet runs away from you. Ths game is a complete disaster that shames the Flatout name. Stick to the older Flatout games, as they are all amazing. This one is disgusting, do  not  buy it.
1129	0	a	B_astardization of a stellar series of racing games. Played two races and then uninstalled.
1130	0	a	Avoid it, not a proper Flatout
1131	0	a	STOP!!!  You better DO NOT BUY the game.  At first it may look pretty cool, and you don't have a problem with the little 'easy' made graphics.  For player's that knew the old version, Flat Out 2, it is even more depressing. As far as I can remember you could gear your car's up in Flat Out 2 and the Cars still looked made up, BUT not like toy cars. Even if I mix something up here, the physics are even worse than the car's look like. It so brutally Acarde that it should run under 'fun games for babys' .   Finally: I can't belive that this should be the next version of Flat Out 2. I totally don't get it. Even if you took the same graphic and physic enginge from the old game, and mix it up with a few new Racetracks and Cars and what ever, you would wind up with a better game than this.   I wish I had take on of the thumbs down more seriously before I bougth the game.   Good for Kids, but everyone who knew the old Flat Out 2 will be badly disappointed! And even Kids I would recommend to buy Flat Out 2. Is't simply the...no it is complete different game and defenatly more fun! Cheers, Shoot1stAskNxt
1132	0	a	It's terrible compared to Flatout 2. Don't buy it. Much rather have Flatout 2 all over again than this. Much rather have Need for Speed Road Challenge than this.
1133	0	a	Team 6 really put an effort into this game, unfortunately that effort was to make the game as unenjoyable, mundane, unsatisfactory, monotonous, tedious and lastly rage inducing (at having to pay a price for such disk clutter).  If you tried Flatout and compared it to Flatout 3, you would be hard pressed to notice any game play difference apart from the garish new graphics in the case of the latter (yes Team 6 developed both games, and it tells).  Yes you may say there is a lot of variety to the game, but its kind of like saying which style of shirt you would like to wear when you go and get a lobotomy.  In my opinion the title is a typo, a more apt title would be FAIL-A-LOT 3 : Clumsy &amp; Irritating
1134	0	a	pretty crap and chitty. fun for a little bit but the game mechanics are terribad.
1135	0	a	want my money back

1137	0	a	Edited october 1st 2014 I have come to a conclusion that it is even worst than when i first looked at it. The game feels just like a cheap arcade game. The vehicle physics is crap and wanky. The destruction is okay at times but it pretty craply done compared to the other games. Some items like cones and wood float and never move. I can no longer recommend this game to anyone, not even your worst enemy. Its like the just stuck the name FLATOUT 3 on a piece of crap and tried to sell it. You have a better chance at winning the lottery TWICE than enjoying this game for more than 30 mins! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ALL FLATOUT FANS BEWARE!!! This game is a horrible addition to the Flatout series. That is why I gave it a negative reveiw. It feels nothing like the originals.  Now on another note as a racing game it isnt the worst (still isnt that great). It is okay for people who have never touched Flatout if they can get it cheap. I highly recomend getting the complete pack mainly for the other games.  Overall I do not recomend this game. Once again FLATOUT FANS BEWARE!!!!
1138	0	a	This game is BROKEN i could not get it working and others too hace the same/different prolems  Wait for a fix or wait for Next Car Game Others in the series qork just fine (would u like them or not) 
1139	0	a	they ruined the perfect racing game. you rub sides with another car, you go 5 miles an hour. you get touched, you spin out you go off a ramp, you flip over wanna listen to music while racing? what music? i hear no tunage graphics look like they went back to flatout 1 not really chaotic, just messy. and destruction? nope
1140	0	a	3 things wrong with this game, the music , the gameplay ... oh and everything elese. game physics are rubbish, the AI players just hammer your car in demolishion derby, you dont have a chance once your up against a wall. just avoid, spend your money on something else
1141	0	a	This game is absolute joke. Dont waste any penny on it
1142	0	a	Browser Steam OMG IT's FLATOUT 3 Look at trailer, it's okay  Buy it Play it ... ... ... â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it Don't buy it.
1143	0	a	To be very honest, the first flatout is a bit boring, and the third flatout just is completely horrible. Flatout 2 is the only good game of its series.
1144	0	a	WORST GAME EVER you bonece off evry thing and evry thing blows up and thay must of spent 5 dolers on it and it glickchis it is crap thay need to take it off of stem i hate it makes me sick the first event i tride
1145	0	a	Sorry, but I don't know what is this. FlatOut 2 and 1 was better.
1146	0	a	Feel the adrenaline rush as you aimlessly ice skate around the track wondering who the hell would pay full price for this half arsed crock of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. cars feel bland, tracks are boring, and yes, just wrote this after installing and uninstalling within the hour.
1147	0	a	Probably the worse game ever made.
1148	0	a	This game is totally piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. -_-
1149	0	a	5.2 out of 10 It seem like the developers think as many game mode and feature as possible and qucikly did all these without check if there any bugs or problems!   They rushed the whole game the reason why I buy it because it was in a bundle for Â£7.99.
1150	0	a	I don't understand why this piece of garbage is still being sold on steam.
1151	0	a	This game was disappointing. Was expecting massive crashes with particles flying and softbody physics. The improvements Bugbear made to this weren't enough to offset the bad effect on gameplay that the more arcady feel has. Rather wait 'til Wreckfest to be released. Or better yet just go right now and play either Flatout 2 or Wreckfest, they're both made by the same guys who made this and are better.  A rare miss for Bugbear.
1152	0	a	game is ok but keeps non responding every 10 mins i play does not matter what level happens at random times games is only good to play when im board
1153	0	a	this took flatout, and then removed all the fun and gave you a flash game that you would play for free online.
1154	0	a	A really big drop in quality compared to flatout 1 and 2 , physics is basicly turned off in this one your stuck to the ground, running into objects either has zero effect they just bounce out of the way or they kill you. Huge piece of garabage overall.I am shure most people bought this game by accident getting the flatout bundle on coupon.
1155	0	a	one of the worst flat out game they ever made
1156	0	a	Im highly dissapointed in this game. Was looking forward for an excellent game ( very addictive and fun to play ) like its predecessor Flatout 2 but Flatout 3 obviously has gone wrong somewhere, graphics and gameplay wise... Even Flatout 1 was better than this.
1157	0	a	Worst 'racing game' on steam. Cashed in on fans of the Flatout franchise with its name. Do not by under any circumstances.
1158	0	a	Unplayable. Obviously was not finished. Couldn't even navigate through the menu, objects floating in incorrect places, unclickable menu items. Never got a chance to play. Tried installing several times, thinking it was me, definitely not. Brings shame upon the Flatout franchise.
1159	0	a	It is a bad game. I wonder that Flatout 3 has something to do with the original Flatout. What a waste of time and gigabytes!
1160	0	a	It's so bad it's fun. But it's still bad.
1161	0	a	DO NOT BUY!!! It has a meta score of OMG LOW! It's nothing compared to the original flatout. Just al ot of mini games, horrible physics (really!), car doesn't move like you want, AI messed up, graphics effects suck (wtf with the lighting on the cars), and the music is just a default beat tune on a ranndom audio mixer application.
1162	0	a	No career, drive like on a ice surface, creating perfect race to get ahead. This is not a Flatout .... The Flatout series is dead thanks to the new developer Team 6 Game Studios :-(
1163	0	a	The worst game ever made.
1164	0	a	This game is so terrible it is unplayable. I don't need to write anything about the physics or the graphics because you shouldn't spend any more of your time thinking about this game. Save your money.
1165	0	a	Don't bother. Get Flatout: Ultimate Carnage instead, this is just waste of money, as it is a cash grab by the publisher on the name of Flatout only, Bugbear wasn't even involved with this pile of garbage.
1166	0	a	DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! I am a huge fan of all of the other FlatOut games and I really tried to give this a chance but it is just a terrible piece of garbage trying to cash in on a series developed by a company no longer involved with it. Show support for the original series and buy FlatOut 1, 2 and Ultimate Carnage, or support those guys directly and go check out Bugbear's Next Car Game, but pleast do not give these guys any more money. This is not deserving of the FlatOut name.
1167	0	a	Alright, I was the biggest fan of previous opuses. I waited for this game to come out, unsure of what it would, because that it was not made by bugbear.   when I first runed Flatout 3, I thought it was a joke. And I still think it is. I think they make better games than that for toasters. The 3 races I had killed a part of my soul.  Seriously, dont buy this thing. And if you liked the other flatouts, well.. lets just hope Bugbear puts its hands back on the Flatout Serie.
1168	0	a	From what little I played I would NOT recommend this game. It is definately a step back from Flatout 2 and miles behind Flatout Ultimate Carnage....which is a better version of Flatout 2, &lt;--- get this one instead, it's better.
1169	0	a	 DIS IN NOT FLATOUT WHAT THE HELL, MAN?! 
1170	0	a	If you are searching for a good desctruction derby 'recreation' or for 'destructible mindless racing fun' do not buy this game! I have made this mistake! The Racing mode part is terrible and hopeless to win. There is allways just this 1 car you can't beat. The 'stunt mode'......i have spend 20 min to solve the mysteries bejind it, what you have to do in this part.....without result .:( And the Destruction Derby mode.....lol the 1st level is fun......it's a deathmatch. But the other levels....its a 1 vs 23 other fight, where every car has the mission to destroy you, and they are ignoring each other....This was the most worst 2 hrs of my life i spent in it!
1171	0	a	I played for barely an hour, and all I can say is...wow....horrible. I played the 1st ones, and they were amazing. I had high expectations from this one, and was highly dissapointed. I really wish Steam did sell-backs, too bad they dont. What a waste of $30 ugh =_=
1172	0	a	Hit a shrubbery at 120km/h. It totaled my car. 1/10.  Got this in the FlatOut bundle. Definitely and by far the worst of the four. Doesn't play anything like the rest of the franchise and the team that made this did it a disservice. It's like Blur played with Micro Machines driven on ice and everything is boxy and glitters. Several of the characters are obvious jabs at annoying celebrities, but they bring nothing interesting to the table. After playing and enjoying all of the previous games in the series back to back, I played half of one track of F3 and couldn't stand to finish the race. Every negative review of it is spot on.  This series peaked at FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage in terms of graphics and full controller support (finally), but was handicapped by requiring Games for Windows Live. Hopefully if/when Bugbear finishes Next Car Game, it'll be the FlatOut we've always dreamt of.
1173	0	a	Why oh why did I not read the MetaCritic rating before buying this game. It was a rip-off at $2.00, and it's an even bigger rip-off at standard price. Feels like an alpha version of the game.
1174	0	a	DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.  I got it in the sales and I wish i never did. Worst game I have ever played. 
1175	0	a	I'd hoped they were all lies. Flatout created a format for success which the second one followed and improved on, but this, this cancer to the flatout series should be removed. It does not belong in such a series. The driving system in this game is worse than many flash racing games. Mario kart 64 handles more realisticly than this game by far. In addition, in the second race I ever played in this game I clipped through the ground. After that I just gave up on this game. THIS GAME IS BROKEN! Also, this game requires the highest hardware specs out of the series yet I think the turd I made this morning looks like a better racing game. I bought this game as part of a bundle. However, if you are just thinking about buying this game because you liked other flatout games in this seris, DO NOT SPEND MONEY ON THIS GAME.
1176	0	a	
1177	0	a	If you loved FO2 than you will hate this game. Upon first launching I can predict the following emotions... First will come confusion, then denial, more confusion, acceptance, anger will set in. Epic disaster. May God have mercy on the developers souls.
1178	0	a	Game has nothing to do with it's predecessors, it is a horrid joke of a game. Driving physics are terribly arcadey but way worse, AI are incompetent turds. Graphics is a huge downgrade. it is just a waste of money, i am a huge FlatOut fan  and this was the biggest dissapointment i've ever had...
1179	0	a	This is not a Flatout game. It may have the name, but it is made by a different studio, and feels absolutely terrible. With absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever, I'd heartily suggest you skip this one and go straight for Flatout: Ultimate Carnage instead. Now THAT's a great racing game!
1180	0	a	Absolutely shocking  The last game (ultimate carnage) was so good, what happened?!  You have no feel for the car, there are so many severe dips in FPS (i was geting 90fps normally then it tanked to 12 at random points).  A real disappointment to the series.
1181	0	a	Terrible handling. Even Trackmania is a simulator compared to this. Not for anyone who likes cars one bit.
1182	0	a	Just bad game, reasons are well explained in other reviews.
1183	0	a	1/10  Made by a different studio and nowhere as good as Flatout 1 &amp; 2.  Poor racing mechanics, visuals and track layouts make for a game not to buy.
1184	0	a	game is ok but keeps non responding every 10 mins i play does not matter what level happens at random times games is only good to play when im board
1185	0	a	Im highly dissapointed in this game. Was looking forward for an excellent game ( very addictive and fun to play ) like its predecessor Flatout 2 but Flatout 3 obviously has gone wrong somewhere, graphics and gameplay wise... Even Flatout 1 was better than this.

1189	0	a	This game is awful.  It completely veers off from the classic 'flatout' gameplay, and this particular game feels extremely arcade-like. There is no real storyline that is apparent or obvious, and the AI is pretty terrible as well. Loading times aren't great which is actually pretty surprising, and the tracks aren't even fun.  Playing just a race and a half, I would not recommend at all.
1190	0	a	Complete and utter garbage. Don't waste a cent on this game. Wonky Physics, terrible sound track, complete and utter insult to race fans and what was otherwise a decent franchise until now.
1191	0	a	this game is about as fun as the dish network tutorial channel. 0/10 - bad bad bad
1192	0	a	not going to lie: the game is dissapointing, and not nearly as good as the 2nd one or even the first game. BUT it still has a certain fun factor at least the big arena wreckage (still not as good as the 1st/2nd) so if you could get this game in the bundle not bad of a deal if you buy it seperatly by itself not 100% worth it :P
1193	0	a	I do believe this holds the record for the lowest Metacritic score on Steam. Needless to say I could not even finish the first race.
1194	0	a	There was a Flatout bundle on steam that gave me all the Flatouts at a total of $7.99. Or, I could have bought Flatout, Flatout 2, and Flatout: Ultimate Carnage separately for $9.35. Quite honestly I wish I had payed the extra $1.36 just so I didn't have this god awful game.
1195	0	a	I played like 12 minutes of this, and will never play another second. Excuse me while I erase this from my memory. *smashes head against brick wall until dead*
1196	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
1197	0	a	This game is not worth the title Flatout, BugBear probably regret letting a different developor create such a god forsaken game. Best advice I can give is to not buy this game
1198	0	a	Do not buy this crap. If you want to play a good FlatOut game, just buy the FlatOut Ultimate Carnage.
1199	0	a	I wouldn't call it broken, but the FPS goes down the toilet when you PLAY WITH MORE THAN 3 NPCS... *sigh* Buy #2, not this one
1200	0	a	try puting a toothpick under your toenail and then kick a wall  congrats you are now having a better time than you would have when playing this piece of trash
1201	0	a	It's not boring, it's disgusting.
1202	0	a	I bought this game, in hope that it would live up to Flatout games standard. Playing it with those hopes, destroys the game. The graphics, game play, the driving method and control, EVERYTHING is different and much more worse compared to Flatout 2. It used to be fun to crash into another car, but not anymore. This game is made so unrealistic, and the camera when you drive, yeah.... the baddest rotation I've ever seen. I really really REALLY loved Flatout 2 and still plays it, but this game is just a disapointment.  If you've played Flatout 2, and hope this new game is the same or even better, Don't buy it.
1203	0	a	This game sucks! Worst gameplay ever, graphic like from sims 1 and it says i need top graphics and cpu for ultra setting. Meh. No. No way. Please die. Nope.
1204	0	a	10 thumbs down game is crap
1205	0	a	After playing through Flatout 1 and 2 this was a complete disapppontment. The graphics are typical, but lacking, sometimes blurry. The gameplay was just horrible. The way the cars 'feel' when driving is lame, way too arcadey. The tracks suck, and there's no flow what-so-ever. Also didn't care for the lack of a 'Campaign' for single player. It's just free-race mode. Please don't waste your time on this one. Play Flatout 2 or 4. Both are far superior.
1206	0	a	Bad physic, bad screen ratio, bad tracks... We want Flat Out 2 physics and reality!
1207	0	a	It's so bad it's fun. But it's still bad.
1208	0	a	Good graphic, bunch of cars, different kind of game types. It would be interesting game, BUT - driving and impact physics are so awful and unplayable, it ruined whole game...its nothing like Flatout 1 or 2
1209	0	a	Broken game, they gave priority to quantity over quality and nothing quite works. I want my BugBear back :-(
1210	0	a	It's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
1211	0	a	If you have played the other Flatout games, you probarbly think they are awesome, just like me. But when it comes to Flatout 3, its absolutly rubbish.  I've not played this for a such a long time because it's so much worse then Flatout 2, wich i totally recommend buying if your intressed in any Flatout game. 
1212	0	a	The reason I stopped buying fullprice titles on Steam. Some users got their money refunded because of the abysmal quality of this game. I didn't.   The only good thing about this game is the name. And it drags it through the mud...   Do NOT waste your money on it!
1213	0	a	Its just so incredibly boring, nothing like the originals.
1214	0	a	physics and car handling make no sense
1215	0	a	words cannot express how bad this game is. just buy flatout 2 and you will be much much happier
1216	0	a	Give me a refund for this stupid and sorry excuse of a flalout game I want a refund now I hat this game
1217	0	a	I liked the part most where I uninstalled this game.

1223	0	a	Worst racing game! Horible!
1224	0	a	Just bad. It's funny how bad it is. Miniclip has better racing games.
1225	0	a	Horrible. Such waste of time and money. I played Flatout and Flatout 2, both good games toguh first game is outdated. Then i started this game and... disappointment.
1226	0	a	It's incredible how bad this game is, i won't even test it again to write this review...
1227	0	a	This game has absolutely terrible gameplay. Physics are worthless in it, you can't control anything to save your life, no in race music, no force feedbad (The worst part in my opinion), lack of throttle control from what I can tell, and an overall discrace to BugBear and the Flatout name.   IF YOU LIKED THE ORIGINAL FLATOUT AND FLATOUT 2, DO NOT GET THIS GAME, I REPEAT, DO NOT GET IT!
1228	0	a	Worst Flatout  Buy flatout 1 or 2 much better
1229	0	a	Worst racing game I have ever experienced. I got the Flatout bundle and I'd pay to have this title removed from my library.
1230	0	a	It's just terrible.
1231	0	a	Alright wow, where to begin with this game? Whooo weee. Alright lets get started. The... Pros? To be honest, Its hard to really think of any, I got barely into the game before it started crashing so I guess this is off the list.. The Cons. Basicly this game is poorly put together, using the most generic looking models, the most generic music, the most generic AND I KID YOU NOT GENERIC sounds Ive ever heard, No joke that like 'Chink' noise you hear from like I dunno any youtube intro back in 2010? its all over the place. Graphicly this game is hideous, Everything is flat and rusty and low res. Lighting might as well be not there at all as its all this ugly yellow. Anything besides race mode crashes your game, first time I started racing the game dropped to 0 FPS for about a full 3 seconds only to shoot up to 80. and I am running a brand new high end GPU.  If you see the game don't get it, want a destruction derby style racing game? Get the first flatout.  Flatout don't buy.
1889	1	a	So much different than the first three, but still amazing.
1891	1	a	It's sad that this game is dead multiplayer wise after only a year, because it has some crazy cool tracks in it, and it's scratches that Burnout itch just a little bit. Good fun.
1893	1	a	I just picked this up on sale and I'm so glad I didn't listen to all the reviews that said this game was bad and gave it a thumbs down. I am having an absolute blast playing it ! It's a lot of fun and quite challenging if you try to get all the stars for each track. There are over 60 races to complete and you can create your own tracks as well. The Multi-player is shut down so don't buy it for online play.   I have played many Ridge Racer games in the past and I loved R4 back in the day. Some may complain that this doesn't feel like a Ridge Racer game and they would be somewhat right. It's Ridge Racer to the extreme. The Ridge Racer game series needed to evolve with new gameplay and this game does that. It still has the Ridge Racer 'vibe' with all the powersliding you can handle while listening to techno style music. But, it adds in destructible environments with alternate routes you open up by smashing through walls and buildings on each course. It also has opponent take downs like we have seen in games like burnout.   All of this destruction adds to your power/turbo meter. You can keep the meter filled up by causing destruction to the other racers and the environment. Keeping your meter maxed as often as possible is essential to winning races because the AI is not easy to beat. They drive well, boost often and will even 'frag' you when you are ahead of them. Even if you don't come in first you still get points so losing the race is not always a bad thing.  In additon to the main 'domination' mode there are several other game modes to mix things up. There is a mode called 'Shindo' that is a lot like recent RR games where you just get boost for powersliding and the envronment is less destructible. There's also drift attack, time attack and a 'frag' mode where you try to destroy as many oponents as possible. All are fun in there own way and you can apply these modes to the tracks you create as well.   My biggest complaint with Ridge Racer unbounded is that there needs to be more options to change the graphics and control settings for the game. They are extremly limited and it's obvious this is a console port. The game still looks good but more settings for the PC version would have been appreciated. Other than that it's a solid arcade racer.  Overall, the game is just plain fun and that's what counts to me. I don't understand why people don't like it. Maybe they are struggling to win the races. Some races are very difficult and require multiple attempts to win. As with other racing games it takes some practice to get use to the handling of the cars. Also, there is a button for drifting and you should use it instead of the brakes to start your drift.  Maybe the people who don't like it expect it to be like the older Ridge Racer games but I'm actually glad it's different than the previous games. Why make a new Ridge Racer game if it's doesn't add anything different ? Also, I don't care that the MP is dead. I don't play MP on many games anyway. So if your looking for a fun, challenging, over the top, arcade racing experience give this game a try.   8 out of 10
1895	1	a	As with all Ridge Racer titles, the game play is fast paced, arcade-like, explosive fun. Once you master the art of drifting (some cars are much better than others), you can start scoring huge drift scores and unlocking new cars, new races, new districts, and finally city blocks for the track editor (that allows you to make your own race track and share it online for others to race).   You can even drive an American Truck and ram the police, and some of the time trials are nuts taking you through loop the loops, and insane angles. Despite all this, I found the game a bit too easy to master. If you liked Driftopia, you'll probably love this too.   Personal Rating: A bit too easy, but nonetheless good solid fun.  Score Rating: 75% - It's Ridge Racer, no surprises!
1897	1	a	This game has gotton alot of negitive feedback &amp; i dont know why. Its a Great Arcade racer &amp; plays alot like Ridge racer games before Ie Ridger racer Type 4. Great sound track when turned up loud and some excellent course with tunnels &amp; destroyable roads. Perfect game to sit back &amp; chill to for a few hours. If this game was in your Local arcade with link up play it would get alot of coins from me. Only thing perhaps its missing is that old ridge racer Voice In game !
1899	1	a	This is one of the most underrated games i have ever played. I have been a fan of the Ridge racer series since Rage racer hit the ps1 in 1997, Iâ€™ve loved the way cars can drift around corners at impossible angles and speeds...and how its all about the skill of drifting. THIS GAME IS NOT LIKE THE OLD RIDGE RACERS; in this game you can hit walls and it is not very likely you will keep your speed when you just turn and press the drift button, in unbound you have to control your car, or else you will be at the back of the grid. It also borrows from the burnout series with 'frags' (takedowns in burnout)...this adds another element to the exciting racing in this game. It is also made by bugbear (the makers of the flat-out series and Next Car Game), you can see game elements from flat-out throughout this game, as in the highly destructive environments and vehicle combat. The track-editor is also amazing, the editor lets you create many...MANY tracks in all different shapes with all different elements, the advanced editor lets you add ramps and explosives to the track you have created. Overall if you want a fun arcade racer to pass the time and have a lot of fun along the way, get this!! its a brilliant mix of many different racing games.
1901	1	a	Well, it's not really Ridge Racer. I mean, there's drifting.. and there's a heavy arcade feel to it. That's it.  I'll keep things short. Unbounded is not bad, not bad AT ALL. Graphics are fine, sense of speed is ok. Handling is something you need to get use to, but nothing awful. Yes, track design lacks a real punch and the difficulty can be frustrating. But in the other hand - Unbounded is a fun game, being a weird, twisted child of Ridge Racer and Burnout/Flatout. If you find it on sale, for about 3-5â‚¬, it's defnitly worth it!   Yes, there's plenty other, better racing games.But i still find Unbounded charming and... it puts me in a special mood. This game killed Ridge Racer franchise. Not because it's bad - developers just didn't know what to do with it. Innovate or stay the same? It's all sad, i remember playing Ridge Racer on original Playstation.   Oh well. Try Unbounded. It has a demo, so why not ?
1903	1	a	Ridge Racer: Unbounded was, to me, a very fun, yet repetitive racing experience.  (Be prepared to read a VERY descriptive review. TL;DR is at the bottom.)  The game's introduction is very simple, and explains to the player how Shatter Bay came to be, only to turn into a urban playground for the Unbounded. As a beginner, the player is convinced by the hashiriya master to join the Unbounded, and seeks higher recognition by moving up the ranks.  Now, if you've played any of the Ridge Racer titles preceding this one, you'll find that this particular title mostly leaves any traditional aspect of the older games in the dust. However, do note that Unbounded was produced alongside major game developer Bugbear Entertainment, the same folks behind the Flatout series and, most recently, Next Car Game: Wreckfest. Bugbear's role in developing Unbounded was one of the major factors in producing this game.  The single-player mode is very simple. The player has to race through the districts within Shatter Bay and dominate every one of them. These districts very in location and theme, from the lower parts to the docks to even the city center. Now, each district has a set of challenges that get tougher and tougher as the player moves from district to district. These events are filtered out into specific types, from the standard Domination Race to my personal favorite, Drift Attack. Unbounded also adds a ranking system to game, where you unlock more &amp; more features by gaining EXP and moving yourself up higher on the list. Now, from my playthrough of Unbounded, I found that these challenges often felt a little repetitive, considering that they all take place within their respective districts and can only offer so much in terms of visuals.  Gameplay is where Bugbear's changes come into light. The physics system is completely different compared to traditional Ridge Racer titles, with drifting through corners feeling more realistic instead of the old-fashioned 'go through a turn drifting at 300 km/h' approach. However, from my playthough experience, the physics of Unbounded are easy to adjust to, with a slight learning curve. There's new gameplay mechanics implemented into Unbounded, the most notable being Frags and Targets. Frags are the Unbounded equivalent of Burnout's Takedowns, where you can smash into another opponent in order to temporarily render them out of play. An awards system is also present, which gives awards to objectives you achieve as you're racing, such as hitting a particular Target or getting multiple Frags. Targets, however, pretty much lead me to my next point.  The game now introduces a destructive environment, where almost everything can be smashed into. DICE ain't got anything on the amount of buildings and coffee shops you'll be smashing through, as the amount of destruction the player will be causing to the city can put a smile on his/her face. And yes, there's explosions too. Small explosions. Big explosions. Michael Bay-approved explosions.  Aside from the carnage, there's a game mode that I'd like to recall: Shindo racing. This is pretty much the standard racing game mode, where there's no frags and no driving into buildings. Instead, you race against other Shindo class opponents around the city, with the winner being the first across the line. The game also features Time Attack, where you race against the clock in order to beat the timer.  One of the game's bigger selling points is the track editor. This allows users to build up their own personal cities for other players to violently smash through. Track pieces are unlocked as the player progresses through the single-player and multi-player. However, I found that making a city isn't exactly the best time-investing thing to do, but the option will be there should I choose to do so.  This game often goes on sale, and when it does, it's very cheap. I picked up Unbounded with all the DLCs for less than $4 during the Steam Winter Sale of 2014. The game made up the $3.74 I paid for it quite well, providing a solid single-player experience with the added addition of multiplayer (which, admittedly, I haven't gotten to yet).  TL;DR: Ridge Racer Unbounded is a game that I'd recommend as a means of trying new things. The revamped gameplay plus the added ability to create your own personal city to tear through offers a very entertaining experience for the racer fanatic. The single-player is a pretty decent experience, but it allows you to understand how the game works, so that you can begin dominating other players online.   
1905	1	a	Do you like Burnout? Enjoy the destruction of Split Second? Then this game is for you!  If your expecting classic Ridge Racer then look else where.  This game should have been its own franchise but it`s not, it has the Ridge Racer title, RR style cars and music but that is where similarities end. Do I care? Hell no! This game puts Michael Bay to shame with its crashes and destruction. I loved it on PS3, and I love it on PC.  The sad truth though is that there is no online, the servers were shut down some time ago and Namco opted not to modify the game to allow peer to peer connection, or even stop the game attempting to connect to none existent servers on launch. But this does not stop the game being fun, so if you see it in the sale buy it and have a smashing time!  One last thing to note, for achievement collectors sadly you will not get all achievements for this game as there are a couple that are awarded for online play, no online play = missing achievements :(
1907	1	a	Picked this up as part of the Namco Bandai Humble Bundle (which included all the DLC for the game), and I have to say, so far I've found it pretty dang enjoyable. After investing a large chunk of time into Split Second on my PS3, Ridge Racer: Unbounded felt immediately familiar, but different enough to make it stand out on its own. Split Second was super fun as racing games go, but I found the handling on the vehicles to be... not necessarily as advertised based on their stats. RR:U vehicles seem much more true to their description. Although a word of warning: A high drift score is, in my observation, not a sign that a car handles well under drift, even if it has a decent handling score. Rather, the drift score seems to indicate the willingness of the back end to swing out, so a car with max drift almost wants to drive in reverse after every single corner. These high drift cars require a delicate touch, and you'll end up facing the on coming field a lot until you get the subtleties down.  Continuing the Split Second/RR:U comparision: While I loved the destruction in SS, merely placing in many SS tracks required that you hit every single destructible. And to win, you often needed to having the timing of using the destructibles down just so, rather than just relying on your skills as a driver. RR:U gives you the option to destroy, and it's definitely encouraged both by adding to your score and it's potential for shaving a little off your lap times. And of course, it's just fun to do. But in the end, placing and winning comes down to what you do behind the wheel. There will be moments of frustration, like when you're in the lead and some AI jerk three positions back starts a chain reaction accident, costing you your hard earned spot at the top, but even that feels fun and exhilirating, and makes you want to try again. Gotta say though, the SS soundtrack was better IMHO. RR:U has this very generic bassy electronica that I would rather have than be without any music, but it definitely doesn't evoke anywhere near the same kind of emotional pulse pounding rush that the SS tunes did.  Many will complain about the death of the online server, and I can understand that. But when I just wanna pick up and race, I don't really care. My only gripe is that the game was never updated to stop looking for it, so you waste more time than is necessary when the game first loads up, as it looks for a non-existent thing. It'd be nice if they came back and fixed that, maybe rewrote things so that the player community could host servers so we could still play online. But meh.... it's a small thing in my book, and I'm not a ginormous fan of online gaming to begin with, especially when play is strictly competitive.   Havent' played with the editor yet so I can't speak to that, but I think it's a cool feature. Again, many will say it's nearly useless given the demise of online play, but I'll be interested to see what I can come up with anyway.  Overall, as long as you're not looking for multiplayer mayhem, I definitely recommend it, though you might be well advised to pick it up on the cheap, or as part of a bundle. Lots of single player fun to be had, as long as you don't go in expecting the world. Give the demo a shot.
1909	1	a	Excellent arcadey racer right here! The game is focused on five (give or take) different modes, with domination being the main one. You collect points on each race to unlock more races, coming first sometimes doesnâ€™t' guarantee unlocking later races (especially in the later game) so the game forces you to race aggressively which in my opinion makes the game really fun. Also the mechanics of the boost are really well made and add a layer of strategy. The game also has a track maker with a lot of additional player made content already available that you can enjoy once the main cities are finished. Overall I really don't understand how come this game isn't more popular, I got this on sale after I played the demo and I can easily say it's well worth the full price! 
1911	1	a	The designer of this game obviously had an accident involving a bridge support and swore vengeance against all street furniture. So steel, brick and concrete all crumble across your car's bonnet like an elderly pensioner's bones. But on top of that you can activate power (or as I came to call it the Michael Bay button) and explode through other racers and buildings. The game is actually rather challenging but it is such gleeful fun carving a swath of destruction through the city that I didn't mind having to retry tracks numerous times. It has a very nice track editor to make your own tracks and play tracks created by other people. This is my kind of online gaming where you don't have to play against other people. The down sides are the terrible soundtrack and the online server seemed to be down quite a bit when I was playing. Also the crash physics were sometimes a little strange but that never really bothered me. In conclusion this is a very good, fast paced, destructive racing game.
1913	1	a	Enjoy intense racing while trying to dominate every district in the city!
1915	1	a	'It ain't that bad.'  If I had to say anything about the game it would be just that. It's a short shallow experience that doesn't even have multiplayer anymore but bought heavily discounted as I did it's a pleasant one.  There are two things I don't like about it tho (safe the previously mentioned multiplayer situation)  1. There is no 'instant race' option. I'd love to be able to tweak some stuff up and/or randomize it and just let it go. 2. The soundtrack is attrocious. I liked a single track from Skrilex in there thus every game start I had to shuffle till I got it... ofc, this is a PC so I easily fixed it but still.  It's as arcade as it gets but on that regard it offers a great 'chill out' gameplay while still being kind of challenging vs the AI thus, NOT FOR THE FULL PRICE, buy it and see it for yourself. The gameplay is samey enough that you can find out whether it's for you or not before the Steam refund period expires.
1917	1	a	On sale, a bargain fun time. Full price... well, not so much. When it came out I was really excited until I found out there was no wheel support.  It's basically Flat Out 3, but more kind of sci fi which is less cool. flat out 2 was tons of fun.  Better graphics... and um.... better graphics. Less fun.  I don't know what has happened to bugbear they used to be so exciting now they can't seem to get anything right. 
1919	1	a	Failed the tutorial race.  12th/10
1921	1	a	Get this game on sale, it's amazingly fun, highly optimized, quite replayable (if your memory for tracks is as bad as mine), rich lustrous graphics on PC, upbeat music, overall this game seems seriously underappreciated. This is one of the better games out there, wish there were some multiplayer folks willing to give this a try but everyone loves Wreckfest NCG these days (which admittedly has far more realistic driving and physics). But this is fun too! Especially if you don't have a G27 wheel yet. I guess I'll try and find some other players who like it as much as I do.  Pros: - Great sense of speed, as long as you don't run into anything 'non-destructible' in the environment, so it pays to learn the course. - Polished graphics, widescreen support via 'Flawless Widescreen' thanks to HaYDeN, super fun with three monitors. The nVidia 3D surround works somewhat, it's much better than EA's pathetic 'Need For Speed: Most Wanted' but of course nowhere near as good as it is in real simulation games like Assetto Corsa, Dirt or even Euro Truck Simulator (!).  - Tons of cars to unlock, althoughthey all seem to handle very similarly, the only thing that matters seems to be speed and acceleration. - The AI seems to be very 'rubber band' algorighm based, with somewhat suicidal tendencies (this could be good or bad, But overall the randomness aspect of it all keeps it fun, it's a bit like baseball -- 2/3 of the time nothing interesting happens, but when you get it right, it's a home run.  - Lots of destruction, which is rewarded, so keep a lookout for those targets and try to have your boost ready to go when you hit them. Hitting them without boost feels pretty silly, errp! - Great singleplayer, lots of crazy tracks, frag challenges with a truck, quite a lot of fun trying to hit all the destructible stuff. - Community-generated maps can be downloaded too, and there's a map editor. - Great multiplayer races (if there were any players).  Cons: - Upbeat music, easy to switch tracks. There's scanner radio chatter or in-game commentary so it feels a bit isolated from real life compared to Burnout or NFS where the audio is somewhat better and makes the game more immersive. - Doesn't seem to be any car customization, except maybe the colour of the paintjob (similar to 'NFS: Most Wanted'). - The initial logon to the server takes quite a long time, and doesn't seem to be bypassable if you only want a quick singleplayer game. - Weird controls, but seems possible to get them to work eventually. Not sure if this game even supports the Logitech G27 wheel, I need to try. At the moment, I've only played it using 'Better DS3' and a Sony DualShock3 (with a piece of elastic to hold the throttle/trigger down, otherwise my hand got tired accelerating all the time!). - It's kinda strange that bugbear hasn't provided any patch to fix the occasional crash when quitting the game, as they're normally amazingly careful about their code, you can see their thoughtful work on Wreckfest NCG.  Overall, it's well worth it, especially if you get it in a Steam sale. Would be worth every penny if you can get a few friends together and play the hell out of it without any of those loony AI doing weird stuff.
1923	1	a	10/10 game has srkillex on it
1925	1	a	In Short: If you are a huge fan or racing, adrenaline or destruction and the 'Burnout' series (which other than paradise, didnâ€™t make its way to PC), you will love this game. Definitely worth the pittance that it costs, fantastic game with a lengthy career, amazing track editor and plenty of Michael Bay to keep anyone happy.  One game mode in particular known as 'Frag Attack' is very similar to the 'Road Rage' events found in Burnout, except you can drive through buildings... and cars burst into flames in slow motion if you're an adrenaline junkie this is definitely worth your time.   You can even create custom events of all game modes with a fantastic track editor. A basic, but entertaining example of this is:  - Create a track with a lot of open space (this is done easily with pre-set assets) - Set game mode to frag attack. - Plant Petrol stations and explosives everywhere. - Let the destruction unfold.   Aside from this the game features a relatively difficult set of career events ranging from your bog standard racing to destruction based racing and drift events/time attacks, set out in districts of a city with the objective of which is to earn enough points to 'Dominate' the district - this is done by placing podiums, drifting, hitting objects, taking down opponents and smashing through buildings. If you like a challenge you should definitely give it a shot.   Closest thing to Burnout since Burnout. 10/10
1927	1	a	It's surpriseling fun, reminds me of Burnout meets Ridge Racer. It's not necessary a bad thing. 7.5/10
1929	1	a	Absolutely satisfying 'Frags' and destruction. The graphics are great and the physics a blast!
1931	1	a	Sadly, this game is just another example of how Bandai Namco can ruin a game with a lot of potential. You can feel the Bugbear influence with the action packed racing, and in some ways, it feels like you are playing Split/Second-lite. If you like arcade racing and can buy the game at a deep discount, I recommend picking it up. However, the online servers have been turned off, which means you will never be able to get 100% of the achievments, if that matters to you. Also, the graphics options are very limited with no brightness adjuster. That sucks because the game is dark.   Then there is the DLC, which is still full price. Can't have a Namco game without lots of DLC.
1933	1	a	Great game. It reminds me of all the crazy racing games I played when growing up. I would just drive in the wrong direction and crash into everyone rather than try to win anything! It's focused more on action than simulation which is perfect for me. If you just want some fast paced action then give it a try. But be warned it takes some time to master. The racing relies more on your ability to create shortcuts by plowing through certain obstables and blowing up your opponents rathern than pure racing skill. The best way to get power points for a boost is to learn how to drift properly and destroying objects. It's the only ridge racer game I've ever played so I cant comment on whether not it lives up to its predecessors.
1935	1	a	A really cool and realistic game! I recommend you play with a steering wheel.

1941	1	a	  Word of warning, please do not attempt to drive a car like this in real life, only people who have serious skill or professionals are able to do so, including me
1943	1	a	You insane racing game, been looking for ages for a game like this! 10/10
1945	1	a	RIDDGGGGEEE RACCCERRRR-Yeah its a fun little game!
1947	1	a	it good, it weal good!
1949	1	a	Controls were â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ poor. Graphics sucked. Pretty much a worse version of need for speed. Absolutely no online. Amazing game would definitely buy again 10/10
1951	1	a	Ridge Racer Unbounded is like one of those arcade machine games that cost 25 cents a pop, and are high octane, slightly cheap races that you keep coming back to.  It's a great game, it plays great, it looks great, but like in almost all games in it's category, it has bad rubberbanding. You could be in front of a guy for 5 seconds and maintain a steady pace, but a minute or two later you'll be towards the back of the pack, even with frequent turbo's.  The cars also feel floaty, like in almost every game in it's genre. When you're drifting around corners, it feels like you're driving a hovercar which you may or may not like.  Being the only Ridge Racer on PC without emulation, I say it's highly worth buying. 9/10

1957	1	a	A really intense racing game with several different game modes. It is quite a challenge for me to complete some of the levels. If you're looking for a challenging racing game, this is the game for you.
1959	1	a	I like the game it is very challenging and fun to play.
1961	1	a	Didn't play much, but I like what I have seen! It's a bit in the NFS style and to my surprise, that works very well.
1963	1	a	Badass game, I recommend it to everyone that looks after a cool racing game experience. A lot more better if you also have a controller.
1965	1	a	This was stupid fun.. no other way to describe it. Its a raceing game where you get pretty damaged with good graphics
1967	1	a	Good game to kill time and it's been awhile since I had played a racing game. It took me a bit to learn how to drift and earn points to advance to the next level but once you figure out which cars are right for it everything just falls in place and makes the game a piece a cake and so much fun to play. From a scale a 1 to 10, I would give this game a 7.5/10.
1969	1	a	I don't apreciate the lack of multiplayer content !!!! but the game looks fine till now , i've no ideea how is it possible for some individuals not to understand how drifting or anything else works in this game . Anyway , the game's not worth 20 , if you get a disscount then buy this game !
1971	1	a	If you can catch this on sale definitely pick it up. This isn't a racing sim. And it's no Need for Speed. But it is fun arcade style racing with decent graphics even for 2015. There's also a race track editor but I haven't played with it yet. And it seems you unlock more parts for the track editor as you race in single player. So it has a nice side incentive to racing.  Multiplayer doesn't work and the servers have been taken down. But for single player action type racing it's worth $3 to $5 sale price.
1973	1	a	It's your average modern racer but with a track builder. I never got hooked enough to try that feature though. There's nothing wrong with the game, but it isn't anything outstanding.
1975	1	a	  Woah! Great Racing Game, You can break walls?! What a nice
1977	1	a	Love love love this game! Awesome!
1979	1	a	I Love this game it improves on the original 100% - it's challenging, fun and full of destruction!
1981	1	a	We need more people playing this
1983	1	a	Awesome Racing game! 7/10
1985	1	a	Think of it as Flatout 3 and its great 
1987	1	a	Well what other game lets you tokyo drift around in a semi while acheiving a 'Fragstreak' against the police? Fun game, definately isn't a ridge racer game though.
1989	1	a	Wow, I though Bugbear were defunct, pity they relinquished rights to their Flatout series as Flatout 3 bombed. As for Ridge Racer Unbounded, if you like racing games with a difference this is yet another game well worth purchasing. Excellent graphics, with some destructible environments and a challenging race series. You score points to upgrade to new races and new cars. The game has enough variety to keep you entertained for quite some time.
1991	1	a	 &gt; Short version:  Gameplay: 8/10 - Graphics: 9/10 - Music: 8/10   &gt; Long version:  Ridge Racer Unbounded is a bit different from the PlayStation Ridge Racer games most of us know. The whole setting is less 'party racing' and more 'dark fight for domination', you're out to take the city - a bit like in NFS titles where you want to climb up the ranks to become the leader of the street gangs, just better ;-) Also, unlike in PS Ridge Racers, you can crash and there is a (very simple, though) damage model (cars have a certain 'health level'), this adds fragging your oponents, or be fragged by them, like known from BurnOut and the likes. You also can destroy (and earn bounus points by) certain parts of the city along the track you're racing.  Yet, with all those differences to the PS versions, Ridge Racer Unbounded is a great game and a lot of fun! The different setting is interesting and an OK change from usualy more 'party' like arcade action of the other RR titles. The damage model and intentional destruction of the city adds well to the gameplay and makes things more interesting and fun.  Also worth mentioning are the 'frag cams', where your frags, crashes and destructions are shown in from a cinematic perspective.  Last but not least does the game feature a couple different game/race modes like normal races, drift attacks and the such.  The graphics are absolutely amazing and eye candy, the music fits well to the overall experience.    Bottom line:   If you enjoy arcade racers, you will likely have a lot of fun with this one. This is kind of a mix of PS Ridge Racer + NFS + BurnOut and the result is a very fun and solid arcade experience. If you're still unsure wait till you can grab it at a deal, definitaly worth it's money, esp. with a few % off :-)
1993	1	a	Made by Bugbear the creators of Flatout, and is a nice looking racing game. I've only made it through the first couple of races, and i like it already.
1995	1	a	Well, its almost all there. It is a pretty hard game which makes me like it  Its worthy of buying I guess
1997	1	a	This Game definately has some nice features, Driving is not one of them Unforunately The last Ridge Racer I played was Ridge Racer 1 so mabye I'm out of touch but This did not meet my expectations.
1999	1	a	what can i say .. this is a good game great mechanics and very nice cars  graphics wise its really pretty and immersive   BUT   BUT .... they shut down mulitplayer   why could they not have made it peer too peer instead of on a main server so keeping it alive as long as there was players too play ..   apart from that the game is reccomended   just a shame the online has gone  
2001	1	a	Nice racing game with good graphics, reminds me of Need For Speed.
2003	1	a	Before I say what I need to say what I need to say I want to say that this game is very fun. I enjoyed the time I spent playing, although I have a lot of complaints.  The game occurs in a place called shatter bay where you pretty much participate in races and other challenges to prove you're the best driver on the road. You can even make your own courses. But since the servers are gone you can't share them or race anyone online.  Now for my complaints  Very little variety  The cars have a very small selection of colors to choose from, 4 max. The DLC cars get no color change options at all. All of the areas look similar, but they each have something to make them stand out from the other areas. For example Ghost Bay (the final area) is just every area combined, but the area is a lot darker than normal. The gameplay is pretty much Burnout's.  Drifting  I think the drifting in the game needs work, a little too much force and you spin out of control and it's tough to get back into control without resetting your car's position.  Fragging  I know some cars aren't very strong but geez one touch and my car gets totaled at times in the game. I feel like strength doesn't even matter because I can take out one of the strongest cars with the immortal, which has the lowest strength in the game, with ease.  Not that many cars  There is a car that you can only use during the last event in the game  The DLC cars are just reskins of other cars, same stats, same look, everything.  Regardless I think the game is very fun. I don't suggest buying the DLC if you plan on purchasing the game.
2005	1	a	great game but needs to state multiplayer is shut down
2007	1	a	Great fun racer, loads of tracks and cars, and the track editor has been done superb, very easy to make tracks. Graphics are good. Some people i see dont like fact you cant change controller layout, but buttons chosen are same as nearly all racing games, so shouldnt be a problem to most people. Got it on sale, absolute bargain!. :)
2009	1	a	This is a brilliant racing game. The last ridge racer I played was back on PS1 and a lot has changed. Not being sentimental about the franchise I had no qualms with the very different feel this had in comparison.  Notable are the excellent graphics, considerable game modes, variety of vehicles, and the kinetic, over-the-top feel. It's can get quite nailbiting and got me on the edge of my seat on multiple occasions. Sound is good, although the techno dance soundtrack was not to my tastes.  I found this to be a challenging game that does not yield its treasures easily: it took me some time to master the drift mechanic and I found the opposition pretty tough. I wasn't sure I liked it at first, but luckily I persisted and I now am having a ton of fun.  As others have noted, there is no longer a multiplayer server which is a shame, but the single player is content rich enough for that not to matter.  I am very surprised at the low marks given on Steam. This is a high quality racer in my juddgment. Luckily there is a demo so you can try before you buy.  My advice is to not quit too early: once you get the hang of the drift mechanic there is a ton of fun to be had.   Highly recommended.
2011	1	a	Good game, love it. Although I'm using the low end PC its still running good, not smooth xD  Btw, the best game I've bought for the low price!
2013	1	a	There are a good few hours of fun to be had here! It's as simple as a racing game gets; you go as fast as possible, drift around corners and smash others out of your way.  The game looks great, plays well (once you get used to the physics that is) and the soundtrack works well (despite not being my cup of tea generally)  The track creation and publishing is a great addition, and I'm sure that it will create many hours of extra play. I love it when developers pull that off well. Portal 2 is so much better for it, and this is too!   Pick it up on sale, and don't expect a serious game people.
2015	1	a	I've never been a huge fan of racing games. I have enjoyed the less realistic ones like Need For Speed, Burnout, and Ridge Racer.   This game differs from the old Ridge Racers games I used to play on the PS2 back in the day. RR: Unbounded is like Burnout and Ridge Racer got together and had a baby.   Its not straight arcade racing like the past RR games and its not over the top crashing like the Burnout Series. Its a great blend of the two with some nice Drifting elements thrown in. Its by no means a cakewalk. Heck the very first track you play I had to re-do numerous times and then eventually had to go back and finish it again with a better unlocked car to get first place.   If you miss the old Burnout games (not the turd that was paradise) and enjoy the Ridge Racer series then this is a definiate must buy at under $4. Lots of great gaming to be had right here!!!
2017	1	a	Honestly, I was expecting another street racer when I bought this, but wow, I was wrong. This game is ridiculous, high speed, destructive fun. It's gameplay is instantly engaging and incredibly satisfying. Every race and event is enjoyable, and going back to get better scores is actually something I enjoyed, and I usually don't like replaying the same level over and over. It's stylish too, with a distinctive colour scheme and very pretty visuals all round. I was lucky enough to get this when it was on sale, and honestly I feel like I paid too little for it. It's worth it's full price easily.
2019	1	a	That's one awesome game! Currently on sale, I'd get it if I were you and had interesting a fun and unique racing game. It has a demo, so make sure to check that out at least and don't take my word for it. :)
2021	1	a	its awsome its interactof the way the creaters set up this game made it come together like a well placed puzle and this game has tons of potential i hope more peapol buy this game its awsome
2023	1	a	great game but needs to state multiplayer is shut down
2025	1	a	what can i say .. this is a good game great mechanics and very nice cars  graphics wise its really pretty and immersive   BUT   BUT .... they shut down mulitplayer   why could they not have made it peer too peer instead of on a main server so keeping it alive as long as there was players too play ..   apart from that the game is reccomended   just a shame the online has gone  
2027	1	a	Before I say what I need to say what I need to say I want to say that this game is very fun. I enjoyed the time I spent playing, although I have a lot of complaints.  The game occurs in a place called shatter bay where you pretty much participate in races and other challenges to prove you're the best driver on the road. You can even make your own courses. But since the servers are gone you can't share them or race anyone online.  Now for my complaints  Very little variety  The cars have a very small selection of colors to choose from, 4 max. The DLC cars get no color change options at all. All of the areas look similar, but they each have something to make them stand out from the other areas. For example Ghost Bay (the final area) is just every area combined, but the area is a lot darker than normal. The gameplay is pretty much Burnout's.  Drifting  I think the drifting in the game needs work, a little too much force and you spin out of control and it's tough to get back into control without resetting your car's position.  Fragging  I know some cars aren't very strong but geez one touch and my car gets totaled at times in the game. I feel like strength doesn't even matter because I can take out one of the strongest cars with the immortal, which has the lowest strength in the game, with ease.  Not that many cars  There is a car that you can only use during the last event in the game  The DLC cars are just reskins of other cars, same stats, same look, everything.  Regardless I think the game is very fun. I don't suggest buying the DLC if you plan on purchasing the game.
2029	1	a	It's got Burnout's Road Rage mode in it. Is that not enough recommendation?
2031	1	a	Ridge racer unbounded is (as others have stated) an eye candy burnout copy. However for like a 10-30 min time killer it is good. It takes a few races to gain an understanding on how to control your car properly (ie drifting). It's a fun game, but I recommend that you only get this while it is on sale, you want a simple racing game, you have a pc controller (don't try the keyboard controls....) and you want to see cars and buildings go boom.
2033	1	a	I've never been a huge fan of racing games. I have enjoyed the less realistic ones like Need For Speed, Burnout, and Ridge Racer.   This game differs from the old Ridge Racers games I used to play on the PS2 back in the day. RR: Unbounded is like Burnout and Ridge Racer got together and had a baby.

2037	1	a	This Game definately has some nice features, Driving is not one of them Unforunately The last Ridge Racer I played was Ridge Racer 1 so mabye I'm out of touch but This did not meet my expectations.
2039	1	a	Game is great no idea why people r hating on it.  9/10
2041	1	a	If I had a Steering Wheel and Pedal connected it'd be exactly the same as the proper Arcade machines. So in saying that, there's screw all reason to brake and the drifting is terrible. But it's still a fair amount of fun. Taking other Cars out reminds me of the whole Takedown theme from the Burnout series. Worth the $10.
2043	1	a	An enjoyable game once you figure out the drift button is the red 'b' button on a 360 controller and not the left trigger. I really like the clean arcade style graphics. The gameplay is quite challenging and is fun. The only negative is that there is no online server for multiplayer. I recommend this if you want a fun, single-player, arcade racing experience.
2045	1	a	There's one main ingredient I find missing in most modern racing games, it's speed. This games delivers on that in a big way. Also the graphics and game set-up with different goals to reach, like going fast, drifting much, fragging cars or just wreck mayhem gives a nice variety to the game while the speed just goes faster and faster. Also it's nice with a game that you don't need to click and load through several screens before you get to the racing, basically you can open a race within half a minute and the race takes like 5 minutes and then you can log out. That's anyway how I do it, not enjoying to be stuck too long in a game. Great game, best racing game I come upon since the 90s.
2047	1	a	Very solid arcade racing game and a great step forward for RidgeRacer franchise. Don't expect realystic physics and simulator experience or neither relaxed NFS Underground style gameplay. This isn't what this game is about.
2049	1	a	Awesome game. It's like Burnout. You race and crash. You destroy other's cars. But there's no multiplayer and no controller support. But still this game is awesome.
2051	1	a	There are a good few hours of fun to be had here! It's as simple as a racing game gets; you go as fast as possible, drift around corners and smash others out of your way.

2055	1	a	Recieved this game in the Bandia Humble Bundle. Now this is no Grand Turismo or Forza yet it is a wonderful time killer and Classic Ridge Racer.
2057	1	a	Happy hardcore and arcade racing? Yeah, why not.
2059	1	a	yo man this gaem has no online!! That aside the game is pretty solid. Just dont think that its like the arcade game ridge racer. its a bit more realistic with the way you turn and stuff liek that.   notable things about the game: has old ridge racer music, has original car brands from ridge racer, and uhh it has skrillex dubstep?? get the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out of here.
2061	1	a	Its so fun! Ridge Racer has come a long way. Feels like pretty polished arcade racer and gives a sense of speed and destructive satisfaction I haven't really felt since Burnout 3: Takedown on PS3. Even for being a 2012 rekease I think it holds up pretty well in 2016 with the visuals and soundtrack. Worth it.  P.S: While some argue it doesn't hold up to the way the original Ridge Racer games were, I'm honestly very ok with this because the old games were not this fun. 1 of the best improvements is the opponent cars actually move or crash when you slam into them.  Also, there is a problem where it cannot connect to the server...but personally, I don't see a need for it and or think it takes away from the enjoyment of the game. Im oldschool though.
2063	1	a	Before I say what I need to say what I need to say I want to say that this game is very fun. I enjoyed the time I spent playing, although I have a lot of complaints.

2065	1	a	Though it's not really 'Ridge Racer' it's still one of the best arcade racers in last years.
2067	1	a	It's Bugbear. It's Flatout on 'roids. Nuff said. It's not â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing Burnout, it's not â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing Need For Speed, it's not Split Second, IT'S â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING FLATOUT.
2069	1	a	You can't miss this oportunity to put your hands in one of the best racing games ever made!
2071	1	a	This is a brilliant racing game. The last ridge racer I played was back on PS1 and a lot has changed. Not being sentimental about the franchise I had no qualms with the very different feel this had in comparison.  Notable are the excellent graphics, considerable game modes, variety of vehicles, and the kinetic, over-the-top feel. It's can get quite nailbiting and got me on the edge of my seat on multiple occasions. Sound is good, although the techno dance soundtrack was not to my tastes.  I found this to be a challenging game that does not yield its treasures easily: it took me some time to master the drift mechanic and I found the opposition pretty tough. I wasn't sure I liked it at first, but luckily I persisted and I now am having a ton of fun.  As others have noted, there is no longer a multiplayer server which is a shame, but the single player is content rich enough for that not to matter.  I am very surprised at the low marks given on Steam. This is a high quality racer in my juddgment. Luckily there is a demo so you can try before you buy.  My advice is to not quit too early: once you get the hang of the drift mechanic there is a ton of fun to be had.   Highly recommended.
1248	0	a	Ridge Racer Unbounded is completely unrelated to the original Ridge Racer arcade games. It managed to introduce a lot of new concepts, such as course construction set (with progressive unlock of building blocks), group racing, lots of cars, multiple modes, destructible scenes, and so on. However, with the shut down of the matchmaking servers in early 2015, buggy game (crash to desktop after several races), and odd handling (there is no tutorial on how drift works in this game) means the game, even at bargain basement prices, is not exactly a good investment.   As a new racer joining the scene in Shatter Bay, your task is to 'take over' multiple neighborhoods by doing well or very well in the various races. Each neighborhood has about 7 races. Winning the races (or at least, get into top 3) will unlock higher races, while accumulating score will increase your rank and gain you access to better cars.   There are multiple race modes, but most races will be 'domination race', where you race up to 11 other cars. Do the special moves like getting air, hit top speed, or drifting, will gain you boost. Once you fill the boost gauge, you can engage boost which allows you to smash through certain 'targets', yielding shortcuts that gain you more boost (usually involve getting some big air) but since boost has limited duration, you have to time its use carefully. Smashing other cars will cause them to respawn, albeit several seconds behind.   So what's the problem? Very weird drifting mechanism. Some guides advocate holding down the handbrake button during the turn, others insist on releasing the handbrake as soon as drift had started. The problem is there is no 'test track' for you to practice. It's always race, race, race.   The graphics are quite good, and as this is a Bugbear product (makers of Flatout series) the game has decent handling... except for the weird drifting. Sound is... okay, with a lot of decent soundtracks, again, just like Bugbear games like Flatout.   You were able to build your own race courses and as you conquer neighborhoods and raise your driver level you will unlock additional blocks to build the courses. However, with death of the matchmaking servers the courses are of little use now, as much of the fun is race others in MP games. In fact, the game is stuck for about a minute checking for nonexisting server when it starts up.   All in all, Ridge Racer Unbounded tried to do too much and lack of tutorial / test track made the game unenjoyable, and the shutdown of matchmaking server is the nail in the coffin. It's fast, it's furious, but it left an empty feeling.
1249	0	a	I just couldn't stand it anymore.  That's my short-review of Unbounded.   Is a long-review really necessary? *Sigh* Well if nothing can be done about it, let's dive in.  I've been a Ridge Racer fan for quite a long time. Aside from Ridge Racer Vita, R: Racing Evolution, and maybe Rave Racer, I've played all the games. I'm extensively familiar with the series, but that's irrelevant. Unbounded is...I don't know what it is. Was it some game Namco bought and then had some RR music and cars included to tie everything together? I don't know. So yeah, if I compare this game to RR, or hell if I so much has even mention that game, then I've lost.   Unbounded takes place in Shatter Bay, where a mysterious group is involved in illegal street racing. Apparently they hate the city almost as much as they hate each other. This is one of those racing games where not only can you obliterate your rivals, but you can also bust through cafes, government buildings, and construction sites for a shortcut. The similarities to Burnout are pretty obvious, though in this game 'checking' a rival is a bit more binary.  By catching air, drifting, and/or receiving various in-race awards, the player gets boost. Aside from a temporary increase in speed, anyone you run into during that brief period is going to get wrecked. This is about a 95% chance. If you're grinding next to someone (oh my) and you hit the boost, they're going to turn into flaming wreckage instantly. When not boosting you have a 5% chance of wrecking someone. This is a neat way to reverse all the dirty tricks that can happen in a usual race. Say you're one of two racers making a turn. You're on the outside, and the inside guy is using you as a buffer to avoid hitting the wall. This is a great time to boost because they'll suffer dearly. Also whenever you wreck an opponent, the game auto-corrects your car, so you don't drive into a wall or anything. Exploiting this mechanic can be quite handy.   Your opponents can boost as well, and aside from the red trail there's no obvious indication that they've boosted. Something like a sound effect could have been really useful. As it stands you're better off handling the other racers with kid gloves (especially if they're cheating AI), because they could boost at potentially any moment and take you out. Boosting is also necessary for certain destructable objects. Their usefulness in the actual race varies, and they could just as easily glitch out and cause you to flip over or get turned around. To unlock more races you have to amass a lot of points, destroying stuff is how you get them.  There are no shortage of tracks in this game. That's because they're all created via a track-editor. It's a neat idea but not really fleshed out. Basically each track is divided into sections. Let's say there is a straight-away, a curve to the right, a squiggly line, a hard-angle right, a dip, a long-easy right, a hairpin right, and that's the track. A lot of time in arcade-racers is spent learning the track itself, but with this game it doesn't seem to matter much at all. Instead you familiarize yourself with particular turns (the 1 or 2 difficult ones to be precise). While the track-editor allows further customization by adding objects and other tools, it's not as deep as it could be. Let's call it a limitation of the game-design. It's difficult to create ornate tracks when it's expected that a handful of racers are trying to destroy each other. There are a lot of created tracks floating around, and some are really interesting. Consider spending some time checking things out online.  I don't like the handling. Normally I'd just tack this on to the end of a huge paragraph, but it's the #1 reason why I couldn't take anymore of this game. The main reason I don't like it is because it's inconsistent. With some games drifting has either A) a sizable learning curve, or B) can be picked up in the first few seconds. Both A &amp; B work on their own. Daytona USA** is an A type, while Ridge Racer (I lose!) is a B type. Both games have appropriate learning curves, and mastering them is an exceptional feat despite the wildly different barriers of entry. Unbounded can't be an A type because the tracks aren't nearly as involved and well-designed. There's only so much you can do with such a base-selection of turns. Unbounded isn't a B type either because the cars have more weight, it takes more counter-steering not to lose control, and deciding between what type of brake to use to initiate the drift is more important. Essentially the system just doesn't gel for me, but I guess it doesn't matter.  This game apparently considers good drifting somewhere towards the bottom of 'things you should actually be concerned about in a race'. In the career mode there are very few time-attack races, and even then they have gimmicks like icons you pick up to freeze the clock. There are drifting events too, but you don't think about applying what you've picked up in an actual race. It's hard to appreciate a good drift in this game, when it's usually more effective to barrel through the opposition with a boost. Sometimes the winner is merely the racer that managed to get away from the chaos. More often than not, driving skill takes a backseat.  Altogether Unbounded just isn't satisfying. It never flicks the 'Hell Yeah!' switch in my brain. Quad-kills, surviving a brutally difficult platforming section, or just executing the perfect drift through the hardest turn, these are just some of the many 'Hell Yeah!' moments. Unbounded has never in my 7 hours* of play elicited that same response. I do all these supposedly awesome things but it's just not exciting at all.   *Yes I realize that by playing the game for a sizable amount of time, I've opened myself up to comments such as 'If you didn't like the game, why'd you play it for that long?' I was ready to quit this game after 2 hours, but that wouldn't be fair would it? Although, I probably should have beat the game, but playing Unbounded for 10+ hours is just too much to ask of me.  Sorry.  **In Daytona USA it's called power-sliding. It's the same but different. DETAILS.
1250	0	a	The racing is okay but not great. The fact that the developer abandoned it, removing multiplayer, means I have to recommend against buying it.
1251	0	a	A game that is mostly fun in multiplayer has no multiplayer as the developer program it so that only official server can provide multiplayer and that server is down. No other alternative, no LAN option, nothing. Dont support Bugbear and dont support Namco, they are the worst companies.  There should be a website like metacritc except for companies, where such filthy bussiness practices would be exposed to mass view so that people would not buy their products
1252	0	a	Can't really recommend this one. Although drifting through a corner certainly gives you an amount of satisfaction, frustration with other elements are plentiful. Results in the race seem heavily dependent on luck, or moreso the absence of bad luck, wich you will have most of the races. The handling feels very mediocre and unpolished.  The scenery or city you race in seems a bit lifeless. The AI is tough as hell, but not in a good way. If you're looking for an arcade racer, i can happily recommend NFS: Hot Pursuit, Blur, Burn-out, Driver: SF or even a Sonic Racer. This one falls short of the quality one would expect from a game in this day and age. I say C-
1253	0	a	4 hours may not seem like much, but it's an eternity when you're playing this game. I gave this a shot because I have great respect for Bandai Namco, but I was sorely disappointed. Once the novelty of blowing up fellow racers wears off, this game turns into an overhyped Micheal Bay style clusterâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. The drift system is awful, the vehicles are ridiculous, and the 'plot' is shallow. (and pedantic) I would also be remiss if I failed to mention that the multiplayer servers are no longer up, so if you play this game, you will be forced to experiecne this torment alone. Trust me, whatever the price is for this, dear reader, it is too much. I honestly wish I had my 4 hours back. If you were considering this because you like racers, pick something else. If you were interested in blowing up things while you raced, go play Burnout. It's way more fun and overall better built.
1254	0	a	This is an awesome racing game but the multiplayer is missing since they shut down the servers only 2 years after releasing the game. If you don't mind just running the same tracks all by yourself this is a really cool game. Reminded me of 'Burnout'. It was very enjoyable playing the online part because you could run tracks other players created. It was very challenging. It has been a big let down since they shut down the servers. Everyone needs to complain to Bandi Games until they turn them back on. This is only 1/3 the game without the multiplayer and world domination. I can't believe they still advertise online player when selling this game.
1255	0	a	This game puts the Ridge Racer name to shame. It is a poor clone of Burnout styled racers, nothing like the classic Ridge Racer games of old. The car physics are horrible and totally ruin drifting as a race mechanic.  THIS IS NOT RIDGE RACER!!!
1256	0	a	  A lackluster and uninspired game
1257	0	a	Ridge Racer Type 4 has always been a favorite of mine, if not my favorite game ever. This game, however, does not even deserve the name Ridge Racer in the slightest. It's a cheap, weird clone of Burnout that does everything that makes it's source of 'inspiration' fun, wrong. It's slow, clunky, drifting is awful and the (crash) physics are just dreadful.  The only plus point I can give is that they put the Assoluto Bisonte from past games into the game, but even that is DLC. There's also a couple music tracks from past games, but nothing exciting.   Still waiting for a game that comes close to RRT4's greatness, Namco. And when you're at it, get me a new Ace Combat game that doesn't suck.
1258	0	a	Imagine if Burnout had terrible drifting, awful music, no Takedowns, and a bad 'boost' system. You'd have Ridge Racer Unbounded. You're better than this, Bugbear.
1259	0	a	The drifting in this game is bloody awful, even with a car that has the drift stat maxed. *sigh* back to Burnout Paradise... you know that game was made in two thousand and eight and it still hasn't been bested?
1260	0	a	Apparently the online servers don't work anymore because they've been shut down. Unfortunately, the multiplayer would probably be the only reason to keep playing this game.  As far as gameplay goes, this game is unlike any proper Ridge Racer game before it. Unbounded is trying to be something akin to a (pre-Paradise) Burnout but it falls short of being better than any Burnout game. The drifting mechanics aren't great and the cars you start with all feel heavy, clunky and slow (even the DLC cars). You don't get the drifting you come to expect from a RR and you don't get the speed you would expect from a Burnout.  RR Unbounded is a game with an identity crisis and as a result it doesn't execute well in anything. I only got this game and some DLC for it as part of a Humble Bundle. With all the issues the game has on top of it's current multiplayer-less state, there is no way I can seriously recommend anybody spend any amount of money for this game.
1261	0	a	DO NOT BUY THIS.   This do not look like Ridge racer at all ! And there is no choice between cars ! Oh yeah you have to pay DLC for that !   This is more like a Burnout or something like that but in less good. The mechanics of the game espaces me , really, you destroy other cars just by using a Boost ?????!!! DAFUK ?! You can destroy a Statue and buildings by using your Boost ???!!! Their boost looks more like an NAVY weapon than something else. You can hardly go speeder than 220KM/H.  I just play this because this is the single Race game i have, and i had it for free with DLCs.   IF YOU READ THIS MESSAGE DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ! TRUST ME !
1262	0	a	This game is frustrating as hell  It's somewhat fun, but frustrating to the highest degree. IMO, needs a difficulty slider to make things more even and grounded. The rate at which your car gets 'fragged' becomes way too often apart from the AI cars, which are tanks compared to your car. It seemingly gives you no chance against other cars, and the speed system is rubber banded, so to speak,so it doesn't matter what car you have, the AI will always catch up, no matter how perfect you drive.  This particular game brings shame to the genre of arcade racing. I usually find them fun, and can play just about anything. Except this...the only thing I can use to describe it is abhorrent.  The game suffers, and I give it a 5/10, and I cannot personally recommend it to anyone. Not even at a $1 price point.
1263	0	a	This game is not very good. Multiplayer is over. Graphics are not beautiful. Destruction of cars and town is worst than others racing arcade games. Driving is very â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up. Realism in the car is sadly â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up too. Only 3 mods of race. I don't recommand at all.
1264	0	a	I never played any Ridge Racer game before, and from what I understood this game is very different from old ridge racer games. What I can say with certainty is that this is one of the most soulless and bland games I've ever played. It feels like it was made by a computer.  Doesn't help that the driving isn't particularly fun. The game's emphasis on drifting just makes it very imprecise. I never felt like I did anything on purpose.   tl;dr game sucks.
1265	0	a	I've been a Ridge Racer fan from the beginning. I purchased a day 1 Playstation together with a copy of Ridge Racer and put countless hours in that game. Winning from the 'devil car' as the final achievement was wonderfull. Even though the game had only 1.5 track(s) did not matter, because the layout of the track was simply perfect. Than came Ridge Racer revolution (ridge Racer evolution was a better name) and again I played that game countless hours. Getting the 'devil car' and 'angel car' took a big effort, but the game simply played as the perfect arcade racer.  Than Namco released Rage Racer and the series slowely started to loose it charm but still it felt like a Ridge Racer game. Ridge Racer Type 4, released after Rage Racer, included a remake of Ridge Racer 1, now with slightly better graphics, and 60fps.  Ridge Racer 5 for the Playstation 2, which included a remake of the orginal track, was the last game I bought in the Ridge Racer series, until this piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Don't let the name fool you, this is NOT a Ridge Racer game. It doesn't play as a Ridge Racer game and it doesn't look like a Ridge Racer game. This is Flatout abusing the name of Ridge Racer. If you enjoyed Ridge Racer, than stay the hell away from this game.   I think I will hook up my old PS1 to play some proper Ridge Racer now.
1266	0	a	Looks like a pop glamour FlatOut + Burnout without good style, good music and good controls. Cars physics is so arcade, that you CANT properly control your car in any cases. RESPAWNS AFTER CRASHES IS A HORRIBLE THING. You can be respawned and instantly crashed by enemy. And enemies respawns in the middle and YOU RESPAWNS LAST. Also enemy crash cam is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ because your car position after it IS A SURPRISE - you can hit the wall or you can STAND STILL! Map design isn't good. Sometimes some walls are destroyable, BUT SOMETIMES NOT! After the cool object destruction with slo-mo etc YOU CAN HIT THE WALL WITHIN 1 SEC! Better play FlatOut OR Burnout. Mixing this games isnt good idea.
1267	0	a	Maybe the worst racing game I have ever played in my life. Long time ridge racer fan. I know it's not real ridge racer but I got it anyway for nostalgia etc. It's not even a decent arcade racer. I could of lived with the levels and cars it all looks pretty good even at 21:9. But the controls and handling make it an awful experience. Wish we had a real ridge on the steam store.
1268	0	a	In an attempt to make Ridge Racer more like Need for Speed Underground and the Burnout series Bugbear have created a game devoid of anything remotely interesting, getting neither their strong nor interesting points right. Less than the sum of its parts Ridge Racer Unbounded (aka Ridge Racer in name only) oscillates between a lukewarm 4 and 5 out of 10. It's a perfectly functional game and anything but horrible but I somehow wish it was horrible so it would have a single memorable ingredient.  Everything you'd expect is sort of there; various generic game modes with sports car pastiches. A bit of drifting from NfS Underground, a little bit of Burnout's car combat, a bit of the destructible environments from Split Second, etc. all of it assembled robotically and efficiently without any creativity, passion or talent. Racing-light is the name of the game - less calories, no taste. For a racing game supposedly based on high speed and drifting neither is engaging and fun enough to keep you interested past the ten minute mark, the bland music doesn't help.  Apparently there also used to be an online multiplayer mode that is now non-functioning. Honestly I'd much rather invite my friends to an office meeting than Ridge Racer Unbounded so this point almost works in its favour but you have to admire the audacity of the publishers who really went the extra mile here, I applaud you.  In short, avoid. It's mindboggingly forgettable and generic, so much so my mind already blurs the select few hazy memories I had of playing it with memories of other, better games. A monstrous waste of time.
1269	0	a	This isn't Ridge Racer AT ALL, it's just a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ burnout rip off( a really bad one)
1270	0	a	Enjoy experiencing your car exploding when the wind kisses the side mirror? Then this is the best investment for you!
1271	0	a	I remember playing the first ridge racer on an arcade with chair and wheel. This game was awesome. Unbounded is not. ItÂ´s pracitcally the worst racing game ever. In time of forza and project cars itÂ´s nice to play an arcady racing game like split/second, but Unbounded is not the game you should play for an arcade racer if you can choose between better games.  The controlles are laggy, whacky and bad. The gamemodes are so boring. Actually youÂ´re repeating four games modes over and over and over.  The rubber banding AI drives you nuts. ThereÂ´s no room for skill cause the AI will always get you.  I beat the game, but iÂ´m really glad being done with it. Now i can spend my time with quality racers...
1272	0	a	Sadly, this game captures none of the elements that made Ridge Racer games so captivating. It wasn't the driving physics. Each track had it's own character - the scenery, the pavement, the layout, the music was hand-picked to match the track You will not find any of this in Unbounded.   What you will find, is explosions, slow-motion fly-by camera, destructive vehicles (including your own), destructive environment, litter on the street, samely brownish-grey color scheme, and indistinguishable and interchangeable tracks. It's neigh impossible to distinguish one track from the next, or even parts of the map. Following the course is a challenge in itself, since all looks just so alike.
1273	0	a	I tried to like this game I really but if I'm honest my one true racing love will always be Burnout 3 and everything else just pales by comparison. The handling, the AI, the track design, the variety in cars and customisation but most important the sense of speed and actual enjoyment are all sorely lacking from Ridge Racer Unbounded.  On the plus side I don't think I paid much for it, the graphics aren't too bad and, apart from the fact it keeps attempting to connect to an authentication/online server that no longer exists every time you start it, it's actually been bug-free.   I unlocked all but the last two areas before finally admitting I wasn't really enjoying myself beyond satisfying my OCD need to complete every game I own. As much as it will annoy me I have to stop and uninstall it. Life is just too short and my 'To Play' list is too long to continue playing mediocre games.
1274	0	a	I wasn't expecting much, but No Wheel Support is just wong for a driving game. 
1275	0	a	I eat arcade racers but I could not stomache this one. No option to change control mapping, and a vibe that screams this developer was late to the genre; Wearing an ensemble that loosely resembles something you like, but nothing like what it should be (Classic Ridge Racer) or could be (Any other decent arcade racer). I bought it for $1.74 and I'm still dissapointed.  Silver lining was the original Ridge Racer GTR lookalike is in the game, playable immediately. So at least I had a couple good memories resurface there. These memories promptly had me uninstall the game
1276	0	a	If you like Ridge Racer and wanted something that has:    A Skrillex soundtrack   No connections to previous RR branded cars   Your favourite colour is neon orange and black and nothing else.   Lens Flare EVERYWHERE!!!   Two of the three DLC cars that was brought in from the prevous installments, (Type 4 Machine + 1 Machine) getting hammered by other cars even though they are the most decent looking.   EXPLOSIONS!   Flatout Crashes + the glorius Michael Bay slow motion camera.   Pretty much nothing to do with Ridge Racer cept the drifting and the boost (which I also hate).  Go get this.  Otherwise don't. Even the damned Grid 2 can pull something better than this.
1277	0	a	From an arcade racing aspect, Ridge Racer Unbounded offers a decent amount of fun, but only after you have mastered drifting. Drifting takes some getting used to. Well, lets just say that it's a lot easier if you pick the right car. Not all cars are created equal drift-wise and trying to win with a poor drifting car is more difficult than it should be. The game does not leave room for mistakes; one crash and you are in last place--so don't even bother trying to finish.  There are many things about this game that I do not like: 1) The initial cars are not only slow, but they all have â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ acceleration and the AI cars will pass you like you are standing still. Not only that, but the AI cheats when they crash and will spawn in front of you at full speed. 2) All the cars look and sound the same. 3) The graphics have an annoying orange hue making it difficult to focus on the road. 4) There are only a handful of areas with multiple events, but each event pretty much uses the same racing map and there is very little variety. 5) Music is kind of hit and miss, some good, most bad.  With so many better arcade racers out there, this one is easy to skip.

1281	0	a	This is not a Ridge Racer game.  I can't even label this as a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Child. It was made to cater and aimed to typical 'stereotypical western gamer'.   Explosive, destruction, lights like Michale Bay? All in this game. The traditional drift handling? All gone. Thrown out of the window.  This game wasn't even released in Japan. They won't even try to own this horrible abomination.  Ohh... Those reviews from top game reviewers? $$$??? Do yourself a favor. Play the ps2, ps3 or psVita version if you really want to play the REAL Ridge Racer.  P.S. This game was priced $49.99 originally. *wink* *wink* *nudge* *nudge*
1282	0	a	Don't even bother trying this one. I wonder what kind of miracle happened so this product holds about  70  Metascore rating. This is way over the top, the  'real'  score should be somewhere near 20. It has absolutely NOTHING to show up as an advantage in comparsion to other games of this genre. If you still have an idiotic idea to try this 'reborn' 'classics', better play   Driftopia   - at least, it's free.  It's all the same. Same engine, same 'old school' graphics. Same uncontrollable cars that feel like a flying gliding bricks of iron metal. Same unimaginably frustrating gameplay. The only thing is good here - the soundtrack. That's the ONLY thing.  ..Oh. You can also check my review on   Driftopia    here   P.S.: Small Update, Dec 2015   Ridge Racer Dirftopia   got out like two years ago from now or something. You can guess why.
1283	0	a	i brought this because it was two dollars on humble bundle and i wanted to see hd bisonte. i can't even use what i paid for.  â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you namco bandai
1284	0	a	Not even worth my time to write a proper review about it.
1285	0	a	One of the worst racing games I've ever played. Consistently found it impossible to win a race and the drifting mechanism is far from scientific. I only played one hour but obtained zero value from it, it made me feel like throwing my controller across the room, terrible value.
1286	0	a	what if they made burnout but with worse physics and graphics and also handling? hoo boy...here it is. ridge racer unbounded still has its moments but the difficulty feels unfair at times and it gives you little incentive to keep playing, with drab and uninspired environments and cars. also, this game is very much 'bounded' as it's not free roaming, and there's tons of rubber banding. It should be called 'Ridge Racer Un-Unbounded' or 'Bad burnout'. The track builder has potential but nobody cares really
1287	0	a	Ridge Racer even three years after the original release it manages to have technical issues such as switching from 30-60 fps out of nowhere causing the game to slow down to account for the frame switch. This makes the game hard to play, especially with what seems like an ai that cheats. You'll be going as fast as your car can go and the ai with the same car will somehow race ahead of you by miles.   Ridge Racer is at best mediocre, and at worst an infuriating waste of time.  4/10
1288	0	a	This game is a reasonable to good racing game with some positives (race statistics are displayed on the background, Sherlock style, which looks really nice). There are three major caviets:  1) The servers are no longer working. This means you have to wait a couple of minutes while the game desperately tries to find them and the game is now single player only.  2) The car mechanics are weird. As others have metioned, drifting feels odd. You have to be able to drift a considerable amount to win.  3) It is very difficult to knock another car off the road (unlike Burnout which takes skill but is feasible) but another car can nudge you if you are on very low damage and cause you to explode in a cloud of rubber, paint, mod kit panels and coconut airfreshners.  This game might be worth trying if it is second hand Vauxall Nova with a Baked Bean exhaust (one lady owner) cheap, but probably left alone otherwise.
1289	0	a	I got this game off a sale in Humble Bundle and I found it regretful for puchasing this game without any research at all (Think of it as a blind purchase).   Well I played Ridge Racer Type 4 in Playstation 1 and really enjoy the track and handling (not to mention the energetic music tracks). This version is a poor rip-off of Burnout that the drift mechanics wasn't explained throughly, making me lost control most of time. The AI is cheap as every time I use boost, I can't cut them off unless I'm real close to 'frag' (crash) them.  As said before the handling of cars is poor and the music is forgettable. Even dozen of DLCs won't saved it. Better off with Burnout Paradise.
1290	0	a	Dull and boring, no graphics options other than a cryptic 'Anisotropy' slider, and closed multiplayer servers. Don't really bother...
1291	0	a	Unbounded isn't a word, and this game is an exercise in trying to powerslide a buttered ice cube at 10fps. Game design is hosed. Skip it.
1292	0	a	Way better play mafia or GTA and drive a cab than play this game. Pathetic driving game. Servers down.
1293	0	a	     so fast i need speed for game   
1294	0	a	Pros:  - Decent racing game - Soundtrack seems good from what I heard  Cons:  - Online was shut down some time ago now - Looking at other reviews, it still crashes randomly. - Drifting system is odd, and probably takes some time getting used to, but if it keeps crashing this is hard to do.
1295	0	a	I got this game as a part of humble bundle sale, so I don't really mind paying for this rubish. However, If you're going to pay for this game, I implore you to look elsewhere.   Ridge Racer Unbounded (RRU) is a sad case example of how a great publisher like NAMCO BANDAI games has lost its identity in the contemporary video gaming world. If I would like to play Need for Speed (NFS), then I'll play NFS games. If I would like to play Burnout, then I'll play Burnout games. RRU is the very definition of identity crisis. It borrows the 'career' mode of most recent NFS, but the concept end up as very linear and boring with no story lines. It borrows the destructible environment from the Burnout series, however, it does not borrow enough to make it slightly fun. Unrealistic drifting was always fun factor and also the trademark of RR series, however it is undeniably toned down in an attempt make the game more realistic. As a result, RRU racing mechanics become something that is neither realistic nor unrealistic. In short, this game is just not good from any aspect it try to sell. The developer copied aspects from other games, yet failed to make it any good. Worse, they also droped many fun aspects which make the original series fun. This game is basically a fail reboot, akin to the fail reboot of the Fantastic Four (2015) film.    PS: NAMCO BANDAI games!!! If you, as a corporation, has allow any developer to bring your flagship RR series to fall this low, then how the mighty have fallen indeed.
1296	0	a	So, this here is a decent racing game. Handling's pretty good, action-filled gameplay, excellent track editor. Sounds like a good game, so why's it a downvote?    Ridge Racer  : Unbounded (keyword: 'Ridge Racer') is a spin-off, spun too far off track from the Ridge Racer project, as in not in the main series, and not made by the actual developers of Ridge Racer either mind you, but Bugbear. Yes, those people. Flatout. Wreckfest. What is a spin-off? Probably depends who you ask, but to me it's a game that strays away from the main series, maybe experimenting a little bit by changing up the main gameplay formula. And hoo boy, let me tell you... it sure changed.  That's my main problem with Ridge Racer: Unbounded, it strayed WAY too far off from what Ridge Racer really is. Ridge Racer is a high-speed, nitrous oxide filled drift-racing experience, and this game really just doesn't capture that timeless Ridge Racer feeling. The drifting is weird in comparison, it's definitely not as fast-paced and you're driving like a maniac. Now don't get me wrong, many a person could probably describe the way you drive in Ridge Racer games as a way a maniac drives, but in Unbounded you take it to the n-th degree by pulverizing your opponents, literally just smashing them off the track. It really, really just feels like a Burnout game.  It'd probably do great as a Burnout spin-off. But then again, EA games would probably never allow this much creative freedom. So again, it's not a bad game, it's just that it really, really feels weird knowing it's named 'Ridge Racer', because it's so much  but  Ridge Racer. Do I recommend it as Ridge Racer? Absolutely not! Do I recommend it as a game? Sure, it's alright.  I have to admit, it's a decent play once in a while, so play it if you're not expecting Ridge Racer.
1297	0	a	What a letdown, I picked this up because BugBear did it and I expected a Flatout 2 like experience. What I got was a confusing interface, controls locked into Xbox controllers ( I play on PC with a joystick.) I wanted to like this game but there were too many obstacles to let that happen. Waste of money.
1298	0	a	Terrible handling, No online multiplayer, no offline multiplayer.  Avoid, not even worth it if its cheap.
1299	0	a	     so fast i need speed for game   
1300	0	a	I bought this expecting more... Didn't deliver.
1301	0	a	You're in your twenties and you still jerk off to cartoons, other questionable material, and play make believe on imageboards infested with pedophiles and children with too much time on their hands, with parents who punish their children in the form of timeouts and soft-spoken words used as intimidation. Do you see what's going on? You are going nowhere, you sit in your room all day and think about the most asinine â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, but you don't progress, you stay stagnant. As the years go by, you fall deeper into the abyss of degeneracy. You're depression gets worse, you start to pick up fetishes you never once dreamed of and you hoard pee bottles and shower maybe once a month at best. You find solace in other people on various communities that are just like you.   You think being a neet and collecting social security is a great thing. You make fun of people who work calling them 'wage-slaves', but you've never worked in your life. You're parents probably hate your guts, but that's not all of your fault, the fault lies with them partially, for not being their enough or not parenting the way they should have. Or maybe they enable you, because they love you so much, and know that there is something wrong with you, but you choose not to get help. You will always stay the same.   You are probably logged in right now, you've been logged in all week and during the entire week, you did nothing. On the off chance you are one of the unlucky ones you will die of thromboses, but hey, it's better to die, than to die trying. That's ok though, because I forgive you for who you are, and I forgive humanity for what it is. We are all lost to time eventually, some of us make it and some of us don't. The world isn't just, life is what you make it.
1302	0	a	this game is awful there is almost no point to the game and awful controls not worth the three bucks I paid
1303	0	a	Me no like it. Its a fail drift game. I will be glad when this drift obsession is over, it doesnt belong in racing games.
1304	0	a	Burnout revenge made from namco. Buy Ridge Racer Type 4,it's better.
1305	0	a	Not very playable on pc (in my mind). way better on xbox 360. Drifting is way off and unconfertable also AI's aren't the best. Graphics are laggy as all hell for no reason. I had to play on 4:3 to get 20 fps (steam fps thing) but it was smooth so idk its wierd.
1306	0	a	On its own, this is just kind of a cool racing game. If I could rate it, I'd give it a 5 or maybe a 6 out of 10. It tries to be Burnout, but the drifting, boost-earning, sense of speed, and car takedown mechanics are too sloppy to compete. It just makes me want to play the real thing - Burnout Takedown or Revenge.  Also, the final nail on the coffin is the name of the game. Ridge Racer. To be clear - this is NOT a Ridge Racer game. It is Ridge Racer in name alone. The drifting I've come to love from the classic series is NOT here. This is a naming cash grab.
1307	0	a	The game looks pretty I can't deny that.   However it suffers from a rubber-banding AI (which I am concinved sometimes outrightly cheats). The result is that even if you come first in an event it often feels more like you got lucky rather than earned it due to skill, tactics and learning the track.  If your not very good at driving games don't buy this, it is not for you as it does not have an easy setting, the first car you get is at best mediocre compared to the early AI cars.  Don't buy it at full price, do consider getting the original Grid instead as it is more satifying.  I'm giving this a no recommend as it is a game with such limited appeal and steam doesn't let me score it 3/5
1308	0	a	Played many better racing games
1309	0	a	this game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
1310	0	a	Meh. If racing games are your shtick and you can get it under $2, then maybe.  I got it as part of a Humble Bundle, and it just isn't worth the 2 Gig of HDD space.  I played it for .3 hours, because that's about all I could take.
1311	0	a	Definitely didn't deserve Ridge Racer title in it. All the drift feel from RR is gone, replaced with this destructable cars that felt weak when it did happen. Race is kinda hard which is good, but sometimes the hard part on winning a race is when you cannot forsee what happen in the next turn. Destructible building are incosistent too.  Online play is dead, so don't even try to buy this under full price!
1312	0	a	Tried it briefly before getting frustrated with the first drift challenge. Uninstalled it. Decided to give it another shot. Uninstalled it again and will stay that way too. Describing the drifting in the game is hard unless you try it for yourself, but trust me. You don't want to. Combine that with near flawless AI that will nail turns perfectly while you struggle and no multiplayer servers (wasn't a big deal to me, but could be to others), and it's a game I can't recommend for any price.
1313	0	a	it's like ridge racer, except the car handling sucks, and the courses suck, and the campaign sucks, and the difficulty sucks, and the online functions don't even work anymore, and... actually, I don't think this is *anything* like ridge racer  also, I tried the beta for that free-to-play version they were planning a couple years ago. it was one of the worst things I'd ever played.
1314	0	a	Players familiar with older Ridge Racer games will not like this game. This is a very disappointing title in the series by getting rid of the arcade-y style racer in favor of copying the same style as the Burnout or newer Need for Speed series titles. One of the things Ridge Racer was known for is the ability to wildly powerslide in and out of corners with crazy speeds while allowing you to feel in contol with some realism (able have manual transmission to change gears, trying to approach the corner just right to get the most speed, etc). This game now dumb things down by having you press a button to try and start a powerslide. This game tries hard to to come off with a gritty story to explain it's darker tone but again, this seems too much like it was trying too hard to be a Need for Speed game. The original design of their cars are nothing more than copies of real world versions. Basically this games threw away what it's known for in favor of copying others and failing.
1315	0	a	The game starts with 2 minutes of trying to connect to the multiplayer servers. Servers which are no longer there but the game was never programmed to acknowledge. When you get in it's almost a shell of a game, there's a single player campaign mode which lets you select a single car (unless you get the dlc) and a single track. When you get into a race the entire pack jostle around within a few hundred meters of each other, so a single slip can easily send you form first to last place and failing to adequately drift around a corner can cost several places. This makes progression feel random as it is quite easy to play a race three times and come in last, first and 5th place. A little bad luck can leave you playing the same track over and over before breezing past the next few.
1316	0	a	I've been racing on the same tile set since the beginning using the same car I unlocked five minutes in. Boring and uninspired. Fails to have the same charm as the games it tries to emulate. A poor man's Split Second. Very repeatitive, very bland. Nevermind that this isn't classic Ridge Racer. This game is just garbage.
1317	0	a	the city made from cardboard :(
1318	0	a	No Multiplayer, horrible controls, not a good game.
1319	0	a	cant connect to any network when i start the game so its pretty boring
1320	0	a	Wanna know the most exciting part of this game?.. Getting the refund!
1321	0	a	This was a great Burnout-like game to play when the servers were operational, but now that the official servers have been shutdown the game is barely playable, with much of the interesting functionality disabled.
1322	0	a	I got Ridge Racer 4 for my PSX as a kid and really loved it. Ridge Racer Unbound was in the Bandai Namco Humble Bundle, so i though give it a try. Maybe its like back then. No its not. Its absolutly not like a Ridge Racer. It might be a good Racing Game, i can't tell after the 30min I played it. But it wasn't absolut not what I expected under the name Ridge Racer, sadly
1323	0	a	First time starting the game -&gt; 'Can't reach server'  First place, I drift around a corner, brush a wall, the car suddenly turns into the opposite direction and boosts straight into a wall. Car explodes, suddenly 12th place. Hit car #11 from behind, suddenly I get fragged from it and I'm 10 seconds behind.  Start a 'Shindo' race which promises a standard race without destructions and with normal overtaking of cars instead of fragging them. 20 seconds into the race, get fragged by an enemy.  Worst soundtrack I've listened to in a game.  2/10 won't ever ridge race again
1324	0	a	One of the worse racing game i've ever played, the control is slippery as all hell to the point where drifting or turn plain turning your car at all can send your vehical spiraling out of control, the music is a dissappoint since previous games in the series had much better soundtracks, honestly namco what the hell is this garbage? you built the game mechanics around crashing and being reckless yet you punish the player for doing so. Need for Speed 2012 was better than this and that game slippery as all hell controls to but atleast the developers had a idea on what they were doing with the that game. If don't know how to make decent racing game then stick to J-RPGs and anime games dammit cause this game sucks!!!!!!!!
1325	0	a	I want to start this by saying that I was skeptical of the reviews I had read, most of which were similar in theme to 'I liek Ridge Racer and this ain't no Ridge Racer!' ...I thought perhaps these were just fans of the franchise who were lashing out because the developer was trying to do something new and different to a series that they hold in high regard.  As it turns out, however, this just genuinely a bad game. I want to say that it only takes one mistake to cost you an entire race -- but the word 'mistake' assumes you have far more control over your destiny than you actually do. This game seems to roll a 20 sided die in order to decide if your drift mechanic will manuever you harmlessly around a corner, slam you into a wall, or spin you around like a top until you explode from the mechanical strain of the g forces you're enduring in your fiberglass sports car that can destroy buildings for science reasons.  ...This game COULD have been decent. Sure, slamming your car through buildings while taking no damage only to to later find yourself bursting into flames because some AI in a mustange sneezed a touch too loudly at you while trying to pass you inside a corner makes zero sense - but games don't have to make sense so long as they're fun. This game seems to have forgotten about fun (and play testing) in order to make room for a ton of explosions, meaningless DLCs, and a soundtrack of mainstream EDM that middleclass white people listen to when they want to feel less mainstream.  This game could even still be playable if you're willing to invest the work necessary into learning it's wonky physics, restarting every race as soon as anything negative happens, and meditating your way through the rage of working exeedingly hard to both get and hold 1st place only to have the game decide in the last quarter of the final lap that the damage to your back left quarter panel constitutes a legitimate risk of ICBM-sized explosion... Yes, the game is playable. If locked in a basement with only Ridge Race Unbounded, after 10 years I'd probably be pretty good at it. One of the best. Or I'd have decided that the assumedly cold embraces of death's infinite nothingness simply had to be less likely to cause me emotional distress, and gnawed my way through the computer's power cable until I tasted pennies.
1326	0	a	I love Bugbear's approach to racing games, and I really wanted to like this one, but with the very best intentions, it's only hit and miss, and even more miss than hit, unfortunately. Many aspects of Bugbear's trademark destruction racing is implemented well (good visuals and sound, visceral environment destruction, easy controls - though except drifting, etc.), but there's one big fault that leads to a string of others, making the entire game questionable. The culprit is car damage, which seems semi-random at best. It's annoying enough if I bang my bumpers at the end of the race and the game decides that I crashed, but due to the idiotic fragging mechanism, I feel like a sitting duck in any race where I can't get a 2-3 sec lead by the second part, where boost increase seems severely diminshed, at least for the player. The boost mechanism is rather stupid by the way, Flatout's nitro makes 100x more sense. Silly racing formats don't help things either. I mean, frag 20 police cars with a truck in a given time? Seriously? When every frag switches on slowmo event camera (at least it can be skipped, but stilll)?  All in all, the game feels like it tries to be too many things at the same time, and succeeds in very few aspects. It's moderately fun when the car damage randomness isn't geared against you, but it quickly loses appeal, and after dominating one location, I'm not sure I'll ever go back to the game. That's not a good basis for recommending a game, so I don't. Too bad. 
1327	0	a	decent game, PC port sucks, has a hribble dead zone making it unplayable :(
1328	0	a	Guys this is kinda bad.  Doesn't really play like a Ridge Racer game, doesn't really have a tutorial so figuring out the not-so-arcadey drifting is kind of a mess, and it's actually got a huge â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ move in that most of the early cars are just... not good. At all. Like, 'potentially impossible to get first place' not good.  There are high points, but you're gonna have the opposite of fun getting to them. When the game gets silly it's awesome. Time trial courses in what are effectively Mario Kart cities with jumps and halfpipes and things are great. There is a mode where you're in a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥off-huge big rig just smashing through cop cars which is also snazzy. The problem is the RACING sucks. Even the DLC is underwhelming: oh, I have Pac-Man and Soul Caliber and other Namco cars? Oh they're... they're just the awful starter cars with a new paintjob? Oh.  :(
1329	0	a	poorly optimized,overused orange and yellow in color grading to the point where the game looks dull,the soundtracks just dont go with a racing at all,cars handle poorly and the levels are just mediocre at best you cant tell where you can go past them and where you can get stuck,there are some passages that look like a shortcut but when you try to go through it doesnt let you, from what ive heard they have moved away from what the franchise used to be and tried this expirment which is a massive failure, imo the overused orange is to cover up the hideous dated graphics which were dated even at the time of release, online is dead servers are down, the cities unlocking is meh and the customization is merely chosing colors for the car you driver.The only good thing i have to say about this game is the presentation looks nice along with the ridiculos amount of stuff you can blow up, it feels like a poor mans burnout or nfs imho, its hard to recommed this even when its on sale.
1330	0	a	If you look at the game piece by piece - it is good game, but when you put it together - it doesn't work well. It seems to have identity crisis and it doesn't seem to be able to choose - or it wants to be NFS or Flatout. By not establishing itself - it competes with those titles while failing to deliver on par with them. I would definitely prefer a racing game without essentially useless (unpredictable) destructible environment and weird physics (on one occasion my car went into air after driving over knocked sign or some debris) or game similar to Flatout, but not this hybrid. At first - I was enjoying this game, but after playing more I will definitely not recommend this game as it is less than sum of its parts.

1335	0	a	uurrrghgh.... I can't say a single good thing about this game.. And to think I actually payed around 50â‚¬ for this piece of â—˜â—˜â—˜â—˜! This and several other games have taught me NOT to buy ANY game on release and full price. Cons: - AWFUL HANDLING (the main reason I can't stand this game) because of this the game is unplayable - There is NO map so you have no idea what kind of turn will be next and should you drift or not. - Music is just boring. The best track is scary sprites and nice monsters by Skrillex and that says a lot. - The graphics aren't even that good.. - No car customization (other than color change) or even rotating and viewing them while selecting a car so no eyecandy for you.  Pros: ehh.. umm... can't really think of any.  I did not try the multiplayer but with handling like this why would I bother...  Don't buy this. Just don't... eh..well, you can play this if you get this for free from someone but remember to feel sorry for the poor soul who paid for this.
1336	0	a	The steering is so off I cant even play it anymore. The MAIN aspect of a game, and its off by like a second from when you press the button.  Worst racing game ive ever played  -Edit- Decided that it might be with my pc, so now that I have a new PC that can outdo the graphics  So I reinstalled the game  One of the worst decisions of my life  Still, the worst racing game on the market. Steering is STILL off, even with a new pc. If I could, I would give this game away to anyone. To the point where I want it REMOVED from my steam account. Dont even want it attatched with my name.  The graphics are good, they really are. I will admit that. The layout and the races are good too. But the steering.... HOW CAN THEY â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ THAT UP. The steering is off, it always has been. From the moment you move the joystick to steer/hit the button to steer, it will wait a little less then a second and THEN steer. Its as if it has input lag like a HDMI tv and a low end console.   Once they fix that, which I doubt they will ever do. I will never touch this game again.

1341	0	a	There's a lot of people saying that this game doesn't live up to Ride Racer standard, but is similar to burnout.  Now, I'm a fan of the burnout series, having played it on the PS2. This game is nothing like burnout either.  The environments in the city that you race around are pretty good by racing game standards, but it becomes quickly apparent that they are consistently re-used, and there's not much variety in them. Plus, nearly everything is destructible, which means there are virtually no hazards to avoid other than flat brick walls at turns.  The mechanic used to 'frag' other racers is just terrible. It seems as if it's trying to be like burnout in that respect [RE: takedowns], but it's so badly made. The only way to frag seems to be to rub up against the back bumber of a car, and magically they get taken out. There's no timing either, so unless you're in direct contact with a car [no pit manoeuvres here], they won't be affected.  To top it off, it is full of obnoxious dubstep music, which i'm really not a fan of.

1365	0	a	While this game offers it's couple of hours of fun, that fun is not worth the 10 euros you have to pay. I got this on sale so it was okay, I suggest you wait for a sale too if you are fan of flatout-style racers.  Forget realism, forget polished driving controls. This is arcade. This is not even remotely Need For Speed And honestly, feels like a bad ripoff of FlatOut series (probably because they hired the same developer..).  This game soundtrack is nice fast-paced electronic music, but having to listen old overplayed skrillex tracks is somewhat unbearable. But the music fits the speed and pace of the game, I'll give some points for that.  4/10 Buy FlatOut instead.
1366	0	a	[Edited]  I've changed my mind, I don't really recommend this game, as it gets me easily bored because of unadaptive difficulty of the game. I would recommend you guys to buy the game when at its sale, since you might be a bit regret paying for it a full price. Ok so let's get straight to the pros and cons of the game.  pros: - Great graphics - Suitable physics for arcade games, (although the drifting physics is a bit sloppy, I don't really like it) - Track editor  cons: - Unadaptive difficulty of the game (it's hard from the very beginning of the game, but it doesn't get any harder each time you progress) - IMO, I just don't like the frag concept when you want to crash the other cars, and it's silly because when you're side by side with your opponent, and then your opponent suddenly activate the power, you'll get fragged (unlike burnouts). :P - A bit glitches (especially when you crash the other cars, sometimes you might just randomly crash into something, and it resets your car so it slows you down) - The game might sometimes crash for no reason  Let me get the next detail for you in the future, I'm still playing the game.
1367	0	a	There's primarily two ways to go for a racing game. You can try to emphasize fun, or you can go for realism; rewarding skill and focus.   Ridge Racer Unbounded does neither. It feels as if someone received instructions on how to code and design a 'racing game' via telephone, while having no prior experience in creating such.   Avoid.
1368	0	a	Oh how the mighty have fallen...  What happened here? Why is the only racing franchise I liked now just a Burnout/Need For Speed clone?  This is as much a Ridge Racer game as Command and Conquer 4 is a Command and Conquer game, in name only, gutted of what made the earlier titles so great.   Such a shame.
1369	0	a	Fun for $6, but not much to this game. Had to use x360ce emulator to get my Logitech RumblePad 2 to work. Any version of the emulator should work, just dump the exe into your Ridge Racer Unbounded folder then create the profiles. It will create the following files in your folder: x360ce.ini xbox360cemu.ini xinput1_3.dll xinputtest.exe  Just not enough vehicles or custimization for me. My 2 year old gets a kick out of it when we play. That is about all it will be used for.

1376	0	a	This isn't a Ridge racer game, but more like a mix of Flatout + Burnout + Split/Second.  The biggest parts of the gameplay are the fragging, track creator and city destruction mechanics. You gain power (which is basically your boost meter) by drifting, chasing/drafting behind opponents, catching air, etc. When your power bar fills, you can boost, frag opponent racers (essentially wreck them), and destroy targeted parts of the track. The track editor is a unique feature where you can use parts to create your own cities (You can even go online and race in cities that other players have created). The main game mode consists of a series of races across several districts throughout the city.  Unfortunately the game just falls too short.  The race types are pretty slim, ranging from destroying opponents while racing, destroying a set number of racers within a time limit, to time attack, to drift attack and normal racing without destruction. The handling is pretty bad. Gone is the drifting from previous RR games. It feels more like NFS The Run or NFS Rivals. A.I. is a bit unbalanced. Some of the track designs are pretty bad (like smashing through a shortcut only to fly straight into a wall and crash). The servers constantly disconnect, which is annoying when testing out one of the thousands of custom tracks online. No custom graphics settings. Literally, NONE whatsoever! Only two controller presets and controls cannot be customized.   Not recommended.

1378	0	a	even at the low low price of Â£2.99 with all the DLC I kinda felt like I had wasted my time and I know at this point I've not even cracked the 1 hour mark.  This is not Ridge Racer. smooth chaining of drifts rarly happen and it just does not have that same feel of speed. Maybe beacuse rather then huge open roads your tied to a tight city with lots of 90 degree bends it just never happens unless your lucky and get a high way section in your race. It also commits the sin of locking cars to just some events so unlike just about every past Ridge Racer some cars you just cant take with you between races. Also it for some reason has a tiny sample of colours to pick from IF your even aloud to pic a colour.  Also I feel like the take out system is almost luck based I hit some guys full T-Bone style and ran a few into walls doing nothing while just touching others burst them into flames.  I was actually shocked to see the Bug Bear name on the loading screen as Wreckfest is currently shaping up to be a great game. This even at the hugly cut price was just crap.  This game tried to be a more edgy and aggressive game to go against other similar titles at the time and IMO Just buy Burnout PC its a far better game and looks just as good.
1379	0	a	not even worth 3$ if you want a game that makes no sense has sloppy controls, gives you bad cars and acts more like need for speed underground 2 even though its not because that game was good then you want this game.. i have played almost every racing game ever made and this one is just utterly pointless and not even realistic.. the original ridge racer was good this one well lets just say the object is to wreck your opponents but somehow they spawn up right behind you.. so you continuously blow them up until your car blows up.. i have beaten almost all games as i will this one but it makes no sense to me.. the game is nearly impossible on the first ever race you play.. did i mention the handling of the cars is garbage? nfs underground is better than this and that was made 10+ years ago!!!!
1380	0	a	Terrible stuttering issues where the game slows down and speeds up with no apparent reason. Drifting is inconsistent and seems to not work consistently, sometimes you don't drift at all and sometimes you do a spin. Collision damage seems unpredictable, sometimes you'll wreck another car with a tap and sometimes you'll hit them at high speed while boosting and get nothing for it.  Also, too many obstacles that slow you down (rather than destroy you). The game tries to be fast paced, but obstacles that force you to stop/spin around/slow down massively ruin the flow. Seems like to get the pace it wants a collision should either wreck you, or slow you down a tiny bit. You end up wasting time trying to turn a sluggish-â™¥â™¥â™¥ car around, wishing you'd hit the obstacle that little bit harder to get wrecked because then you'd get back in the race faster.

1387	0	a	This game could be really fun. Could be. For starters, server's dead. So you load in after a slightly annoying wait while the game fruitlessly tries to connect to the server. So no multiplayer, that's fine. I can forgive that, I love singleplayer games. But to get into the game and spend over an hour trying to beat the first race, hell, even place in it. The drift mechanic is so damn finicky that I end up either spinning out or fishtailing at every corner. And to know that the devs abandoned this years ago...  Thank God I got this from Humble Bundle.
1388	0	a	Absolutely no reason to get this game.  Compared to all other racing games there is as good as nothing that is 'driving' you forward to play the game. At first its exciting, but that wears off real fast.     A)   No Story     B)   You don't own a car, you just pick a limited amount of cars from a list, and the list differs depending on the race type. Only car costumisation that exists are very basic colours that you pick just before the start of each race. (No Economic system implemented)     C)   Controls are odd : The game tells you to drift to aquire 'boost' (Its like nitro but also makes you invincible for the short duration) and has a special drift button for sliding.  Using this button however slows you down immensely and makes your car quite hard to handle. If you would drift just using 'reverse' (while accelerating) (I know, game logic) you get much longer drifts and retain more speed. So why the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is that drift button there then ? The only reason why someone would use this button, is because it makes ur car turn faster (but lowers ur speed like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥), as every car in this game steers like a 5ton SUV.     D)   Even with more drifting oriented races, at the end, you need to be the first over the line. Considering that most curves (yes even in a drifting race) don't require you to slow down, nor drift at all to get through it, you are much better off to continue to accelerate and turn/steer. Even considering how slow all cars turn     E)   Every car looks quite the same, eventhough they may have different stats, or one has the shape of an Italian sportscar and the other of a muscle car, or an SUV, they all still look alike in some way? I know, just weird     F)   The music doesn't add anything extra. It didn't affect me what-so-ever, while in a racing game, it should try to assist in getting and keeping your adrenaline flowing, but not here.     G)   The crashes or 'frags' and demolishing obstacles may seem cool at first, but it wears off really quickly.     H)   Some might say 'But its an arcade game.', to sanctify the things that are missing in this game. That is true for points   A  ,   B   &amp; a lil bit of   D   (first over the line regardless what) that are elements of the arcade genre. However I still play arcade games from years past, and comparing those games with this one is in my opinion an insult to the older arcades.   Main reason why 'racing' in this game was so simple, was probably because I just couldn't last longer then 2 hours. It just doesn't spur you on. Maybe with faster cars, further into the game, the drift button will have its use, especially if you end up 2 fast to go through the curve without drifting / hitting the brakes. But what's the point if the game is sooo dull in the beginning you won't even get to that content ?  As a conclusion this game did not spur me on what-so-ever. I was sitting in my chair, unexcited, bored, expressionless and calm while playing a racing game .... Not worth getting even if it was on a big sale, its simply not worth your time, nor your money.  There are far better racing / arcade games out there.
1389	0	a	I'm not quite sure what I expected with Ridge Racer: Unbounded. The title sounded cool and I had heard decent things a few years back, but I never realized that Namco Bandai had tried their hand at a Burnout game. When I first loaded the game, I was delighted that this was taking a more destructive approach to racing.  After I finished the first event, I knew something was very wrong. The previous Ridge Racer games were all about speed. Tight turns, tighter controls and hilariously awful translations; that is what gave Ridge Racer its charm. All of that gets thrown out the window for Unbounded in an attempt to modernize the series.  For starters, the graphics are darker and more realistic than ever before; the pace has been slowed a bit and the cars feel far too weighty. Drifting, which is an integral part of the track design, is so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing busted that I nearly quit in fury a few times. Busted explains a lot of things with Unbounded, but it applies more to the controls then the arenas you'll be tearing apart.  The newest addition with Unbounded is the destructible environments. I have to give credit where credit is due; Unbounded does offer an impressive amount of course carnage. While the props are basically made of styrofoam, your car can glide through things and not immediately crash. Sadly, that's about the only decent thing in the tracks.  As for regular buildings, your car typically gravitates towards them. Barely clipping them will usually cause your car to smash up, but sometimes you go flying through the air or spinning in circles. While that should be realistic, the game has an awful tendency to reset your car before your crash site. This causes a tremendous amount of wasted time in Time Attack events and often causes you to lose up to 7 places in race mode.  These should be fun, but the physics and AI of the game are so borked that I couldn't wrap my head around them. At times, you fly out of the gate and pass everyone with ease. Other times, the opponents are beyond hard and you'll hardly catch them. Sometimes you'll smash through highlighted objects only to immediately crash once the automated cutscene ends. You'll even make jumps only to see your car barrel rolling through the air, despite not clipping anything.  There is also some horrible graphical glitch that causes constant flickering for upwards of 15 seconds at a time. It obscures some of the track and leads to wiping out or missing turns. It also looks terrible and gives me a headache, but that may be a personal issue.  What isn't personal is information about your cars. The stats are shown before you decide on your vehicle, but they aren't really reliable. Maybe this is more down to individual playstyles, but the car with the highest speed stat should be the fastest one on the track.  There are also some cars that are carbon copies of others (excluding the pointless DLC) and others, still, that have mostly the same stats, but are higher in key areas. It makes certain cars completely worthless after reaching higher driver levels.  Then there is the lack of course diversity and the general sluggishness to the controls. It just doesn't feel pleasant to play Ridge Racer: Unbounded. I had fun, at times, but not enough for me to recommend this to anyone. The lackluster campaign and hilariously anti-climactic ending just rub salt in the wound.  The online portion is completely non-functional. From the sound of what it included, it could have remedied this package. Racers were given the ability to customize events and challenge others worldwide. While it may have been frustrating to deal with the controls, I could see smashing people into walls as being a blast.  Still, that doesn't work. Namco Bandai shutdown the servers in 2015 and have basically cut the game in half. The price tag, at least, reflects the lack of multiplayer, but it still sours the overall package. Having courses made by other players would be outstanding, even if the game feels rushed and sloppy.  It doesn't help that there isn't a split-screen mode at all. I know PC games typically don't offer split-screen, but even the console ports of Unbounded lacked the feature. In other words, the multiplayer was basically a bulletpoint on features for the game. No one actually cared about molding it into a celebrated feature (something that should be sorely missed upon it's closure).  Overall, I just wouldn't bother playing this. Unless you just have a fondness for the Ridge Racer name, there isn't much here that hasn't been done better in other racers. Unbounded mostly made me pine for a new Burnout or to return to Burnout: Revenge. Even the crappy portable Burnout games are better than this drivel.  3/10
1390	0	a	A racing game without steering wheel support? Seriously?
1391	0	a	This is not Ridge Racer !!! Atleast not as i know it. Its more like a mix of Need for speed and Burnout. Now they all have differant kind of stuff you need to do along the road ..that is not the Rigde Racer i know of. Dissapointing ? yes i would say so..the cars have zero feedback and most cars react all the same. No online server so basically its one player mode only
1392	0	a	I don't know what this game is supposed to be.  As a racing game it is unexciting, and as a destruction game it doesn't have enough explosions.  There aren't enough cars or tracks to choose from early on. Colours are limited. Everything has to be unlocked and winning is nigh on impossible. It is also a drifting game. I hate drifting games.
1393	0	a	A few years ago, a friend of mine talked me into this game. I did horribly and assumed it was because I was terrible at racing games (spoiler alert, I'm not THAT bad). I came back to the game for some entertainment while Dirt 3 is installing, and some poor entertainment it was. And I'd like to think I've got a little bit more racing game experience behind me at this point. The drifting controls are abominable, the boost mechanic is overpowered (rear-ending someone while boosting kills them). Also, I've heard tell that the multiplayer is down. And the car selection is pretty limited as well, even if you bother to go through and unlock things. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money on this game.
1394	0	a	[Edited]  I've changed my mind, I don't really recommend this game, as it gets me easily bored because of unadaptive difficulty of the game. I would recommend you guys to buy the game when at its sale, since you might be a bit regret paying for it a full price. Ok so let's get straight to the pros and cons of the game.  pros: - Great graphics - Suitable physics for arcade games, (although the drifting physics is a bit sloppy, I don't really like it) - Track editor  cons: - Unadaptive difficulty of the game (it's hard from the very beginning of the game, but it doesn't get any harder each time you progress) - IMO, I just don't like the frag concept when you want to crash the other cars, and it's silly because when you're side by side with your opponent, and then your opponent suddenly activate the power, you'll get fragged (unlike burnouts). :P - A bit glitches (especially when you crash the other cars, sometimes you might just randomly crash into something, and it resets your car so it slows you down) - The game might sometimes crash for no reason  Let me get the next detail for you in the future, I'm still playing the game.
1395	0	a	While this game offers it's couple of hours of fun, that fun is not worth the 10 euros you have to pay. I got this on sale so it was okay, I suggest you wait for a sale too if you are fan of flatout-style racers.  Forget realism, forget polished driving controls. This is arcade. This is not even remotely Need For Speed And honestly, feels like a bad ripoff of FlatOut series (probably because they hired the same developer..).  This game soundtrack is nice fast-paced electronic music, but having to listen old overplayed skrillex tracks is somewhat unbearable. But the music fits the speed and pace of the game, I'll give some points for that.  4/10 Buy FlatOut instead.
1396	0	a	Constantly tries to reach the online servers but the servcers no longer exists, so long wait for the authentication check, which happens several times in game, plus no multiplayer. Also the laziest console port I have ever seen - 1 variable in the display settings and no mouse use in game. Awful.
1397	0	a	The music is ridiculously bad, the levels are uninspired, the engine sounds way to boring, the handling of the cars is just HORRIBLE, the game itself lags like hell and nothing offers any fun. I played for about ten minutes and I'm already wondering what unbelievable crap this game is.  And after the second race it quits to desktop with a strange error.
1398	0	a	There's primarily two ways to go for a racing game. You can try to emphasize fun, or you can go for realism; rewarding skill and focus.   Ridge Racer Unbounded does neither. It feels as if someone received instructions on how to code and design a 'racing game' via telephone, while having no prior experience in creating such.   Avoid.
1399	0	a	Fun for $6, but not much to this game. Had to use x360ce emulator to get my Logitech RumblePad 2 to work. Any version of the emulator should work, just dump the exe into your Ridge Racer Unbounded folder then create the profiles. It will create the following files in your folder: x360ce.ini xbox360cemu.ini xinput1_3.dll xinputtest.exe  Just not enough vehicles or custimization for me. My 2 year old gets a kick out of it when we play. That is about all it will be used for.
1400	0	a	Ice Road Truckers the video game.  Cars slide everywhere. Very hard to controll.  Blowing up the other cars is fun but very inconsistent.
1401	0	a	Last Ridge Racer game I played was Type 4 and I expected something as fun as that but this games just so boring, its really an overall disappointing game.
1402	0	a	NO, absolutely not. This is not a Ridge Racer. This is a simple copy of a Burnout game. I'm really disappointed. I can appreciate trying a different angle but when you slap 'Ridge Racer' on a title it's a bit too far.
1403	0	a	Simple racer, doesn't feel fast tho.
1404	0	a	This game is just not fun. It looks fun, but it's not. The physics make no sense even for an arcade game. The car feels like a brick on ice and all AI opponents are rubber-banded. You can turbo several times and take the lead only to be smacked in the back and get overtaken by several opponents, sometimes ending up last place. Driving is sluggish, the car is unresponsive and the collision physics make no sense. You can slam someone full on and get no points, or you can get slightly touched on the side of the vehicle to get blown up. It's juts... not recommended...
1405	0	a	Terrible stuttering issues where the game slows down and speeds up with no apparent reason. Drifting is inconsistent and seems to not work consistently, sometimes you don't drift at all and sometimes you do a spin. Collision damage seems unpredictable, sometimes you'll wreck another car with a tap and sometimes you'll hit them at high speed while boosting and get nothing for it.  Also, too many obstacles that slow you down (rather than destroy you). The game tries to be fast paced, but obstacles that force you to stop/spin around/slow down massively ruin the flow. Seems like to get the pace it wants a collision should either wreck you, or slow you down a tiny bit. You end up wasting time trying to turn a sluggish-â™¥â™¥â™¥ car around, wishing you'd hit the obstacle that little bit harder to get wrecked because then you'd get back in the race faster.
1406	0	a	I came from playing the original Ridge Racers. The games were fast-paced, joyous, and celebrated the mechanical marvel of the automobile.   Unbounded disagrees. The game takes place in Shatter City, where for some reason, people live oppressed or something. The story of fighting the system through vehicular mayhem just kinda feels silly to me. It's like the game treats cars as a way to complete its objective, rather than celebrating racing.   And that's disappointing. While it is alright, I can't say in good confidence that I'd reccommend this as a Ridge Racer game. Maybe a new Burnout title or a Flatout title, or even its own IP. But this is not Ridge Racer.
1407	0	a	While the game itself wasn't bad it had nothing to do with Ridge Racer. With the online component having been taken down sometimes (almost all the time) the game can't even get through the achievent check when the game starts. If you're looking for a racing game for the love of all look at something else unless you enjoy staring at a black screen telling you it's doing something (but doing nothing).
1408	0	a	Definitely a decent arcade-racer, but it gave me the same impression GRiD 2 did: It's not sure what it wants to be, and it just ends-up feeling mushy.  Drifting, as you'd imagine, is a central mechanic in games of this genre. And while they do require practice &amp; nuance to do well in Unbounded, they just never feel good to pull off, and feel wildly inconsistent most of the time.  After I figured-out the drifting was something I didn't enjoy (even when I got decent with them), I tried to just race clean &amp; fast, and take corners with an optimal driving-line instead. And surprisingly, it worked-out, and I actually got rewarded for finding ways to take tough corners at optimal speed (even just barely touching a wall can knock-off a lot of your momentum). Not something I expected from an arcade-racer, and I got some enjoyment out of that aspect.  And now, the issue of rubber-banding: Surprisingly, Unbounded does NOT have it. Or, at least, I couldn't tell if it was there. If I raced really well and maintained optimum speed on corners, I would usually be 2-or-3 seconds ahead of my opponents, and I'd stay that far ahead for the duration of the race - they'd only encroach if I messed something up. Although, courses with lots of straight-aways are another story: They usually inexplicably sped ahead of me during long stretches of track, even if I was way ahead of them on the last corner. Not a huge issue, but it can feel unfair when the AI magically speed past you if the finish-line is at the end of a long piece of track.  What I want out of a racer is either a) an authentic simulation that rewards good driving or b) a crazy arcade game that still has its nuances. Unbounded doesn't deliver either for me. Its drifting feels really bad, so that cuts-out the arcadey-but-naunced aspect for me. And the physics &amp; handling are too arcadey to make optimal driving-lines feel good, so it's not in the authentic category either. It feels like a strange game that has no identity.  Unbounded's definitely not a bad game by any means, but there are many, many other better racers out there. Play them instead.
1409	0	a	Controls are very wonky on the keyboard, I highly reccomend using a gamepad. That being said would I reccomend this game to anyone? Not really there are tons of other racing games out there that fill this genre much better and for less money even. Do not get me wrong, its an okay game, just much better out there.
1410	0	a	 I'd Rather Do My Report
1411	0	a	Its pretty but its not a ridge racer game..the studio behind this are behind the flatout series..and boy can you tell..this is flatout prettied up and with the ridge racer title slapped on.
1412	0	a	Give us back MP and I will recommend it! -___-
1413	0	a	Don't buy this game, No is a Ridge Racer's game classic with arcade races, is other ''Need for Speed'' game type, but of the nanco. The online service is dead, well now don't matter
1414	0	a	it's an awful experience from the beggining, since there is no info about how the game works
1415	0	a	I guess it's time to buy a 360 controller because evidently no racing game made in the last year supports any other type of controller.
1416	0	a	I really wanted to like this game, however it's total crap.  Handling is poor, drifting is horrible and necessary. Oh to top it off the game is completely unsupoorted by the publisher. Just glad I got this game from a Humble Bundle otherwise a bit of a good money would've been wasted.
1417	0	a	This game could be really fun. Could be. For starters, server's dead. So you load in after a slightly annoying wait while the game fruitlessly tries to connect to the server. So no multiplayer, that's fine. I can forgive that, I love singleplayer games. But to get into the game and spend over an hour trying to beat the first race, hell, even place in it. The drift mechanic is so damn finicky that I end up either spinning out or fishtailing at every corner. And to know that the devs abandoned this years ago...  Thank God I got this from Humble Bundle.

1420	0	a	I like the Ridge Racer series a lot. I like the Flatout Series a lot. I'm mostly indifferent about RR:U. However, if I were simply indifferent I wouldn't review this game at all. I have to go through the effort of disuading purchase of the game simply for the removal of its online services. But while I'm here for that I may as well talk about its snoozefest content.  So accessing other user's content and the majority of online services are gone. What's left of it is a mediocre racing game having little of the charm of either Flatout or Ridge Racer. Yes, stuff blows up and Yes, there's super exaggerated drifting. A clear connection is drawn to RidgeRacer and Bugbear, but sadly, the drift mechanics feel weak and are poorly implemented compared to other RR games. As for the destruction, it comes off as canned and grows largely unimpressive as believeability escapes with the game choosing what can and cannot be taken apart. That and the cookie cutter maps and environment start running together and weren't that great looking in the first place.  As it is, it should be in an arcade cabinet at Chuckee Cheese. If you're looking for an arcade racer to really stay with, I'd pick up almost anything else. If it's priced at like a dollar and you're only expecting that much out of it, you wont be as disapointed.

1426	0	a	The slow-mo crashes look cool, especially since just about everything short of entire buildings is destructable. That's where the positive stuff ends.  For one, when you start the game it's immediately obvious that PC wasn't the lead platform. The options that you can change are minimal, so you won't be able to get rid of the disgusting instagram filters and nauseating overused bloom effects that make the entire game look like a trashy CoD killstreak montage video. And that's just one of the game's smaller problems. The physics are horrifying, and I don't say that from the perspective of some elitist sim-only race enthusiast; I LOVE arcade racers, and the games that Bugbear made before this one (Flatout 1 and 2) were both tons of fun. Ridge Racer has always been about speed and control, but something is definitely off with the handling model here. Cars feel like absolute tanks when you're driving in a straight line, but initiate a drift and suddenly your car will feel as weightless as a paper airplane. I know that's kind of how drifts are supposed to feel (in a very VERY simplified, vague sense), but it shouldn't be that exaggerated in ANY game. On top of that, in the time that it takes to get used to the handling model, you'll realize that you've seen just about every game mode that Ridge Racer Unbounded has to offer. It's extremely repetitive. I've re-installed this game on 3 or 4 separate occasions, and I've really tried to give it a second chance more than once. I'm disappointed every time.  Save your money. Bugbear's older games from the Flatout series are fantastic, and their new game Wreckfest (Next Car Game) is a little more on the realistic side but it's more fun than this. I'd skip RR:U if I were you.

1429	0	a	This game is not Ridge Racer, it is a generic Burnout clone with the Ridge Racer name on it.  Ridge Racer games are bright, colourful, with happy techno music and wide open streets where you drift round corners. The drifting mechanic is extremely simple to learn and is very well designed and implemented. It is Ridge Racer's trademark gameplay.  In this game we have only dark, tight streets, mostly annoying music (there are a tiny number of tunes from other RR games, 2 or 3 from memory) and worst of all, the drifting is terrible in this game. It is badly designed and you have to smash into objects in order to earn boost. It is the most ill-conceived and unintuitive game design I can remember. Some objects are breakable and give you boost, others will make you crash. The difference between these objects in appearance is not obvious so you have to either learn from trial and error, or hope for the best. Other larger objects can be smashed through when you have full boost, but not at other times. The game will take control of your car during this time, and often hand you back control when a crash is unavoidable. So the game basically forces you into crashing.   The game varies between easy and maddeningly difficult. Make no mistake this can be a very frustrating game indeed. I don't think there is any catch-up or rubberbanding, because typically if you let the AI get a lead and crash on the harder levels you might as well restart as you have next to no chance of winning. On the other hand, I have found myself with huge leads and I've even found myself stopping and waiting 20 seconds for the other cars to catch up, so I can try and score more points in order to unlock the next stage.   I have completed the career mode but in the end it was more for my own personal satisfaction than because I was really enjoying myself. I've recently been playing Ridge Racer 6 on the 360 and Ridge Racer 2 on the PSP, both of which are PROPER Ridge Racer games and are miles more fun than this game is. Loads of fantastic tunes, open roads, addictive drifting, colourful happy environments. Real feel good games. We still wait for such a game on the PC - this isn't it.  Oh yeah and it likes to crash to the desktop a lot (I'm using Windows 7) seemingly randomly.

1431	0	a	I can not recommend this game, not so much because of the game itself, but because of retaliation of the publisher to negative reviews. What I have to tell is too much information to rewrite all of it here, so I'll just post a link to my review of the publisher(s) to save a LOT of time:   http://www.wondergamer.net/reviews/vindictive_retaliation_to_negative_reviews.htm 
2073	1	a	Good racing arcade for F1 fans. But itâ€™s only for players that are fond of arcade racing and F1. It of course doesnâ€™t worth its normal cost. You should buy it ONLY on sale above 50%. DLC are unreasonably expansive! Especially China Track which is the worst DLC Track but the most expansive (LOL). But Europe, India and Canada are rather good. But anyway they are very expensive. Buy it ONLY on sale.  Multiplayer isnâ€™t the strong part of this game â€“ many players has different problems with online mode, but it works:  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=316882599   For this you should link your Steam and Race Net accounts:  http://steamcommunity.com/app/203680/discussions/0/846959362244973673/   http://steamcommunity.com/app/203680/discussions/0/864951475503458740/   You should also learn some tips or it will be difficult to play it:  1) Watch videos of shortcuts (include locked ones):  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=113147181   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=113338734   2) Learn how to do start and jump boosts:  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=130374135   Eventually itâ€™s your choice but for me itâ€™s awesome. I get a lot of fun playing it with my friends via split screen (up to 4 players) and via multiplayer.  You may also right to me if you have some problems or you want to play online! Donâ€™t hesitate ;) 
2075	1	a	F1 Race Stars is ALMOST a very good game. But ultimately it is frustrating and somewhat lacking in comparison to other top kart racing titles. It is fun to play as your favourite F1 drivers in cartoon form, with lots of nice power ups, and some truly original and very innovative racing modes which keeps interest levels high. The graphics are quite good, though of course they are meant to be very cartoon-like as opposed to photorealistic. Overall, there's a lot of good to be said about the game. It is certainly a challenge!  But here's the rub: the game is challenging in the most frustrating of ways. Firstly, there is essentially no difficulty level. The 1,000 vs. 3,000 cc only changes the speed of the cars. Facing the AI is like a baptism of fire. It is relentless, and one can win only with a mix of skill and luck (luck being by far the most important factor). I don't like to win every race, but when I lose I want to be able to remedy that by improving my skills. Not so in F1 Race Stars. You can be racing at your very best and come dead last by virtue of a bit of bad luck; likewise you can race like a drunkard and come first with a contrary amount of good luck. This, unfortunately, is a very nearly game-breaking fault. As a result, what could have been a classic kart racing title will be one to forget in comparison to a Mario Kart or Crash Team Racing. But all in all, it isn't a bad game. Fun but frustrating. 7/10.
2077	1	a	If you can get this game on sale, like I did, then it is a pretty decent time killer for a few hours (I recommend it on sale, but not if its standard price). However, the novelty factor quickly runs boring and there are a few issues with the game: it looks and plays like they tried to rip off mario kart, the boosters are ridiculous and can get you from anywhere, if you are dominating then it seems to rain a hell of a lot to bring you back to the field.  If you like this sort of game there are plenty of levels and steam acheivements to work through, and if you are a fan of F1 then its a bonus novelty to have real drivers and teams (I am not).
2079	1	a	10min of gameplay (i show 1 lap for each of the dlc tracks)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01w8wpPml1M   This is a cart racing game with real f1 drivers. Since this is linked to f1 there is no drifting so you'll need to use your breaks on turns or pump the gas also hiting the other cars drops your speed. You get 11+4 dlc tracks, 28 drivers in 14 cars in 1, 2, or 3,000cc. Each car is shared by 2 drivers and each car has a different ability, stuff like better boosts, more of a item, off road, and many more. Items come from stares on the track and give power-ups like, speed boosts, bubbles (can be placed behind you to block or shot forward &amp; stops a driver), a shockwave (disrupts cars around you), a teleport (jump ahead a bit), a rocket (become a rocket and fly forward), rain cloud (slows) balloons (if hit will cover your screen with confetti), and a pace car (slows the head cars). Tracks have hidden paths (i think you need items to use some) and it will sometimes rain. Cars can get a boost at the start if you hit the gas right, and again sharp turns are hard with no drifting. Boost pads on the track charge up a battery on the back of the car before you can use it. Taking damage or hitting a object head on will damage your car and you'll be slower and handle worse until you can drive down a pit lane.   The game is polished, runs without errors, and can be fun though i know some complain about the turning it wasn't a deal breaker for me also the purple car at the end has a off road ability so you won't lose as much speed when your off the track. The character motions are campy but they also give the feeling of sportsmanship and that they don't hate each other, also the opening race thing is skipable.  The dlc The 4 tracks are ok, not sure they are worth $5 each and if you want to see them i have all 4 in my video. As for the accessory packs, these change your skid marks (you wont even notice), what your tailpipe kicks out when you boost (you'll barley notice), &amp; your horn (you'll notice this most and i can see people liking the air horn in the party pack) Though i didn't feel they give enough for the price (all 9 for $9). If it was all in 1 cheaper pack maybe but how it is now, i'ed pass.
1435	0	a	I normally dont write reviews but... for this game i just had to! Because everybody has to know thats its totally extremly and absolutly... â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Dont buy it. Dont let the shiny graphics, license and comparison with mario kart blind you into buying this! Why? Because the game mechanics is bad. The team did really a good job on polishing the game. But the mechanics... for example, if you get hit by an enemy extra, you get a double punishment. Not only for the extra that hit you, but also your car is broken now and you drive more slowly. You have to drive trough a pit stop (normally around 2-3 on the map) where you lose AGAIN time to repair your car. If you add the pit stop you get triple punishment... wtf... It also has no kind of fun mechanics like in sega sonic all star racing or mario kart where you can use your skill to get extra boosts. Instead you have Kers... and Jump Boots... where you just have the possibility on some occasions by simple button releasing and pressing to gain an extra boost. Yay again... Please DONT BUY Save your money! I am Sorry for the dev Team, You did a great job with the game overall, but your game lead designer should buy any nintendo mario kart game to see what good game design for fun racers is. Thx
2081	1	a	i didn't expect this much funny and cute game from codemasters. they are making games as racing simulations. f1 race stars has all licenced drivers and ads. graphics are amazing. drivers talking is very funny and it depends on driver's country. if you like mario kart or like funny games you should try it out.
1436	0	a	You cannot customize the keyboard at all, and it only works with 360 controller.  I can't imagine it would have been too much effot to be able to change the keyboard keys, or to have added support for other gamepads, but it is beyond the expertise of Codemasters it seems.  Its a shame because it appears to be a reasonable game but these are serious hurdles to its value.  Go play Sonic All Stars Transformed instead.
2083	1	a	Very good game, attractive. I'm so glad to find a game on computer who looks like Mario Kart. But one bad point, we can't change the hotkeys...
1437	0	a	F1 Race Stars is  incredibly  shallow. For your full price you get a grand total of seven tracks with very little variation outside of them. It's a very fun splitscreen experience... that's better suited for a console. F1 Race Stars took plenty of chances but they didn't pay off and for full price you're going to be playing a flawed game that could have been more fun. This is made worse by the fact that the online is dead and the game has trouble reading multiple controllers at times. If you have four guys who'd like to play it and can get it really cheap on a sale, I'd say it  could  be worth a look at, but F1 Race Stars doesn't do anything for anyone outside of that small, situational demographic and that's just dissapointing.
1438	0	a	A complete dissapointment, and the multiplayer does not work well if at all.
2085	1	a	F1 Race Stars is a great arcade racer with off the wall collectable bonuses and power-ups or hazards. Great humour and flawless gameplay. In the tradition of Sonic All Stars racing or Mario Kart ... but be warned, this one is on steroids. Controls are smooth and intuitive with full support for an X-Box 360 wireless game pad controller. This game is really fun to play and comes highly recommended!  9.5 / 10
2087	1	a	Funny game, but I really miss the option to change the controllkeys. WASD is not the best option here as a right-handed gamer, arrows would be better for me.
2089	1	a	With Controllers, this is a fun party game. Gameplay similar to Mario Cart.
2091	1	a	If you want a break from the Racing simulators and want a bit of fun then you got to buy this and the DLC's. I really have enjoyed playing this to date. Typical Codemasters high quality game. I recommend it on sale or at full price
2093	1	a	A cool racing game to play!  10/10!    I wish DLC was free!
1442	0	a	...  ... ... ...   I'm done. I quit. I can't take it anymore.  Pure Racing is the worst game mode I've ever played in any game, EVER. Spent two hours restarting Monaco over, and over, and over just so I could finish 4th. Despite the fact that it's IMPOSSIBLE to finish 1st in this gamemode unless you started first, somehow the AI that had won previous races also won again at Monaco and I ended up 2nd in the series. All that work, just to get my best possible finish of never-higher-than-fourth and the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t AI wins, AGAIN.   Once you strip this game down of all its mario kart clone mechanics, there is literally nothing left -- this game accomplishes absolutely nothing. I had already grown weary of these ridiculous physics at this point. You can't make any corner because you just drift back and forth across the track, sometimes completely unpredictably. If any of the moronic AI get within an inch of you, which they seem incapable of NOT doing, they will trigger an absolutely unforgivable knockback effect that COMPLETELY stops all of your momentum. Naturally, it affects the AI less than it does the player so navigating through the clusterf*ck of garbage AI seems perfectly legit.   This is quite possibly the worst AI I've ever raced against in any game, at least in recent memory. Maybe it's just emphasized by the ridiculous physics which are, I suppose, designed to discourage less than optimal racing. Trying to retain a faint connection to real F1 racing, they make it abundantly clear that COLLISIONS ARE BAD, MMKAY. Be a respectful driver.. and wreck them with power-ups like a good boy/girl.   However, optimal racing is an impossibility, especially when comparing a play to an AI. All of these problems are almost mute when a part of this merely acceptable Mario Kart clone. Then, strip the game down to 'Pure Racing' and you just get slapped in the face with its â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t.  Unbelievibly, despite the AI never taking an optimal race line or hitting any of the apexes of any corner, they are still consistantly as fast as if not faster than the player, unless you rely on the ridiculous draft system. If you brake into a corner properly, you WILL get rammed from behind and your race ruined. If you try to carfully overtake an AI through a corner on the outside and miraculously don't get hit from behind or have an AI slow to a crawl right in front of you, then the car on the inside WILL turn into your line and ruin your race.   So to recap, the AI never brake in corners and overtake you with easy, an often ram into you from behind. Yet, often times when entering a corner they will brake unpredictably and cause you to ram into them, even though they never brake. Despite the fact that the AI never take an optimal race line around the track, they make perfect time around corners, never missing boosts, while the player is in a constant struggle not to drift out of bounds while somehow managing to brake in a way to not get hit, enter corners in a way you can't be surprised by AI braking, or allowing any AI an opportunity to try and pass you on the side or enter your racing line.   Honestly, even though this game is a Mario Kart clone I expected it to have a stronger more realistic racing feel than it does. Furthermore, the amount of control I actually feel like I have over the car feels about comparable to ice tracks in Mario Kart, but not quite that extreme.  The power-ups lack any originality.  Oh, and the pit stops, oh my god the put stops. I could rage about them forever, about how AI will go into the pits on the last stretch and still win or even pass me, how if I go into the pits I will get passed by 3 other cars, all this mostly due to the fact that some pits are LONG AF and waste so much time while others might even be faster than the main race line.. seems legit. Ultimately, this inconsistancy leads to times where the standard of not pitting on the last stretch ends up with you losing the race. So, just keep in mind that whichever decision you make is probably the wrong one.   I would die for some online matchmaking to this game so that I don't have to deal with these AI, but I have yet to see a single person any of the times I've looked for a match.   Perfectly decent party game -- it's exactly what you'd expect. I'm not disappointed with my purchase, as these types of games are fun just to mess around on. I'd recommend this game to anyone who is into this type of game, despite the fact that they are probably better off just continuing to play their kart racer of choice. Jimmy Johnson's Anything With an Engine, right?  Edit: Just spent the last couple days playing Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed and it blows this game out of the water. It really made me realize how all the parts of F1 Race Stars work against each other, making it an incredibly unfluid and irritating experience. I'm not sure if on top of everything else that the tracks or poorly designed, or if it's just the terrible gameplay and uncontrollable cars that make it feel that way.   In the end, I could only recommend this game if you already know you want it. If not for the ridiculous collision effects, this game would still be passable. Truly one of the worst mechanics I've had to struggle against in any racing game.
2095	1	a	fun game, cartoony graphics, many cars and characters. many challenges like race or smash cars! just play for fun :P
2097	1	a	A fun game but not thatmany players so hard to find online games...
2099	1	a	A very fun game, only cheap and hours of play time. It is very much like MarioKart, VERY MUCH. For F1 fans really, but I'm not an F1 fan and I like it. Best played with friends.
2101	1	a	F1 Race Stars is a great option if you want that 4 player mario kart feel without having to buy a nintendo system or resort to an emulator. This game also allows for 4 player co-op through the career, which I think is a nice touch. The controls are tight while still arcadey, the tracks are fun with nice visuals, and the music is peppy and exciting. This game is certainly a fun little romp. -PR0XIDIAN
2103	1	a	Great game
2105	1	a	So uuhh it's a fun game and stuff, but do people still play this online? cos Im kind of lonely in the servers
1444	0	a	Would not buy. All of the devs must have been left handed as the default controls are WASD to drive, and they cannot be changed, this must be the first racing game ever made which is like that. It also CTDs when using 1920x1080 resolution
2107	1	a	Until I manage to get a controller for this game and see if it will work i cannot recommend the game i couldnt alter the keyboard controls so it was totally IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTROL, the graphics are excellent, I think the game play could be good if the keyboard control could be altered so at the moment I would not recommend it if you only use keyborad, so my rating for the game is - Graphics 8/10, Keyboard Control - 1/10  Updated Review - Date - Thursday 11th December 2014  I have now being able to play the game, with an X-Box 360 Controller, I thoroughly enjoyed the game, I found it very easy to control with the control pad.  I would recommend the game to use with the Controller ONLY, as i feel that it is Impossible to play with keyboard, here are my updated ratings for the game - Graphics 8/10, Controller 8/10
2109	1	a	This is another one of those great party games. Snacks and drinks on the table, getting worse at the game with every shot of vodka. It's great fun and really competitive!
2111	1	a	please invite me tq
2113	1	a	F1 Racing is nothing but awesome ! Like mario kart for the PC
1450	0	a	One of the biggest disappointments of the triple-A titles this year. Cheap AI, uninspired tracks, and boring multiplayer.
1451	0	a	Utter â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, glad it was free with another purchase.
1452	0	a	It's pretty but thats as far as I'd go. I recommend Sonic &amp; All Stars Racing Transformed over this by far.
2115	1	a	A fun take on the old Mario Karts. Much better with friends than against AI.
2117	1	a	F1 version of Mariokart. Good fun, will obviously never hold a candle to Mariokart, but a good game.
1455	0	a	It's has every aspect of Mario Kart without the awesomeness. I got it free with with the pre-purchase of F1 2013.
2119	1	a	A friend bought this for me as a gift.  I totally forgot just how good this game was. 
2121	1	a	If you like/love Mario Cart type of games this one should be in your list. great graphics, challenging gameplay.  The only problem with this that I can find is that Codemasters should really look into their multi-player code a little. Sometimes it is hard if not impossible to setup a game with a group of friends. 
2123	1	a	Great game, it is very enjoyable. the tracks are fun and well designed. its kind of like Mario Kart but with F1, Make sure to bring some friends with you because unfortunately there is nobody playing online
1457	0	a	It's Mario Kart but with an F1 twist!...is what I want to say, but Mario Kart is fun. The powerups are complete â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t, the damage feature is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t (get repaired, instantly take damage and have to do another lap at half speed), and there's such a limited number of tracks that it feels like they didn't even try with this game. If nothing else, it speaks volumes about this game that Codemasters have to continually give it away free as a prepurchase bonus for their newer games. They can't get anyone to buy it so maybe they can convince someone to buy the DLC by giving them the game.  Just avoid this game. It's terrible. It's NOT a game you really want to be playing. Especially since almost two years after initial release it's still Â£14.99. There's barely Â£5.99 of content in this game, let alone Â£14.99!
2125	1	a	+ Some of the most original creative maps you will can find on an arcade kart racer + Very hidden unlockable shortcuts  + Great graphics + Intense races + plenty of races / game modes to unlock and play in career + Insane jumps, inclines, loopty loops, and gravity defying tracks  - No drifing / sliding - Power ups are pretty generic  - All characters / cars are the same / no upgrades  (Price paid: $5 with DLC)
1458	0	a	Beatiful graphics to blend people.  This game is absolutely no fun to play. No Challenge in driving, enemies can suddenly appear behind you, even if you are driving much better than them. This is annoying especially when you are right before acrossing the finish line.
1459	0	a	Multiplayer doesnt work at all. F F1 race stars
1460	0	a	Meh. Even 3k cc is super slow paced. Also, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ the caution car.
1461	0	a	Multiplayer doesnt even work! Server claims its been in maintainance but its already been 2 months. Unbelievable. Luckily i bought this while it was on sale at 3 bucks.
2127	1	a	Great game, played for a while on console and found it for Â£1 on amazon so great to play with friends
2129	1	a	Basically an F1 spin on Mario Kart, but a bit more bare-bones. At least it's for PC.
2131	1	a	Basically an F1 spin on Mario Kart, but a bit more bare-bones. At least it's for PC.
2133	1	a	This is a great and fun game, haven't tried playing multiplayer yet but I'm sure it's great fun. Big change from normal Formula 1 games, more suited for younger people, also the requirements aren't as high as they say they are as my old PC couls run it fine in 1080p and I only had a intel pentium D dual core and a radeon HD 5450 with 2GB of ram. SO you shouls be able to play this on nearly any computer as long as your hardware is compatible. BE sure to check it out, remember there is also a demo so you can try before you buy. Just what I did.
2135	1	a	fun but not as good as the sonic cart games
2137	1	a	A lot of fun in couch multiplayer. Played on DS4 controller via InputMapper and gameplay was awesome. Its basically same as on PS3. Yea
2139	1	a	Sorry, wy I can't start the game F1 race?
1463	0	a	I bought it to my stepson hoping he will play a kid's game in the logitech wheel. But this is a bad port, no wheel, no mouse, I am returning it.
1464	0	a	WE PICKING UP THE PACE BOIS  NVM FLAT TIRE
1465	0	a	This is a kart racer with no soul and zero charm. The AI is some of the worst I have ever seen in terms of rubber-banding. It is also exceedingly frustrating that the AI will ram into each other, the player, and course items and take absolutely no damage whereas they can pretty much total the player's kart from the very start of the race and seemingly at will any time during its duration.   Bottom line: Stay away from this kart racer unless you are a masochist, or want to give a gift to a person you hate.
2141	1	a	It's old school  Mario Kart  for the modern gaming world  Just not many other players on-line, so if you have it, let's  RACE   Only really bad part is, it's uses  CodeMasters  own network for all sync/on-line stuff and not  Steam , which is rather slow, but worst of all it only uses  Facebook  rubbish and no  Google+  connectivity, which is awful, but avoidable at least.  The above issues are also found in  GRiD 2 , which is equally brilliant, but also plagued by the same issues!   *2/3*  - One mark lost for rubbish network usage and very limiting connectivity options
2143	1	a	Very fun Mario Kart styled racing game.
2145	1	a	It's a fun take on F1, it's not all great though. It's recommended for fans who wants to try something different.
1467	0	a	Buggy, boring and not worth the cash. I got this as a pre-order bonus for F1 2014 and took 1/2 hour to be bored of it. The controls aren't intuitive, and the KERS thing just seems poorly implemented. Power ups are stupid (and it's not always clear what they do).
2147	1	a	M8, dis game was so dank, it gave me the skillz to become an F1 dr1v3r. LOLOLOLOL 420 blaze it get rekt
2149	1	a	great game when you doing nothing...!!!!
2151	1	a	At first i thought this game was terrible, But it seems to have grown on me, and Now i would definetly recommend it.
2153	1	a	big thumbs up if u like these type of fun racing games. not gonna say much but for the cheap price it is, try it n see
1469	0	a	Sonic All star racing is better
2155	1	a	It's Mario Kart on F1! I really like it, especially playing it on the couch with your friends!!
1470	0	a	I bought this game hoping for Mario Kart for the PC,but all I got was frustration and boredom. This game is really not that fun...It may look like alot of fun,but unfortunately it isn't :/
2157	1	a	...
1472	0	a	Whether you play at 1000c or 3000c, the difficulty doesn't change much. As a result, it is an incredibly frustrating game which doesn't reward you in any way regardless of how well you play. The entire game depends on luck and only luck for you to win a race and the eventual championship. It's well made, but that's about it.
1473	0	a	Its a Casual RAC game for F1 fans,but not a good choice for player who want to play a RAC game that like Mario Kart or Sonic All Stars Racing(its has been relased in steam). The worst thing is u can't drift cornering in game, same as a real F1. but it make game boring QAQ. About the Multi-player mode?come on, forget it.  If u want to play a Casual RAC game,Sonic All Stars Racing would be better. Remeber,buy F1 RACE STARS only when it come out at Bundle Stars as a bundle(including all DLC) 
1474	0	a	The game's kinda fun but... No customizable controls and NO SUPPORT FOR 1080p resolution IN 2015?!?!? Unacceptable!
2159	1	a	Wow, that was a lot of fun. I recommend this game. Good controller ability or play with keyboard, your choice. Playful and light game environment. The light is green, go! 
1477	0	a	What a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game,i'm glad i only payd 2 euro on it,on random hot key on â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥,if there's somebody out there who has a +1 rocke league key,i will gladly trade.
1478	0	a	Reload this utrer nonsense.
1479	0	a	This game just isn't fun and that's really such a shame, because it's like it's almost there, and then it just fell short for no reason.  There's just no give in the cars, no drifting, and when you realise it's not possible it's just not fun. Corners are bland and witohut the Mario Kart style handling but with the MK styled tracks it just feels like a weird mashup that makes no sense. It's like they wanted to make a fun party racer, but decided the F1 cars should handle like F1 cars.  The majority of the power ups are so uninspired, most of them being carbon copies of MK powerups which is mostly the norm since, it's not too otherworldly, but everything is just, bubble. Red bubble, blue bubble, purple bubble. The only other power-up is a safety car which slows down the lead racer, but just slows them down.  I would appriciate this game more if the safety car was introduced as rubber banding, making sure that the lead racer can still stay first, but can't get to a point where they're unreachable especially playing a solid defense. Also if you could just drift, I swear if you could just drift this game would be fun.  Just don't buy this, Sonic and Sega Allstars is a much better game.
2161	1	a	F1 Race Stars is, essentially, an F1 version of Mario Kart. The worlds are just as cutesy, the hazards just as interesting. I think about the only difference is that your cars can take actual damage and require 'pit stops'. You can play it online with friends or in a career mode. I purchased it on sale for $3, and have yet to regret my decision.  8/10. Purchase if on sale, I'm not sure I would recommend it so strongly at the full price.
2163	1	a	Just very nice!
1480	0	a	Like most people I got this free, so Codemasters can give it away. If Iâ€™d paid for this then Iâ€™d be googling Steam refunds right now. This is a F1 themed karting game similar to Mario kart but without the fun, graphics, cool weapons or basically anything that would make you wanna play it. This really is terrible. The commentary sounds like they got random people from the Codemasters office to step in to save a few pounds. After half a lap even the most enthusiastic player will be thinking, â€œCodemasters what is the f**king pointâ€. Iâ€™d rather spend all day biting the toe nails of a tramp than load this game again.
2165	1	a	cool game!
2167	1	a	Fernando Alonso + Finger Guns = A Good Time
1481	0	a	F1 race starts is a arcade racing game that is similar to mario kart. The racers are real f1 race stars, and the items have been changed to fit the game. Unlike mario kart this is not a very good racing game.  Personally I've played almost all of the mario kart games, so this game was not very hard in the slightest for me. The reason it's so easy is that fact that you have no â€œrivalâ€ racers. In Mario Kart, you usually have a few characters that get 2nd or 3rd place as you get first and keep really close to you in points for the standings. In this game I would be able to finish 5th and 6th at times and still win because some other person with no points would win the race and I'd still be in first.  There are not that many different tracks and you will go over the same tracks over and over again in different cups. There are 30 cups, which vary in the amount of tracks they have. At first they are just slandered races but eventually the other cups apply a variety of challenges instead. Sometimes you have to stay in first to get points, other times you have to collect cups on the road to add to points. Each track also has a shortcut system that I personally never used, but if you are having troubles I'd recommend looking their locations up you can win races just by using them.  The racers are not really exciting, and the attributes each pair of racers have didn't alter my experience. The power ups are balloons, and other real world things that aren't creative, like a torpedo, a ghost boost that makes you invulnerable and move quickly. One of the most awful idea's the game put in is this stupid pit system. If you get hit by a balloon or something, your car is damaged and moves slowly, and you have to go out of your way and lose placing to drive through the pit stop. Really stupid idea in an arcade racer.  One more thing to say about the difficulty there are 2 cups that are an insane spike in difficulty. In these they have the damage set to extremely high so if another racer even touches you you have to go pit and they all pass you. It took me 3 hours to do the first and 3 to do the second. They are quite random and will aggravate you so much you might just quit the game.   I bought this game for about 5$, it has a few dlc's that are for multi-player which doesn't exist. This is not a very good game unless you are a diehard mario kart fan. Even then go play that instead.
1482	0	a	Mind Blowingly Pansish
2169	1	a	Cute graphics and characters, humor and secret shortcuts and toon-like landscapes made here a racing game tailored for multiplayer fun.
2171	1	a	Great, fun game! Brings all the fun of the classic game Mario Kart straight to your PC in a funny, Formula 1 fashion!
2173	1	a	You play Mario Kart as Michael Schumacher 11/10
2175	1	a	  Woah! This is a good one. Only if you choose career mode. Seriously, in career mode you can unlock more game modes, not just plain driving, but slalom, exhibition, fuel and trophy mode. It gives game a second breath, makes it alive. With splitscreen - what more would you want?  The only negative is that settings are hardcoded, cannot be tweaked.
2177	1	a	I think the whole grab a key to open a shourt cut thing is very gamebreaking making it almost impossible to catch back up with who grabbed the key and took the short cut. Otherwise, pretty good arcade style racing game.
2179	1	a	I say this game is pretty decent, but one question: Is it me or the mobile version gets more than this version?  I feel like this game needs more maps. Compared to the mobile version, it seems they get like, as said in the app's description, 40 tracks? What's this game, like 12? Sharp turns in this game is difficult, usually making the bots overtake me. But for the mobile version, it seems you can 'drift'? And the updates for this game! When was this game last updated because in the mobile version it got updated in 2015! Basically, what I'm saying is that the PC version has way less than the mobile vesion and here's a list of things from the mobile version that should be in the PC version:  -More tracks (I don't want to just play the same tracks over and over again.) -More 'characters' (I don't really care about this much, but who knows? Maybe I like characters that just wear only mask?) -Gamemode (Maybe? It was just something from the mobile version.) -Better multiplayer (???) -More powerups (I just wanted more lower chance to get good powerups because the amount of red balls thrown at me.)  And just because this cost money, don't give: -Energy (Just absolutely no.) -Microtransactions (Sure I want more tracks but please make some of the tracks free.) -Levels (I think the 1000CC and such are fine. What would levels bring? Unfair advantages?) -Power gates (It cost in-game money and it seems like a pay in-game money to win.) -In-game currency (As stated above, pay to win. Maybe. It depends how the IGC will work. If you can earn it easily. It doesn't cost money. If you can use it just for cosmetics. Who knows?  And that's it. I know this really isn't a review but hey. I think this game is pretty decent.  Please note that this is just my opinion.
2181	1	a	No online players anymore.. :( But it's pretty enjoyable for people who likes playing career mode alone or with a friend, absolutely fun. Thumbs up! 
2183	1	a	Mario Kart + F1 = F1 Race Stars with overwhelming graphics.. Feel the speed, the fun and my powerups seeking yeh...
2185	1	a	Fun arcade driving game. Many similarities to Mario Kart. I like the way they worked in pit stops with car damage. Absolutely worth the sale price of $3.74.
2187	1	a	In the first 15 minutes I was chased by the Ninja Turtles, hijacked Bill &amp; Ted's phone booth, met RoboCop and drove the DeLorean.
2189	1	a	Retro City Rampage: a cleaner version of GTA with a retro asthetic. It's got a funny storyline, great music, tons of weapons, thousands of hidden goodies around the map, and most importantly, fun gameplay.  Pick it up while it's on sale and you'll find it a solid use of 20 hours of your time.
2191	1	a	IfI had to recommend a great retro style game. This would be the one. It's like GTA 1 game married the references/pop culture of the 80's and 90's (and yes some other newer games too)! If you love the 80's and 90's you will find this game worth while giving a playthrough. With all it's 8-bit glory. Heck they have free-play mode where you have nothing to do but do what you want in this open world. Customizing the game look also is pretty radical! Be the way cool cat and get this game if you don't already have it.
2193	1	a	Retro City Rampage is a wonderful homage to all things 80's. Expect references to 80's movies, games, pop culture, and much more. The gameplay itself is like a 2D, 8-bit version of the 3D Grand Theft Auto games, split between on foot combat, and vehicle segements. There are 62 story missions, 23 weapons, and tons of vehicles. The game has a pretty good difficulty curve starting very easy and building up to extremely difficult for the final sequence of story missions. The game is very generous with checkpoints so dying is almost never that big of a deal. Aside from the main story there are 14 'sprees' and 23 'second rate sprees'. The sprees involve trying to get a high score while under various effects such as drunkeness, invulnerablity, explosive sweat, normal stuff. There is one second rate spree for each weapon and they just involve killing as many people with that weapon as possible. There are also 70 collectibles hidden around the game world (similar to the packages, magnets, oysters, etc. from the GTA games) along with plenty of other hidden easter-eggs giving plenty of reason to explore the game's overworld. Overall the game was very fun, very funny, and highly recommended by me.
2195	1	a	Was killing innocent civilians when the Ninja Turtles came to stop me.  20/10
2197	1	a	I haven't really played the game much yet, though so far it seems really fun and has a great sense of humor, but the Developer responded to my bug report within a couple of hours and had a patch that fixed my Linux gamepad problem out within only hours of when I posted the initial issue.  BEST DEVELOPER EVER! (And one that cares about Linux!)
2199	1	a	grand theft auto on nes in the 80s in back to the future with a few references that are known today combined into one   WOAH
2201	1	a	  Ok, for some reason, my long review auto deleted itself, so ill redo what i can do it again.  This game was gifted to me from a friend. It is quite fun, but newer gamers and millenials might not understand things in this game as they are parodies from the 1980's and upwards. Also, people who only care about graphics will not like this game either, due to the older look of the graphics in this. I really enjoyed this title.  Anyways, this game was quite fun to play and i recommend it to all my friends for retro gaming and funny game playing.
2203	1	a	  'EVENNG LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! WE PRESNT TO YOU TONIGHT, A CLICHE BANK ROBBERY!    References has always been the part of every sector of the entertaintment industry. Musicians puts hate or love to their lyrics, as the reference to someone or something, most of times, it has affected them. Directors and screenwrites puts to their movies references of another famous movies or people affected movie industry. And so, game developers trying to put references of games, poeple who are/was or affected gaming industry. And sometimes, we can find developers from diamonds, who puts references of all kinds, into their game - Vblank Entertaintment.  These guys made out of nothing something and that's Retro City Rampage (RCR) -  little indie game, which contains more references, that megabytes that game has.   Most epic adventure for those, who was born before 1990, and biggest nightmare, and 'Lost World' for those who wasn't. RCR be like - A-Team GMC van gonna run over you. Green pipes from Mario are everywhere. Brown Dog from my childhood is everywhere. First mission and first reference totally blew me away. School bus runs through the wall of the bank, to stole looted money alias the Batman. And so, almost every minute, you'll find something, from your childhood, or not only.  Difficulty and game-design of this game is just tribute to good old video-game machines - tough difficulty, dozens of secrets, score multipliers, memorable characters, unblockable characters, crazy weapons, aliens and sh*t.   If you looking for nostalgia, and wants to go back to your childhood, go for indies, Playstation 1/2 or Retro City Rampage. Salute to you Vblank.  PS: Main parallel of the game is Back to Future movie from 1985.  PS2: Between the writing of this review and this update, the game has been updated to DX version which is another thumbs up.   Bonus Point: There is nothing wrong with this game for real   Rating: 9/10
2205	1	a	Retro City Rampage is a GTA like pixel world filled with memes and steriotypes. It really feels like the old GTA2 with features from the later games. It has a decent story line and a heaploads of fun.  I recomend having it and running if if you are bored.
2207	1	a	Awesome game! Killer chiptunes, great spritework, sillyness galore! Just, don't explore everything before doing the story...you'll wind up going to places in the Story that you already found while exploring and it kinda ruins it. I wish I hadn't done that. :(  DX stuff: + The new cop system is GREAT! One of the most annoying things was constantly getting the cops on me accidently and having to sit around in a store till it passes. now you just kill them off the screen. + The new overlay is nice. + Scoreboards! + You can mark waypoints on your map now. Pretty awesome.   Unfortunately, if you've already played through the game there's no real reason to play again because of DX, unless you just want to score on the leaderboards.
2209	1	a	This game might honestly be one of my favorite games ever. There's a lot of fun to be had here, and the number of good things immensely outweighs the bad.  Pros: -Awesome visuals. -Fantastic soundtrack. -Absurd yet hilarious dialogue. -A large open world to explore with lots of neat places to visit. -A fun story mode with fun yet challenging side missions. -Tons of customizable visual filters to spruce up the viewing experience. -Loads of references to video game and moie characters of times past. -Minigames inside of a game. Always welcomed.  Cons:  -The core gameplay finds itself to be a little bit repetitive, but it's still fun nonetheless.   This game just a blast and, like I said earlier, one of my favorite games of all time. It's loaded with charm and obvious care from the developer. It's SO worth paying the full price for, you won't regret it. 10/10.
2211	1	a	Think 8-bit GTA1/2 meets the ridiculousness of Saint's Row 3 paired with a HUGE amount of videogame and movie references. If you can't relate to that, think GTA1/2: Blood Dragon. True to it's old school nature, It's everything you can expect and more from a top down homage to nes gaming.  It has a neat little story mode with millions of references, arcade challenge mode where you can do fun weapon or kill challenges of the sort, and a free roam mode where you can create mayhem as you please. There are even arcade machines you can play within the game as fun little minigames. Also included, are tons of skins for the game. The controls for aiming can get a bit of getting used to but it is far from a deal breaker.  This game is a must have for any old school gamers.
2213	1	a	Amazing game, very fun! Brings back alot of memories of early gaming ;0 has a bit of everything from the 8 bit to 16 bit era
2215	1	a	There's so many reviews that chances are no one will ever see this, so I'll make it short:  This game is amazing! I love all the 80s game references. Controls are good. Funny. Great music!  Now let me go find my flax combobulator...
2217	1	a	It is basically like playing the original GTA, except packed with tons of references to old stuff.  Most of it will probably go over your head if you're under 25, you'll probably get most everything if you're over 25.    https://youtu.be/wxfiTrqWlFA 
2219	1	a	This game is the NES-style crossover of GTA 2 and some of best NES titles like: - Super Mario Bros - Contra - Smash TV - Mega Man - and a lot of other references and easter eggs!  Simple and addictive gameplay, fun missions and crazy plot. Must-play for every 90' games lover!
2221	1	a	If you grew up with the original Nintendo Entertainment System you can stop reading and buy this now. Trust me you won't be disappointed.  Did you enjoy GTA 1 &amp; 2 or Chinatown wars? Stop reading and buy this game now.  If you're still reading this try out the demo. You'll know if you will buy it by the end of the demo.
2223	1	a	Better than GTA V
2225	1	a	If this game was released for the NES back in the day, it would have been a solid hit ! Very entertaining game with good gameplay.
2227	1	a	I like the story and artstyle of this game (which reminds me of many NES/SNES games). I really like how it parodies many games and films like Back to the future, Super Mario Bros 2 and Bionic commando and how it uses these ganres to produce humour. The key bindings fit the game perfectly and allows the player to easily control the character.Overall, the game is probably better than the first installments of GTA. 9/10
2229	1	a	If you want to be hit by a ton of pop culture references while playing a retro style shooter mixed with Grand Theft Auto style game play? Retro City Rampage is what you're looking for. Albeit it does have it's let downs but overall the game is a fun experience.  For my full review of the game, go to:   http://godbomb.blogspot.co.uk/2014/05/retro-city-rampage-review-for-pc.html 
2231	1	a	This game is awesome! You can do alot in this game. It's really fun, i like missions, the characters, the customizations. For this price, it's definitely a buy.
2233	1	a	Honestly, love this game right now. Only 8 hours of game time so far, but many more to come. Graphics like a classic NES, game like GTA. Amazing references, 20+ years, TMNT, Back to the Future, Mario, and more. Cards, Achievements, Perfect Controller Support. The Sprees in game will keep you busy trying to Gold Medal all of them. The Story Stages are increasing in difficulty, with a decent plot. I bought this from HRK Games for $1.95, and SO worth it. One of my favorite games right now added to my Library for all the content this game has to offer. Recommend it to all gamers.
2235	1	a	Love the Main Missions and I love the Side-quests. Tons of replay activites.   +Exellent Weapons
2237	1	a	If you love Retro Games, go play this game! 
2239	1	a	It's like indie, gta, and retro had a child, and I love every second of it.
2241	1	a	A lot of fun,
2243	1	a	Awesome game! Well i'm a little sad cuz i'm not a 80's kid but it gave me nostalgia!
2245	1	a	Wow, what an awesome tribute to the 80's (and early 90's) this game is. It's basically GTA, NES style. The controls are well done, and causing havoc around the city is fun, but the crazy references to everything awesome about the late 80's, the 90's, and beyond are amazing. The plot makes no sense, but that's OK since you get to ride Donkey Kong, hijack the TMNT van, join the Ghost Busters, guest star in Saved by the Bell, and drive the Delorean from Back to the Future, among other stuff. If that sounds awesome, you should try it. It is awesome.
2247	1	a	Basically Watch Dogs, GTA V and Saints Row 4 but good because you can 'drive' a giant ape to destroy the city, 11/10.
2249	1	a	8 bit GTA. The game is a good play, and takes points from the top-down GTA that started it all. Pretty entertaining, and a hilarous satire storyline that reminds us of the stories that games make.  
2251	1	a	First of all , the only con is that the game is too short... And that it only lack one element... local multiplayer.  But apart from this the ambiant, the look, the music and every character you will find in this game is an open love letter for retro gaming.  From Megaman to TMNT passing by Metal Gear in an open GTA world you incarne Player and do errend for everyone. Every text makes reference to a video game or a movie from 80's up to 90's.  Seal of approval!
2253	1	a	Take me down to murder and mayhem city.. where the 80's are alive and the girls are all.. 8 bitty...  Saints Row 2-4 and GTA: Vice City have nothing on this game when it comes to paying homage to the 80's and murder and mayhem, but they do have better graphics, better soundtracks, and far more t&amp;a but who needs t&amp;a when you can kill the Turtles, the A-Team, and the Hoff? At least I think I ran over the Hoff. This game is just everything I wanted in a NES game in the 80's but never got, and I love the 80's.  In short, if you're a child of the 80's and you aren't a graphics junkie and can appreciate 8 bit.. graphics', this game is calling your name.... really.. really loudly.   And its dirt cheap so it isn't like you'll have buyers remorse even if you don't care for it.  Did I mention it runs under Dos, Windows, and that your cat can play it?
2255	1	a	One of the best game I ever played! If you like humor, references and retro style games, it's for you!
2257	1	a	In this Mad Magazine-esque GTA spoof, you send a pompadoured maniac crashing through countless references to 1980's pop culture. The flimsy icons of your childhood will be mocked, your reflexes will be tested, and your funny bone will be tickled even if you are too green to get the allusions.   With its awesomely stupid sense of humor and its ever-changing gameplay, this grab bag of ridiculous delights is sure to please!  (Make sure to check out the arcade! There's this awesome eating competition minigame that you just  have  to see!)
2259	1	a	Retro City Rampage is a better technical achievement and a transplant of retro gaming than it is as an actual game. I'm impressed that something like this is able to have a lot of variety and not end up really collapsing in on itself. The mechanics themselves are not perfect but okay, doing that thing where misguided nostalgia brings back terrible gameplay elements and mechanics instead of doing the right thing and leaving them in the attic.  The references ground my gears more than the gameplay. The combined weight of all the references and cameos is like Neil Cicierega having a stroke and turning the Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny from a five minute song into a ten hour long old-style Greek epic. And when that isn't irritating enough, it brings out the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ self-parodies of other games!  The real recommendation here is the developer. Brian Proviciano is a Carmack level magician who fiddles around with ancient hardware and creates 100%-hardware accurate ports of this game in Assembly. The game itself accomodates to every level and flavor of nostalgia. You can even play the game in EGA or on a simulated Game Boy screen, for crying out loud! You can even play the aformentioned NES port of this game inside the actual game! That's bonkers as hell. Brian needs his John Romero to make the most of his talents and create something truly amazing.
2261	1	a	This game is beautiful and nostalgic
2263	1	a	This game is fantastic. It's funny, fun, and well worth $10. It has parodies of movies and other games *cough cough Back to the Future*. In a sense, it's retro GTA. Still waiting on multiplayer (a player can dream).
2265	1	a	1) Immediately steal a car. 2) Try to lose the cops who are chasing you because you stole a car. 3) Realise you can get a ton of weapons. 4) â™¥â™¥â™¥ SHIT UP  69/5 would drive straight into a police barricade again.
2267	1	a	A fun and enjoyable little gem here, i mean who hasn't said sorry constantly becasue of your terrible driving skills.
2269	1	a	Very fun 'GTA' clone. Very humorous and addictive, this game won't let u end until u'll finish the mission. Score: 8/10
2271	1	a	I killed a man, stole the wagon from Oregon Trail and crashed into the DeLorian listening to 8-bit Death Metal. 10/10 would do aforementioned scenario again.
2273	1	a	THE GAME IS FUN. LOADS OF FUN EVEN. I ENJOYED IT A GREAT DEAL.  BUT THE JOKES.  MY GOD MAN THE JOKES ARE BAD. THEY ARE BAD BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT GOOD. THEY ARE KIND OF GODAWFUL.  PLAY THIS GAME FOR ITS FANTASTIC GAMEPLAY, MUSIC, AND GRAPHICS. DO NOT PLAY IT FOR ITS WRITING.
2275	1	a	Open World on 8-bit? Why Not?
2277	1	a	While this isn't a game that's based on an 80's franchise, I still highly recommend it to 80's retro junkies. There are so many 80's elements in this game and while the game pays homage to those 80's franchises, its done in a parody like way. The TMNT parody stuff is highly amusing, and then the A-Tem show up, and you'll come across the Burton verison of Batman which at the same time pays homage to the old campy tv series, and there are even some 90's elements like the moments where the game mocks Saved by the Bell. As for the main bad guy, the developer seemed to base him off the corrupt boss in Warrant's old music videos from their Dirty Rotten era. But like I said, there are a lot of 80's elements and Back to the Future is one o fthe big ones.  In short, this game has retro NES graphics, and plays like one of the original GTA games but is chock full of 80's and some 90's satire and tht makes it totally worth getting if one is an 80's/90's junkie. Th elead character, despite being an 8 bit character, is also pretty amusing.  In short, I highly recommend this game to my fellow gen x'ers who grew up watching all of those 80's films and are into violent games that are violent in an amusing way.  
2279	1	a	Great mini games!
2281	1	a	10/10  Just can't go wrong.
2283	1	a	8-bit GTA + Nostalgia, it's obviously pretty great.
2285	1	a	Get this if you want to play something fresh.While it looks like just one more 'pixel indie game' at first sight of the screenshots, I assure you it is not.It serves as an example how 'GTA' would look like if we had it in NES/SNES era and has a lot of easter eggs along with a great humor in them.I nominate this game for a â€œI Thought This Game Was Cool Before It Won An Awardâ€ Award because I think it perfectly suits the category.It may not appeal to a regular 'Grand Theft Auto' fan, but purpose and importance of it's existence is undeniable because it provides a unique perspective to a sandbox genre that we know today.So, take a seat and prepare for your trip back to the future!
2287	1	a	It's a parody game that doesn't take itself seriously. It was a fun for a bit but then it get's repetitive. Minus points for the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ collection achievement.  7/10  I wonder how many people got the 'iced tea' gag.
2289	1	a	its a 8-bit GTA +great music +Great dialouge +Great story +Tons of quests + Achievements + mini games + Trading cards + Controller support + Many refences to the 80s and 90s  + Many vehicles and weapons  A great, solid game for hours of enjoyment.
2291	1	a	Great Game, had a lot of fun with the 80s vibe
2293	1	a	Great Game, had a lot of fun with the 80s vibe
2295	1	a	Can't afford GTA? No problem, get this instead. So much parody in one game, I love it.
2297	1	a	A solid, but kinda short mixture of Grand Theft Auto 2 and an 80s themed family guy episode.
2299	1	a	When I picked this game up I honestly didn't expect it to be all that mind-boggling, but my mind was boggled almost immediately. A lot of other games in the same style tend to simply have pixellated graphics and vintage sounding chiptune music, leaving them feeling far less authentic than I'd like.  This game does it's very damn hardest to make it feel as real as possible and it does a hell of a job at it. It even allows you to play the unfinished prototype of the game that was actually developed to play on the NES. The music in the game is out of this world in how great and accurate to the era it is.  The story is fun to say the least and I found the humor to be very amusing. The gameplay is incredibly smooth and the controls are very easy to handle, especially when using a suitable controller. Pick up this game already and start running stuff over while stealing other stuff.
2301	1	a	I've been looking forward to Retro City Rampage for quite some time now. And now that it's been released I'm actually disappointed. Not because I enjoyed it so much, but because of the difficulty spikes that took away a lot of my enjoyment.   The graphics look sweet , there's a lot of passion in it. It's visible from the start. I also enjoyed the references to 80's games, shows and movies. All great stuff. Same goes for the music and sounds, nothing to complain here.  The missions, however, are a different story. Like any other game it starts off easy. Then suddenly missions become more difficult and even frustrating. And after that they somehow become eas(y)(ier) again. Wait, what ? There's no consistency here.  I finished the game in 8 hours (which should've been 6-7), but if you want to buy and play everything I think you can add a few hours to that number.  A decent game, nothing more, nothing less. Is it worth it ? You decide !  [Rating: 71/100]
2303	1	a	IF YOU CALL YOURSELF A GAMER, YOU NEED THIS GAME!!,   'Takes you back to Saturday Morning Cartoons and Cap' n Crunch!!
2305	1	a	If you like having fun, and like a game that doesn't take itself too serious, play this game!  Retro City Rampage (RCR) originally started as 'Grandtheftendo', an unofficial NES port of the first GTA. Later, the author decided to keep the same spirit (retro, 8-bit looks and sounds) while expanding the game way beyond the NES capabilities. Then RCR was born.  It obviously looks and plays like GTA (the first one, with top-down view), but it is a satire of the old (and new?) games, and includes uncountable references to other games and movies and pop-culture and stuff.  It is not a difficult game, although some mini-games are quite hard. It gives you a smile very often, when you see something unexpected or absurd happening, or when the game throws yet another reference at you. And it is fun to play!
2307	1	a	The amount of polish and love this game has recieved is astonishing. Go buy it.  EDIT: unfortunately, pretty much the whole end section of the game is balls to the wall hard. I don't enjoy that. I lost interest when I got to the final boss battle and just watched the ending on youtube. It left a sour taste in my mouth.
2309	1	a	It took me a while to get used to the controls for driving but then this game got really fun. It's a cocktail containing Grand Theft Auto / Mario / Teenage Munant Ninja Turtles / Cobra and other retro games. And they mix perfectly together.  The game offers a huge arsenal of vehicles, weapons, environments, challanges and missions to keep you occupied. I liked the game so much that I needed to 100% complete the game and it only took me 16 hours ;D  You can even change the screen settings to match all sorts of old game emulators and also features great soundtracks.  If you like old school games, pixels, gta and open world freedom get this game. It's more then worth the money.
2311	1	a	A solid game. It will take you back to the days of the original Grand Theft Auto mixed in with all the classic tropes and in-jokes to your '80s and '90s gaming. I stopped playing at one point, not because it was a bad game, but because I got overwhelmed with the Open-World stuff like the various challenges and time attacks and everything else. I'll probably be revisiting this game shortly, but take it from me, there's PLENTY in this game to do and to keep yourself busy with. Not to mention all the retro mini-games they have like a Virtual Boy styled Super Meat Boy game and other Arcade games included in this.
2313	1	a	I got sword training from Guybrush Threepwood.
2315	1	a	This game is pretty â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing addicting. Also there is alot of references from the 90s.
2317	1	a	I got drunk on milk then high on scooby snacks 10/10
2319	1	a	An old school gamer's paradise! Take GTA make it 8-bit then fill it with as many hilarious, old-school refrences as possible and you've got this game.
2321	1	a	This is an amazing game that brings back all sorts of nostalgia. Fun to play and purely addicting. Worth the price.
2323	1	a	ItÂ´s very good retro game like a GTA 1 with lotÂ´s of fun.
2325	1	a	THIS GAME WAS GREAT!! SPENT TWO HOURS ON THE FIRST DAY!!!!, THE CONTROLS WERE PERFECT!!!!, THE MUSIC WAS GREAT!!!, the only thing I have a problem with is that there needs to be an update with multiplayer, but other than that, ITS GREAT!!!, TOTALLY RECOMMENED THIS GAME!!!!
2327	1	a	Super Nostalgia!! WORTH IT!! some references!
2329	1	a	Its a silly top down retro-flavoured homage to old 80s NES games that started out as an NES demake of Grand Theft Auto 3 and its sitll fun to play. Even if it does use '8-bit' as its chief aesthetic, since that's apparently 'the big thing' amongst indie devs.  The difficulty works too. Its difficult but not flatout 'f*** you' hard like most. There's a nice amount of customization options too including screen borders homaging old Arcade bezels and the Game Boy's old â™¥â™¥â™¥ sepia screen.  Plus its a near-recoloured Claude from GTA3 and a hilarious ripoff of Doc Brown trying to stop a Potara fusion Doctor Robotnik/Wily from takin gover the world. How can you go wrong?
2331	1	a	A Grand Theft Auto type game with retro style graphics and gameplay with Back To The Future References, whatâ€™s not to like about this game?
2333	1	a	Like GTA, but it's actually playable. It really has a retro feel. It's like if GTA would have been made by something like Rare for the NES and it makes fun of everything like Mega Man and Duck Hunt. It's made with DirectX though, which sucks. Also, I got a Trading card when it crashed. Pick it up while it costs less than 1 euro!
2335	1	a	I honestly have more fun â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing around in this game then any GTA game or GTA clone I've played
2337	1	a	Ever played the original Grand Theft Auto games on PlayStation?  Did you like them? Then you'll love this! This game uses the play style of the classic GTA games but with an 8-Bit twist! You'll experience lots of references to many games/movies during your time exploring the small, yet satisfying city of Theftropolis. Not only are the games missions/stages fun but there is lots of things to find, unlock and do outside of missions too! Just watch the trailer, it shows all you need to see to make a desicion on whether to buy this game or not. But if you do buy it... I hope you enjoy it as much as I am :P
2339	1	a	This is the most 80's game about the 80's that ever 80'd. I can't think of any 80's phenomenon this game didn't reference. Maybe Alf? The game is a pretty fun 2D gta with minigames and homages to 8 bit classics. Gets pretty tough near the end of the main story, with lots of frantic old school action. There are callbacks to Mario, Mega Man, Contra, Battletoads, even Castlevania. Looking forward to the sequel!
2341	1	a	This game is awesome on my levels. The humor in this game is epic if you are an old nerd like me. It is like an upgrade GTA I and I think it is what GTA 3 should have been like.
2343	1	a	The game starts out well touches a lot of good old gaming memories....but then by the end it just starts to copy the worst things you dont want to have in your game and becomes just die-&gt;reload-&gt;die missions no fun , no meaning. Left a bad taste by the end , would not want to play this game again :X Proceed at your own risk.... Music is good, a controller is highly recommended   why cant we have the the good parts from the retro old games instead of the annoying ones.... Scorewise i would say 7/10  My screenshots showing how the game goes from nice nostalgia to Pure rage[spoilers]  http://steamcommunity.com/id/liquidsnakehpks/screenshots/?appid=204630&amp;sort=newestfirst&amp;browsefilter=myfiles&amp;view=grid#scrollTop=0   Hoping for a pure story in the next game they make using a similar retro style
2345	1	a	full-auto rocket launcher ?!!.... yea , GTA fanboys can die in peace now
2347	1	a	 Basic Information
2349	1	a	Take every game you played in the early 90s and then turn it into the original GTA  it's not the best game, but it's a pretty great nostalgia bomb
2351	1	a	I barely saw 80s but nevertheless I like this game.  This is like 'Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid' of games: The really fatefully made ode to classic games of 80s and early 90s in both good and bad.
2353	1	a	THis game is like a retro style of GTA, but more cartoony and 8-bit, plus plenty of throwbacks to old games.  If you're a fan of retro games as well as a GTA style, then this game is a good buy.
2355	1	a	this is a brilliant game, it is fun and has little nods to movies and other videogames like back to the future for example. i love it! if you like free roamiong games and retro 80's games than this is your perfect match!
2357	1	a	This game is like a cheap and arcade version of Grand Theft Auto I recommend this game for arcade &amp; free roam gamers.
2359	1	a	It's like GTA before GTA took itself too seriously, with sprinkles of Contra and beat-em-up platforming hybrids. Also, filled with 80's pop culture references. (though almost too many, heh)
2361	1	a	This game is amazing! I love retro games and if you loved em I have a good feeling you will enjoy this game. The story is great and you will have a blast just pointing out all the old school game references. It's fun as hell!! AND it offers tons of video options that just make the game so much more fun to play with scan lines and different old system colors, arcade cabinet style and many many others.. it feels like emulating the classic consoles and monitors. I could tell you more but I think you should experience this game youself!
2363	1	a	This game is simply amazing. I love all the subtle references to other games/genres and much more. 10/10
2365	1	a	You better believe a brotha when he says that Retro City Rampage will joke you to death.  (Also, it's tons of fun, and HEY it has music by FreakyDNA, Virt and Norrin Radd which you can listen to whilst doffing a Devo hat and driving Donkey Kong across a trailer park at the same time.)
2367	1	a	I got this game a couple weeks ago and already logged over 11 hours on it. awesome retro game, would reccomend
2369	1	a	these games are so violent they are making are kids do drugs and shoot people on sight i say we ban retro city rampage on steam what do you say old sport
2371	1	a	Amazing game, classic but awesome. This is very fun if played with a controller: D 
2373	1	a	Well You can Sleep in this game, Even when you are dreaming this game is Open World
2375	1	a	Retro City Rampage is good and fun game, but it's just an 8-bit retro GTA. So, when it's on a discount sale, you can buy it for sure, just don't waste money on a full price.
2377	1	a	Fun little game. Kind of like if GTA Vice City was on Super Nintendo, which is pretty sweet. Although I'm not even sure what the purpose of it all is, but you get to drive tanks, the DeLorean and the A-Team van, so that makes up for it.  Got it for $1, so in this case, I got my money's worth
2379	1	a	What can I say that hasn't been said already?  Brilliantly written - so many many MANY 80s / videogame references...  And for a couple of quid (on sale) - or even more - definitely worth a punt!!  What are you waiting for? Get in that time machine!!   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce7lLNDtUo8 
2381	1	a	In my Criteria , It meets standard , it's an enjoyable game with a nice retro setting (you don't say) , a wonderful and addicting free roaming mode , and a LOT of references even on the main screen which I think it is fantastic . You can change your graphics mode to other console form the 8-bit and 16-bit era and you can change the border of the game giving you the intention the you're playing on a real console from 2 decades ago.Taking it's cues from Volgarr The Viking (another great Retro Game) Giving a good beating to the player in other words meaning the game is difficult (At least for me) and this is where some of the games problems start to show , Control My GOD the car driving is horrifyingly bad , but I figured that you could change it in the control menu. But in the end I would Highly Recomend this game
2383	1	a	Sometimes I have a hard time convcing myself to play older games that are good. Buying this game was a great way to motivate myself to do so because every five seconds you get a reference to an old good game. That, coupled with how boring this game is provides the perfect mix needed to get me to play those older games.
2385	1	a	I actually want the cereal as displayed in the trailer, just for the sake of tasting the nostalgic graphics, internet, and movie references. Oh and uhh... you get to kill Ninja Turtles. So yes, buy this game.
2387	1	a	This game is WAY beyond worth your money. It's fun and clever, with way more references to other games and 80s-90s culture than I could ever hope to keep track of. And it makes no pretensions about why you're really playing it--to go on completely implausible destructive rampages--so it lets you get right to it as soon as you start the game.
2389	1	a	I love this game! This brings me back the old good memories of GTA 1 â™¥
2391	1	a	this game throws you everything related to NES! Best Retro referances that I have ever seen. you have played soo many 'so called' retro games right? Than try this one
2393	1	a	If you are an 80s/90s kid you will fall in love with the hundreds upon hundreds of references to movies, tv shows, and even video games! suprise surprise!. A game that used to be planned to just be a fan GTA3 demake (named Grand Theftendo) but after it was shelved it revived as this game. The combat is pretty fun and funny at times (with mario style jump stomps) and the vehicles are pretty sweet too (from a yoshi motorcycle to kip from knight rider). Also some of the options in this game give you so much joy as some video filters can change the game to looking as if you're playing it in a Virtual Boy and even borders to look like different TVs (with one being an arcade cabinet with cool stickers of instructions). If you are an old school gamer that loves the times of 8-bit, chiptunes, and nostalgia then you definately need to pick this game up. so, are you a bad enough dude to play Retro City Rampage? I should hope so.
2395	1	a	This game is one of those games you don't get any more then you bargained for. It has some thrills and some fun parts, and it can be pretty funny. Don't get too excited and exceed what your expectations should be, and this game will give you some fun times. Be warned however, there are some very frustrating moments in-game...
2397	1	a	The perfect blend of old school and new school that really takes me back to when I was little. If you love old NES games and parody, you'll love Retro City Rampage!
2399	1	a	The game can be old.. but it's f**king amazing :) 9/10.
2401	1	a	Quite the fun game that gives me the same awesome feeling inside as GTA: Vice City, but with an 8-bit touch. Unfortunately, it lacks a decent storyline. The large amount of customization options and free-roam make RCR a game worth checking out.
2403	1	a	A good Retro-Game. Tons of Reference , Open-World , Lot of Secret. What a Beautifull game.
2405	1	a	If GTA and the 80's had a baby, but GTA had a love affair with a NES  4/5
2407	1	a	Like the GTA series, if the GTA series was good.
2409	1	a	It is possibly good. i could like it, yet i could hate it. i may enjoy playing it, or i may not. ehh, i like it.
2411	1	a	Get this while you can with 75% off. Such a bomb. Rad nostalgic moments guaranteed.
2413	1	a	Really fun game!  The game is a parody of many others such as GTA, Metal Gear Solid, Sonic, and much more! It's packed with references to other games and even game development. The story is basically Back to the Future (and I'm sure it recognizes that) and a big scavenger hunt. You do all of these missions for the Doc to help repair the time machine. The first half of the game is just running around having fun. Once you get to the second half though, it's no more fun and games. The difficulty curve shoots up and the levels will take you a few tries (or a lot). It became a trial and error type game, kind of like Hotline Miami.   The game is definitely worth a buy! 8/10
2415	1	a	This game is soooooo fun. so much like GTA. luv it! cant stop playing. I absoulutly love all the game and movie and tv show references! the only thing that could make it better is multiplayer and where to get the mods also more mods!
2417	1	a	Bodacious blast to the past, woah!
2419	1	a	It's hard no to recommended this game for so many reasons but here some:  1- it's made in Canada ( yeah most don't care.... but who cares ! Right ! ) 2- it try and manage to bring back so many good moments from the past 3- and i guess some might like the humor some not, but it ain't serious at all!  Now that it's 10 $ it's a great deal, story wise it's about 7 hours long if you take a lil time, and there is some challenge and free roaming wich give to the replay value. Even though I didn't play much after the story i'm pretty sure it coul had at least 2 hours more.  Nostalgia is something great to help a game out so I don't know if I could say it's for everybody, as younger one might not understand all the references.  Was a great 8 hours, don't regret it
2421	1	a	Do you like the old days of NES Games because your nostagia goggles are on too tight? Do you get off on stealing cars and outrunning the cops, army, and bionicops GTA style?  If you answer yes to either one of these, this is definitly a game you should pick up. Also, seek help from a doctor. Nostagia goggles cut off circulation to your head, and  getting off to stealing cars just isn't healthy.  8/10, on the count that keyboard controls are a tad weird to work with initialy and for 'Virtual Burn' giving me headaches.
2423	1	a	I can run around with a master chief helmet, a tattoo about retro games, run as fast as quicksilver, steal a kids bicycle, and beat the snot out of a cop with a guitar. 11/10
2425	1	a	The most satisfying thing about this game is plowing through a crowded sidewalk at full speed.
2427	1	a	Hey, you guys remember that THING from that OLD GAME?
2429	1	a	In the beginning was the NES, then about 12 years later the PSone and the game GTA. Now here's an amazing mix of the distant past, the even more distant past combined into a brilliant GTA (the first two) parody.  Normally I think references are bad writing, but less so the more well known classic (ninja turtles, bill &amp; ted, back to the future) 80's references which often just make enough of an apperance to keep things moving quickly. And considering it states right at the begining that it's a parody, it works in a beautifully ( parody is fair use under copyright law: ) cheeky manner.  RCR's gameplay absolutely thrashes the original GTA (and all the GTA's in my opinion, but I may be alone in that) that it is so closely based on. Especially the handling of the vehicles which is a joy and easier to both run down lots of pedestrians, and drive safely with traffic.  I've kept this review relatively short for the short amount of time I've actually played it, but I've played enough to know that I love it.  9.4/10 Oh, and the grim reaper mission just has me completely beat. I just can't kill them all fast enough.
2431	1	a	While this isn't really to my personal taste much, the game is a pretty competent offering and does 'retro' properly instead of being an awkward half-way thing. Main flaw of it that put me off is the game plays things way too fast and loose, it's honestly difficult to keep up with all the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it throws at you non-stop. Though that could just be me being old. =v
2433	1	a	Just like the NES version!!!
2435	1	a	Where to start : Pro's ; If you like me grew up in the age of the mega drive and the SNES then this game is what you wished you could of played, orignally a lovingly crafted demake of a certain open world game (GTA) after a legal case the name was changed and portions of the game were to however this detracts nothing from the game it's self. Packed full of missions and challanges A great retro sounding soundtrack ( what else do you expect )  Also you get an MS DOS prototype version and the orignal SNES rom with the purchase of this game fully compatable with game pads.  Con's  None that i can think of
2437	1	a	GTA NES Style.
2439	1	a	If you took all the classic 8bit and arcade games, and just smashed them all together, this is what youd get. Full of references, and overall, fun to play.
2441	1	a	1-word-review: AWESOMETASTIC!  Buy this Indiepearl, free roam, story, minigames, cameos and lots of humour. This game was in development for years, I pre-ordered it from their homepage because it sounded like alot of fun, and now I can just approve this! Runs on all machines XD!
2443	1	a	A parody, a clone, and a Demake all in one. So how come I have more fun with this than GTA 3 or my personal favorite of the series, Vice City? Because it's a great game, with much to do. You may only get about ten hours out of the story if you â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ around, and possibly sixteen hours to 100% the game, but you'll have fun the entire way, and for ten bucks, that's pretty good. ALSO; YOU CAN ACTUALLY AIM! Finally!
2445	1	a	this is the reason i use steam. this game is just the grestess love letter to all things during the 80's and early 90's and it is ABSOLUTLEY AMAZING! the writing, the gameplay, the driving, the characters, the EVERYTHING is just soooo good. get it now, everyone!
2447	1	a	GTA NES Style.
2449	1	a	There are so many refrences, I can't count them all. Zelda, Mario, Minecraft, Back To The Future, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, etc... The list goes On and On. The missions are fun (Reference filled don't you worry), enjoyable, not too long, not incredibly hard, charming and, pretty great in general. There are also a lot of extras in the game, like optional shaders, secrets, character customizations, etc... In short, this is a great game that I would highly recommend playing if your nostalgic, just want a fun top-down-GTA-type game, or if your into the old GTAs.
2451	1	a	(Beta review) This is probably the greatest video game I have ever played. If you like a game with great humor, 80's and 90's references, 8-bit graphics with smooth, action packed gameplay, then this is the game for you! I am SO hyped for the sequel, Shakedown Hawaii! (Actual review) When I look back on every game I have ever played, I can honestly say from the bottom of my heart that Retro City Rampage DX is the best video game I have ever played. I bought it on my 3DS a few years ago expecting fun, and I received a world of amazing, unbelievable content. This game has a very special place in my heart for its characters, story, humor, and everything else. I hope it wins something someday since it brought tears of joy to my eyes (really). The sequel will be undeniably amazing as well,  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNmYyb7dCdQ 
2453	1	a	This game let me hijack a school bus, then back over its driver multiple times for $3 in cash and made me question my morality.  10/10
2455	1	a	Retro City Rampage (DX) is a typical 'retro' game which isn't afraid of making fun of itself and the whole 80, 90's genre of gaming with many reference to TV and movie from that times as well. In fact the whole game is full of references everywhere , some obvious , some more obscure which will only make sence if you have knowledge or even better experienced the shows or games they are making fun of.  The graphics are over the top retro 8'bits and many gameplay mechanics reminds me of the games of that era, packed in a GTA aspirated but of course over the top game-frame. The creator of this game used a lot of time to give you the feeling of playing those antiquated systems .   There are also many funny commentaries of the state of gaming both practical and moral which can even apply today. At one point the hero of the game regret one of his past transgressions, the other character listening to the 'player' (yes the player's name in the game is 'player', another pun) comments ironically that he should maybe stop routinely running over and killing innocent bystander while he is at it.  This is a funny comment on heroes in games (and medias generally) sometimes committing large scale genocide in order to 'save the day'.  The gameplay is actually ok and refreshingly diverse, but it's obvious the creator prioritized putting references and puns in almost every frames of the game. As a result, the game itself might feel too short and small, the city especially could have been a tad larger, and I can understand the criticism. I still would recommend the game for the well done retro feeling , funny puns , especially but not only if you grew up in the 80's and 90's.   It's not very expensive to begin with but if you get a discount at some sales, it's really worth it as long as you have some interest in game culture and ready for a game that doesn't take itself very seriously.  
2457	1	a	It's 8 Bit GTA just even more silly. I mean seriously it is just like GTA, at least as much as I played of it which was about as much as I playd GTA 1!.
2459	1	a	This game is great, especially if you are an 80's/90's kid with a love for video game/pop culture nostalgia. The only downsides are that it can get repetetive near the end, and frustrating as well.
2461	1	a	its like 2d GTA with a ton of game crossovers. if you hadd multiplayer it would be out of stock XD
2463	1	a	This little game is an over-the-top arcade treat chock full of 8-bit fun. I robbed a bank, got chased by Mutant Ninja Turtles, stole the TARDIS, ran people over in the DeLorean with Doc Brown, went on a lucid dream rampage in a tank, got sent on a quest for a three-headed monkey paw, and that was just the first level.
2465	1	a	This games really gave me a flashback of old GTA games. 10/10 best GTA simulator ever and its really better than all the GTA's. And seriously the music in this game is so addictive to listen. It's worth 10 bucks to waste.
2467	1	a	This is a great game! full of references, stupid weapons and amazing missions. its a pretty short game (hence my 10 hours). I can not wait until shakedown miami cames out!
2469	1	a	An excellent GTA 1 style game. Graphics are slightly different to GTA 1 in that they're a bit more pixellated and the viewpoint is isometric as opposed to top-down but it has very much the feel of the original GTA. They've fit a lot of stuff into this game, there's plenty of collectables to find. I didn't find it ever really got boring. Great fun.
2471	1	a	You are lucky I envy you You do not have to wait years to play Grand Theftendo or  spend $10.00 on a magazine  Good God  with an article and screenshots about  a little game that started as a homebrew for the NES that is now called Retro City Rampage No The world is your oyster Do yourself a solid get this game into your life ASAP it is all kinds of wonderful  Dare I say Brian Provinciano  has created a masterpiece?  sure...  Now get your â™¥â™¥â™¥ back to the future!
2473	1	a	  People tend to compare this game to GTA a lot. Which I understand due to it being open-world and whatnot, however the humor, writing, etc. is nothing like GTA games and is more of in the essence of Saints Row games. While that's not the point of the review, I needed to get that out of the way for people who plan to get this game thinking it's the same exact thing as GTA with a serious story.  Retro Rampage DX is by far one of the best open-world indie games I've played in a while, and while my time on Steam doesn't reflect this, I have played RCR on PS3 in 2013 and I believe DX is the best remake this game has gotten.  Lots of improved mechanics and the driving doesn't feel as bad as it did when the first game came out, I really do recommend getting this game if you want something that's along the lines of Saints Row games and has a pretty good singeplayer story.
2475	1	a	Pure novelty if GTA owned licensing rights to all of our favorite games of past and present! Lots to do, naturally, but I was actually bored faster with the game than I thought I would be. I put about 45 minutes into it every time I open the game. Really cool game, but for some reason I did not stick to it as well as I thought I would. Well worth it when on sale!
2477	1	a	This game honestly has it all. It's fun, with catchy tunes and lots of classic video game/pop culture references.
2479	1	a	I really like this game, and that's something I don't often say! The graphics, the gameplay, everything just fits so perfectly to make this a beautiful game! Just look out that it doesn't hit you right in your 'addiction', if you know what I mean :)
2481	1	a	only thing missing is multiplayer
2483	1	a	You get to kill people.
2485	1	a	as i review this, Retro City Rampage is a greatful NES fanmade 8-bit GTA open world game from a guy named Brian who made this game all by his own (no seriously, one guy just made this game), the game has over tons of weapons, vehicles, missions, and all kinds of stuff including cameos and references of NES games and   80's and 90's pop culture, and the graphics.......well....the graphics are just 8-bit so nothing new about it, the vehicles are sometimes in a pain, the controls of the vehicles are medicore but that doesn't stop this amazing 8-bit open world game, i reconmmend those who like retro old school games, i give this a 8.3 ouf of 10
2487	1	a	Retro City Rampage is a great open world game that manages to have zero filler. Every mission is unique, which means you'll never get bored with it during the six or seven hours the storyline lasts. There are also some pretty fun challenge modes. The graphics are some of the best done 'fake nes' graphics I've seen in an indie game, and the game is overall very pleasant to look at. You can't go wrong with this one.
2489	1	a	It's 8-Bit Grand Theft Auto. It's Aiiiiight
2491	1	a	People say Retro City Rampage is a GTA 1 clone, i don't see that i see a really fun and funny game and i could not put it down. i give it a 9/10
2493	1	a	Love It!
2495	1	a	Modern 8bit remix on GTA1!
2497	1	a	Old School Game :D
2499	1	a	p. cool / 10 more than just your average indie retro shootan game I reccommend it
2501	1	a	I love dis game. There are so many reasons why you should play this game. To name a few, there are old-school references and many graphical settings. Any old-school enthusiast would love this game. Some references are parodies of things such as Doc Choc( Dr.Brown from BTTF). If you're looking for a cheap retro style GTA-like game, you've come to the right place.
1487	0	a	On the one hand, a tremendous amount of work went into creating tons of mini-games in service of making a reference a minute, and that merits respect. On the other hand, that mostly ends up serving as a reminder of games you liked a lot more than Retro City Rampage.  If you want open-world mayhem, go with something like a Saints Row game, where the city is easier to enjoy. If you want referential humor, grab something like Shut Up And Jam Gaiden, which puts more effort into its punchlines than 'Hey remember that thing.'
2503	1	a	YES, Retro games *can* be good... and this is retro well done &amp; true..
2505	1	a	Still better than Cod  Really nice arcady game  gta indie style  My sponsor:  http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ArchReviews/ 
2507	1	a	This game is EPIC! A Rewing into 80s culture, everything NES and old school  love wishing for more games like this
2509	1	a	You play as my father on his trip to work.
2511	1	a	   GTA-like retro game. You can drive around in various types of vehicles ranging from bicycles to monster truck    On-foot gameplay. You can hide behind covers, shoot with lock-on, shoot in any direction with right analog stick and last, but not least. STOMP your opponents.    References lot of old games/movies. I must admit the these were really funny and done well.    It's crazy how many options are there to tweak color scheme to mimic certain systems or create your own mix.   Only thing I have to say was bad is the ending boss. Trying too hard to make it difficult like old games while the whole game is fairly easy :|
2513	1	a	Ran around with a rocket launcher shooting everyone. Commited suside by hitting the wall next to me. 99.9% of germs killed with one wipe.
2515	1	a	THis is a Good game. 8-bit Of GTA. although has 35MB disk ,, but it has great elements like GTA. its worth playing !!!
2517	1	a	real game show there pixel
2519	1	a	HOLY â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ THIS GAME IS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING AMAZING!!!!!!!  ESPECIALLY THE DOS VERSION!!!! but the dos version needs music on adlib/opl2/ym3812~
2521	1	a	Old school, LOVE IT!
2523	1	a	This game is Awesome! I'm not really into 8-bit game before, but when i play this game i felt i want more game like this.  The main story is simple, yet entertaining. Well actually i don't really get some of the side story, maybe because my english is not really good but still this game is fun to play. And another things that made me like this game is that this game has a lot of easter egg of some famous movie like   TMNT, Rambo, Back to the Future, Robocob, and many more   The things that i don't like in this game is i feel some stages are too hard to finish, even though in the end i finished them. But overall this game is great I would rate this game 8/10

2525	1	a	If You Can Update it please add multiplayer mode i really want it..
2527	1	a	If I had to describe this game, the first thing that comes to mind would be, Holy Sh*t.  Must have.
2529	1	a	Very interesting re-imagining of GTA  I mean, this guy even ported it to DOS (Check your directories for RCR486) and released physical copies on floppy disk  But tbh the game is frustrating at times and not very replayable imo.
2531	1	a	8bit GTA with great 80's - 90's parody. 6/5.
2533	1	a	it's a good game
2535	1	a	THis is a Good game. 8-bit Of GTA. although has 35MB disk ,, but it has great elements like GTA. its worth playing !!!
2537	1	a	if you like hotline miami or any other modern retro games then you need this
2539	1	a	Better than GTA VI.
2541	1	a	Retry City Rampage DX copies the core gameplay loop of classic GTA, with lots of arcade style minigames added, along with references and inside jokes. Some of the gags had me laugh out loud, while many others had me cringe. The main storyline is deliberately bad, bogging down in collecting arbitrary parts for a time machine over and over again.  So while this is not a great game, I can't help but give it thumbs up because I honestly had a good time for the 6 hours it took me to finish. There is enough variety and unexpected challenges at every turn to keep you interested, and the whole look and feel is rather authentic.  This could have been a much better game if the developers had taken the storytelling aspect more serious instead of relying on the audience going crazy over excessive referencing of established franchises and indie games. It's definitely worth the price tag, and if you catch it on sale or in a bundle, I say go for it. You won't regret it.

2545	1	a	Someone tried to make GTA for SNES... and I am SOO glad they did. this game is amazing. Although it is primarily a GTA parody, they also make fun of a TON of other things, such as the video game industry, Back to the future, teenage mutant ninja turtles, Apple, and about a ZILLION other things!
2547	1	a	it's a good game
2549	1	a	Actually pretty good. I needed something able to run on my old laptop, and this worked well with a controller. Plays exactly like the original GTA, but obviously the graphics are just NES style. The sound and music holds true to the classic NES style. I liked this one, and nostalgia wasn't a factor, it was actually decent to play. Pick it up at on a steep sale nonetheless.
2551	1	a	This is a pretty good &amp; funny version of GTA with some 8-Bit Graphics &amp; Music.
1497	0	a	One of the most overhyped games of all time. Most of the game is 30 second snippets of better games from the 80's. Until you get to the end of the game when the levels go on FAR too long. The difficulty balance is off too. Again, most of the game is a cakewalk, you can ease through it with no effort. Then you get to the last 10 levels or so (out of 64) and the game just becomes a bull â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ sandwich. The dam level of TMNT, for example, is considered one of the worst of the NES era. So of course this game makes you do it twice. Road Blaster is one of my favorite games of all time, but the end of the game forces you to do it 6 times, wrapping up with a boss that you can only beat with luck. He has a specific pattern, but he 'cheats' in that sometimes his missles go where you are going to be, not were you were when he fired them. Sometimes, but not always. It's a violation of the boss pattern and had me throwing my controller and screaming profanities by the end of the night. The graphics are cute for about 5 minutes, then you realize you can't really tell what the hell is going on most of the time. The chiptunes are pretty good, but once the loop is over, the game won't start a new song unless you trigger a cutscene or get in a car.
2553	1	a	Truely amazing game which plays a lot like an old fashioned GTA. Every last pixel is reference to some part of gaming, movie or pop culture history. With so much jam packed in that it's almost overwhelming.  This takes me back a golden era of gaming in the best ways possible. Game soundtrack alone is worth the asking price.  Many hours of fun to be had with this title. Includes a bunch of built-in games such as 'Virtual Meat Boy and Bit Trip'.  A+
2555	1	a	What an awesome game. Its like all of your favourite videogame memories mashed together to form a awesome game full of games and games agames agames.   Its like So AWESOME!  10/10 BOYEEEEEEEEEEEEE
1502	0	a	I completed the game and it was tedious. The nostalgia humour is relentless and the gameplay is as incoherent and frantic as the narrative. Only a handful of missions required some skill and were rewarding; the majority of the game is: drive somewhere, receive joke, complete trivial action.  Music is very good, and the art style is cool.
2557	1	a	U get to use a mariachi (or however u spell it) guitar...... and kill people with it  10/10 would mariachi again
2559	1	a	haha awesome, this game is retro 'gta'. And its really fun, for those who love retro-styled games, plus if you enjoy gta games, you'd like this game. Has many modes, Free roam, story mode etc. I like it, I recommend it in definatley, Thumbs up to the dev :D
2561	1	a	So I found this game in my basement the other day and I decided to pop it into the toaster. It was all burnt up and the copy got destroyed. So then I decided to go and steal it from the Steam Store and it play it on my computer.  Upon actually getting into the game itself, I found myself attacked by a bunch of nerd-drawings all over the place! At first I was a little startled, then I realised that upon pressing my Xbox 360 controller's guide button, I was actually still sitting in my caddie playing on my Xbox 360! It was a little jarring to see that they had made another old game again.  So after about an hour of cursing at the game and making up my own words with the f-bomb attached to them, I decided to get really mad. I pulled the game out of my Sega Master System and threw it into my fireplace/smashed it with a hammer/made it 'explode'/cuss at it for an extended period of time/let Mike Matei play it. I then told everyone to never play this game and went back to making my feature-length movie about old games.  Thumbs up if you're an 80s kid.
2563	1	a	it's an amazing game. It make me laugh all the time.
2565	1	a	it's an amazing game. It make me laugh all the time.
1505	0	a	So yeah, this is a parody of GTA that relies on the unsurmountable amount of pop culture references to make you think it's doing something intelligent when it's not. The plot is completely neglectable, as it simply doesn't make sense. It's repetitive and so are the missions and dialogues, that try to be really clever with the most teen and buttdick humour ever. I was enjoying the sillines of it all until I realised that the dialogues were skippable and not funny, and that everywhere I went it was a hassle because the police was, well, hassling you everywhere. Not only that, but towards mission 40, the combat spikes up so much that it's frustratingly difficult and unfair - particularly for such a basic and not-thought-through system. It's simply not funny or engaging, and too frustrating. As a whole, yes, it's a mildly clever statement 'videogame plots never make sense and are over-the-top self-aggrandising rampages!!!'. But you can do exactly that with a much cleverer writing, humour and mechanics. Also, this game should have lasted two hours top, and it goes on and on and on and on unnecesarily. Man this is the first game that has made me rage quit and outright uninstall the game.
2567	1	a	NES + GTA = Retro City Rampage
2569	1	a	Such Soundtracks Very Graphics Much 80's  So References  WOW !
2571	1	a	It's really awesome, tens of years of popculture in 1 title. There's something missing- Anaglyph 3d support for whole game. It'd be AWESOME even more.
1507	0	a	I'm sorry, I don't get what the fuss is all about. Yes I like the references to all the classic games/movies/tv series, but other than that it's 'meh' for me. There's alot to do in the game which is nice, personally I just didn't want to do any of it. 4/10
2573	1	a	If you love GTA, specifically 1 &amp; 2, you'll enjoy this.
2575	1	a	Retro city Rampage is an extremly fun game. The music is great, so is the gameplay. There are a few issues like the driving but other than that the controls are great, i'd recommend this game to anyone who likes 8bit games.
2577	1	a	 https://youtu.be/VGc5H8QLOrg  Watch me play it
1508	0	a	I think the developers executed exactly the type of game they wanted to make, and I love them for some of the funky stuff they've done, like creating an MS-DOS port and some of their assembly (ASM) stuff out on the web.  Unfortuntately -- and this is a purely subjective &amp; personal beef -- Retro City Rampage DX felt like a power-fantasy for children. I did not enjoy the pacing &amp; easiness of the game, and had to put it down after 0.7 hours - and I haven't had the will to pick it up since.  Hopefully I'll change my mind some day and play it again, and then commit seppuku because my opinion was made in haste. But these days, I value my time a lot more, so I'm not sure if it was wrong to judge it after my short time with it.
2579	1	a	Like the original GTA with a top down view but with many references to past games (duck hunt, zelda, mario, etc.) in both the characters you meet and the missions you do.   e.g. There is an underwater level that mixes both TMNT1 and underwater Mario Levels. There is a Paperboy level (NES). You can stomp on enemies like in Mario  Fun game, I wouldn't pay full price for it though. Get it on sale
2581	1	a	This is the greatest throwback to retro gaming there ever was. The only thing i would love more would be multiplayer... here's to hoping..
2583	1	a	Tons of fun, 10/10.
2585	1	a	Really great game, and for $10 you can't go wrong. Would recommend it for sure!
2587	1	a	7.5/10
2589	1	a	-Gets cornered by cops    -throws tnt like a mad man   - crashes game  10/10 would crash again 
2591	1	a	this game is frikin fun nuff' said
2593	1	a	Damn nice and nostalgic game...very addictive! play it!!!!!!!!!!!
2595	1	a	With the game being short, while having limited graphics, very limited side-missions, and lack of 'Steam Workshop', Retro City Rampage makes a good, clean alternative to the 'Gran Theft Auto' series....which it parodies, among many other franchises, as well!  As to remind you; THIS GAME IS A PARODY! For $9.99 bucks, it's rather short, and as soon as you beat the game, it's literaly over. For effort, I give this game under the rating of 7/10, saying that it makes a good, clean alternative to 'Gran Theft Auto'. (While of course, being NOWHERE beyond the whole 'PG-13' rating, in humor.)
2597	1	a	Rammed a police car with a tank, police car exploded 11/10
2599	1	a	This Game Is Just So Awesome !! I Highly Recommend This Game Guys !! Please Buy It .. Its Worth A Shot !! The Gameplay Is Just So Epic !! Nice Story .. I'LL GIVE THIS GAME 9/10
2601	1	a	I'm only a teenager but i grew up playing the old text based games from the 80's. Like Leisure Suit Larry or King's Quest, i also enjoy old playstation 1 games. Retro City Rampage is a spoof of all the old good games rolled into a Grand Theft Auto 1 or 2 scenario. You'll see parody's of Paperboy, Leisure Suit Larry and from the front cover it's quite obvious, Back to the future. I haven't finished the game yet put it's pretty good so far, the music is pretty cool too. a spoofy 8 bit GTA at it's best.   
2603	1	a	i have probably played this more than i should, love it.
2605	1	a	This game is basically a parody on everything that's somewhat retro. It's full of adrenaline and variety. One of the intensest and funniest games I've ever played.
2607	1	a	I still remember the good times - always looking out not to be eaten by a giant panda in the streets.
2609	1	a	YOU.MUST.HAVE.THIS.GAME.
2611	1	a	decent game but its keyboard controls are very bad, i pretty much believe you should only buy it if you have a controller.
2613	1	a	This game is fun. Hard but fun.
2615	1	a	&gt; Bought a cup of coffee &gt; Bought a skateboard &gt; The skateboard is rlly fast &gt; Hit a car with the skateboard &gt; The car is going to explode &gt; I don't care... keep spamming 'W' Button &gt; The Car is on Fire! (The skateboard also burned too) &gt; The skateboard explodes (the car explodes after the skateboard explodes) &gt; Got killed by the exploding Skateboard   10/10 would get killed by an exploding Skateboard again
2617	1	a	Its like if gta 2, a NES and references had a baby
2619	1	a	This game is a masterpice. It is like gta 1. And also the translation are good. But my biggest enemy is the difficulty. Lots of times you replay the same mission over and over again, but sometims it is very frustrating. But you can have lots of fun with this game.
2621	1	a	Hijacked Bill &amp; Ted's time machine and kicked everyone out. 11/10.
2623	1	a	A brand new NINTENDO 8-bit cartridge for your computer. This is too awesome to pass up, especially if it's on sale. You owe it to yourself if you are old enough to have enjoyed games of the bygone era to buy this. Even when not on sale it's still WELL worth the 10 dollars US that it costs to buy it. Entirely fun, and combining many different play styles, you will be on a nostalgia trip the entire time. And yes, not only are the GFX 8-bit, the sound is too, and it's very very well done.  Do enjoy - I know you will. 10/10!
2625	1	a	Awesome game get it got it on xbox 360 first then here worth every penny FUN fun FUN Would buy again even if I had to trade the last Ben&amp;Jerrys box on earth. It would be empty, of course. I'm not stupid. But I'll get away with this awesome, fun, ridiculous, fun, sometimes high paced, fun, sometimes challenging, AWESOME, game of lets-play-something-where-we-can-just-â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥-around-and-wont-have-to-do-anything-cause-i-don-wanna-get-up-from-the-couch.  10 out of 8 would pay double for the game.     I think you got me after all that...
2627	1	a	it is soo cool, right when i saw this i knew i had to get it  - if you like saints row, and if you like gta, this is kinda like both combined. - if the top view bothers you, don't worry either, you get used to it fasy ( but i still cant drive for crap) - JUST GET IT'S AWESOME
2629	1	a	Its like if gta 2, a NES and references had a baby
2631	1	a	This game is a masterpice. It is like gta 1. And also the translation are good. But my biggest enemy is the difficulty. Lots of times you replay the same mission over and over again, but sometims it is very frustrating. But you can have lots of fun with this game.
2633	1	a	Solid snake died in a helicopter andi stole the docs car from back to the future. I have no idea what this game is 10/10
2635	1	a	Im having a lot of fun so far, i loved the first GTAs on PS1 and this game just keeps making me feel the same way. Maybe the car controls are a little bit difficult but still very enjoyable.
2637	1	a	It's pretty grape. Buy it.
2639	1	a	Its cool. has references and stuff
2641	1	a	THERE ARE REFERENCES EVERYWHERE! But yeah, this is a great fun game. You should buy it if you get a chance.
2643	1	a	Fantastic game and the DX update is brilliant! The new HUD makes a world of difference imo. Love all the nods to the other games, films etc.! AWESOME!
1520	0	a	Prepare for a totally unfunny oversaturation of pop culture refrences for no reason! Also, incase you couldn't tell, RCR is a GTA clone, and has a criminal protagonist.
1521	0	a	Retro City Rampage tries to do the whole GTA/Bethesda game/Ubigame thing of being a big open world that you get familiar with by driving around a hub, and that's a pretty modern convention. It also tries to do this while clumsily weilding about what they will assert is a very retro playstyle. The thing is, this ends up being a worst of both worlds scenario, strung with boring and repetitive combat scenarios spread across a pretty uninteresting city, with little motivating you to follow through with the dozens of side missions that show up on your radar. When I did try to do them, they felt like they were repeating the worst parts of the main campaign, which itself was largely juvenile in tone and design. They throw a million expendable cops, thugs, and soldiers your way, with a hundred invisible checkpoints and an infinite supply of lives so that you die a million times (97 by the end in my case) without losing a lot of progress. And I can't help but feel like that blind jab at 'difficulty' is what they believed would make their game justifiable as 'Nintendo Hard'. RCR is less a game and more a hamfisted, halfhearted, and mostly unfunny collection of cheap references and gags.
2645	1	a	One of the wierdest and most fun fps games ever! Some people call it hat simulator and I can see why there are tons of hats from strange hats to unusual hats this game is all about hats!
2647	1	a	It's 8-bit GTA. I kinda felt like GTA was getting a little TOO real. So this is a refreshing break.  It's what GTA would have been if it was released on the NES and the NES was actually capable of such an expansive world.  I went to the Casino, spent $500 on a roll of the pokies, won death then died. Then lost $2700 from dying. 10/10. Would play again.
1525	0	a	Dont buy this game it sucks. Way too hard for no reason, story doesnt make sense, too hard, too hard, too hard, this game sucks
1526	0	a	This game is a good example of why it's important to also check the negative reviews on a game that have a lot of positive reviews.  As many others have expressed, this game shoves parodies &amp; references down your throat every single moment and that seems like all the game is good for and even then, it does get annoying especially if you're familiar with all those since it's like- where the hell is the new, fresh content we haven't seen &amp; experienced before?  The dev can make an excuse saying it's meant to be a homage to retro games but I think that's cheap if it doesn't have much of it's own content &amp; flair to back that up. I know it's a parody, but at this level it's just plain cheap reuse of existing ideas &amp; scenarios from other games put randomly in it. That said, it tries hard to be funny but you'd just get a few chuckle here &amp; there. That said, newer gamers who hadn't played the games it's parodying would not get most of the joke and to me, that's bad since like a bad parody (either games, films, cartoons, etc.), it fails to make the joke happen for those unfamiliar with the source material.  Moving on, even with the story, parodies &amp; jokes aside, this game is still â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. It's just like the most of those pseudo-retro games with retro graphics but in terms of gameplay, it's anything but. Broken stealth system, you can't run at full speed right away after moving from standing still (seriously, not even newer games do this anymore), the game auto aims for you &amp; the Mario-stepping-on-enemies are clunky as hell. I also haven't found a reason to do this when you have other alternatives to kill the enemies. There's also the boring take cover &amp; shoot when the enemy is not shooting &amp; standing there like an idiot waiting to get shot. It happens too often &amp; takes too much time.  That said, control is rigid. For a game focusing on rampage, this is totally the opposite experience I'm looking for. If you want a pseudo-retro game that excels in gameplay &amp; still have a touch of their own (as in not being cheap copies of existing games &amp; makes it a 'homage to retro games' as an excuse), get Hotline Miami or Binding of Isaac: Rebirth instead. Those are heaps &amp; bounds better.  If I could refund the hell out of this game, I would. Luckily I bought it at discounted price.   
1527	0	a	I broke my Â£700 Computer because of a rapid click minigame.  â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ This Game
1528	0	a	Hold Enter button simulator.  I love the retro sound and graphics.. really feels like an 8bit game but where it fails for me is in the bitty broken up nature of the gameplay. Everytime the action gets going it comes to a halt for the story.  Yes if it wasn't for the story it would be too close to GTA 1 but it does feel like there should have been short elegant segways into the plot instead of the classic mistake of coming to a dead stop to explain stuff. You are a bad guy.. you hurt innocent people while doing bad things.. got it.
2649	1	a	This game is so awesome but does get boring, but if you like to have a fun time get it.
2651	1	a	Simply amazing if you liked any game from over 5 years ago
1530	0	a	Controller support is attrocious.
2653	1	a	if you played enough old console classics you will love this game... worth the money if it's on sale, buy it.
2655	1	a	You got GTA 5? Pfft i got a NES-looking game dat allowz me to wear a super hero clothing  0/10 - IGN  'Dull story, Not anything like CoD'  Wich means this game is good.  
2657	1	a	My ex wife still misses me...                                                      BUT HER AIM IS GETTING BETTER!                                                              JOAJE
2659	1	a	Incredible Game :) !
2661	1	a	its really cool. Its like gta but pixel and retro and old school. All in all its a cool game  
2663	1	a	One of best game I've EVER played. I've only played about an hour and 30 minutes but I can already tell that im hooked. great humor, graphics, refrences, and an awsome developer. The only thing I could ever ask for in this game would be for the dev to add in a multiplayer mode. But besides that it's by far one of my favorite games.
2665	1	a	Disclaimer: I do not enjoy the PC Port of this game, But i recently Bought the 3DS version of this game, and this is the version i am talking about  This game is funny, enjoyable to play, and has great controls. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the first few GTA games for the PS1, and with the portability of the 3DS, Its Even Better
2667	1	a	This is what you would have gotten if GTA came out in the SNES era
2669	1	a	Aside from indie devs sucking each other off, having Epic Meal Time in the game and stupid â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing memes it's a pretty rad video game.
1537	0	a	The game has a lot of funny moments but it's not super hilarious or original. And I don't particularly like the clunky GTA 1 gameplay. I bet a successor of this game could be amazing if it would adopt more fluid GTA 2 gameplay and invest more in quality parody than 200 billion references.
1538	0	a	Essentially 'References: the Game'. Cluttered visuals and hit-or-miss sound design make this feel more suited to be a free title.
2671	1	a	.
1540	0	a	Retro City Rampage is like the old GTA games but with a load of references that are crammed down your throat every minute. This game doesn't really bring anything new to the table. RCR had pixel graphics and 8-bit music which is nothing new. The gameplay is basically just a top-down shooter and nothing more. The entire story is based around fixing a time machine for a scientist who time travels in a delorean, which is great because we didn't have enough references. Some of the missions are an outright pain in the â™¥â™¥â™¥. For example: There's a mission where you play as BiffMan (YAY MORE REFERENCES) and you have to swing back and forth over and over again to hit a button that drops henchmen. You have to time it right and grab the henchmen and then time it right to drop them in the tank of crocodiles. You have to do this multiple times all while on a timer. There are many more annoying missions but I guess if you're hardcore and want to power through it, you can. Also, some of the mechanics such as the police are irritating. If you run over a couple people or crash into people while using the game's mediocre driving mechanics, you get a wanted level. The only way to lose said cops is by collecting cloaking device coin things which are placed throughout the city or starting a mission. This makes doing things extremely annoying because let's say you want to explore the map but accidentally run over someone in front of a cop. Well now you have to drop what you're doing and go around town looking for one of the coins or carry on while being swarmed with police officers. The game also gets very boring after a while. Unless you're doing missions nothing much changes. It's just the same old thing for the most part. The missions are kind of interesting but usually have the same goal and continue to drown you in references. In the end I would say $10 is too much for this game. If you find it on sale for $5 or less like I did then maybe give it a shot. You might have some fun with it but you'll probably get irritated with the same crap I did and give up on it.
2673	1	a	my car was jacked by a granny  11/10 would granny again
1542	0	a	Oh god, this game is pretty bad, trust me.Stay away.
2675	1	a	You'd be crazy or broke not to get this game! It really takes ya back to the good ol' days as most reffer it to with its old grapical design and refrances to games and old movies. I can go on and on about this game but i'm sure someone else will make a better review than me. But anyway for real while this game is one sale for a buck do yourself a favor and buy it.
2677	1	a	GTA 3, but with even more references, and it can get 60 FPS on my toaster oven. 5 stars.
1547	0	a	I'd been looking forward to this game for a while, and bought it on a steam sale a while ago. I'd tried a demo before and it seemed like it would be funny and a lot of fun. However, it is most definitely not funny, and it's only moderately fun.   The game doesn't know how to tell a joke. Saying 'hey look, it's Solid Snake! It's Doc Brown! It's the TARDIS!' is not a joke. It's the same problem that Duke Nukem Forever had with its humor. I love a good reference, but references alone do not make a game. The gameplay itself is average, and certainly nothing to write home about, but the humor was clearly supposed to carry it, and the humor just doesn't have any effort behind it. It just tries to throw thirty references at you a minute and hope that it overwhelms you with nostalgia enough that you don't notice that there's nothing else going for it.  It might not have been so disappointing for me, had Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon not already come out before I tried it, since it did the 80's reference/parody game a lot better.
2679	1	a	If you like games and you dont buy this, you're an â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.  10/10
1551	0	a	Played 30 minutes, got bored, quit.
1552	0	a	With gameplay that's too fast to comprehend and every retro homage under the sun shoehorned into every second of playtime, this game ends up being exhausting and annoying. Thumbs down.  (The music is kickass, though)
1553	0	a	It's fun at first but the story just blurrs one event into another And it would be excusable if it were fun but then it gets repetitive.
1554	0	a	Retro City Rampage looks like a throw back to the NES games, it sounds like a throwback.  But it doesn't play like one. RCP grabs almost everything that was rad during the 90's quotes, movies, games and slaps it into one box, that if was released during those times would have caused many children to die of cardiac arrest.   Unfortunately being bombarded with 90's references via storyline, background foreground etc and so on gets a little tired. It's the equavilent of a dubstep, raveparty on acid while injecting absinthe atop of an Euthanasia coaster.  When I muster the strength I turn it on for a short period so I don't have to use my NES emula.................Nintendo Entertainment System.  2.5 out of 5 chiliwigs
2681	1	a	Its alright
1574	0	a	The free-roaming parts of the game are mildly fun, but the story missions get progressively harder and use gimmicks to stay engaging. Expect to lose tens of lives at certain points as you approach the end of the mission line, in what is an otherwise trivially challenging game.
1575	0	a	In the 4 hours I played this game I kept waiting for it to throw up even the faintest, barest, most insignificant semblance of a fraction of a challenge. It didn't. It doled out mindnumbing fetch quests, kill X of Y missions, and brief corridors of cannon fodder, all backed by irritating, disposable music and laced with witless 'parody' and facile social commentary. It is amongst the most insanely boring gaming experiences I have had in recent memory and I recommend it to absolutely nobody. 1/5
2683	1	a	its a very fun game
1585	0	a	Meh. Fueled only by nostalgia and gaming / pop culture references.
1586	0	a	A perfect example of a game coming out at the wrong time. This is the greatest Grand Theft Auto ONE parody to ever exist. Had Retro City Rampage come out at that time I think it would have made more of an impact. Games have evolved since then and sadly the mildly amusing referencial humor was not enough to keep me playing this all the way through.
1587	0	a	ATTENTION: I recommened buying over Humble Store, when it is on sale!!!  Simply start playing the story. Do not start playing the game with open world ambitions. The world is too small and the retro style music is too annoying over time. That said get it over with, do some challenges and have some 'retro-feel'. Oh before I totally forget it, it is a game with many hints about other games , movies, cartoons etc. That is it in a nutshell... for 50% off it is a solid buy for random fun, nothing serious and you should really tune down that cr4ppy retro music! *blerch*
1588	0	a	not a fan. Perhaps because I missed out on a lot of retro games. I do not find this fun.

1593	0	a	This game is really annoying to play. The layout and map is so forgetable that I can never find any shops where i need to. Also, if you want a vehicle, you have to run around for an hour just to find a car you want. Not that it matters though since essentially every car in the game is exactly the same. Retro City Rampage is an overall boring and aggrivating game. And not in the fun way.

1599	0	a	f fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff  uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu cccccccccccccccccccc kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk                                                                                                                                                                         you.
1600	0	a	Its an afull 'parody' as they call it to the ps1 era GTA games. Hard to look at. Injected with more crappy refrances then an lethath dose of haroine. It pays tribute to Super meat boy and Bit trip with very hard to play clone type mini games. Its sad
1601	0	a	WHY IS IT SO PIXELAGTED IT MADE MY EYE RUN AWAY FORM HE (I CALED CHILD ABUISE SERVICE AND IT KILLED ME) PLAS DONT GO BUY TT, GUY NEW GAEME 
1602	0	a	terrible game, blatantly rips off the dead ops arcade mode in call of duty black ops
1603	0	a	no, i think its a bad games that tryed to make a 2d verson of GTA5
2689	1	a	Remember GTA1? It's like that but with ~references~ which is my kind of humor because I am completely unoriginal. 9/10
2691	1	a	All I can say is that I'm in love with this game. It controls beautifully, better (I personally think) than any of the top-down GTA games, and for the first time, I'm ACTUALLY interested in doing missions (as well as taxi shifts). I've also understood almost EVERY single reference I've seen, and had to do everything in my power to keep myself from dying of excitement when I found the fridge on the chain, the cow signs, and the definitely-not-earthworm hiding in a trash can. The game is seriously one of the funniest things I've played in a long time, and manages to pull this off while still being family-friendly. The ONLY thing that would be cool to add would be multiplayer, but, eh, I'll get over it. 10/10   Also, I play it with a Nintendo 64 controller, and have NO regrets.
2693	1	a	this game is cool  buy this game i am 20% complete  buy it and BE IMORTAL  but please make more maps and weapons PLEASE MR EDITOR
2695	1	a	Love this game brings me back in time to when i was a kid.
2697	1	a	Grand Theft Retro
2699	1	a	Retro city rampage is a great throw back to the 80s/90s and other things like that with a classic old school look, fun gameplay and aprox 9 billion refecenes from back to the future, sonic, minecraft, batman, metal gear solid and so much more. The only bad thing about the game (in my opinion) is the last levels because they are just to hard that you may break your controller/keyboard. This is also on: Steam, PS4, PS3, PSVita, Wii, Wii U, 3ds and xbox 360 (I'm not sure about Xbox one but it might come out an it). It's good, has an 80s themed sence of humor etc. and has a really funny breakfast ceral ad (the breakfast ceral is not real)
2701	1	a	This game is exploding fun! Litteraly! The game have solid gameplay, hilarious story and A LOT OF REFRENCES! but it can get annoying as you can't escape the cop easily and I find myself suicide just to get away from the cops.     This game gets a 9/10 and my 'Must Buy' seal of approval.
2703	1	a	This game was everything I hoped it was. The developer threw in toooooons of easter eggs from games and movies of my childhood. I'm in my 30s and this made me feel like a child again.  I've typically been against the GTA style games, but this changed my opinion of them. LOVE THIS GAME!
2705	1	a	NEStalgia! Great minigames. Mile a minute references. Fun gameplay. Very customizable look.
2707	1	a	Imagine 8-bit version of GTA without adult stuff, and you get this
2709	1	a	I'm pretty impressed so far as I got it as a time waster while I have a cold not really minding if it was that good.  Its like Grand Theft Auto the original in fast forward like others have said.  Everything seems very polished and it is hard to find a fault other than it is so fast paced, I find it hard to keep up at times as I'm not in the mood for anything taxing with my cold.  The Mac version runs flawlessly and uses native full screen mode which I was impressed by. First game I've actually seen use this feature.  For the price, this game is a steal and much better than many of the other Indie games on steam as it seems to have loads of content and be very polished.
2711	1	a	This game is hours of retro fun!
2713	1	a	I dont understand why anybody would find this game not fun. This is just like the original GTA's but stripped down to the fundamentals, which is completely fine because the fundamentals are ALOT. The gameplay is smooth and works completely fine on a keyboard or Game Controller. There is alot of cool stuff to do while your just roaming around in Theftropolis. The city is small but not so much so that you get bored and have nothing to do. The music is crazy awesome and very nostalgic. There are heaps of references from the classics like Megaman, Sonic and Mario which is absolutely awesome, and the comedy is on point. Definately worth what you pay, and I actuallly think that this game deserves a solid 10/10 This game is a must play for anyone.
1604	0	a	No configurable controls=this is a bad game. Not recommended. Can't play it with my gamepad because it maps 'walk left' and 'walk up' to the left and right shoulder buttons, and the keyboard controls are awful. Add in the ability to re-bind controls, like ALL OTHER GAMES, and then we'll talk. Until then, stay away from this game unless you're 100% sure that your contoller will work with it.
2715	1	a	OMG... where to start?  This is a gem... just can't get enough of this game. If you're more or less a gamer from my generation (I'm 33, started with the Atari 2600) you will love and get this game just as much as I did.  It contains many references and parodies from Atari and NES games references to 80's movies to early PC games (LSL anyone?)to Mortal Kombat and to basically main pop culture and gaming through the last 3 to 3.5 decades, done awesomely and hits you right in the nostalgic nerve.  Putting aside the nostalgic love it generates, the game is super fun and enjoyable, with an amazing gameplay, many many features and really fun and engaging missions from stealing TV sets to traveling with the Doc from Back to the Future to many other great and fun stories.  Definitely, a must have!!
2717	1	a	Retro City Rampage is an extremely enjoyable game that I would highly recomend. I have around 60 hours in this game and am proud of it.
2719	1	a	If you were gaming in the 80's and 90's this game will spark off nostalgia, if not play it and see why your dad can't beat you on halo.
2721	1	a	Remember all the games of the past 8-bit era such as TMNT, Contra, Smash T.V.,Bionic Commando,APB and others? Remember all of the NES chiptune and Commodore 64 wavetable music of the era? Remember all the nostalgia of 1980's Television &amp; movies? Good...because this is ALL going to come flooding back in a tidal wave of nostalgic bliss.  Now take all that concentrated awesome throw it in a blender with the original Grand Theft Auto ( back when they were known as DMA design and were better known for making Lemmings and FAR before they became Rockstar games.) add copious ammounts of tounge in cheek genuine humor a metric TON of 'easter eggs' and throw in a few cameo's from 'notable' greats and you have this GLORIOUS batch of insanity known as Retro City Rampage.  If you're an '80's kid' ( and not some wanabe hipster) you owe it to yourself to PICK THIS UP! 
2723	1	a	very good game i would recommend it for the consumer audiences
2725	1	a	Within the first 15 Minutes I helped the Joker rob a bank, Killed the Ninja Turtles and the A-Team, Stole the TARDIS and drove Doc Brown's DeLorean... So Yeah this game was made for me.
2727	1	a	Awesome, even though I don't understand all the references!
2729	1	a	Retro GTA with lots of old game references! Awesome fun!
2731	1	a	I'm not gonna lie, this game is really fun, but has some setback. For example: since its supposed to be a retro game, it's pixelated. But because of this, I sometimes miss alot of stuff that goes with the background that really annoys me. Also the controls i keep forgetting, and the $14.99 price. I suggest waiting for it to be on sale. On the bright side, it's really fun to go on rampages, and even the story is a bit long.  3.5 outta 5.
2733	1	a	If you want to play a game like the first two GTA games but find it frustrating, this is your best alternative, all your game references, 80's references, NES references, it's a retro gamer's dream game all wrapped up into one game.  This is some addictive fun, check it out NOW!
2735	1	a	It's a pixelated GTA! Lots of parodies and shout outs to other games and movies from the 80s and 90s. I love it!
2737	1	a	This is my absolute favorite game of all time! Loads of stuff to do if you are bored, awesome references to retro NES era games. It's also the only T-rated Grand Theft Auto clone- all the swearing is done with symbols and there is no blood. This is exactly how you would want GTA to play out if it was made for NES. The controls are very comfortable with the Xbox 360 controller. This is the one game I would not mind buying for every system I own. The developer cares about the game and releases updates and allowed a modding system. This game also has steam cards, including the awesome Radioactive Plumber card.  The only thing that is missing is an Android port...
2739	1	a	Classic arcade style of a game, Very enjoyable and very fun, Reminds me of the old days.
2741	1	a	THIS GAME IS UTTERLY INSANE IN ALL THE BEST WAYS POSSIBLE! RETRO GRAPHICS! RETRO SOUNDS! RETRO STORY! 8-BIT REFRENCES AND 80'S REFRENCES GALORE! YOU'D BE STUPID NOT TO BUY THIS! 20/10
2743	1	a	A great throw back to the 80's.GTA is back as is TNMNT.Retro City Rampage made Retro rise from the gfrave 10/10
2745	1	a	This is a very fun game! A witty, rage inducing game full of funny parody's. Very similar style to Grand Theft Auto I, II, Advance and China Town Wars. The music is nice however sometimes feels like you are listening to one long song on each station (when there's more than one). The controls are a bit clunky with an Xbox 360 controller but still very much playable. 8.5/10
2747	1	a	A homage to open world games, with the fun-to-play attitude of a modern game, and the wonderful playfulness of an retro game; both in graphics and sounds.  Also lots of hints to both old games and movies, makes this one a real joy to play; especially if youre an somewhat older gamer :D  Recommend very much!
2749	1	a	Now this, is fun.
2751	1	a	I like the game, simple and fun to play. It's my 'go to' when bored with big name titles, easy to put down and pick up again later.
2753	1	a	its an awesome 8 bit game with a story that is awesome easter eggs itself, fun gameplay and like 2398852639 cameos! youll have a blast just shooting and playing around!
2755	1	a	I've been waiting so long for this to come out! It's finally out, and an hour in to it, it's definitely not letting me down. It's very similar to GTA2 in play mechanics and style of game. In beautiful 8bit graphics and lots of references to good ol' NES and all kinds of games. Two thumbs up! I think i'll be playing this for a while.
2757	1	a	10/10 Would go back to the future. DAAA DAAA DAAA DA DA DA DA DA DAAA DA DA DAAA DAAAA DAAAAA
2759	1	a	This is another game making a glory 'remember the 90's' with this top down grand theft auto clone that is all bells and whistles and you want it. Its got a parody story Im sure only 90's kids will get.
2761	1	a	it's obviously a parody, and parody is good.
2763	1	a	Fun game. Lots of references to a ton of classic games and overall a blast to play. A bit short but sweet and leaderboards provide some small amount of longevity in trying to reach the top if you care about those things. Achievements are pretty good and feel worth getting. Overall worth it.
2765	1	a	Drank milk and went insane 11/10 would go insane again
2767	1	a	Such a fun mess around game.
2769	1	a	So real I almost hit a tank with my fists. And you don't usually see tanks in this game until you do something bad.
1605	0	a	It's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥!
2771	1	a	Grand Theft Auto For Kids
2773	1	a	Review: 7/10  The developer of this game has shown what's the outcome of years of hard work, and no doubt the outcome is good! This game is basically GTA in retro/pixel graphics. You get everything you experience in the GTA games in addition to a whole new level of craziness (Not Saints Row The Third crazy, but close enough), with lots of nostalgia from other 8-bit arcade games like Duck Hunt for example. The gameplay is fun as hell and causing chaos is actually better than the older top-down GTA games! Being an open world action game, do expect lots of variety from it, along with some mini games that really makes this game a bang for the buck. However, the game does get repetitive when it comes to combat. You'll actually find it to be like an arcade game which is precisely what it's intended to be. So buy it instantly if you are into the older arcade games, and if not - Still buy it for the stuff you get for the low price, okay?
2775	1	a	You'll have fun for a while, but the whole 'making fun of the 80's and old video games/movies' thing gets old really quick. The top-down perspective makes the jumping a bit wonky,but other than that this game isn't 'bad'. However, the only thing it had going for it to make it unique was its humor and that gets old fast. It's 3 dollars though.
2777	1	a	7/10
2779	1	a	You like old games? You like NES? You like all pixelated graphics? You like chiptunes? Well, then I say that consider getting this.  You can think it as a GTA (somewhat) in 8-bit. There's also â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ons of different game references that I cannot even count them.
2781	1	a	First GTA has nothing on this.
2783	1	a	0/10 didnt get the cereal
2785	1	a	this is a awsome game 
2787	1	a	Retro City Rampage is a really fun game that succeeds at being at least what it is. It's primarily nostalgia-bate, but it plays great, and as an open world game is actually has more mommentum and a brisker, more satisfying pace than it's contemporaries. Mostly good looking, but sometimes it can be a little forgettable. I mostly recommend it, especially if you haven't played it.
2789	1	a	I was one of few people to play this when it was new, i enjoyed it with references from back to the future i reccomend this game and it's price tag :D 8/10
2791	1	a	Bodacious game! I love all the refrences, it reminds me of the original Grand Theft Auto games! 10/10 -RamboBiscuit
2793	1	a	This game was funny, great and awesome.  Worth it's price 10/10 would play again.
2795	1	a	if you like 8 bit and open world this game is for you
2797	1	a	idk wth this game is inexplicable  9001/10
2799	1	a	If GTA stayed 8 bit then threw in a ton of movie and pop culture references this would be the outcome.
2801	1	a	A game with as many 80's references as there as much money in Bill Gate's bank
1607	0	a	This game does a poor job of imitating the old gta games. Unless you can get this game for under a dollar, i would recommend you don't get it(in my opinion it is that bad).
2803	1	a	Is fun and exciting in the beginning because of the funny sounds and cool 8-bit graphics, but gets pretty quickly too empty in it. 6/10
2805	1	a	Quite probably the best indie game I've ever played.  RCR features a classic GTA style gameplay coupled with clear parodies of 80's &amp; 90's games and films. The game features a wide range of activites to complete and a high level of customisation; from hairstyles to cars (even the game's graphics can be changed to suit anyone's style thanks to the array of colour palettes and borders included).  Furthermore, aside from the missions, there are side goals, rampages, challenges, a free roam mode and more...basically, there is something here for every fan of open world gaming and retro media alike!
2807	1	a	This is basically 8-bit Grand Theft Auto on steroids. Awesome.
2809	1	a	I saw the video about the optimizations behind this game and that already got my interest. This is the most awesome game done in years in the sense of coding and optimizations. This is what a true retro game looks like and how it is made.  Today I decided to go ahead and try the game. I was amazed at the details hidden in it. All the cool references to the old arcade classics, the different minigames and cool little easter egg type treasures. This is truly a great achievement. I would recommend this game for anyone who has played any 8 bit games and also to anyone who hasn't to see how would the best 8-bit game look and play. Also I would suggest this game to any game developer as there are a lot of things to learn from this masterpiece. Looking forward to next game from these guys.
2811	1	a	Do you like GTA? Do you like retro NES games? yes? Buy this game. No? Buy this game anyway.
2813	1	a	If you love the internet or the 80's or old school nintendo game this is the perfect game for you NES difficult, many refrences, and an 8-bit GTA feel with many fun missions.
2815	1	a	Fun little game so far but the game references can be a bit much. we get it guys, you played NES games. so basically recommended if you can withstand the barrage of references
2817	1	a	I bought the original on PSVITA and I really enjoyed it but why do I get 1fps on a i7-4790k OVERCLOCKED and DUAL GTX 980s and 128gb's of RAM? It makes no sense, just play Mario it's a better alternative to this 8-Bit game.
2819	1	a	Been waiting for the release for so long. Well worth the wait.
2821	1	a	Quite good for a retro game.
2823	1	a	You can run faster than cars. I R8 8/8 M8
2825	1	a	Had no idea what was going on at any time.  11/10 would be confused again

2829	1	a	I just rekted the city so hard!
2831	1	a	It might say I only played 3.5 hours but I played about 50 hours offline at my grandparents and I must say it is one hell of a game and the nostalgia in this game is the best. If you are a fan of old top view GTA games and Old retro games this is for you.
2833	1	a	Funny, addictive, with awesome 8-Bit graphics. Just go and buy it!
2835	1	a	If you were born in the 80's and played 8 bit games, this title is for you.
2837	1	a	A great combination of NES era nostalgia and the now-obligatory free roaming, open world, whatever you want to call it structure that every game is required to follow today.  Packed with lots of silly references to your favourite 80s movies, cartoons and video games.  The developer deserves a lot of praise for the effort they made to develop a limited version for the NES as well. If this had come out when I was a kid, it would have been, no bougt, one of the greatest NES titles ever.
2839	1	a	It's a great game. References to pop-culture and gameplay style like GTA 1-2 (not the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ones) are super. You won't regret this purchase.
2841	1	a	Awesome retro game with parodies of everything, one of my favorites.
2843	1	a	This game is basically like Grand Theft Auto 1, if it came out on the NES.  The music is good, the gameplay is good on the whole and it has a good sense of humour and tons of references to 80s and 90s movies, shows and games.  From Saved by the Bell, to Ninja Turtles, to Back to the Future and Metal Gear Solid, nothing is sacred!  There's also some sweet arcade games based on Super Meat Boy, Bit Trip Runner, and Epic Meal Time .
2845	1	a	Cool retro game, like C64 version of GTA
2847	1	a	One of the best games on the market and I am glad that I spent my money on it!
2849	1	a	Absolutely fun, would highly recommend this
2851	1	a	This Retroic Game kicks SO MUCH â™¥â™¥â™¥! -Nice Resemble of NES Graphics -Great Controls -Nice Put of Cameos -OK Challenge -Best Music in any 8-bit Game! -Nice 8-bit Demake of Grand Theft Auto III -Very Interesting Development History Highly Recommended!
2853	1	a	Stop whatever you're doing and play this game, now.........NOW!!!
2855	1	a	Retro City Rampage is not only a throw back to pixel classic video games, but it also brings up pop culture and movie icons from the past 50 years. I HIGHLY recommend this game. The story line is whacky but well done and the overall smooth flowing levels and menus keeps your attention for long periods of time.
2857	1	a	It's 8-bit GTA.  It's amazing.  I shall repeat myself.  8-BIT GTA!  You must buy this game....  8 BIT GTA FTW!!!!!!
2859	1	a	A pretty fun retro-style GTA clone. Wait for a sale though; I wouldn't recommend paying the full $15 for it.
2861	1	a	Some will say that Retro City Rampage is a 8-bit verson of GTA 1 and 2, but 1 million times cooler....  That someone is me, and every word is true, but I will say more. Retro City Rampage does remind me of a 8-bit verson of GTA 1 and 2, but 1 million times cooler - but the chreey on top is how it also says homage to a ton of classic 8-bit games, but turning them into funny and comforting parodies that everyone will remember and laugh over.   At the same time, it's a very well designed game. The Game mechanics are on point: Tight and responsive, no lag or difficulty, the game music is spot on perfect - classic 8-bit music. And the side quests and main missions while vast and interesting, are always fun and entertaining.   And yes, there IS a mission or two, where you MUST run people down.  How could you not love this game?  I highly recommend this game for casting online (twitch/hitbox/etc) and just playing on your own or with a buddy. Oh, and joystick support is easy to setup. Takes like a minute to config a controller.
2863	1	a	I don't get all the 80's references, but in short :this game is fun. It reminds me a lot of GTA:Chinatown wars, in that there are many stores and minigames to play around town. The campaign is challenging, though sometimes it is a bit too challenging. I find the most fun simply going on a rampage.
2865	1	a	Games like this bring a smile to my face... reminiscent of GTA 1&amp;2 with numerous mini-games all hailing back to classic NES titles. Do yourself a favour and check it out via youtube.
2867	1	a	Would definately reccoment this game. An amazing concoction of of 8Bit beat 'em ups and open world exploration. What initially seemed a close and simple clicky clicky game soon opened up to be an amazingly well thought out game with a great range of weapons, vehicles and a variety of things to do. Follow the main quest, or just go and goomba stop people while driving around shooting your rocket launcher and throwing baseball bats at people. Oh and don't forget the time travel. That's a lovely element of the game.  With a mix of awesome pop culture references, hilarious dialougue, and an overall aura of brilliance to the game, Retro City Rampage is a great game for a great price, Definately would reccomend it, already played for a lot of hours :D ~Savva
2869	1	a	This is one of the best games I've ever played!
2871	1	a	It's like a 16-bit Grand Theft Auto! Also includes a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ of game references.
2873	1	a	Really fun game! If you have the money get it!
2875	1	a	A one-man effort that manages to cram more into its 30Mb install than most games have in four sequels.    Retro-styled, anyone who ever played on the older consoles and machines will immediately recognise references to several series and games from those eras. Outside of that, it's a fun walk-around/drive-around game like the original GTA, with plenty of missions, side-missions, hidden bits and roaming to keep you happy.    And even in free-roaming mode, it's a good five-minute blast while you're waiting for other things.
2877	1	a	Possibly the most weird yet funny game ever. i love it.
2879	1	a	It takes work to re-create an already amazing game (or so I've heard, never played GTA III) in certain restrictions lower than the original product. Brian Provinciano (I think that's his name) did it. And did it well.  Retro City Rampage is hilarious, action packed, and above all, fun to play. I haven't played too many sandbox games other than Minecraft, but I easily jumped into this game with few problems. It's everything the first two GTA games were, and plenty more. Decent sized map, full of secrets and multiple characters to play as in free-roam mode, including Super Meat Boy and Commander Video. Even though I've heard people say that the game lacks it's own ideas, and that is sort of true. The game is a massive parody of tons of stuff from the 80s and 90s. Featuring Back to the Future, Metal Gear Solid, Contra, Duck Hunt, and many, MANY more.  The stroy is very confusing at first, which is a down side, but once you get into it... at the least hilarious and kinda creative. The levels themselves are usually fair and difficult. However, that being said, due to the awkward controls (believe me, you'll know what I mean if you buy the game or already own it) and the level design itself can be downright ridiculous, the levels aren't always fun.  Overall, the game is fun, hilarious, and at some points creative. 8/10
2881	1	a	this game is like an 8-bit gta, but it has classic references that will want u to play more
2883	1	a	Grand Theft Auto meets the 1980s - great 8-bit graphics, great 8-bit tunes, awesome top-down gameplay with the familiar free-roam mode and missions that GTA has - plus so many nostalgia 80s you'll have to pull the cartridge out and blow on it.
1609	0	a	This game is terrible.  I'm a kid who grew up in the 80s playing 8 bit games, but this game is just a constant parody of the genre with no actual game. You are constantly watching cinematics in 8 bit style that try to showcase how clever the developer's jokes are when making reference to old games. I mistakenly thought this game might actually have a story, but the game exists as an excuse for the developer to sit us through his sense of humor.
2885	1	a	When it comes to GTA clones, this game has got to be the most outrageously hilarious one I've ever played, even moreso than with Saints Row The Third and that's really saying something from someone who has played a load of open-world sandbox types of games, but this one conveys the retro feel to a T. The story isn't exactly anything to write home about, but that's easily forgiven with how 'mature' this game is. From potshots at gaming companies, cameos out the whazoo from game devs and gaming icons alike, lookalike and soundalike references from games of the past and mixed in with a lot of tongue-in-cheek wisecracks that are designed to get you to bust a gut out laughing, there is absolutely no reason as to why this title should not be in your collection.
2887	1	a	I've played this game on various ports, and the Steam version has to be my favorite by far. This is a fantastic game, but for some reason I can't play it for long periods of time, or I'll lose my mind from boredem. I don't exactly know why I feel that why, but hey, just a warning! Absolutely worth the $10!
2889	1	a	Crazy as hell! A must have! ;)
2891	1	a	Playing like an old school 2D version of Grand Theft Auto this retro themed title is also chocked full of references and parodies to classic video games and 80â€™s pop culture. In it you play as a lawbreaker known only as The Player who is working his way up to the top of the criminal empire.
2893	1	a	Not bad, but not great by any stretch. A typical entry into the retro rebake catagory of games. Might keep you engaged for a few hours, but the tiny map and constant references to old school games gets tiresome quickly. 6/10.
2895	1	a	funny and fun. a lot of refrences. i love it!
2897	1	a	the what if the original GTA came out a decade earlier with mechanics of thast era implemented but with with the zeitgeist of today with popculturall references and hard on retro humour.
2899	1	a	tns of humor and alot more fun then i was expecting this game is a awsome throwback with tons of features if ya grew up with a NES get this game
2901	1	a	Really enjoyable 8 bit parody game, nothing else to say just try it, you wont regret it
2903	1	a	Awesome!!!! And it has trading cards,win of the week!
2905	1	a	If you dont own this game and love retro 8 bit style games this is a must have!!! Hours of fun and laughs
2907	1	a	Dis is a zombie game where you kiss dogs and cats and have kitty kat sswafferer???
2909	1	a	It's 0.99 cents as I write this.  BUY IT RIGHT NOW.
2911	1	a	My only regret is not seeing this title before it went on sale. Got it for $0.99 and would have totally paid full for it. The parodies alone make this game very enjoyable. A real shame that games like this go under the radar for so long.
2913	1	a	must have, you can grab it for a dollar
2915	1	a	Great game for anyone who has grown up with a Nintendo.. TONS of retro references.. Very fun casual game :)
2917	1	a	So many references and random plotlines that it starts to not really matter what's going on anymore. All that's important is that you can run people over with your little pixelated car. Worth it just for that, I'd say.
2919	1	a	OH MY GOD!!! THAT IS BIGGEST MOMENT GAME! HAHAHAH!
2921	1	a	This game. Sweet graphics, tight controls, framerate, and referances galore. This game can get you engrossed in the story or you can just screw around in Free Roam Mode. And I got it for a dollar so honestly it couldn't go wrong. But now that I have played it I can say it is worth the ten bucks, and with the competetive market probably twenty. Really amazing.
2923	1	a	This Game is just as AWESOME as it looks. worth the buy!
2925	1	a	very fun i recomend this game to anybody who wants to have fun
2927	1	a	It has Trailer Park Boys Refrences, and more than a few. Enough said.
2929	1	a	Great little game, well worth a look, and well worth the money. (69p!)
2931	1	a	This is a surprisingly fun and funny game. I have gotten a few hours of gameplay from it so far and I'm not even half way done. It kind of plays like the old GTA games, but it's a lot more fun. I got it for $.99 and it was more than worth it. You should buy this game even if at full price. 9/10
2933	1	a	If you grew up on the Nintendo, Retro City Rampage is a must. It has many, many references that will make you smile, and the game itself is an enjoyable experience. I highly recommend this game.
2935	1	a	Combining GTA/Saint's Row like gameplay with 8-bit graphics and gaming nostalgia, Retro City Rampage will take you back to the days of simple NES games making you wish you had a game like this. This is one of the best nostalgia trips anyone can take.
2937	1	a	This game is great. It's like classic gta inside an NES city, Theftropolis. It has plenty of NES/80's pop culture references which I enjoyed a lot, along with other classic game references and even some modern game references as well. I got the game on a great deal for $0.99 but I say it's worth it for $10. If you are a fan of old school gaming you should check Retro City Rampage out for sure.
2939	1	a	For 69p, this game is more than a fair price. I can think of a few things I can purchase for 69p, take chewing gum for example. Maybe a day of satisfying chewing. On that front, this game should provide at least a day of entertainment. It does just that, it's 69p, buy it!
2941	1	a	You grow up with the NES? This game will remind you how great of a console it was. As well as remind you what a piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing dog â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ some of the games were. Holy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing ball-sacks, it's only fair that I play this game after watching AVGN because I can point out things that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ the living â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out of me (and probably you too) much easier than just from memory alone. And mega â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, can this game be hard.  Also this game is full of epileptic lights and has some of the most nauseating screen rippling I have ever seen in a video game. This is the first game I have ever played that made me have to quit so I could go lie down and not vomit.  I'd recommend this game to everyone who wants a nostalgia trip. Or to people who want a stupid fun barrage of different ways to kill the living â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out of pixelated pedestrians. But beyond that, this game doesn't have too much substance post references and cameos (John Romero is in this game, and he gives you the Konami Code). Controls are pretty good and the game-play is solid, also the music is really nice, just this game will more than likely make you angry at one point or another. Just like the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing NES.  Protip 1: Borrow a bus, run into every pedestrian you can (They need help sleeping, the town has an insomnia epidemic), then get the threat meter to red. Then steal every tank and park them in the Pay 4 Spray.  Protip 2: Enable blood with this 'innocent' cheat (it doesn't disable achievements or saving); A B A Y A B B / X O X Tri X O O (360/PS controller) or just Jump Grab Jump Use Jump Grab Grab
2943	1	a	it needs to be cheaper
2945	1	a	References the game
2947	1	a	A very, very fun game. The references are corny and hilarious as hell, the gameplay is fast paced and fun, and the soundtrack is great. I would definitely recommend picking this one up if you're a fan of open-world games, or 8-bit games in general.
2949	1	a	Think GTA if it were on the NES. Worth it!
2951	1	a	This game is a definate treat! It's like multiflavored nostalgia! Just enough of each flavor to remember why you loved it (and why you are glad it is gone.)
1610	0	a	I haven't played this game much, so my opinion might not be as valid as those who have invested more time, but there is a reason that I haven't played much; there is nothing about the gameplay that grabs me. The 8-bit artstyle is very cool, and there is the occassional bit of good humour in the game, but it's mostly just driving around pointlessly running over people.  So far it has not been worth the 99 cents I paid for it.
2953	1	a	Fun Game, lots of things to do! Great when you are looking for casual entertainement!
2955	1	a	Hilarious, fun, well-made game with awesome presentation. Hard to find a game that's a whole lot of fun while still having a great sense of humor. This one is it - if you're the time that digs the old 8/16-bit in-jokes (and a lot of movie references), as well as some fun pixelated game time, this is for you.
2957	1	a	A great game! I love all the old gaming references it has. If you can't afford GTA, you should buy this.  I give it a Pixelated Pistol/10
2959	1	a	Killed Shaggy and Hi Jacked K.I.T.T 10/10 
2961	1	a	What can i say, it's an extended version of the extended version of GTA combined with pixelart and a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ of twists and funny references.  i've never saw anything like it  - - - yes you can free run in that game as you would in GTA but with more style and things you can do - - -
2963	1	a	$1 dollar special, worth it for the jukebox alone.
2965	1	a	This game is epic because it pretty much allows you to do anything you want in a massive 8 bit world , the only problem i have is that the police do not stop eventually once they have arrived, well at least not in the current half an hour i have played it for 
2967	1	a	Feels like one of the original GTA games, just more retro and colorful. Worth the 1$ it was on sale for!
2969	1	a	Pretty amusing game, i'm quite enjoying it. Music can be a little annoying thou,
2971	1	a	Wow, They straight up lied to my face. There is only about 30 or 20 missions and 5 side missions and they said 60+ story missions! But because that is not important what IS important is the fact that this is a great game all together. Honestly this game is about 40 or 20 hours of gamplay. (Depending on your skill level) And about 30 or 10 of those hours are actually worth it. Like really! Half of the enemys and levels are tedious and boring. (SPOILERS AHEAD) Like, one of the enemys is immune to every single weapon you have and oneshots you. You have to make sure you pick up one of the strongest blast weapons to ensure you can defeat him. And then at the end of the game they put 120 (and respawning) of those enemys. Lucky I wasn't using a controller.           Good things about Retro City Rampage: The game serves hours of replay value and has way too many secrets. But FINDING those secrets is amazing. Like using that one gigantes car and finding it again later in the game to beat that guy in the race. Or unlocking the minecraft secret by finding the pipe. And those (Easy) boss battles. Okay bye.
2973	1	a	a homage of the legendary 8 bit times...... a mixture of many arcade games packed in a open world for instant action.... Art or Trash, you have to decide....   (on steam sale for less than 1 â‚¬/$ - probably,you do nothing wrong)
2975	1	a	You'll basically be thrown to death with references (seriously, there's way way more than what's healthy for a person or game), but the plot is crazy and the gameplay is kickin'. Recommending, provided you get it during a sale.
2977	1	a	I would pay what a new release game for ps4 to have the game for the NES. Awesome game. I like all of the Vancouver references. Seeing as im from Vancouver. 10/10
2979	1	a	definitely brought back nostalgia! 80's and 90's taking it back in this one!
2981	1	a	You can play the game in your dream. 11/10
2983	1	a	This game is awsome, it's the perfect mix of GTA and old fashioned 8bit graphics. I could play this game for ever nice job Vblank, you made an awsome game and one to be proud of.
2985	1	a	Retro City Rampage is set in an old-school town, where you play as a person named ''Player'', who accidentally sent himself to the future, where he sees what has happened to the town now named ''Theftropolis'' after his rampaging. There is a lot to say about this game, it is mostly funny references, the protagonist's name being ''Player'' is a dead giveaway that this game is focused on comedy. It has no bugs that I have seen or heard from. There are some problems, for example, if you move too fast, you might get motion sick. It also has a scoring system, this makes the game far more addicting, I keep coming back to play the game, so I can built up my score. This game also reminds me of Grand Theft Auto 1 and 2, because it views the player from the top, it has a scoring system and the tendency to drive on sidewalks and run over people. My rating: 9/10
2987	1	a	I picked this up for 90 cents. This was an AMAZING deal, I really love how this game plays. Lot of humor, although if you are not born in the 90s (good) or 80s (better) you won't get most of the references. The only thing it really misses is Multiplayer Death Match mode. Other than that, recommended play!
2989	1	a	Its like Grand Theft Auto...only pixelated and epic!!!!!
2991	1	a	Hell yeah. I had this game on the Vita before Steam. It's every bit as fun as the Vita version. Shoot doods, do things, nostalgia stuff. It's all there. Worth every penny.
2993	1	a	WoaaahahwAW?! That's what this game will do to your mind. At least if you're an 80s-90s gamer of any age. The sheer amount of nostalgia will make your head explode, recompile, then explode again. Every mission is an adventure through time to the age of hardcore gameplay, simple (yet stylized) graphics, and amazing chiptune music.  I'd try to list all the references, but I think my fingers would ignite from the effort. If you know what NES-era gaming was like, and have fond memories (even of the awful bits, like the Ninja Turtles game, especially the dam level), you will absolutely f**kin' LOVE this game. Period.  The general gameplay recipe is this: take a decent dose of GTA, mix in some Saints Row shenanigans, add a hefty plethora of NES-era stuff (both references and gameplay... and graphics and sounds and...), as well as a generous portion of modernization in terms of controls and smoothness, and bam... you've got Retro City Rampage. Every single part of it is immensely enjoyable and relatable, while still being fresh enough to keep even the most ADHD-riddled brains occupied.  To top it all of the developer even added a truly 8-bit version (playable *within* the game itself)... so much so that the extracted version will work just fine on an NES emulator!!! Just take a moment to think: this (or at least a *version* of this) was possible back in the 80s. This kind of gameplay and variety and just general awesomeness... it was all possible. My god... what have we been missing?!  Look, this game is amazing. Hands down, flat out... amazing. From start to finish you won't be bored and, if anything, you'll just be craving finding the rest of the secrets and references. Get it NOW if you grew up playing NES-era games, and if not? Well... you'll enjoy it just the same (though I can't say you'll get the same sense of nostalgia that the rest of us will).  The dev is basically a one-man show (who I have spoken with personally and is a truly kickass dude), has supported practically every platform out there (and for the rest is working diligently on it), and is ABSOLUTELY someone you should follow for future releases. Zero complaints, nothing but praise... not much more to say!
2995	1	a	Cool, fun, confussing. IDK
2997	1	a	Better than GTA V. Do I smell butthurt? DEAL WITH IT.  GTA5's humor is not crafted like this game. From obvious references to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Contra to the more subtle and obscure Wayne's World and Apple 2 references. And the gameplay is basically GTA1+. So if you don't like that you won't like this unless you love parody games. I like this game alot! Slightly overpriced though, so get it on a deal at some point.
2999	1	a	Hilarious game that brings you back to the old days with loads of nostalgic references!
3001	1	a	A genre of it's own. I'd say about a 8/10
3003	1	a	Hilarious fun in brief spurts. It's the perfect game to play if you've got ten minutes to kill.
3005	1	a	hell yeah! im having lot of fun playing this game.
3007	1	a	Think of your childhood memories, nostalgic sensation am i right? Now imagine you could go back, and revive that sensation again but this time with awesome references, even better charisma, great soundtrack, stereotyped world, a lot of fun and of course a lot of replayability value.  search no more, here it is folks the perfect time machine: Retro City Rampage
3009	1	a	This is the greatest GTA game of All Time.
3011	1	a	It's okay for the first few hours or so. Then the references get stale, the gameplay gets tiresome, the missions become unnecessarily difficult, and then like halfway into the game they start to get to long spiel about game publishers and ESRB boards. It just gets boring.
3013	1	a	An excelent retro arcade GTA-style shooter, with numerous hilarious old-school references!
3015	1	a	Fun, yet simple crime game with a lot of pop-culture references. It's nothing great as far as game mechanics or graphics but creating chaos is fun and it's humorous.
3017	1	a	A Parody game that has that great 80s video game feel to it! Lots a great and funny video game/ movie references that make it just as good. =)
3019	1	a	Retro City Rampage explores the character of 'Player' as he goes on criminal rampages with few if any consequences.   If you had played Grand Theft Auto 1 or 2, you'll understand the mechanics right away. And even if not? Still not hard to figure out.   Although for the most part it's not especially challenging, some of the minigames can be pretty difficult.    Completely absurd in a wonderful way.
3021	1	a	8-bit gta with stuff from the 80's how could you not buy this
3023	1	a	Fantastic if you are a NERD. NEEERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDS
3025	1	a	i love it they should make more games like this  
3027	1	a	best game i have ever played reminds me of Gta1 and gta 2 with lots of references to 80s and 90s games love the TMNT and mega man refrences
3029	1	a	Fun retro stlye game. Makes alot of great video game referances.
3031	1	a	8-bit spoof supreme. Retro city rampage is a spoof of several games and movies and will throw you for a thrill ride. The easiest comparison to this game is 8-bit grandtheft auto/saints row chaos. You will classicly only have your 3 hearts as lives inwhich you'll need to find more throughout your world as you do whatever the hell you want.  This game is packed with random missions and mini-games for the player to do alongside the random main storyline of the player. Long story short, you're in a pixel world and your a ganster... GOOMBA STOMP. yes, they allow you to goomba stomp. Ontop of goomba stomping you have a large arsinal of weapons at your disposal that you will pick up between smg's pistols, cricket bats, baseball bats, crowbars and stealing peoples cars to run over masses of people.  Overview: Pros: The randomness and silly chaos of this game is exciting and never gets boring along with the dozens of chaos filled mini-games scattered about such as USE THIS TANK AND BLOW UP THINGS TO GET POINTS or use a smg to shoot as many things to get points ect. Its a relatively silly game and has spoofs that people will instantly know when they come up such as back to the future and mario's goomba stomp.  Cons: The only cons about this game that may bother someone is if you do not save frequently - this is a retro game you will lose all your things even if you have hearts remaining. This may frustrate some people as they lose their mass arsinal of weaons.  Final thoughts: when this game is on sale for a few bucks I would highly reccomend picking it up if you're into 8-bit chaos. The graphics reminds me a little of terraria and its alot of fun to casually play every so often. All and all, it was worth the $4 I spent on it and even possibly its full price.
3033	1	a	GTA in 8-bit Absolutely fantastic game If you grew up with arcades, console and movies of the 80s and 90s then you'll love this game
3035	1	a	its that game that dident copied another game and didnt put all kinda of stupid reference to things in it so that the guys get mad on the ineternets.
3037	1	a	RADICAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUUL!!!!! car stealing action + unlockabe charictars + no blood + retro style + back to the future + free roaming + guns and weapons = RETRO CITY RAMPAGE buy it NOW!!!
3039	1	a	Very adictive and original game with many easter eggs and references to movies and videogames.
3041	1	a	If you have played a lot of NES, or grew up with 80's references, this game is a great purchase. It probably has 10+ hours of game play from the main story, and after that you should have everything unlocked to mess around with in the open world map.
3043	1	a	Imagine GTA for SNES... there you got yourself Retro City Rampage. 10/10
3045	1	a	For the people waiting 3 years for this game to release its FINALLY Here. The game is awesome. every portion is detailed in awesome 8-bit style. Music is beyond everything I could have ever dreamed of. Gameplay is spot on 100% tight controls. The game is SUPER long. And just running over people to earn cash is so awesome. But watch out for the cops. And dont forget 'The Truck Have started moving again.' Yes all the Metal Gear NES quotes Contra Bill &amp; Ted Duck Hunt and more references are IN THIS GAME. Buy it.. Why are you sitting here still? BUY THE GAME NOW D:
3047	1	a	Definetly recommend to anyone who is a fan of 80's culture and 8 bit video games. I don't think I have managed to catch all the jokes yet. RCR shows how fun can it be to just run around and blow things up. I must warn though that there is pretty significant difficulty spike around the last half of the game. My other gripe is how you lose all your weapons when you die. Other than that anyone who loves parody games will certainly love this 8/10
3049	1	a	Retro City Rampage flops between excellently recreating the challenging and frustrating gameplay of a bygone era of videogames, and falling into the trap of sloppy, overused jokes ranging from stale internet memes and tired 80s references. The last portion of the game is great fun, and it's a shame the rest of the game is quite different from it. The approach to design seems to be to insert as much content as possible with no sense of an overall idea or quality, meaning the game shines when it gets a level or concept right, but feels boring and repetitive when it misses the mark. The usual 'indie game' circlejerking with cameos from Phil Fish, Minecraft, Super Meat Boy, Destructoid and others also irks me, just because I really don't like the culture that has sprung up around indie games. Overall, though, it's still got a lot of bang for your buck, with plenty of extra game modes and challenges to take on once you've done the rather short story mode, and all kinds of collectables and customisation.
3051	1	a	100% Retro Goodness!
3053	1	a	This game is a lot like the good old GTA 1 and 2, only with NES-like graphics and music. It also turns into Contra, Super Mario and so on at times, not to mention the minigames you can play in the arcades ingame. Nostalgic, fun and arcade at its finest.  The controls are well thought as well, you can move around with the arrow keys and fire in different directions with WASD and even lock on targets. Driving is also well made but it can get a bit dodgy at times for the sake of retroness. There's also a cover system in game which really surprised me, you can take cover almost anywhere, and then pop out and fire, and get back into cover.  An awesome retro game, only lacking some multiplayer. Great scott! BUY IT NOW!!
3055	1	a	I game that reminds me the 90s I spend playing on various entertainment system :] If you don't smile at any screenshot/trailer/game hub image, then the game is not for you... at the opposite, you'll be delighted!
3057	1	a	This quirky game is entertaining. It has seemingly endless references to other games, movies, and TV. Charming, but not mind-blowing.
3059	1	a	I spent 2 hours playing this 8bit fun.... its soo fun my brain has melted and i am writing the last words i can.. Herp... De..Derp... De Very Goods game. 9/10  Oh BTW i managed to get rank one on the running thing....sweet.
3061	1	a	It's hard to tell what the key word in 'Retro City Rampage' is, but it's probably not 'City.' It's definitely retro as hell; in fact, it lets you choose your preferred flavor of retro by choosing from several old TV-tube-style screen frames and an impressive number of old color pallettes, including Game Boy and ancient green-screen styles. Game structure follows GTA format in a top-down perspective. Soundtrack is 8-bit excellence and features some beloved 8-bit composers like Virt. 80's and 90's pop culture references deliberately run absolutely rampant, and are actually done quite well for referential humor -- the whole game is pretty darn funny, in fact. Gameplay itself works pretty well and is satisfying. My biggest complaint is that some of the missions are real jerks which almost seem to be deliberately recalling the worst and most annoying GTA missions. If that's the worst I can say about it, though, this game is well done and hells of fun.
3063	1	a	Ok.. If you have these qualifiers.. GET THIS GAME!!  1. You grew up with an Atari video game system. 2. You know what Load '*',8,1 is. 3. You are a geek.  The game is FULL of references that will make you smile. If you grew up in the 2000's, then pass up this game. You won't get it.
3065	1	a	WTF IS ? By totalbiscuit on this game ;  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJUmhC79Yro   Should be enough to see if you should buy this game or not (ps : you should it's awesome)
3067	1	a	Awesome game. The free roaming is like GTA 1 but all the campaign missions throw you in various other games, like excitebike or paperboy. Filled with awesome references from movies and games from the 80's and 90's. Some parts are pretty tough.
3069	1	a	Probably the best GTA clone I've played. Hilarious dialogue, fast paced arcade style gameplay, polished 8-bit soundtrack and graphics. I don't think I could ask for much more from this game.
3071	1	a	I wholly recommend this game to everyone. The game has a gorgeous retro-appeal and it's chock-full of funny jokes and references to gaming and 80s pop culture. The best feature of the game are the dozens of different vehicles, weapons and powerups you get to use, most of which are pretty out there. You can drive the car from Back to the Future, wield a sword and shield and fling yourself in the air by farting. All of these can be used to wreak delicious havoc on the city streets.  RCR also offers a lot of bang for your buck. Aside from about 50 story missions, there's two dozen rampages (wreak havoc in a certain way), you can replay some of the sections from the missions for highscores, dozens of skins, multiple color palettes (make it look like a NES or a C64 game), you can play the original version of the game made for the NES and play mods that change the look of the game.  The game is (or was) not entirely without its faults though. While some of the story missions were great fun with a lot of variety, some were also a bit tedious or frustratingly hard. The developer has done a great job dealing addressing those issues though, issuing a few patches that made the frustratring levels more accessible. These imperfections don't ruin the game though.  In the end, the good stuff far outweighs the bad stuff. Take a look at the trailer and if you like what you see, then you won't be disappointed with how the game turns out. 
3073	1	a	Will give a full review later... but in the first 5 minutes I killed Rambo, all 4 of the ninja turtles, robbed a bank for the joker, carjacked Dr. Who, wiped out the A-Team, and convinced Doc Brown that I was a hero, and had him help me tow the wreckage of the the tardis.
3075	1	a	One of the best de-makes ever in my opinion. Nothing ground breaking. But it's a REALLY well made game for what it is. Plenty to do and unlock, pretty addicting gameplay. The near endless refrences to old school games will give you chuckles the entire time. Not just games, Movies, toys, events all from the 80's 90's. I would say a must have for anyone over the age of 20, you'll get plenty of nostalgic laughs and a solid little GTA clone to boot@ :-)
3077	1	a	80s references, the game! I liked it better when it was Grand Theftendo.
3079	1	a	dumb just dumb it does not have 2 brain cells to rube together but I tell you what it is a hell lot of fun I mean the first leavle has the hiest from the dark knight a froger mini game and the first boss is the teen age mutant ninja turtals using janitor equipment how on earth can you not love a game like this. it is so stubid it comes of suddlely ironic if you spell suddel like this     SUDDLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3081	1	a	Outstanding little game, feels like the original GTAs but it's so much more. I personally like looking out for all the little nods to to other games/movies.
3083	1	a	This game is fun!! :D
3085	1	a	if you liked nes, back to the future, 8 bit games or are nostalgic for the 80's in any way buy this game. i got it on sale a few months ago and put it aside just so i could really get into the story when i have time. i saw elements of gta, frogger super mario, apb, i could go on and on. lots of arcade challenges. definitely a winner.
3087	1	a	There was a lot more story to this game than I expected, somehow? Fun!
3089	1	a	i wish i could make love to this game, thats how great it is
3091	1	a	Retro overload!
3093	1	a	i love this game i was lucky to get it for 1 dollar from sales and thank gosh they have copyrighted all of this cuase this game is like gta but with refrenses fro 1980s to the 2012s i reccomend the free roam and make some heat and its a on swearing game. so parents can buy it for kids that are like 10.. its still fun and i highly reccomend people playing it its cheap its good has a decent campain and a lot of other things....... i really reccomend it
3095	1	a	A very addicting simple GTA style game that has hints of Mario, THUG 2 and crazy taxi all bundled into one. A steal for the price it is!
3097	1	a	great game its gta 3 NES version!
3099	1	a	pretty damn fun. worth the price, and is often hilarious.
3101	1	a	Refrences. So many refrences.
3103	1	a	I love it so simple but so fun
3105	1	a	'It's like an 8-Bit Grand Theft Auto!' That is what I'm sure you've heard before, and are probably expecting me to say -- and you're right! And guess what? It's just as awesome as it sounds! Only... it's so much more than that, even!  This game parodies just about anything and everything from the 80s and 90s: from video games, tv shows, movies -- I'm talking everything from TMNT, Metal Gear, Mario, Back to the Future, Duck Hunt, River City Ransom, The Three Stooges, Die Hard, Skate or Die -- and even freaking Saved By The Bell! And these are merely the things I can remember from the last couple of times I've played! Plus, the first couple of Story Missions are so jam-packed with references that I'm almost positive I've missed a few.  This entire game was made completely by one guy (save for the AMAZING 8-bit soundtrack, by various artists), and it took FOREVER to release, but it's finally out, and worth the price of admission.
3107	1	a	Before buying this, make sure you are born before 1990 and you actually possessed a Nintendo Entertainment System: in this case, you will see this game as a funny 8 bit GTA with a ultra-nostalgic flavour, with a nice replayability and rockin' chiptune music. Else, this will be a quite boring and dull game with no significant meaning.
3109	1	a	A great game with a classic feel. Very funny and original.
3111	1	a	If you have an xbox controller or PS3 controller Using a wireless reciver than your set controll wise game wise insanely fun reminds me of super nintendo while im writting this it's on sale for 2.50 (us dollar) 89/10 Get it
3113	1	a	Pick this up on a sale, it's pretty damn fun, the story is addicting.
3115	1	a	References everywhere. This game is really NEAT.
3117	1	a	This game is truly harharharlarious. It's a mish-mash story stocked full of references to all things retro and nerdy. Great gameplay and hilarious dialogue.
3119	1	a	This game is great. Looks like an old NES game and has paradys and cliches from 80's culture.
3121	1	a	I posted about it but it bears repeating--this game is a love letter to the days of classic NES days. Part GTA, with splashes of classic NES gameplay (SMB, Metal Slug, Ridge Racer) and Indie Games (Beat.Trip, Meat Boy). It is easily the best time I've had gaming in some time, can be played in short bursts, and is HARD like games used to be.
3123	1	a	This game is pretty damn fun, reminds me of old school GTA meets Back To The Future for sure!
3125	1	a	Very fun and great soundtrack
3127	1	a	I will keep this short: if you combined GTA with everything from the 80s and 90s, you get this game. I may have only racked up about 8 hours on this at the time of this review, but I have quite a few hours on the 3DS version (I have so few on PC becuase my Afterglow 360 controller doesn't agree with RCR). It's a fun game I reccomend to people who like open-world games and/or retro stuff in general.
3129	1	a	Sometimes the missions seem too easy or repetitive. Itâ€™s a game that youâ€™ve already played before. If youâ€™ve played any GTA game especially GTA 1 or 2, Retro City Rampage doesnâ€™t bring anything new to the theory. Sure itâ€™s nice to see a GTA style game in 8-bit and all of the references to other popular things from decades past, the gameplay and story at times has no substance. Youâ€™re going to either love it or hate it. Iâ€™ve always felt this way with GTA games. There are parts in the games that I absolutely love and missions I can play over and over again. With the ability to finish a mission multiple ways and the vast amount of options available doesnâ€™t over shadow the fact that missions are the same. If you love the GTA series you will love this game. If youâ€™re like me, you are looking for something different that Retro City Rampage doesnâ€™t provide.   http://iamericm.com/2013/04/retro-city-rampage-indie-game-review-2/ 
3131	1	a	This game is amazing with the references, jokes, secrets, for anyone who likes jokes after jokes and references everywhere, this is for you.
3133	1	a	this is what i day dream about in school. they just put it in a game. and gave me a sesier because the graphics look like the porygon episode of pokemon that gave japanese kids a severe case of the break dancing jams.you know? anyway just buy it
3135	1	a	You say: Why?  To that I say: How could you not?  
3137	1	a	ITS PIXELATED GTA!  Pros: Open-world, you get to blow stuff up. You can kill the popo. Also, alot like GTA with pixels.  Cons: Once you've played a few hours of it, it gets a little less fun.
3139	1	a	You owe it to yourselves to play this. If you are a child of the 80s and 90s this is a must-buy.
3141	1	a	Retro city rampage DX is a game that has a lot of refrences to movies and other videogames  the humor will crack you up  9/10 needs sequel
3143	1	a	What the hell? Bwahahahaha 10/10 great references, very funny and the gameplay is great as well. Those easter eggs and all the ideas *___* (I swear, I will never ever use that smiley again).
3145	1	a	10/10 so many retro game/movie references  (retro as in before 2000s)
3147	1	a	Within 2 hours of playing this game I have run around in a Luigi hat beating people up with a mop, infiltrated a military base and fought Bionic Commando to fix my time machine, and stolen Donkey Kong from a harbor, plowing through oncoming traffic like nothing.  Best 3 dollars I ever spent (I got it on sale)
3149	1	a	Probalby one of the best games on Steam but it would be so amazingly awesome if you added multiplayer!
3151	1	a	Absolutely mental. Nostalgic as hell but with a modern twist. So many glorious 8-Bit options too. Highly recommended... Best Â£2 I've ever spent.
3153	1	a	Imagine an 8-bit Grand Theft Auto clone and you've got Retro City Rampage pretty much thought out. If you took a GTA protagonist and had them take a Forrest Gump-style tour through 80s videogames and cinema, the result would be exactly what you get here: A lot of thievery, swearing, ultra-violence, explosions and generally just a complete mess. But hey, you get the high score. The odd thing about RCR is that it's generally more fun then any of the games that inspired it, and manages to be much more forgiving in difficulty besides. Accompanying its relentlessly entertaining and reference-laden campaign is a series of bonus levels, including rampages that test just how well you can do what a GTA player does best- tear â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ up. There's also plenty of unlockables, including a number of extra playable characters, a huge variety of weapons and vehicles, and that chiptuny goodness you expect from one of these retraux titles. If you like virtually ANYTHING from the last, like, 35 years of nerdery, you're likely to find something in Retro City Rampage that makes you smile. I know I did.
3155	1	a	Great!
3157	1	a	Just... Amazing. Awesome gameplay, funny references, radicool music. You even get a bundled DOS version for free so you can play on your old pc from back in the day! :)  10/10 would buy again   
3159	1	a	This is so much fun! It feels like GTA 2 with so much comedy
3161	1	a	This is a really good retro game with references galore
3163	1	a	Surprisingly addictive &amp; extremely entertaining... I love all of the classic game refrences!
3165	1	a	If your 35 like me you will love this game. It reminds of the old games in the day and this game actually is better than those games. Look and feel of the NES times, game play like a modern game.
3167	1	a	I've given up hours to this game, and rightfully so. The interesting Plot, the cool characters and the amazing graphics and sound all pile up to make this game work splendidly for the pc and doesn't deserve to be on any other system. i have one major, MAJOR flaw though, and that's how short it is. please make a sequel. Also the ending is awful  IGN 10/10/ OUT OF TEN
1612	0	a	this game was just not my cup of tea I liked the refrences to classic games and movies but I just felt it was trying to hard to be awesome.
3169	1	a	Like this.   9/10
3171	1	a	amazing game highly recommend this game if you are into retro gaming
3173	1	a	very fun game retro look with a modern spin and a dash of humor!
3175	1	a	I love this game.It's just awesome,but there's one thing...This game needs..MULTIPLAYER! Thinks about it,It would be awesome do mayhems,races or just freeroam in 2 or more players VBlank,think about it.Do although something like in 'How To Survive'-Possibility to connect on a small,private server.  Even without MP this game is awesome ;) Good work Btw. Where I can get tool for custom vehicles and characters?
3177	1	a	This game is super fun and reminds me of gta 2 alot
3179	1	a	Like Broforce and GTA: Chinatown had a kickass baby. 10 out of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing 10.
3181	1	a	I know it says only 1.3 hours on record. I can assure you I've played this game on different platforms, rest assured the experience on other platforms remains the same.  Pros + Good old school style gameplay + Excellent Soundtrack + Lots off funny moments + Tons of retro easter eggs including the cardboard box trick. + Surprising number of options given its art style. + Excellent Controller support allowing you to remap everything to suit your play style.  Cons + Difficult missions  The game is pretty well made, anyone who has grown up in the late 80's and early 90's will love this game. There's a lot to enjoy here, and its well polished. I haven't seen a single bug or glitch in the game which is rare these days. The only real set back is the difficulty of the game, it tends to spike quite early in the game, I'd have liked to see different difficulty options included.  After all this I highly recommend the game and the price isn't too bad either, but obviously expect it to come down in the sales.
3183	1	a	I've always had a distaste for modern graphics and wished that developers would focus on putting 'more' into classic-type genres than they do into crafting realistic-looking visuals. This game is exactly the type of thing I've always wanted. It's a retro-style game with a fantastic sense of style, a fast and fluid gameplay dynamic, and just 'more' of what made the old days of gaming so great.
3185	1	a	An awesome blend of GTA and 8 bit nostalgia fun. Ive never played the 2D GTAs and this was very fun. Always changing mission type kept gaeplay fresh throughout. Very fun. 8/10
3187	1	a	This Game Is Awesome! Retro City Rampage Is The Best Game Ever!
3189	1	a	This game is excellent and I recommend it for any retro-gaming fan and old school gamer alike! I originally played this game (the DX version) on the Nintendo 3DS, and then when I joined Steam, I purchased Retro City Rampage DX for the PC. And I have got to say that this is definitely a well-done and proudly made game! You play the villain in the city, trying to do various entertaining deeds, while, well, destroying a bunch of buildings and running over a few 8-bit citizens on the way.  One of the biggest things that makes this game so great is that there's a bunch of cool EASTER EGGS hidden in the game as well; for example Minecraft, Super Meat Boy, and other newer series are referenced and more! And oh boy the number of pop culture references! One of the more noticeable ones is constant references to the hit 80s trilogy film series 'Back to the Future'. The game includes a story mode, where you as the main character can choose two paths, blue or orange; there's a free-roam mode where you get unlimited ammo, money, and you get to roam around the city to unlock secrets, play in the arcade, and buy weapons.  That pretty much sums up the best of Retro City Rampage DX, and honestly, if you haven't tried the game or bought it, yet, well... please do! -RetroPac ##++Retro Video Gamer &amp; Website Creator++##  http://retrogameblogger.net  Like this game? Definitely check this site out! Mario! Sonic! Pac-Man! And more!
3191	1	a	'Back to the past!' 9/10  This game could not be more appropriately titled. Rampage you say? You're damn right it is and I couldn't be more happy about it. To picture it, imagine a mashup of your favorite 8-bit video games from the 80's with some early 'Grand Theft Auto' thrown in for good measure. Which is totally awesome if you ask me, and makes for one of the best retro gaming experiences of all time; in my opinion, of course.  Playing through this game, you're sure to pick up on various themes and obvious and also obscure references to old Nintendo classics such as levels taken directly from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (that damn water level, for instance), sounds from the Mega Man series, and the track design from one of the best racing games of all time: Rad Racer, to name a few. The plot is also a mash-up of sorts as it's basically taken directly from 'Back to the Future' with sprinkles of 'Ghostbusters' and other popular 80's movies as well. Can you imagine, both 'Ghostbusters' and 'Back to the Future' in the same game? It doesn't get much better than that, folks.   Actually, now that I think more about it, this game is just one big barrage of nonstop old-school references to video games and movies from the 80's. But as I said, there's nothing wrong with a little nostalgia. And if you grew up playing games like 'Link to the Past', 'Mario Bros', or any of those fantastic early NES titles, then this game will make you feel like a kid again; in a good way. You know, like having no responsibilities other than to wipe your own butt after using the bathroom, or brushing your teeth before bed, or doing your homework the night before, or...hell, just pick this game up already. You will not be disappointed. And even if you are, what did you expect from a kid?
3193	1	a	A real old school retro top down game unlike any other sticking to 8 bit era style faithfully. Fun variety of weapons and enjoyable story mode spoofing various aspects of gaming/pop culture. Removes a lot of frustration of those games with generous checkpoints and skip able missions.   Overallâ€Š Verdict â€”â€Š Good for a nostalgic diversion for a couple hours. 
3195	1	a	This game is awsome. Refrence: Back To the Future, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle, Doctor who, Batman Dark Knight, etc. BUY IT.
3197	1	a	This is a great game that everyone should enjoy and play for themselves. So please buy this game or get it as soon as possible!
3199	1	a	if you dont have a controller, the controls suck. P.S. don't get this on a mac if your trying to mod it...
3201	1	a	I laughed,  I cried, I chased BiffMan with the power of coffee, I had fun.  10/10
1613	0	a	Retro City Rampage falls short of everything it tries to accomplish.   The 'jokes' are all just references to other charecters or games. Once in awhile you will see somthing cleaver but most of the time it comes across as annoying.   The gameplay is playable. But as a homage to the early Grand Theft Auto games it just isnt as fun as the original. The missions seem like you are just running around doing random things and running around murdering everyone and trying to run from the cops just aint what it used to be.   It isnt a terrible game there just wasnt really anything there that could hold my interest. Let alone want to make me come back for more.
3203	1	a	This game is amazing. Seriously. First of all, don't be put off by the 8-bit style. This is truly an open-world game, with great story missions AND side missions. The controls are great, and there are also several minigames ou can play if you're bored of the main missions. Since the game has old-fashioned graphics, lots of lower-end computers can handle it, and mine runs it very well, no frame rate drops. The setting itself is awesome, and I love finding the 80's and 90's references throughout the game, they really give a nice atmosphere. Honestly, no game is perfect, but this one is pretty darn fun. And that's what video games are supposed to be, fun.   8/10- An enjoyable experience.
3205	1	a	This game is like an 8-Bit version of GTA with a tiny twist. I dont wanna give anything away, so just buy the game and u will probably like it
3207	1	a	Really fun to play and I love all the secret geeky eggs that this game includes.
3209	1	a	This is basically Grand theft auto, but with 8-bit graphics. 10/10
3211	1	a	For anyone old enough to get even just half of the references, this game is a delight to play. Even if you don't I think it's still pretty funny. It will make you laugh many times over, and in a few parts maybe rage some. But a well designed parody game that's fun to play.   Side note: I only have 14 minutes logged at the moment i wrote this cause i played it in offline mode and it didn't register. So i had to play at least 5 for steam to let me review it, lol.
3213	1	a	top down retro something, gta 1 on nostalgia acid. not for everyone
3215	1	a	Nostalgia,Fun,Refrence's.  Thats What this games got ;)
1614	0	a	It's a neat concept, it really is.  you play as a street thug running around a retro-GTA inspired enviroment and be amused by 80's/early 90's gaming and pop culture references.   But I think it tries a little too hard with that concept, to the point where the game doesn't exactly feel all that fun to play. Maybe I just feel like the indie-gaming market is a little over saturated with 'old school' and 'retro' and 'pixel graphics' games, and this really shoves that in your face in spades.   Now, I could've gotten a refund but I do still felt like there was fun to be had here. And it is very clear that the devs had a real love for the game that they made and homages they were shooting for. And that's great, I support that. But as far as the game itself, I think it's just a little too much of a decent idea, leaving it feeling a little unfocused and not all that fun to physically play.
1615	0	a	Hours of fun and time spent at breaking past levels that keep you crying. Would have been better if the missions are better designed. Definitely not my type of game. Buy this only if you are interested in the Metrovania theme with retro gaming elements. The game crashes at random points despite updates that have claimed to fix.  10/10 would remove it from steam library
3217	1	a	BEST GAME EVAH MA MOM SAID I COULD NOT GAT DA REL GATA FAIV SO I BAUGHT THIS!!!1111!!!!! OMAFG ITS SO MUCAH FUUUN
3219	1	a	I just don't know why this game is so unpopular. c'mon guys, just play this game.
3221	1	a	Its fun, enough said.
3223	1	a	it's pretty good
3225	1	a	Good clean retro-style fun! Plenty of cameos and references to 80s games and movies.
3227	1	a	Great game, good 'story line', there is lots of replay value. This game has wierd controls kinda, so it is better to buy a controller for this one.
3229	1	a	Very fun, actiony and the like. Plot was a bit hard to follow, and totally irreverant, but it IS a parody.
1617	0	a	Hurts to say it considering I love everything referenced in this game but it just felt boring and forced after a while. Gets really repeptitive towards the end and the story just falls flat.
3231	1	a	This is the best NES game that never made it to 1989!
3233	1	a	Here's a simple way of describing this Fantastic Game:  o Grand Theft Auto + 'Ready Player One' by Ernest Cline + Old School Graphics  = Retro City Rampage
3235	1	a	Huh. They made the 80's into a video game? MOST EXCELLENT!!!
3237	1	a	I had no idea what i was doing for all that time... but it was fun!
3239	1	a	This game can only be reviewed with one long run on sentence. Here we go:  It's a fun no thought adhd gta/saints row makes no sense in the style of 8 bit, it's the game we all wanted in the 80's but couldn't get with one reference right after the other it much reminds me of the film kung fury in game form.
3241	1	a	This game is a great pick up right now for .99 cents. It has a better than average but not great campaign and has a great free play mode. This game reminds me of The first or second GTA. All in All this is a great game and i recommend picking it up   9/10
3243	1	a	-The TARDIS is a portajohn -So many 80s throwbacks -Free roaming -Some character customization -Minigames! -Hidden Areas -I murdered the A-Team pitilessly  TOTALLY RADICAL/10
3245	1	a	  7.5/10 TJBs
3247	1	a	It's like GTA 1, but more with modern-retro things. Gags, jokes, references, etc... It's pretty fun, though.
3249	1	a	The last stage made me wanna punch my computer. 10/10
3251	1	a	80's/90's References: The Video Game.
3253	1	a	This is what GTA should've done in the 80s.
3255	1	a	Best Game! Old Game!! .... I`m crying...
3257	1	a	The game is a good game for bad pcs. I use it for my travel pc and i have a blast playing it but i do not play it on my main pc as there are better games.
3259	1	a	If you love Old-School games then you will surely like this game. It's like If you took any grand theft auto game and NESified it. I especially like the NES references here and there In the game. It's just awesome!
3261	1	a	2D GTA with a fun plot. It'll make you nut if your into that stuff
3263	1	a	Imagine someone made GTA 2 in this day and age full of pop culture references from the 80s up to the Phil Fish Saga. That's what this game is.
1618	0	a	Genre: Racing Game   Warning:  The game has  no online multiplayer , just  local multiplayer in splitscreen.   The â€žBang bangâ€œ in the title of the game is improper chosen because you have no weapons or upgrades in this game â€“ itâ€™s a simple racing game!  Also simple is the graphicâ€¦ I had the feeling I am driving with toycars in a legoworld and the campaigns are really short. ;(  The game is maybe funny for the first minutes of playing time but this slowly driving (even with nitro boost its still slowâ€¦) in a simple graphic world and with bad AI enemies bored me really fast.  BANG BANG UNINSTALL!
3265	1	a	Bang Bang Racing is a good overhead racing game with major issues to overlook. The first issue is every time you turn your car, the chase camera swings to adjust. Its a gentle sway, but it often goes back and forth for the most minor of adjustment. It can be stomach churning, but there is always a fixed camera angle. The second issue is that an entire event can play as if its in slow motion when others are fine. Sometimes the slow motion accelerates to the smooth speed the game usually has. Even the fireworks at the end make the game slow down. I can recommend adjusting your screen resolution, but on a computer that can play ultra max settings on grander games, its just odd.  With those out of the way, I can tell you about the game itself. The game plays great with a keyboard and mouse or just a 360 controller. It plays like a lot of overhead racers, left and right to steer with a nitro boost and you have car health. If you take enough damage your car is crippled and you'll need to crawl your way to the pit lane. You can tell a damaged car by the bellowing smoke coming out of its tailpipe. Driving through the pit near the finish line will replenish your health and nitro boost, but its out of the way and its just easier to avoid completely. Like most overhead racers you can turn on a dime and there are a number of hairpin turns on each closed circuit course. These ultra sharp turns ensure that you'll need your brake or in this game's case reverse.  You compete against seven other racers in typical races and elimination rallies that eliminate whomever is in last place when the clock runs out. There are time trials where you race against the clock. Finishing in third place or higher will unlock the next track or two. The races are brief, several laps that take half a minute each depending on the track. Coming in first unlocks a few new vehicles for the current series.  Rather than showing stats for each car, it gives you a hint and a description for each one. I assume a steering wheel means that its good at handing or steering. The roll bar icon indicates that its durable and can take a beating. The nitro means that its better at nitro and what looks like either a tire or a fan could mean its exhaust is efficient? Perhaps it accelerates faster. I assume the speedometer means that it has a better top speed. Wait I have that backward, the speedometer is the car better at acceleration and the wheel is the one with the better engine.  The meat of the game is the career that has you competing in four brief stages that I'd call a series of events rather than stages. Each one has a minimum of five events that increase by two for each stage. With the exception of the first stage, these stages are punctuated with a final championship that has you racing in several races back to back as a sort of endurance event.  The aesthetic is nice and clean and the cars are stocky little cubes that represent race cars, stock cars and muscle cars in a sort of chibi caricature form. Speaking of chibi, there are no people in the game, just bouncing heads on bleachers to cheer you on. Its a look that several other overhead racers do and Bang Bang Racing is the cleanest. Each track is beautiful and full of color. Japanese cherry blossoms on some tracks, a crystal blue watery port on another. It just looks like a game I want to play.  Each track is compact and littered with things like cones, tires and barrels that will get in your way. The barrels are either full of water or tar, they'll slow your car down depending what you hit. The real obstacle is your opposition, because they all cluster together and usually jam up early turns in each race. There's no logic here, they just cram together. You can push other cars out of the way, just as you can be pushed sideways. With the cars being so stubby, its tough to turn anyone around although I have seen a few racers get stuck driving into walls.  There's good use of stand and it will scatter onto the pavement if you drive through it. This is a nice touch of detail and it seems to affect gameplay. As you progress, you'll find tracks with shortcuts which is another nice touch. One thing that was overlooked is the game's snowy winter track without icy roads. It plays like every other track.  For anyone interested, there's four player on the same game and it could make for some fun times if you have a big screen and enough friends to play it. If you're alone, you can always play against bots and even select their difficulty. You can play through all four championship endurance races, but if you're looking for a quick fix, there's free play that lets you select the mode, track, class, laps and difficulty of your opposition.  Despite its two major flaws its still a fun game and a real toss up as to if it earns a recommendation. If the game slows down this bad for me, what will it do for you? Its only on a few early races, but those early races are your first impressions of the game.
3267	1	a	One of the best mini racing games i recently played (out of Death Rally, Mini Motor Racing and others). It has better looks and physics than Mini Motor Racing for sure. And it's harder. And you play with every type of cars in every next championship, so you have to try them all. And every new type is faster, harder to handle and master. And F1 is actually the fastest type, not some stupid BUS on steroids :)
3269	1	a	Bang Bang Racing doesnâ€™t want to be just another isometric racer.  Itâ€™s design leans heavily toward that of classic arcade racing, uninterested the cartoony power ups and lightweight vehicles so pervasive in the genre, focusing its energy into crafting a very physical racing sensation even at the cost of neglecting everything else in the game.  And it definitely shows. Bang Bang Racingâ€™s core racing experience is tight and fast, with cars that carry a deliberate weight as you spin around corners, and aggressive AI that holds tight to the line between challenging and unfair. The sense of speed feels amazing as you slam down on the boost and try not to wreck and your newfound velocity, something thatâ€™s difficult to land when youâ€™re viewing the game from the viewpoint of a trailing helicopter. Itâ€™s some of the most engaging racing Iâ€™ve ever had in an isometric racer, but itâ€™s also the first and last thing Bang Bang Racing ever excels at.  Though thereâ€™s a clear struggle during races as everyone fights for first, often spinning themselves out in the process, once you leave a race progression becomes hard to track. You unlock tracks and cars in a linear order, but it doesnâ€™t feel like youâ€™re ever advancing. Races come and go and I never got the impression I was driving better cars or racing smarter opponents from the first race to the last. The only difference between the four cups (which branch out into individual races) is the type of car you drive, but again thereâ€™s little to differentiate them by. Muscle cars felt the same as formula one cars, and as each cup uses small variations on the same courses I never had to adjust my racing style for any small subtleties the different vehicles might provide.  Track designs are universally solid, but you can only go so long on a dozen or so tracks before they start to feel tired. I appreciated the small ways Bang Bang Racing changes things up between races, be it switching race modes or opening and closing short cuts, and it was never much of an issue that I was still essentially doing the same races over and over. But I imagine thatâ€™s in large part do to the career mode lasting in the range of 2-3 hours, which works at keeping the sense of repetition at bay, but also meant I was done with the game rather quickly and found little excuse to replay races over again.  Most bothersome is a camera that canâ€™t keep up with you. Bang Bang Racing has two options for this, one being a fixed camera typically from the side of the track, and a dynamic camera that stays at the isometric angle but turns to follow the direction of your car. Both are extremely problematic, the former because it makes it difficult to drive in a straight line or see where youâ€™re going, and the latter for all of that and the added effect of being nauseatingly mushy. It pans slowly and clumsily, often leaving you staring in the wrong direction you need to drive and sliding around so much that I often started to feel ill and had to stop for fear of vomiting over my monitor. It tends to be more usable than the fixed camera, but at the added cost of motion sickness which may or may not affect you (for reference, I almost never experience it).  Yet for all Bang Bang Racingâ€™s problems I kept coming back for the immensely fun and satisfying base racing experience. That I was willing to endure physical discomfort to play it should say how much I enjoyed it, and it makes it difficult to recommend for or against the game in any large capacity. I can only hope developer Digital Reality gets another crack at it and can fix the problems present here, because theyâ€™ve got a great foundation to work with packaged together in a miserable shell.
3271	1	a	Bright colourful graphics, tight controls, a lot of fun. A great thing about this game is that your car will keep driving around the track without having to turn, the walls will push the car in the right direction. My nephew is too young to understand the whole turning thing so he just holds down the accellerator and has a great time!   8/10
3273	1	a	Classic top down arcade racing game with good graphics/gameplay. If you liked micro machines or similar racing games in the past then you will enjoy this. A surprisingly large selection of cars and tracks are included and are great fun. No online multiplayer is a bit disappointing but there's split screen local multiplayer and at just $2.50 on sale, you can't really go wrong buying this.
3275	1	a	Picked this game up during the sale, sadly it crashes ever 40 minutes or so on windows 10...   Am I going to ask for a refund? Hell NO!  This game's great! picked it up for like $2.00 CDN and it even has local split screen multi player which it doesn't even advertise! Had I of known the game had local split screen multi player I probably would have picked it up much earlier... The game is easily worth $5-$7...  THIS IS A MUST BUY WHILE IT'S ON SALE FOR THIS PRICE,  even with the crashing, I feel like I just robbed these poor developers...   Very good work guys hopfully you can make another one of these gems.
3277	1	a	I was unhappy with it when i experienced crashes during carrer mode, making me repeat lot of races over and over. But apart from that this is really fun game, what i like is that even AI drivers make mistakes like crashing into walls when taking turn badly, spinning out on oil, or crashing under pressure from other drivers and player, sometimes they take shortcuts and in other lap they will not etc. Its great to see that, unlike in some other games where AI doesnt react to what is happening on track, even some triple A games dont have that so that is a big plus, makes racing more interesting.  It takes few races to get the feeling for the camera position, speed differences from class to class so you will at the final tier crash into walls more often until you get the feeling for the speed. You can select different cars in same class, some have better handling others longer nitro boost, higher max speed etc. and you can really feel the difference depending of the tracks you are driving on. Tracks itself are beautiful, have a lot of variations with shortcuts, hard turns or long straits, and traps like exploding, water or dreadful oil barrels that bring some tactics into racing (where one oil barrel in wrong time can make you lose few places in the race at the end). At the starting line in box you can refil your nitro and fix the damage on car. While you do damage your car you wount be eliminated for it if you total it, your car will only be slower until you fix it. Too bad the game doest have online MP cause that would be really a blast to play against other people. It offers a lot of replay value and for the price i highy recommend it.
3279	1	a	This may seem like another Micro Machines style game, but it actually owes more to the classic Super Sprint - In fact the whole thing feels like an update version of that arcade racer. It uses most of S. Sprint's tricks with oil slicks, exploding barrels and shortcuts.  The games does have it's fair share of problems though, the biggest of which is those oil slicks and barrels. Look at it this way: you are about to win a race, you hit an oil slick, you lose the race. I know that this is old school, but it's pretty annoying and takes some of the skill from the races. Also you will notice that the camera spins around the car making it feel like a little RC racer. Unfortunately it just can't keep up, especially with faster cars which makes it precise driving difficult. Of course this isn't that much of a problem unless you care about the time trials.  Having said that racing is usually quite fun and opponents race fairly. You can use the exploding barrels and other hazards against them which even things up a bit.  On the whole I found that I enjoyed it more than I disliked it which means it's a recommendation from me.
1619	0	a	This game is missing the joy of a true skill-based racing experience. It has some of the most obvious rubber-banding I've ever seen. You easily pass the lead car then it will suddenly become fast and pass you after awhile almost no matter what. It doesn't feel like its about driving skill but rather about timing of taking the lead at the right time so the rubber-banding will not take effect until after you have passed the finish line. The AI cars will try to take you out if you are near them, even if it costs them race position. For instance, I was heading down a straight section of track nowhere near a corner and when I came up to another car it made a sharp left turn straight towards the wall to knock me off course. The turning of your car is so sharp and immediate that it doesn't feel like it is a real car and it makes it difficult to try to drive a perfect line around the course, which again subtracts from the skill-based aspect you expect to find in a racing game. Also, the camera is very disorienting and probably could cause some people to have motion sickness. Overall I think a person would be lucky to get more than 4 hours of enjoyment out of this game before becoming bored.
1620	0	a	at first it was nice, little car, simple gameplay. But when you arrive at the level 3 cars, you feel kinda frustated... repetitive track, same style of drift and not a great challenge at all (even you play the hard mode).  you can find some other better games of this 6/10.
1621	0	a	Incompatible with AMD GPUs, refuses to even start, what atrociously bad devs, this makes the WarZ dev team look good.  Perhaps it's a great game, but how would I know? Half the world can't run it because of their incompetence.
1622	0	a	Game itself is a very simplistic racing game (think of Flash games).  The problem comes with these serious game SLOWDOWN issues on many systems, occurs every 5-10 seconds.  Therefore, I would never recommend a game like this.
1623	0	a	Reminds me a bit of RC Pro-am from Nintendo.  Cool simple racing game, but very poorly optimized it seems.  I can run most AAA games on my decent pc that meets the specifications, but this is in painful slow-mo with tons of lag. For such a basic game that is crazy. This is desite lowering the settings and resolution to minimum. If you have a much better pc than suggested its good give it a go if on sale imo. I have a new gaming PC, but still the demands for this game are way too high. The game itself is pretty good.
3281	1	a	Better than NFS: Rivals
1624	0	a	Just within a few minutes of playtime, I noticed it's not worth continuing to play further. The camera is annoying at times and the controls / driving just doesn't feel right, similar to Mini Motor Racing EVO, even though this game had the controls a bit better. As someone already stated, it feels like a flash game, therefore I cannot recommend buying this. Least I got it in a bundle that included some better games, so money wasn't wasted.  6/10
1625	0	a	'Bang Bang Racing had stop working after you won 5 of the 8 last races and right before you had the chance to have your game auto-saved.'   TOO BAD FOR YOU, IT IS THE THIRD TIME IN A ROW THE GAME CRASHES RIGHT BEFORE YOU FINISHED IT !  'Ah Ah' should add the developers.  Don't buy this, it is not finished and it won't be. No more updates since 2012.  You CAN'T EVEN REMAP THE KEYS !!  It was unplayable on windows XP, it is still crashing on Windows 7 with 8 Giga of Ram and GTX560ti...  It's a shame because, even if graphics aren't HD but oversized for 1080P, the game is pretty challenging. Sometimes good driving by cornering and braking at the right time is rewarding, but at the harder levels, many of the A.I. cars always overtakes you with extra nitros and brakes in front of you to block-passes you and ruins your race.  Sometimes you are blocked by a pile of cars, all trying to block you at the same time, instead of rushing to victory.  So, there is the 'codemaster's solution' = RESTART RACE ! ... if it hasn't crashed before to windows desktop. 
1626	0	a	THERE IS NO ONLINE MULTIPLAYER
1627	0	a	At first it seems like a fun little arcade racer game. You start off slow and then it ramps up the difficulty and speed. Unlocking the tracks and cars is a normal game mechanic of racers but it also lacks a key feature and has the dreaded racing game stereotype features as well.  Not having a map/course layout in the HUD is not really excusable, having to remember the tracks and half the time there are 'shortcuts' and half the time they are blocked is quite annoying. Also, BBR has the ever so popular 'Oh you are kicking our butts.... Let's have unlimted speed boosts to catch up' syndrome. If I'm winning by half a track it's because I'm doing well. I shouldn't have the whole pack catch up within seconds of the finish line! Whomever thought that was a great idea is the same person who loved playing Madden on the SNES cause they both be cheaters!  I really do want to recommend BBR but the minor yet annoying flaws make me not want to try and complete the game.
1628	0	a	Old school top down arcade racer combined with modern day race events. Meaning you'll get to play championships, elimination races, time trials, etc. But it has nothing else going for it. At least the graphics are colorful.  [Rating: 66/100]

1631	0	a	I have no clue how this has such glowing reviews. The game is a mess on a technical level, it lags constantly on high-end machines and even threw a full system crash my way. This is not an isolated issue, the forum is full of people with such issues.  If there WEREN'T any such issues then this could actually be a fun but mediocre arcade racing game, but in its current state it's absolutely unplayable.
1632	0	a	This game crashes my pc on start up 100% of the time
3283	1	a	Solid racing game. A decent number of cars, tracks and races. Good performance, graphics and sound. Nice balance between challenge and fun (I'm weak at driving games and I fail a lot). Big replayability as you have to achieve TONS of records. Top-down perspective is nice, but camera fails at times and makes winning the race difficult. Does it stand out? No, but if you like similar games you will enjoy this one.
3285	1	a	Great little mini car racing game with a terrible title. Push on through the first two classes as the fast your car goes the better the game gets. It's a pity you have to unlock them to get to them. There are a huge selection of tracks ot choose from and a couple of different modes. It's not fancy but it is well crafted.
3287	1	a	An amazing game that is cheap, fun, and all about the chaos! Highly recommend you play this in big picture mode with a controller, well worth it.
3289	1	a	Why is it so hard to win the first race? I won all the other tracks before winning the first race. frustrating none the less. It's an ok game.  Get it when its on sale.
3291	1	a	This is for a badge
3293	1	a	Great little top down arcade racer which reminds me of my childhood days playing Skidmarks on the Amiga. You can usually pick this game up cheap and it is fun with nice looking tracks. The only downside is it doesn't have online at the time of writing. It didn't bother me but some find this a major downside as some of the games competitiors do have this feature.
3295	1	a	What a fantastic Racer! Ace handling,graphics,tyre screaming, if only you could smell the petrol! Would reccomend to anyone. Must have another go.
3297	1	a	All those that want a rally game should have it. Imo they made it too good to be honest. &lt;3
3299	1	a	A surprising little game. It plays and looks like a souped up micromachines game from days of yore. It has lots of nice little touches like oil slicks, sand, exploding barrels. And tons of unlockable paint jobs. Not to mention quite a few well designed tracks with the standard elimination, race, time trial options. The multiplayer bonus and shortcuts add to this and it's a shame more people aren't playing it.  The downside is the standard rubberband AI that you get with racers, but if you've played racing games this is kinda goes with the territory. It's not terrible with it, but it is noticeable. Especially in elimination races. The other downside is multiplayer is limited to unlocks, so if you plan to play with friends you may want to spend some time unlocking at least the extra tracks, modes, and cars.   I recommend this as a fun little party racer with a lot of nice little touches that nobody should be disappointed with. If you like unlockables, all the skins/paintjobs should keep you going for quite some time.
3301	1	a	Plus: Awesome little overhead racer. Decent with Xbox controllers. Fun coop, but has a bit of a control learning curve. Excellent graphics. Fun obstacles. Minus: Xbox controls need tweaking. No car upgrading. Must unlock things in SP to be able to coop them.  AMD Phenom II X6 1100T 3.3Ghz. 6GB DDR2 2.5TB 7200RPM, 16MB, SATA II 16MB/s Cable/N300 Wifi XFX 2GB Radeon 6950 Vizio 42' 1080P 3D LED
3303	1	a	Fantastic game, great mini racer with a bit too much rubber AI but i guess having other racers around you always makes it more interesting, split screen multiplayer is just plain oldschool endless fun. You get the choice of fixed or follow camera, whatever suits your style... if you're ever played the classic ironman, death rally or ignition, just get this game right now, else, if you're new to the genre, this might be one of the best starting points.
3305	1	a	Goes back to the likes of Micro-Machines and glitters it all up for modern times.  The most important point of this game, is that it does achieves something that most AAA games can't and may never: It's   Fun.

3311	1	a	Playschool/Rescue Heroes art meets an oddly Fast and the Furious race feel. Causal game without much depth. By it for a $1. Played for 30 minutes and thats all I would of it.
3313	1	a	Fun game but no online MP, only local coop.
3315	1	a	Charming little top down racing game. The cars all have their own element in which they excell. Turning, top speed, boost, etc So you just pick the car you think will be best for the track/tournament and go for it. It isn't so that you will have a big advantage if you have the right car. The bots are pretty good racers as well. Sadly this game is pretty short. So pick it up when it is on sale.
3317	1	a	Reminds me of an old Neo-Geo game.  If you liked Mashed for PS2 this is a game for you.

3323	1	a	Great fun. I love it

1641	0	a	Game have problems with optimization and developers doing nothing with them.  Besides, game is too easy.

3327	1	a	Fun racing game, although a little short lived. Reminds me of Micro Machines when I was a kid!!
1643	0	a	There is absolutley no sense of speed in this game. It feels like its running in slow motion.  It's not that the frame rate is bad, etc. It's that the speed is just really really really slow.  After a few laps round the tracks I was getting very boring as the car is going so slowly....  wasted my money (yet again)
3329	1	a	just a really fun simple racing game, with good graphics, and great gameplay - would def recoomend
3331	1	a	Fun racing game, although a little short lived. Reminds me of Micro Machines when I was a kid!!

1646	0	a	why Half of my games dosent support controler logitech dual action WTF ?
1647	0	a	Got this game as a part of a bundle. If the mini racing genre does not already appeal to you, bang bang racing will not change your mind. Might be fun for family multiplayer.
3335	1	a	Really nice 'micro machines' racer game. Really good physical engine simulation, beating all chronos will require some effort, hell yeah !  9 circuits, * 2 (both ways) + circuits with shortcuts.  Would wreck my car again 8/10 :)  edit : forgot, but nice split screen mode too !
3337	1	a	Actually decent, get on sale though. 7/10
3339	1	a	You'll need a little time to get used to the gameplay and the camera, but after that, it will be fun, fun and more fun. Try it !
3341	1	a	Great for kids, its super arcade with easy controling (ive tested on dual shock 4 controller emulated as Xboxcontroller via inputmapper utility) and it was good. But ive felt little dizzy after first 2 maps. So Yeah!
3343	1	a	So brilliantly good that I would pay twice as much for an 8-way network-multipleyer version.
3345	1	a	The good: old school top down racing with lots of courses / cars. The bad: lack of online multiplayer, unable to redefine keys, camera following mode can be too slow with fast car and twisty tracks. Overall: a good buy when on sale under $5. Reviewed on 16 July 2012
3347	1	a	This has got to be one of the most fun car racing games in this style I have played.  1. Use a gamepad. 2. Put camera mode to 'follow' in the games options menu. 3. Start to memorise the track layouts as you race on them.  If you like this style of game then I hope you enjoy this one as much as I do. 
3349	1	a	A fun and simple racer, only it is just limited in that it seems it is the same races over and over again. You can pick different cars once you unlock them, but it was a missed oppertunity if they had instead allowed you to customise your own car to compete at better races. Would recommend buying this when it is on sale.

Simple, easy, and extremely fun (With friends, ten times that). 2. Soundtrack is amazeballs. 3. Progressively challenging. 4. Wide variety of funky characters to choose from. 5. Brilliant level designs.    Cons  :  1. Minimal amount of players during matchmaking. 2. Lack of advertising for the game. Not many people buy it. Please, buy it.  It may not look visually appealing, or promising, but that's what even I thought before I actually went ahead and bought it. This is a  must-buy  for those who love party-oriented games.

3387	1	a	Alright, SpeedRunners is a fast-paced racing game that looks nothing like (and plays nothing like) a normal racing game. It blends elements from platformers and other genres seamlessly... kind of. The game has a considerable amount of glitches and bugs, but it's been improved considerable since I first reviewed this game and it's a much closer to flawless. There's a lot of glitches that I originally complained about, and I think the dev's edits and fixes to them has been phenomenol and deserves it's own mention. There's still a few issues, mostly with lag, but that's hardly a fixable issue due to poor ISP's and everything. That being said, the game is still an amazing game. I would play this 24/7 if it didn't have it's road bumps (and, as you can see, I've still played it religiously). From what I've seen, the 'Story' mode is mainly bug-free, and if you can't handle the lag from online players, you can always play with AI and friends in a custom lobby. There's a built-in solution for every issue I have found, so in reality, by the end of this, a LOT of people might be saying 'SpeedRunners is an amazing game and you're wrong!' and I'd agree, especially since it's much more tolerable than other games *cough* Monstrum *hacking*, and it runs at a very smooth framerate for a game of this size and quality (most games I can't play in a resolution above 800x600. This game I certainly can). Finally, I say buy this game for 3 main reasons: it has surpassed many MANY more games on the steam store, it's no longer Early Access, and it's an amazing game already. who wouldn't want to race their friends in a cartoon world of a guy in a unicorn suit, a cat, and a detective dog? I certainly do.

3415	1	a	Updating my review in line with release to be much more comprehensive, I'm going to use the spoiler format thing again since if people just want a quick look at one aspect of a review it should be easier to find than a wall of text, there's bound to be a better format but meh, it will do.  Rating: Look at my time it's kind of irrelevant what I say at this stage, right?  Overview of gameplay:   High speed elimination based race, up to 4 players compete to travel through maps as possible using a combination of a traditional double jump mechanic and a grappling hook mechanic. Game also has weapons which can be used to mess up your opponents.    Some gameplay tags: Very Fast-paced, High skill cap, simple mechanics, repetetive, addictive  Recommended Audience (my opinion):   1. Groups of friends looking for an easy game to pick up and have fun with (probably wont pass 30 hours gameplay if in this group)  2. People who want a competetive multiplay platforming/racing experience  3. Anyone (Seriously it's a damn good game, I'm far too lazy to write a review like this for most games :D     Pros: Easy to get into   I highly recommend learning the game initially with friends who are also new to the game, the start of the game has alot of just learning maps and can be very rough unfortunately if you are not partnered with friends/other newbies, even a few hours could give someone a massively unfair advantage over a new player and hurt the experience for them.   Very Fun Fast Paced High Skill Cap Live Update: New content / bugfixes regularly implemented Customisable graphics (Trails, characters and object mods) Not very resource intensive Pro-active Developers    This is a very important point, the devs of this game are constantly looking for feedback and, while I might personally disagree with some of their choices and initiatives, I think they deserve massive praise for their approach to the development. They listen to the community and always try to look out both for the experienced players and the newer players.....I just happen not to be in sync with the community on several discussions hence the disagreements.    Streaming and community content on front-page:    Not a big deal but just a nice touch, if you release a good video or guide you might be featured on the front page after the game opens and if you stream the game there is a tab which will show your league, your current viewers and give an easy link to your stream, just a nice little touch    Cons: Heavily repetetive:    It's basically a racing game with, imo, slightly mechanics and weapons, there's 35ish? tracks at the time of release that are curated or official and gameplay off of these is rare unless you personally go looking for it   Ranked System: (Due for an overhaul according to devs, will update this review if it is updated and improved) Extremely simple mechanics:   This is both a pro and a con, on the one hand it makes the game much better for picking up and playing, on the other hand it often feels like levels are all played the same, the techniques used for speed rarely vary and weapons provide most the variety   Speed Cap:   This won't affect your gameplay for a very long time after you start but if you go for long enough this becomes a big issue. You take routes or do tricks that should give more speed but still everyone ends up travelling the same speed making route variation pointless and suboptimal     Other comments: Soundtrack is only ok, not necessarily a con but worth mentioning  Doesn't handle latency amazingly well but vastly improved on this issue so no longer worthy of a con, I have no major issues even though I can't get wired net where I live.  Player count is currently a bit low which prevents the implementation of certain gameplay refinements that I think the devs would like to put in but this shouldn't put you off buying the game, games are always available and community is (mostly) nice

3421	1	a	SpeedRunners is one of the games that can be proud that it broke the early access curse and was fully released not too long ago.   SpeedRunners at least in my eyes is one of the most fun games I've played in recent memory. The thrill of being in first and the feeling that you can't be stopped by your opponents is just purely amazing and I think everyone needs to experience it.  In the story mode of SpeedRunners you play as Speedrunner and you try to become the best by overthrowing the other speedrunners.   But enough about the story, let's get into the gameplay:  The entire game is based on speed. You try to outrun all your opponents and the last one alive wins, win three times and you win the game.   Anything goes, you can use weapons,grapling hooks, explosives and all sorts of stuff. Some stuff can backfire on you so be careful on how you use the power ups.  The Graphics are awesome and I love the art style. Everything from animations, backgrounds and characters, everything looks amazing.  The soundtrack at first, I liked, but it get's tiresome really fast and I just really prefer to either mute the game and put on something else or just don't wear headphones.  The main campaign took me 1 hour to finish, and there is some replay value. You can go through the campaign more than a few times and unlock more stuff like maps and characters.   I didn't encounter any issues while running this game and I highly doubt anyone will too, so you are good to go.  Overall I don't have anything bad to say about SpeedRunners. It's an amazing game and I highly suggest you check it out and you will get sucked into it.   Pros: +Great gameplay +Outstanding Art Style +Outstanding multiplayer   Cons: -Incredibly short campaign  Final Rating: 9/10  If you liked this review, please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked about it.

3427	1	a	This game is literally all I play now. SpeedRunners is a multiplayer racing game with up to four players where you choose and unlock all sorts of comical characters to play as. Racing on foot has never been this fun. Wait, it's never been fun... Well, this Makes it fun! You can play this game both casually with friends, and competitively with anyone. Learning the physics of this game and it's crazy tricks raises the skill ceiling so much higher! You can play ranked with people of your skill level, or jump into a quick match and have just as much fun grappling and kicking off walls to your leisure. There's even a single player story mode, with unlockable comic book chapters! Not to mention, this game's soundtrack and art style makes it feel all the more like you're inside a comic book! While many players buy this game on sale and give up early, this game is most definitely not dead, and seeing its success and competitive scene, won't ever die. This game is simple fun for absolutely anyone! Grapple far and hit slopes hard, runners! This game is amazing, and I'd recommend it for anyone who likes any sort of platformer game!

3453	1	a	  I found it a bit repetitive, but it's fun. It's pretty much just a simple running race game: you're just running, level after level, grabbing your opponents with hooks, throwing boxes at them and using special powers to prevent them from crossing the finish line before you.

3457	1	a	My favourite game at the moment. Easy to play, hard to master (perfectly) everyone can more or less move to the whole map without any experience. But there are so many alternative ways where you can go to be faster.   Good game to watch videos nextby. The Power-Ups are just amazing!   The only thing that I dislike are the characters, which I think could look a bit cooler.  Also I have some minor lags sometimes (once in an hour), which is quite weird, because my pc is a lot over the requirements.  Cool local-co-up game!   Wow that was a unorganised review.   - 9/10 Riggy

3477	1	a	Ever since I tried the demo of this game I was hooked. No pun intended. I love the art style, the music, the speed. It's pretty intimidating at first but it gets easier the more you play. There is a tutorial and you can play against bots to get better. Pretty much everyone in the community that I've played against in MP were really cool and willing to 'show me the ropes'. This is a fantastic game and is super addictive. You've been warned lol. Get this game!

3515	1	a	That game can make the time you spend playing it fun and pretty interesting. That was a unique experience playing that game. I liked it, the game has a fine graphic and good gameplay, the soundtrack is cool.
3517	1	a	SpeedRunners is one of the most fantastic small titles available on steam, as a multiplayer game it's one of the most fantastic around. The gameplay is extremely fun the overall concept is pretty different and it has a good amount of gimmicks to practise and learn to get an upper hand. It's very fun and I haven't had so much fun since that first night playing with a group of friends. Recently announced is a level editor too which will also be a fantastic edition to an already great game. High recommend.
3519	1	a	This is one of those games you turn on, play a couple of matches then wake up behind a Mcdonald's counter with bodies lyring all over the floor and a firetruck crashed through the main window. a quick, hilariously fun game i promise you you'll not be dissapointed with this rage-generator.

3547	1	a	This is a fun, addicting game and (probably) a great local party experience.  You will notice bugs once you get to a high rank but that would be several hundreds hours in.  I would recommend since it is a good way to kill time quickly and has a insane amount of replayability.

3557	1	a	Speedrunners is a game that can build or destroy friendships. Mostly destroying tho. You can only become better by practicing and when everybody is good at the game, it's an amazing experience. Or you can annoy the f*ck out of your friends by playing way better than them. It's always fun when they rage and call you a hacker instead of admitting that you are way to good at the game.   Aaah... nothing better than watching your friends suffer.

3639	1	a	People told me before I bought it that this game is a Mario Kart in 2D.  They were totally right. I used to play a lot of Mario Kart Wii when I was younger and got better and better at it with each race I did.   SpeedRunners works a lot in the same way. You'll pass through the same levels over and over again, but you'll always find a new technique to go faster or trick your opponents.   With time, you'll get better and better, and after a few hundred hours, you'll be as skilled as the hundreds of other good players out there. All it takes is some practice.  I love this game. It's so fun and interesting, especially the multiplayer. :3

3645	1	a	Pros: - Fun - More fun - Rewarding chaos with friends  Cons: - You might have no friendships afterwards  Is there anything I can say about this game that isn't just the word fun? It's probably one of my favourite games to play. It's not a game I would play solo, but it's very rewarding to play with friends. Although it can be very difficult when your friends are better than you, it brings out this fun side of competition where anything can happen.

3727	1	a	A good concept with decent game play. I don't think it's worth it's stated price but it's still in early access. Time will only tell! My hope is that they add some mini-game functions or attempt to play with the rules of the game. (This game is local co-op)!  Speed Runners is a game about running the fastest, being first while leaving your enemies in the dust. By being last, you risk the chance of being eliminated by being off the edge of the screen. The  gameplay  itself for the moment is decently good but has a lot -First player controls the pace and controls the camera. Take the long route or risk grabbing a pick-up may cost you a life. The scoring system as of current requires three wins. This means you need to win three times in order to take the game. You do not need to win consecutively to win the game. There are about a handful of characters to choose from at the moment. Some characters are available to unlock while others are DLC's. All character designs are quite unique and all move differently from one another. I haven't noticed any significant diversity in speed between the characters.   More or less, all characters seem to jump just as high as one another and move as fast as one another. Is this a good thing? Depends. It offers a level playing field for everyone but mixing up the game is never a bad idea. One person may prefer speed while another may prefer brawn. The only issue I have so far is that players are not able to melee or hit one another without a power up. Sure, this may be good as people aren't whacking one another always but some players I have played with mentioned that a melee addition would make it more engaging. Nonetheless, the game is still enjoyable and power ups provide a great addition to the game. Some of the power ups included are a grappling hook to grab the nearest opponent that pulls them back and you forward, boxes that opponents can run into, a force ball that completely slows and pushes opponents and a homing rocket missile (just to name a few).   Levels themselves are quite challenging and take a bit of time to get used to and really good at. It is a bit overwhelming at first playing online and getting completely smoked by veteran players. If one's really persistent on getting good, it does take a little grinding to familiarize yourself with the level design.  Visuals  are quite simple and suit the games needs. It's not over the edge 3D but the graphics do fit the atmosphere. I wouldn't mind seeing a little more done in regards to animations or things happening in the background. Heck, why not have players influence some of the backgrounds/graphics. Why not even have them alter the stage? This is possible to a certain extent as levers are present throughout levels. These levers open and close paths and definitely add some more interest to the game.  Sounds  are pretty decent at this point and aren't extremely varied character to character. Dialogue is slightly different but wouldn't hurt to add a few more sounds to the voices.   Overall, not a bad game in it's current form. There is a lot of opportunity here to take the game beyond being a simple linear running game. Although be it so, there's some serious fun to have online or between your buddies. I'm really, really, really hoping they add some mini-games or some more diversity into the game. They got a nice engine, let's do more with it!  Indie Rating : 7.6/10  EARLY ACCESS RATING : 6.95/10       Gameplay   C+     Story / Campaign   N/A     Visuals / User Interface   B-     Sounds / Music   C+     Replay-ability   B-     Overall    C+      PS - Why can't you take in-game screenshots with F12?

3907	1	a	This game is definitely worth a buy. The community is small, and the devs dont really update the game either, but that doesnt mean this game is one to be overlooked. On top of its already challenging story mode, there are lots of ways to challenge yourself against bots, or other players, even both! So, if you're thinking about getting this, please do! See you out there SpeedRunner!
3909	1	a	Friendship Destroyer Adrenaline Booster Horror Intense As ***** 10/10 would get exploded again
3911	1	a	I'm going to preface this by saying that I've only played through the story mode, but I feel like that actually captures the essene of what the game is, if not the entire spirit of it.  I first purchased SpeedRunners as a sort of replacement for Runbow. I didn't want to have to plug my Wii in all the time to just play one game. Why not just buy a new running game, and let my litle black box gather more dust and grow more and more redundant in peace?  The game is hectic. Chaotic. Deliightfully retro. There were many times I was mere milliseconds away from an untimely elimination, only to boost and swing just right and propel myself to a dashing finish. Oher times I was not so lucky, and was left groaning in annoyance and even frustration. I can only imagine how that would look with three other people playing on the couch, too. Probably a party.  Long story short: buy it. It's a good time, even on your own. It only gets better from there.

3985	1	a	One of my favorite games. Must buy.
3987	1	a	I have only had this game for about a week but i can allready say it is amazing, even though its looks like an average side scroller it is far from it. the art style is beautiful and overall it is a very fun and competive game to play which never gets old. An amazing original idea which works incredibly well. i would definatly recomand it to anyone that is looking for somthing new play or just to play in your spare time either way its a great buy.

4125	1	a	SpeedRunners - My personal review  I bought this game in the official steam shop after it was mentioned in one of PewDiePieÂ´s slightly older videos. It has been reduced by 75% from the original price so I payed about 4 euros in total, at this point my expectations werenÂ´t that high so I first thought that iÂ´d spend about 20 hours in the game. After a few matches and when i started to figure out the special mechanics that the game has it really started getting interesting and fun to play. Now I spent 46 hours in the game and that after about 6 weeks of buying it and after all this time its stil enjoyable and on top of that it became one of my favourite games iÂ´ve ever played.  It is a jump nÂ´run multiplayer game without any type of story you need to mention, so there is a tutorial but the game is just about the gameplay and not about the graphics or the campaign. You shouldnÂ´t buy this game if youÂ´re looking for a revolutionary game in every point but if youÂ´re into games like this its definetly worth youre money although i have to say that you should wait until its getting reduced again. 
4127	1	a	Ive only played this game for a bit, but I know its fantastic! The graphics are great and everythings fluent. All the characters are interesting and really make you want to play them! Its not a pay to play game! Everything you buy just effects how it looks and not how its played, to be good you must play! The soundtrack fits the tone of the fast paced, cut-throat gameplay! All the sound effects are great and really immerse you! I hate long reviews so ill keep it short. The game is fast paced, fun to play, cut throat and with every victory your friends will hate you more and more! Mentioning hate, Ive sseen NONE of it in the games ive played, everyone is nice and fair with each loss, and complementary with each victory! Worth. Every. Penny.

4203	1	a	I seriously looked at this game a while ago and thought it wouldn't be interesting. A couple friends and I decided to buy the game and check it out and 4 hours later we had some of the best fun in a LONG time. It's basically a fast-paced platforming game with powerups to hinder your friends (or foes) from beating you. The catch is after one person 'dies' by falling off the screen, the screen begins to get smaller and smaller until it's small enough to barely fit 2 people. It's some of the best fun you'll have and I can guarantee you'll be angry and laughing at the same time.

4341	1	a	think of Mario Kart think of your friend 2 feet away from the finish line think of that blue shell you launched, floating just above their head think of the sheer anger on their face as you steal that gold cup from their fingertips  this is far more intense and friendship breaking than that! rockets, grapples, cheeky tackles that any ref would have no trouble red carding!  one of the most FUN games in a long time, LAN PLAY + 4 FRIENDS = LAUGHTER, TEARS AND AT LEAST 1 BLACK EYE HIGHLYHIGHLY RECOMMEND
4343	1	a	It's a side scrolling racer where the object isn't to finish laps ahead of your opponents, but instead only to get far enough ahead of your opponents to push them off the screen to their explosive death. It's got a bronze/silver age comic book feel to the aesthetic. It reminds me of the racing game included with Kirby Super Star.

4353	1	a	Just recently getting into this game, I'll never be good enough to beat the veterans online, and maybe not even my friends - but I still enjoy every second of it.  Great stylized graphics (seriously, just watch someone else play and pay attention to the level artwork in the background). A catchy big band soundtrack that's totally unique. Snappy gameplay that allows you to get better, inches at a time.  The most fun you can have with this is to start playing along with three friends who haven't played before. Figure out the game mechanics together and accept your defeats gracefully.

The best thing about this game is the satisafaction you will feel when connecting a golden hook onto your friends neck and you catapult yourself into first place while laughing at him in TS.  F***ing amazing!

4399	1	a	Awesome. I bought this game during the Steam Summer-Sale and was really excited having seen YouTubers playing it. That said, it is not worth the regular price because: A: VERY limited story-mode B: Like ZERO DLCs C: Community is somewhat small so it can take forever to get put in a game D: Because of sed reason (^), you have newer players stuck in online matches with players 10x as good Again, I love the game and it's fun and easy to learnâ€”But it could benefit from a lower price and more DLCs

4495	1	a	SpeedRunners is as if Mario Kart and Super Meat Boy had a baby. It's a fast paced platforming race where you knock your opponents out with items found on the track, going off-screen results in death, and the last person alive wins the race.  I'm not a multiplayer person at all, but I enjoy playing this competitively in ranked mode, or casually with friends. To my knowledge, there is no other game like this, so I would recommend this title to anyone who enjoys platforming games.

I'm not so sure I'd like this game as much as I do if I didn't have plenty of active online friends AND a YouTube channel with a few fans who are willing to watch me fail at it... :P Nonetheless, it has Steam Workshop support and that's always a major key in a game like this. :D Be sure to pick this game up with a few friends ESPECIALLY if it goes on sale and you'll probably have a blast! :) GLHF.

The gameplay is extremely fun, the overall concept is pretty different and it has a good amount of gimmicks to practice and learn to get an upper hand.

4713	1	a	Fantastic couch co-op game. I've played many hours with friends and it's always a blast. Fast-paced, intense and competitive. I would thoroughly recommend it.
4715	1	a	This game is a great game for parties (You can play local with controllers for twice the fun). This game can and cant be competitive you decide. Sadly you need gamers to play this game if you are a gamer yourself this is because you absolutely smash them XD (If you like teasing and killing plebs this is the game for you!!!!)

4727	1	a	 the ranked game matchmaking is so trash that it doesn't work.  i'm beginner league, rank 2 (doesn't really fit for me honestly, because i joined in late), and i get paired with someone 3-4 ranks above me.  i lose most of the time of course, but even when i lose i gain ELO.  also half the time the 'winning moves' are really just exploits that weren't really planned to be used in the orginal map   pros:  - fun racing game with friends. - skill impacts (WAY) more than RNG, item drops. - made it out of early access, i guess that's kind of a pro.  cons:  - camera is literally so attrocious, it's a joke. and because the camera matters in win/lose situations, it's kind of a key element, and doesn't really pair well when â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed in the other direction. - (VERY) easilly exploited. - matchmaking works half the time. - limited gameplay. - you can gain and lose ELO from playing workshop maps in ranked, which aren't usually played for obvious reasons, and to add insult to injury, you don't even gain XP from playing these maps in non-competitive modes. please remove workshop maps from ranked pool. - very small base of players (&lt;750 when i play, peak is usually 800).  is it a bad game? not entirely, more like a 'the community makes it bad' kinda game. it's definately worth the money, if it's on sale. also, if you don't have friends to play it with, it'll be way less fun.   are more cons than pros a bad thing? not always. like i said, friends make this game 10x more fun.  beta was a blast, release was somewhat underwhelming, and still kinda feels like a beta game, with several bugs.

5083	1	a	Pure addictive chaos! High skill caps and fast-paced gameplay make this title on to watch out for! I'm not so sure I'd like this game as much as I do if I didn't have plenty of active online friends AND a YouTube channel with a few fans who are willing to watch me fail at it... :P Nonetheless, it has Steam Workshop support and that's always a major key in a game like this. :D Be sure to pick this game up with a few friends ESPECIALLY if it goes on sale and you'll probably have a blast! :) GLHF.

5217	1	a	Hello! Speedrunners Is a really good game for a party or if you just want to play a small game where you can stop (almost) instantly. It is really handy if you want to make a decision for example you want to decide wich game you play the guy who wins chooses the game. 4 pack recommended but if you want to play online it's also fun because you can rank up. And the developers are interested in your experience for example map making contest!

5447	1	a	SpeedRunners is a competitive indie racing game with a 2-D artstyle and a fun soundtrack. It has both single player and multiplayer modes and a variety of fun characters with different personalities. The goal of the game is to knock out your enemies by making them hit the edges of the screen, and you can race through a variety of unique levels with an arsenal of items to do so. This game is pure addictive multiplayer chaos. It's fast paced, it's competitive, and it even has a story! I see this game as a must-have if you're into indie games and is a joy to play with your friends.

Edit: That was then, this is now. The game has developed very quickly, and is much better then it was, and still would recomend it.

5737	1	a	SpeedRunners is not a good consistent day after day game. However it has a lot of replay value, in the sense that you and your friends can return to the game every so often and still have fun. Speedrunners may seem simple at face value but there can be a bit of complexity to it.   Final thoughts:  - BUY THE GAME - If you want a good party game to play once in a while. - DO NOT BUY - If you want a game to play everyday.

5787	1	a	This game made me realize that my dream of being a small blue hedgehog was unrealistic. I never knew a game could ruin my life. This combined with the realization that Russians are cancer ( that dream was crushed by csgo), made me want to end it all.

6027	1	a	The community is what makes this game the most fun., mostly fun in the lower ranks, and maybe overly competetive in the upper ranks. I'd play it more if I had more folks who'd play locally. This is similar but maybe less inviting than Mario Kart. It requires seasoned players some patience and grace to make this game fun for anyone who is playing for their first time.

Has excellent workshop support with user created maps being curated and played competitively and the pool expanding constantly!
6039	1	a	An awesome party-with-friends game to play with your best buddies, with a large learn curve and a lot of strategy involved.  10/10 would grapple your friends again and screw them aha  Ps: Feels so good when you dodge a grapple doe, especially from your nemesis ahaha

6043	1	a	The biggest fear I had when playing this game was that I wouldn't be able to control it well. Platform games are a dime a dozen, but one of my biggest banes is always wall jumping. Even in this game, I have trouble wall jumping sometimes.   But never have I had so much fun messing around with a platformer game. First try, maybe you won't do so well, but you'll have a great time playing and figuring it out with friends. Then you'll play again, and again, and with every match you'll be getting better and better at it. But even messing up all the time is one of the funniest parts. Everybody will do it.   I also have to praise the levels. There's a lot going on and you always feel cool when you manage to pull off the perfect swing around a corner or dodge every obstacle in an area. There's levels for beginners and advanced players and there's not stress when playing with your friends on harder levels because the fun of the levels is messing up until you get the hang of it.   This is by far one of the best multiplayer games I've played. Great style, interesting and fun gameplay: all in all a very great game.  Edit: Years later and I still hold the same opinion for this game. While it does have some glitchiness here and there, it is incredibly fun (even when you lose) and heavily skill-based. If you want to win, you need to get good- and it's fun practicing in order to get good. Play on some workshop levels for some extra hectic fun times.

My housemate can testify, there was much screaming and crying over the Theme Park level.   Took me for freaking ever to get the hang of those wall climbs. A controller helps and not thinking too hard, just go with the momentum and you'll somehow get through all the F**King wall climbs and F**King boxes.   But you'll  WANT  too. You'll  NEED  too. It's addictive and fast and relatively simple to pick up. I like the way the 'story' is told in the cartoons, but I wish the text-dialogue was more than just hints on how to play. It's coloured brightly (but not eyeball-searingly) and the slick little animations make it super entertaining to watch. I am hooked. Not grappled, though.   I might not be able to climb but I can DODGE  8/10 would make Piccolo proud again

6855	1	a	0/10 not fast enough -ign  SpeedRunners is a competitive multiplayer game in which players 'race' around courses using grappling hooks, powerups, and sliding. The goal is simple. Knock all players off the screen 3 times in a row to win.   Speedrunners is truely fast paced. Whilst I have not played the campaign mode yet, I don't think the story is or would be too appealing, and that's perfectly okay with me.  Holy shinoa the artstyle. The game has a sort of comic book or cartoon type of feel, and every level's design has something fresh and new for the formula. Not to mention, this game has integrated Workshop support, allowing any joe-schmo to make very complicated or stupidly easy levels.  God diggity doozle these controls. The controls are amazingly tight and are perfect in competitive modes. If you mess up, that's you.  Overall, Speedrunners is worth every cent. I could not find any flaw and if you want to have a good time with friends, do yourself a favor and buy this.  My (True) rating: 10/10

8317	1	a	Some of the most fun I have had with my friends and brother. I have had such tense races and had a lot of funny moments. I've definitely gotten my moneys worth, especially because I got it on sale for like, a dollar. I would definitely recomend this game. You wont be disapointed..
8319	1	a	White Cat runs faster.
8321	1	a	This game is fun, I love pushing people off the screen.
8323	1	a	Enjoyable multiplayer game with friends. It's fast, exciting, and competitive. It's fun with friends has a decent amount of characters and maps to keep it varied
8325	1	a	Great party game. You have to play Story mode to unlock new characters. It's a good online/local multiplayer game.

8349	1	a	I hate this game 10/10 How do i play?
8351	1	a	I became a Golden Hooker 10/10 would hook again.
8353	1	a	SpeedRunners is a fun side-scrolling game that makes me think that Indie developers could do a lot better. (No hate pls.) Cons- -No one currently plays on the multiplayer -The only DLC is youtuber DLC Pros -Works for bad computers on medium settings -The fact that this game has no flaws except for the DLC.
8355	1	a	Its a great game but it crashes when I try to change character :(
8357	1	a	Fun to play with friends at shools/jobs or were you are
8359	1	a	Ran it so hard even my best friend overdosed on speed
8361	1	a	To me, this game is only fun when playing with a full lobby of friends.
8363	1	a	Speedrunners is exactly what it advertises: a cutthroat multiplayer running race where your only goal is to outrun everyone else. Mechanically, this game is pretty well made. Everything is predictable enough to where intense strategy can be employed in every map, and the simplisity of the mechanics allow for clever tricks to be hidden all over the place to maximize your velocity and ensure that you're speeding away to the top.  That's not the reason I decided to post a positive review though. The mechanics and gameplay are very fun, but because it's (pretty much) multiplayer only, it's the players that make or break it for me. And the community is actually pretty cool for the most part. Firstly, the ranking system is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed and everybody knows it. That's a point against the game. But the community makes up for it by understanding when players aren't as skilled as them and oftentimes encouraging them or even giving them a helpful hand in figuring out how to become speedy.   So in conclusion, great game, awesome community. Game is definately worth it.

8429	1	a	Good for spending your free time... Realy recommend playing with friends, because for me it can get pretty boring playing alone... *maybe getting it while the game is on sale ???
8431	1	a	multiplayer at its best
8433	1	a	Never wanted to kill all of my friends more then i do when i play this game!
8435	1	a	Unaxpected, yet really entertaining and well crafted. The game is simple: race against other in platformish levels to be the first. Meanwhile you will use lot of props to power up your character or stop the others. The thing that set the game apart is the 2D physics engine, the sleekness and polishness in the interface, and the good balance of the game. Also: it has a great kind community that, in my experience, tend to help the noob with words of advice, instead of bashing on his head :)

8561	1	a	0/10 not fast enough -ign  SpeedRunners is a competitive multiplayer game in which players 'race' around courses using grappling hooks, powerups, and sliding. The goal is simple. Knock all players off the screen 3 times in a row to win.   Speedrunners is truely fast paced. Whilst I have not played the campaign mode yet, I don't think the story is or would be too appealing, and that's perfectly okay with me.  Holy shinoa the artstyle. The game has a sort of comic book or cartoon type of feel, and every level's design has something fresh and new for the formula. Not to mention, this game has integrated Workshop support, allowing any joe-schmo to make very complicated or stupidly easy levels.  God diggity doozle these controls. The controls are amazingly tight and are perfect in competitive modes. If you mess up, that's you.  Overall, Speedrunners is worth every cent. I could not find any flaw and if you want to have a good time with friends, do yourself a favor and buy this.  My (True) rating: 10/10
8563	1	a	A fast paced game that is great to play with friends.
8565	1	a	'Graphics: Your toaster'  It's a good game.
8567	1	a	Its fun!
8569	1	a	One of the funniest game I have ever played.

9235	1	a	i found this game by watching some youtubers and i thought that it looked like a good amount of fun, however i didnt have much money so i was a bit hesitant to buy it. After a couple of months i recieved a notification that the game was free for the weekend so epople could try it out. after about 10 hours in two days i bought the game the moment the trial ended. its an absolutely great game which i have never regretted buying because it has gameplay which is always entertaning. whether you're struggling to keep up with a pro, slowing down for a noob or having an intense match with someone on par you can always have a laugh about the result. And probably one of the greatest hings about this game is the community, this game gets nowhere near the same amount of toxic players as other games, almost all of the players are friendly happy people (i honestly believe that in all of my time playing i've only come across 10 toxic players and 1 bot). as a result i could not recommend this game enough and encourage you to get it as soon a you can.  I look forward to seeing you on the race track.

9239	1	a	'My Golden Grapple will be the end of you, Speedrunner!'   No, Gil. No it won't. THOSE F**KING WALL CLIMBS WILL BE. O M F G.   My housemate can testify, there was much screaming and crying over the Theme Park level.   Took me for freaking ever to get the hang of those wall climbs. A controller helps and not thinking too hard, just go with the momentum and you'll somehow get through all the F**King wall climbs and F**King boxes.   But you'll  WANT  too. You'll  NEED  too. It's addictive and fast and relatively simple to pick up. I like the way the 'story' is told in the cartoons, but I wish the text-dialogue was more than just hints on how to play. It's coloured brightly (but not eyeball-searingly) and the slick little animations make it super entertaining to watch. I am hooked. Not grappled, though.   I might not be able to climb but I can DODGE  8/10 would make Piccolo proud again

9881	1	a	Speedrunners is hands down the greatest game of all time.
9883	1	a	... Still waiting for anyone to join multiplayer.  Still waiting.
9885	1	a	It is fun, and can get a bit frustrating.   *UPDATE MAY 2016*  A few years went by, got myself a gaming pc, and a controller, and started to play this again. I now remember how fun this is, very smooth, nice levels, and i like the OST. Bought this back when it was still Early Access, and TinyBuild has not given up on this game.

9919	1	a	10/10 would run again.
9921	1	a	A great fun game if you want to play casual with your friends or a challenging and harsh experience if you'd rather dive into the competitive aspect. It's worth of your time if you enjoy fast-paced games with quick matches. Recommended
9923	1	a	A return to what games are supposed to be, addictive and just fun.  Speedrunners is a wonderful return to the fun platforming days of the NES. This is a quick to learn, yet difficult to master game that is simply just fun to play, and can be enjoyed in just a few minutes.   Essentially, the crux of the game is to just run and beat your competitors by being the last one still running. However, there is much the game and other players can throw at you to insure that is not always as simple as it sounds.  Gameplay is a wonderful mash-up of old-school NES platformers. Gameplay can best be described as a mix of Super Metroid, Bionic Commando and Mario Kart all rolled into one. You and three other racers (bots, online or even local games) charge through dozens of different levels jumping, ducking, sliding, avoiding boxes, swinging on grappling hooks, and shooting different weapons at other racers. In addition, the screen itself starts to slowly get smaller and you must maximize your speed and minimize mistakes. Game winners are determined by whoever wins three rounds first, and rounds themselves are over quickly, this is a great game to play if you can only dedicate a little time to gaming.   This is a fantastic game that I recommend to all.

9935	1	a	It's what it says in the title, watch 10 seconds of gameplay and you get the premise. It's my thing so I like it, I know a lot of people who hate it.
9937	1	a	Its a really fun and fast paced 4 player game. Very fun with friends but online play is also good.
9939	1	a	Ran it so hard even my best friend overdosed on speed
9941	1	a	As someone who's a fan of both platforming games and racing games, I think SpeedRunners is a fantastic combination of both genres. It's kinda like classic 2D Sonic the Hedgehog with Mario Kart items, and it's hella fun. However, the online multiplayer experience suffers greatly from really bad desync issues. In a game that depends so heavily on the players' positions on the screen, it seems like it would be really important to have everyone's games synchronized, especially in ranked multiplayer.
9943	1	a	This game was so fun! You can see a let's play by me here -         YouTubeâ„¢ Video:  SpeedRunners - Ep.1 - I'm A Bad Batman!&nbsp;

9957	1	a	  the only thing this game is missing is a fail compilation
9959	1	a	Got 2 go fast
9961	1	a	Good old arcade fun, even better with friends This game is a fun fast paced party game with.... wait for it..... ACTUAL LOCAL COOP. Plus an incredible amount of replayability, great online and system requirements wich are low enough for somebody with a bad computer. PICK THIS UP ASAP you won't regret it
9963	1	a	PROS: -SUPER fun game! Either ranked or unranked, you will have fun, trust me! -Has ranked and unranked modes -Community is very very very nice 99% of the time. -No hackers -Very few smurfs to ruin your experience (1%, maybe?)  CONS: -Matchmaking system is pretty bad. You can go against people a LOT better than you. If you are in entry league (lowest rank), you might end up playing against silver league players (that's high) -Can get pretty frustrating if you are going against people much better than you in ranked (but if that's the case, just go ahead and play unranked .-.). -Community is small and probably will be until the devs decide to lower the price of the game.  8/10 Would DEFINITELY recommend speeedrunners

9971	1	a	My favorite game of the year!  This game seems simplistic at first but after a while, I discovered that the controls are soooo deep! You can literally spend hundred of hours perfecting your skills and you could still improve.  My favorite aspect is the weapons available. It feel a bit like Mario Kart and I love it!  The only thing I dislike is that workshop maps are part of the official ranked mode. The game should offer 2 different ranked mode: 1-Officials 2-Workshops  BUY THIS GAME

9985	1	a	This game makes my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ tighten up when i play with my friends, the stress it causes is out of this world!
9987	1	a	Never picked up a game so quickly and been hooked.  10/10, would Unic again.
9989	1	a	Speedrunners is exactly what it advertises: a cutthroat multiplayer running race where your only goal is to outrun everyone else. Mechanically, this game is pretty well made. Everything is predictable enough to where intense strategy can be employed in every map, and the simplisity of the mechanics allow for clever tricks to be hidden all over the place to maximize your velocity and ensure that you're speeding away to the top.  That's not the reason I decided to post a positive review though. The mechanics and gameplay are very fun, but because it's (pretty much) multiplayer only, it's the players that make or break it for me. And the community is actually pretty cool for the most part. Firstly, the ranking system is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed and everybody knows it. That's a point against the game. But the community makes up for it by understanding when players aren't as skilled as them and oftentimes encouraging them or even giving them a helpful hand in figuring out how to become speedy.   So in conclusion, great game, awesome community. Game is definately worth it.
