0	1	a	i joined steam 10 years ago today to play rag doll kung fu, the first 3rd party game on steam.   Amazing fighting game with responsive physics and bullet time slowdowns. Still one of the best and most unique games in my library. The reviews don't do it justice, this game went over most heads due to the difficulty curve and was rightly criticised for being abandoned by Mark Healey when he went on to develop little big planet.   Ignore my playtime, we battered this game before records began  pros-  - deep ragdoll physics creates amazing combat sequences  - weapons, bullet time and magic from your fingertips - awesome game modes  - create your own characters and put them in the game - great music and comedy kung-fu artstyle - original concept   cons-  - hardly any players - steep difficulty curve - the game was abandoned so many promised features never came - the servers are now down (Hamachi or die)   special mention to Ceej, Blupilltaker, Siff, Kitty, Platycus, The Dude, and other forgotten warriors who made this game great  9/10
2	1	a	I played this game when it first came out and let me tell you, it was amazing! You may ask yourself why, and write it off as a simple am gimmicky game. The truth is that this game takes some serious skills and has a lot more depth then you would think. There used to be a small friendly and competitive community back in the day and we would host our own tournements. The reason this game died out is not because it wasn't good, it's because there has always been a problem hosting games and playing with others. You see the developer never added dedicated servers as a feature, therefore we all played through pretty much one or two people who somehow were able to host the game. If this community ever came back to life and dedicated servers were added (or something!) , I would be first in line. Long live RDKF!  10/10  (Siu Mei)
4	1	a	A mouse workout! Love this game.
6	1	a	Old game, still spectacular silly fun. 
8	1	a	As my nomination for 'Best First non-Valve game released on Steam' I think it's a shoe-in for the category.  I remember liking it, anyway. It's the one that makes you accidentally hit yourself in the face with your mouse, right?
10	1	a	This game is quirky, fun, and one of the games that's been in my library the longest. The controls are a bit difficult to master, but there are few things better than single-session multiplayer on this innovative fighting game with your friends and multiple USB mice. Also, bear in mind that this game was released in 2005 and pay no mind to the haters who bought it in 2011 or later and got mad because it can't measure up to today's stellar indie titles.
12	1	a	Bruce Lee would be proud (?)
14	1	a	Creative and fun. And the reason I joined steam.
16	1	a	I have no idea why I bought this.
18	1	a	Fun and origional game, with a very very amusing, laugh out loud, story (via video cut scenes). Comes with a character editor, and if you are handy with paint shop pro or similar, you can knock up a characer in an hour or so. Custom characters seem to be only available in multiplayer (but I couldn't find any active servers, maybe that's just me). Your character is fixed for story reasons in the single player. Left me wanting more...Well worth the money, highly recommended.
0	0	a	Anyone considering getting this game at this point, because the price has come down to 10 bucks... don't. On a functional level, it's not playable. The control scheme is not for most people, and you will cause yourself carpal tunnel syndrome from spinning the mouse in rapid circles while holding a button to charge up. That's if it starts up. And considering it's been abandoned by the creators, there's no bug support if it won't. Beyond the technical issues, the plot and styling of this game is in some of the most poor taste I've ever seen, from fake Chinese speach clearly thought up by white people to blatant homophobia I get the uncomfortable feeling isn't actually joking, it really has all the most reprehensible behavior you'd expect from fratboys. If this crap was done in the guise of joking, it'd be comparable to if a standup comedian delivered a KKK-grade black joke and then spent five minutes yelling 'ISN'T THAT FUNNY!?' at an audience that clearly doesn't agree. If you want a game that's playable or has a well-designed, non-offensive story, this one probably isn't for you. If you have no taste, waste ten bucks and see if it even runs for you. For my money, I'd be better off burning 10 bucks for warmth or literally eating it. It was on sale for $2.50 (I believe 90% off at the time) when I got it and I still want my money back.
20	1	a	One of the first games in my library. It's pretty silly.
2	0	a	I don't really like this at all actually. Controls feel awful.
3	0	a	Avoid it, I tried it and wanted to get used to the wierd play mechanics, but it was not natural or easy, So many other better games... why bother?
4	0	a	DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!! Controls are terrible and campaign is impossible to complete because of this but you have to play it to unlock anything. I only put this under recommend because, for some dumb reason, there is no other way to review it on here. I also butchered it on metacritic, GOTCHO ♥♥♥ RDKF!
5	0	a	It doesn't play all that well to be honest. The graphics look okay, but the gameplay itself is too, well I wouldn't want to say hard, but you have to keep a lot of things in mind and be on your toes if you want to succesfully beat someone, or just the objectives. It minimizes the fun factor. I honestly think they could've built a better game around this ragdoll mechanic. Would I want to see a new or other game with this kind of ragdoll fighting ? No. It's 'fun' for just a few minutes at best. Keep away.  [Rating: 62/100]
6	0	a	Have you always liked fighting games, but just wish that once in awhile they could stop trying to do all that 'fun to play' and 'challengingly deep' and aesthetically appealing' stuff and replaced it all with HORRIBLE RACISM?  GUESS WHAT  YOU SHOULD PROBABLY TALK TO SOMEONE
7	0	a	The most shameful embarrasingly bad game I have ever had the displeasure of playing. I profoundly hope the creator has given up his misguided ambition of ever making another game. If there is indeed a reciprocating vengeful force such as karma than the developer of Rag Doll Kung Fu has cursed his family bloodline for generations. I would not catergorize Rag Doll Kung Fu as a game but more appropriatly a war crime.
8	0	a	1st 3rd party game released on steam 1st regrettable purchase made on steam
9	0	a	Whoa. I know Kung-Fu.  No, Keanu, you don't.  And neither does anyone in this game.
10	0	a	You buy it because you're curious...  You uninstall it because its gameplay is really annoying and the novelty dried out... fast...
11	0	a	To all People Who Want To Buy This:RETURN.NOW. DONT WASTE 10 EURO ON THIS GAME... The Game's Fully Abandoned,It Was In Work For A Few Years,And There's No Multiplayer. The Story's Meh,Combat System Feels Weird,No Advice,And And And... I acutally paid for this...Im Not Happy,But it's Ooookkaaay. If you want to use this as an Review in the Internet,Try it. Yet there are no real features...there are many missing ones,And Such...If you want to support someone who gave up on this game,buy it.If Not,Then Waste Your Money On Hats In TF2 Or Something Like That.
22	1	a	Awesome game, cheesy story (nicely sarcastic though), but fantastic multiplayer when played with compatible gamepads. or on playstation or whatnot. Not really recommendable for keyboard and mouse
24	1	a	its a pretty fun game but to be honest it takes a while to get used to it,like the controls are weird but you get used to it only problem i have with this game is there is no support for this game anymore.This is a decent game if your thinking of playing it i would recommend getting friends to play it with you for it gets rather boring if your done with the story mode. 7/10
12	0	a	The game is actually good, just not for the price.  I picked this up for three dollars, it came with another game and it was at Dollarama in a physical case. I figured multiplayer on Steam was a thing, since I originally bought a copy for my friend from the same Dollarama and noticed it had steam.  I'm a bit disappointed that it still doesn't exist, same with a lot of features that you'd expect. However, it seems to be ready for multiplayer to be added, as well as the ability to support never-incoming workshop content, since the mods are all really simple reskins.  The game is very simple and fun, and the story is mature, B-movie level garbage, as if Kung Pow: Enter the Fist was directed by Cheech and Chong.   If anyone can find Mr. Healey and get him to mend in workshop and multiplayer or pass the license off to someone willing and capable, it might do a whole hell of a lot better, rather than abandoning it for the PSN version, or even the iTunes comedy doodle version.  Worth 3 bucks, not 10.
26	1	a	This game was awesome when I first purchased 11 years ago. It's a little clunky now to be honest.
28	1	a	One of a kind game. Local multiplayer with multiple mice is more fun than it has any right to be.
30	1	a	Why don't they make more games like this?!  Simple card playing mechanic that's fun and addicting. Then you have a vaguely interesting storyline that your character has to make his way through.  If you like Puzzle Quest (1st one), you'll love this game!   Seriously, they need more games like this!
32	1	a	The core concept of this game is essentially solitare poker againt the AI. Matching varying combinations of cards will inflict damage against the AI (and AI to you). The damage will increase the better the combiation, from two of a kind to a royal flush. The game mixes things up by adding in spell cards which can be used to inflict status effects, heal, do elemental damage, etc. The additions of the spell cards keeps the battle fresh as certain enemies require specific cards to counter their abilities. Overall, this game is average to above-average. I recommend a purchase of this game during a sale.
34	1	a	Runespell: Overture is a decent and enjoyable game. The story plays out as a fantasy adventure, your character being oblivious to his past and must do battles with numerous foes to advance, making allies and doing quests along the way.   The game play is somewhat unique, using a combination of battle and magic cards to attack your foe. One earns points by creating sets of 5 traditional cards (ace-king: hearts, spades, diamonds, clubs), using rules akin to poker, ie (pairs, 3 or 4 of a kind, straights, flushes, full house etc.). Better hands are worth more attack points (eg. full house &gt; 2 pair). Cards are laid out in columns of which the top card can be taken to make a set, including your opponent's. Meaning strategy is important in order to create the best possible hands while trying to prevent the opponent from doing the same.  The game is simple to play once you know the rules, and can be a good way to spend half an hour or so. Battles can be hard at times but with perseverance the game is not too difficult to beat, I finished it with about 9 hours of game play. I would enjoy a sequel to continue the story as it did seem unfinished at the conclusion. At a discount price the game is worth a shot, if you like card and/or poker-like games. 6.5/10
13	0	a	Runespell Overture is a card game with kind of original mechanic, blending the combinations from poker with tactical moves from Arcomage - where you collecting some points to use them on some spell, which will either attack your opponent or defend yourself better.  Point one is that it is NOT a Role-Play Game, it is only a card game with 'health points' on you and your enemies, and some grades of combinations to win the hand. Point two is that Arcomage - and many games alike - are still Much Better by the terms of gameplay.  As a Pro point, I like the visual stylistics of the Runespell, the way it's presenting itself - it has a good facade, so to say. Game mechanic and scenario combined creating good impression, which follows you in first third, maybe first half of the whole game. But then... then you notice, that the challenge is not anything intense, and just proceeding using quite the same basic combinations - basically doing all the same over and over... and at that point, you'll be not so happy.  The story is okay for that type of game... but nothing fancy or really rewarding for your struggle to beat dozens of almost similar enemies - and even bosses are not much different! To finish the impression, Runespell: Overture is maybe short (about 5-10 hours of gameplay), but holds one bugged achievement, which I can't complete even after 30+ hours... do I need to tell you how I love such things?  Oh, well, I'll just mark it with 5.5/10, and leave it be. Do not recommend, as there are enough of better card games, even in the F2P ghetto.
36	1	a	The core combat of making poker hands to fight enemies is pretty fun. The game is very shallow and has a very lackluster story with choices that impact absolutely nothing.  Get it on a sale or from a bundle.
15	0	a	I got this as part of a bundle and really tried to make it work for me, but it was hard to escape the 'solitare with animations' feeling I got from the game. I'm sure a greater enthusiast for card games will find something they like in here, but I could not recommend it to a general audience.
16	0	a	Make sure you like the core poker-styled game mechanic before you buy because that (and the nice presentation) carry the game. If you like the gameplay, this would be a good game for you. If you're unsure or not especially enthused, there are other games that might suit you better.  Took me a couple of tries to finish the game; I stopped playing and restarted a couple times because I got bored with the game mechanic or early grinding for silver.  Not a very long game once you learn how to properly win games. The story is really like a prelude to the 'real story' which is never revealed. The ending is pretty lackluster. As far as I can tell, there is no reason to Continue+ (for achievements, it's better to just not do the last stage so don't have to unlock all the map again).  Almost all allies are either impractical or unnecessary. Hrodbrokk is a pretty good source of damage for the RP/AP it takes; Brin is usually a waste of a turn because you should be better off moving cards around for bigger damage and using the RP elsewhere.
38	1	a	My only wish is that Mystic comes out with a sequel...and soon. I loved this game even though there was a lot of negative reviews...which only goes to prove that everyone has different tastes in games. I played this game several times and loved it each time for something new that I would discover.
40	1	a	Think Puzzle Quest, but instead of match 3 you play poker solitaire to fight your enemies.  It's fun if you're into this kind of thing. The story is cliched but well-written: I appreciate characters with a sense of cynicism. The art and sound are nice. Tutorials can be skipped when you replay the game.  Downsides: Mystic Box appears to fallen off the face of the earth. Technical settings do not save when you quit the game; I constantly have to hit Alt+Enter to resize my window and re-pick 'click and click' (dragging is a pain) when the game starts up  Overall, I enjoy this game. I use this game to kill time or relax: it's not as mindless as a match 3 and it's a fun twist on the premise. I don't expect it to do much more than that.
17	0	a	I feel that this would've been more fun if the spells and abilities were more than just 'do damage', also as the game progresses your sole upgrade is more HP/MP, without any increases in damage potential, so battles at the end just end up being a long slugfest.
42	1	a	This game was a surprise! I was expecting something like Fairy Solitaire, but has much more the RPG feeling and the RPG elements. And on top of all, keeps my poker knowledge fresh:)  I can definetely recommend this game as a Casual, Relaxing, Adventure with nice visuals.  and for 1,80euro...it's a steal!
44	1	a	One of the best card based game I have ever played. And now it's a real bargain, you cannot have good enough reason to not buy it. ;-)
46	1	a	Addictive poker role playing with real tactical depth making sure every battle keeps you on your toes, all at a bargain price.Delivers an interesting and fun variation of a traditional card game and turns it into a competitive puzzle with myriad nuances to its strategy. Unfortunately, it doesn't do enough to keep the variation fresh throughout.If you're looking for a card game and you're in love with the poker Runespell: Overture could be your game but keep in mind it has no multiplayer and the gameplay can be extremely repetitive.
48	1	a	The recommendation is pretty weak because I didn't actually like the game. I think it has the potential to be enjoyable and it is fairly unique, so that alone might be worth it to you.  This game is essentially puzzle quest but with a solitaire combat system instead of matching gems. It's not fast by any means. Essentially you build poker hands to charge attacks, then launch the attacks at your opponent. Essentially you spend the entire game moving stacks of cards on top of each other to make a combo of five, and the higher the combo on the damage scale, the more the attack will do. You can also 'steal' cards from your enemies so long as they aren't stacked.  The combat is cool once or twice, but after that it becomes so repetitive. Nearly every fight is identical, save for the select few where you need to charge and use special attacks to win.  Beyond the gameplay, the music, sound effects, story and graphics are all ok. They're mediocre, they're fine, they're acceptable. Without a doubt they are not great and won't sell the game, but they sustain it without detracting.  All around, that describes the experience: alright, ok, passable. It's not thrilling or revolutionary, but it is unique and if that's what you're looking for in a game then you'll find it here.
50	1	a	It's like playing poker and classic RPG at the same time. Challenging gameplay and good spells to help you through dozens of quests. Strong allies to unlock with fantastic artwork will make you want to summon them again and again. 
20	0	a	A very odd take on poker mechanics crossed with RPG battles. I just dont care for the strategy here. Just another game where I get to an impossible point after a couple hours with no clue what I could be doing wrong. Eh, I give. Uninstalled. I'd sooner suggest people try Puzzle Quest 2 for this kind of asthetic.
21	0	a	Marvelously fun game. Major set back: Even on the lowest graphics setting, the infernal game chops like there's no tomorrow. I've played 2 hours, then took a break. Now when I try to load her up, the game chops for 5+ minutes till I get bored and quit. And wehn I say chops, I mean the music cuts in and out and you can't interact at all.  The developers have an awesome idea for a game, it's great fun - but unplayable by virtue of their execution.
52	1	a	This is a unique solitaire game where you arrange your cards into poker suits to set up combos and blast your opponent. It's fun. The story starts out interesting setting things in real history, but with fantasy troops around, but it quickly becomes kill the bad guy, and the dialogues tries to be tongue-in-cheek too often
54	1	a	Great game. It's like Puzzle Quest but with cards instead of gems. And I don't know a thing about playing cards. So you can imagine how fun it is for me. The graphics are simple but cool, and add to the atmosphere of the game. The  sound and music are pretty good also. But there is something I hope they'll fix in future updates. Because it starts off pretty easy (obviously), but the difficulty ramps up quite quickly (after about 10 fights). And it's not just based on skill but luck as well. So there are times when you have to refight enemies 5-6 times in a row. Only downside to an otherwise excellent game.  [Rating: 77/100]
56	1	a	I've always liked Poker, but this game I like especially well.  The things it adds to the 'combat' like spells and combo chains is really interesting. The RPG elements, quests, and story added on make it pretty interesting as well.  I got it for $3 and it's definitely worth that, and certainly worth at least $10 as well but I'd still say you should get it on sale.  Great game overall, I recommend it.
25	0	a	Poker meets Solitare - suprisingly shallow puzzle adventure, but if your into poker, you probably can't beat it for the price..
58	1	a	Single player poker based fantasy duel game. It's worth a look for the money especially if you are a fan of Puzzle Quest, Spectromancer or Poker Night at the Inventory.
26	0	a	As a avid player of Match-3 games, and appreciator of the Puzzle Quest saga, I convinced myself to give Runespell: Overture a shot, intrigued by the fact you play with a standard deck of cards instead of coloured gems.  The first battles were interesting, the poker-like combos felt novel. Diving more deeply into the game, it got more depth with the addition of magic cards and sidekicks.  Unfortunately, it appeared that most of the magic cards are just copies of the same basic spell (unlike other games where fire, ice, lightning and poison have different tactical effects).  From that point, the battles felt too much similar to sustain interest, and the constant sight of these clubs, diamonds, hearts and spades turned the fantasy background into the trivial one your regular Solitaire.  These kind of games are supposed to be easy to develop on a reasonable budget, deliberately limiting fancy graphics to focus solely on gameplay depth. Sadly, this game is a living testimony of a team being too lazy or too tired to make a truly great game.   Maybe they lost faith in this game at some point. No wonder this happened to me too.
60	1	a	Really cool game.
28	0	a	game keep crashing at a certain point every time, i tried starting over with a new campain and it keeps effecting it and crashs as soon as i get into the game.. dont waste your money on only a few hours worth of game before it crashs. and you might think its just my computer doing because of my graphivcs card or something, but ive tried it again after replacing my graphics card
29	0	a	WIll not open on mac.
30	0	a	i would not recommend this game at all - total snooze ..... everything is great except the game play mechanics.
62	1	a	This is actually a really cool game and fun too.   Also changelings.
33	0	a	The core gameplay mechanic is original and fun, but I couldn't play enough of it for that to matter. For many people, the game crashes after reaching the first village. Just freezes and can't be unfrozen. Some people say they fix it by disabling 'Raptr,' but I don't even know what that is, and it doesn't appear to be even installed on my computer. If I ever manage to solve this problem, I can give a better review, but for now, I have to say that a game with such a massive bug isn't worth gambling on. Furthermore, there is a lot of dialogue and 'story,' but all of it is just horribly written. I mean really, really painful to read, and you have to go through it all. And if there is dialogue at the start of a fight (usually seems to be) and you die during that fight you have to click through it all again. I feel the game would be better if they either hired a proper writer for the story, or just gave it a bare bones plot and let the player enjoy the actual battles more, without having to suffer through the dialogues. Maybe add a 'skip' button.  Again, I've only played the tutorial, because I can't get it to work past that. It's possible it gets better, though writing that bad in a game doesn't tend to improve. I suppose my real hope would be that there would simply be less of it. If I ever get the game working, I will give it more of a chance, because the combat is quite interesting, and then I will update my review with a more informed experience.
64	1	a	Grate game to help past time
66	1	a	This is one of those games that makes me wish we had a 'thumbs in the middle' button. I liked it overall, but there were times where my experience just felt frustrating, and I don't think it was my playing poorly or anything like that, I think it's just an awkward design at times. If you're looking for a card game, there are better games, but it's not the worst one on the market.
36	0	a	It's solitaire... it comes free with windows
68	1	a	Oh No.... It's so addictive... I don't recommend... It makes you loose track of time :)
70	1	a	Poker and magic mixed in one. Interesting concept but bad graphics.
72	1	a	It's a solitare... poker... type game IN MIDIEVAL WITH MAGIC AND SPELLS AND ALL THAT CRAZY WIZARDY ♥♥♥♥ which I'm horrible at.
37	0	a	Eh, it's basically poker.  The only real variations are you can have 5 of a kind and there are magic abilities which you can use the better hands you make.  The plot is somewhat interesting but not really that original. You basically suffer from amnesia and you happen to be the chosen one to save everyone.  If you like poker... I recommend playing poker. If you like the fantasy aspect I recommend any number of other fantasy games. Even if you like both having 2 good games is better than having one mediocre one.
74	1	a	A normal poker game,a little hard and simple.  The gameplay and rule is easy to learn,so you can enjoy the battle,but the game's music is so bad,only one music from start to finish ,like the producer want to brainwash you...so close the music is good at you.  This game is not good and a little short,I got it from indie bundle,so I am enjoying it and unlocked all of the achievements.  At last,Do not buy the game without special sale.
76	1	a	good game for low price
78	1	a	This...is one of those games I'd pay good money to have on my tablet. I love the mix..rpg+poker = can't loose Have nothing bad to say about it at all..well besides that it's not on my tablet ;) Soooo Devs!..take this old gem and turn it into an app in the store pls..we wantss it..preciousss   Seriously, it's a nice game worth the money, pick it up if you like poker with a twist.   
80	1	a	nice but the hard game
40	0	a	The old iPhone game  Sword &amp; Poker 2  (NOT the awful freemium remake!) does everything right that Runespell does wrong.  In S&amp;P2, your spells directly affect the poker grid, which allows you to make better, deadlier poker hands. Which is fun. In Runespell, the spells do NOT let me affect the solitaire/poker game. They just let end it faster.  In S&amp;P2, you actually feel like you're playing (a weird variant of) poker. In Runespell, the game is much closer to Klondike solitaire. (Fairway Solitaire was fun, but this isn't.)  In S&amp;P2, the story is 'Go poker cute monsters to death to save the world... again' In Runespell, there's this ridiculous grimdark story because you fight everyone with solitaire and poker's UGLY child.  In S&amp;P2, you have incentive to not just defeat the enemy, but to do  well  - you only get a few healing potions per level, so the better you fight, the more health you'll have in the next battle. In Runespell, you heal fully between every fight so who cares as long as you win.
82	1	a	RPG with poker mechanics. I hate poker.  Why not rummy mechanics? 7.5/10
42	0	a	This game gave me AIDS,Herpes,Hepatitis,Cancer,Syphilis,Erectile Dysfunction and Tourettes. ♥♥♥♥ this game and it's preferred soft drink brand, I would rather have sex with the letter 69 then play another second of this ♥♥♥♥ing abysmal game. 10/10
84	1	a	nice little solitare/poker card game. The humor is alright. No bugs. the only complaint i have is there is no autosave but you can save manually so if you computer turns off etc and you for got to save your poop out of luck. (I'm clearly talking from experience.)
86	1	a	Reminds me a lot of Puzzle Quest but the computer cheats significantly less. Pretty fun little time killer, a cool take on RPG battles, but luck is a pretty heavy component so be prepared to lose because there are no card to chain sometimes. If you can get it for cheap then why not, it's more engaging than Solitaire for christ sakes.
88	1	a	Wow! What a great game. Neat take on turn-based strategy. Good story and characters as well. And a great price to boot!
90	1	a	Fun game. It's not as deep as Puzzle Quest, but it's pretty fun approach to poker.
92	1	a	Mix Magic: The Gathering with Poker and Solitaire, and you'd come up with something along the lines of Runespell: Overture. Awesome game.
94	1	a	I thought magic the gathering was nerd poker. This game takes nerd poker to a new level. It's not bad but it's not that great. The artwork is pretty decent.
96	1	a	Mix Magic: The Gathering with Poker and Solitaire, and you'd come up with something along the lines of Runespell: Overture. Awesome game.
98	1	a	A pretty good game. Especially for the price.
100	1	a	Surprisingly addictive; like Puzzle Quest, but with poker
102	1	a	Pretty cool solitaire with RPG elements. The story isn't the most outstanding fantasy, but it did remind me of reading a Forgotten Realms book, a bit. It doesn't help that the story ends halfway through its overall telling, implying that there's a sequel which remains to be seen, though supposedly the studio is working on a new poker-rpg title for release this year. Whether or not that's a sequel to Overture, I do not know.
104	1	a	Combines a poker-style card game with Puzzle Quest battles. There's a quest, but you can skip all the dialogue and just get on with the game. It's not that challenging, but it's entertaining.
106	1	a	A neat game with a mix of strategy and puzzle fighter. love it!
108	1	a	Wish there was a neutral rating for games like this... Not bad because I like card games combined with RPG elements but this one has some serious flaws (too repetitive, lack of content etc) and mostly the end game. It sucks so much...
110	1	a	If you like mixing poker with adenturing around, this is a good one for you.
44	0	a	Sorta easy to follow uncomplex card game with a pretty unsatisfying combat mechanic. I enjoyed it to start with and it quickly got boring.,
112	1	a	Take a bit of Nordic and Old English myths, add in some poker, and throw in a dash of epic. Well worth checking out...
114	1	a	Runespell: Overture - Solid 7/10 TL:DR; Looks like a port from Mobile, but plays well enough to let you enjoy it. Good graphics, bad sound, decent gameplay idea.   Graphics: 8/10 Game appears behaving like a typical mobile title, with big icons, colourful sprites, single click interface. This is rather small title, so not much can be expected - but it does not disapoint anywhere.   Sound: 5/10 Absolutelly atrocious music, unfit for a title, where you need to pause for a while and think about your choices.  Sound effects are average to say at best, nothing that will make a lasting impact or increase immersion. Could be worse.  Storyline: 7/10 There is a story line, suprisingly, quite decent one. There seem to be no nonsense in story arcs, characters do all fit the setting. Unfortunatelly dialogues are absolutelly atrocious. You have a medieval world full of legends with dialogues using words from modern teenagers dictionary. Unpolished dialogue lines are possibly the greatest issue I had while playing that game (after I turned off the music).  Gameplay: 7/10 There are issues with a screen display and game settings not being saved correctly.  This is quite visible, because the game is best played in 30m to 1h bursts rater than as single continuous experience.  And the experience is sometimes uneven.  This game features poker-like mechanism of matching cards in 5 sets of poker type hands to perform 'attacks' that damage health of your opponens. This is as fun as it sounds, but wait, there is more! You can steal cards from your opponent hand, you have runecards (effectively magic, limited use), companion cards (unlimited use), passive cards that increase your stats.  This extra layer of cards is put separate from your regular playing cards that you match during a duel.   This is as cool as it sounds, however the single duel can take a long time and its outcome is quite often random - as the card you get are randomized - which means that in 30m of gameplay you will have 3 to 5 duels (five being lucky) and some story line.  Past that it is really repetitive and that is why playing this game in short sessions is recommended.  Solid 7/10, recommend buy if a fan of a genre, wait for sale if not.
116	1	a	The mix of poker and MTG is fun! Plus, I worked on this game!
118	1	a	At first sight a very simple game , but it grows in complexity as you keep playing. Besides it's a nice way to learn how to play poker in an 'RPGistic' way through a nice storyline, I totally recommend it.
120	1	a	If you remotely like poker and RPGs, pick this up. This game is addictive. Got this in the Toxic Bundle from Bundle Stars.
122	1	a	Interesting twist on Poker with RPG elements
124	1	a	Somewhat different card based game with a fantasy setting. I really liked it, though it gets pretty difficult after the inital fast progress. I'm more a casual kind of player of such games, and found it requiring a little bit to much tactical thought for my taste. Otherwise, a wholehearted recommendation for this game, especially if you like this type of game, and enjoy a little bit of tactical challenge in a fundamentally poker-based card game.
126	1	a	Its pretty much like Puzzle Quest, but with poker replacing bejeweled. Pretty fun. Its a good game to play while half-focused on something else
128	1	a	if you love poker, you'll love this game!!!
130	1	a	A nice turn-based RPG with a playing-card/poker mechanic. Lots of options to allow for various strategies.
132	1	a	Odd mix of poker...points for card combos cause damage... and fantasy card game..spells to defend or attack.. but it works. Addictive despite it's faults ( mainly not being able to cancel selections in the trade screen and having to buy the cards to replace used ones ). Good card game
134	1	a	An entertaining poker + solitaire combo with decent production values behind it. Probably won't take more than a week to beeat, but I bet you'll have fun while doing it. I particularly like the music, and the combat is fast paced and fun... for a card game.
136	1	a	A very good casual RPG-poker game with perfectly fitting music and visual style.  Worth the weight.
138	1	a	It's that kind of game where you fight your ennemies by playing games against them in the style of puzzle quest, but , here you play poker. The idea is ok but the game itself can be boring at times and I stopped playing it when I reached a point where the game was curiously hard and apparently I had to do some grinding against weak ennemies in order to have the items needed to fight a boss or something. On the other hand , it's now really cheap .
140	1	a	This game is addictive as hell. (For a card game)
142	1	a	An entertaining poker + solitaire combo with decent production values behind it. Probably won't take more than a week to beeat, but I bet you'll have fun while doing it. I particularly like the music, and the combat is fast paced and fun... for a card game.
144	1	a	Solitaire, poker and Yahtzee combine to propel a combination RPG/CCG game for surprisingly enjoyable results.
146	1	a	Puzzle Quest meets Solitaire/Poker... Pretty interesting blend.
148	1	a	This game is addictive as hell. (For a card game)
150	1	a	Wow! What a great game. Neat take on turn-based strategy. Good story and characters as well. And a great price to boot!
152	1	a	Reminds me a lot of Puzzle Quest but the computer cheats significantly less. Pretty fun little time killer, a cool take on RPG battles, but luck is a pretty heavy component so be prepared to lose because there are no card to chain sometimes. If you can get it for cheap then why not, it's more engaging than Solitaire for christ sakes.
154	1	a	Poker meets puzzle quest. Very fun game, some fights feel overhwelming difficult though while others are a walkthrough.
156	1	a	Very unique and fun twist on poker. If you like Puzzle Quest or just like poker/other card games, then you should give it a try at least. There's a demo out but the game is worth the price for sure.
158	1	a	WOW! I mean, this is just an awesome game! It offers the wonderful stragetic aspects of poker, with the bejeweled like rush of just creating attacks and chaining them. Sure, the poker aspect can be offputting for some people, but the liberal moving of the cards makes this game a lot more fun!
160	1	a	Runespell: Overture was fun. It reminds me a lot of PuzzleQuest, except matching blocks was replaced with competitive solitaire. Build those those trips, quads, and boats to attack the enemy. There's also spells and other typical RPG trappings. Good stuff. It's the first chapter of a larger story. It wasn't that long and the game abruptly ends.
162	1	a	It's like Puzzle Quest but with poker instead of gems. Although there's not the same depth as the Puzzle Quest series it's still a lot of fun.
164	1	a	I love this game. It's just a bit short. Got it as part of a bundle but it is probably worth a few quid
166	1	a	If you like card games, you will like this competative version of poker and roll playing. I had so much fun with the demo, I had to purchase the full version. Only complaint, it's too short. Give it a try, you'll like it.
50	0	a	I have tried repeatedly to get into this game and I just can't. I find it dreadfully boring and I usually like games that do the puzzle quest thing. I'd skip this unless you really like the idea of playing a poker/solitaire mashup a puzzle quest-esque progression. Trust me, it's not as interesting as it sounds.
168	1	a	Great game, highly recommended!
170	1	a	5/10  Runespell: Overture is a single-player turn-based RPG that uses poker rules and the game takes between 8-10 hours to complete. Combat involves setting up poker combinations (flushes, full houses etc.) with different combinations dealing different amounts of damage. You can use your own cards or even steal individual visible cards from your opponents. Dealing and receiving damage builds 'rage points' (essentially mana) that can be consumed to use spells (damage spells, defense spells, etc). I would recommend this game for someone who wants a throwaway game to occupy a bit of time.  Pros: - Easy-to-grasp gameplay concept - Novelty poker rules are interesting in the RPG genre  Cons: - Forgettable 'plot' - weak story - Can be frustrating at times due to the RNG nature of cards
172	1	a	It's a mix of solitaire, with a bit of poker and elements from RPGs that is really addictive!
174	1	a	If you like poker, this game isn't bad, unfortionatly I can't run it anymore since I upgraded to windows 8. Like I said unforttionatly. Well anyone who likes poker and has windows 7 or less go for it get the game
53	0	a	5 battles in and the repetitiveness of the game has already turned me off to it. Not to mention there is no volume slider to adjust the sound just on and off buttons. I'm not adjusting the computer sound and all of the background things I have going on just to hear the sound on this game.
54	0	a	Don't let the tags fool you; this is not an RPG. A Royal Flush deals the same amount of damage in hour 1 as it does in hour 5. My 1st steam purchase where I felt I wasted my money.
176	1	a	Fun game. However, needs a few things to be really enjoyable.  1. Autosaving. This game has NO autosaving. I found this out when I closed the game and reloaded, only to find I had no save data available. There were three hours of work. 2. When I stack together a straight flush or a royal flush and hit my opponent, the game really ought to have some cool super attack special or something. I felt miffed when I got royal flushes time and again, hitting for a whopping 50 damage, and it was the same piddly animation as always.  That being said, it's a fun Solitaire+Poker+RPG, and I rate it a solid 9/10.
178	1	a	A fun game, if a little challenging.
180	1	a	surprisingly nice cards game using poker mechanics. had few hours of fun with it. they just released it on iOS, too.
56	0	a	It's oké, but not really cool. I wish there was a neutral button, because I wouldn't recommend, but also I can't call this game bad. Luckily there is a demo, so you can try, sadly it doesnt get more interesting after you buy the game when the demo finishes.
182	1	a	Amazingly fun game. Unfortunatly it lacks multiplayer and even after a year of waiting, it seems like the Devs aren't too keen on expanding what could have been an incredible thing,
184	1	a	A simple fantasy-themed card fighting game based loosely on poker.  It's debatable how much tactical depth there is here, and how much 'role playing' there is on offer. Maybe one to avoid if you're after something with real depth.  Nevertheless it does possess just enough of something to keep my attention. As a simple/casual game to de-stress to it ticks the box.
186	1	a	This is a game about killing orcs. The concept is simple enough, but the execution is high quality.   The game is basically a 3rd person shooter in which you have to defend a magical rift in a castle from a horde of orcs and other monsters that are trying to get through it. If too many monsters make it to the rift you lose.   One man against a relentless horde of monsters may not seem fair, but you have a lot of advantages. In addition to your trusty crossbow, you'll have a large arsenal of spells, traps, and guardians to help out. Furthermore you earn skulls for completing levels, and you can then spend these skulls on further upgrading your arsenal.  At the start of each level you'll have time to plan and set up your defenses and get a feel for the layout of the area. You'll be told where the orcs are coming from, what route they are likely to take, how many waves there are, and even what monsters you can expect to come knocking down your door.  This is important because, despite the simple premise of 'orcs must die,' this is really a tactician's game. The first few levels you may be able to survive using just your crossbow, but as the difficulty level increases you will have to diversify your tactics or perish. You'll start facing more orcs, tougher monsters, monsters that come from multiple entrances, and even multiple rifts that must be defended simultaneously.   I will give one bit of warning that is not mentioned in the game-- if you intend to play on the default (war mage) difficulty level as I did, in order to earn the maximum of 5 skulls per level you not only need to prevent any orcs from reaching the rift, you've also got to do it within the par time. Once you start the initial wave the timer starts, and it doesn't stop even during the 'break' periods you sometimes get between waves.  The game is single player only. The graphics and music are adequate, but not AAA quality (this is an indie game, after all, and I don't expect AAA quality here).  There is a storyline which is short, simple, and entertaining. Borderlands fans will recognize the voice of Axton the Commando as the War Mage.  If you like third person shooters or defense-centered gameplay you'll like Orcs Must Die!
188	1	a	Single-player tower defense thing where you seek to commit massacre against poor huggly green people who just want to leave their crappy homelands for a better place. If you do play this game, do so with the knowledge that you are a terrible person who willingly makes enemies walk into spike-traps, get grinded up into goo, and catapulted into lava pits.  Enjoy the murder! :P
190	1	a	Here we have a very fun game, but it can get you very angry when you try to complete it perfectly. I completed with multiple rage quits.  The proposal is simple, tower defense, prevent the orcs from reaching the portal, there are different types of enemies with different behaviors. The fun is to develop a strategy with the available traps, exploring the scenario in order to exterminate all. The vision in the third person possibility you to actively participate in the struggle, something different in these types of games.  With a fun and intuitive gameplay, the graphics also pleases with his cartoonish appearance, the sound of stacks of orcs being crushed and torn is comforting. The plot is simple, just an excuse to kill orcs in many ways.  7.5/10
192	1	a	Excellent tower defense-ish game! It's smooth, colorful, bloody, violent and pretty damn difficult at times. It's a lot like a single player Dungeon Defenders. Removing the multiplayer makes it easier to see whats going on, and allows for more creative thinking. Each new level, trap and ability you unlock will leave you thirsty for more and more Orc blood!  The traps are extremely divers and fun to experiment with. Some combos work better than others, and some strategies are easier for different people.  The pace of the game will keep you on your toes, and the learning curve is well balanced. With the constant addition of new enemies and new traps, your tactic will have to change throughout the game.  Its a good length for the content as well. If it was longer, it would feel drawn out or not leave enough room for omd2.  Over all, this game is a lot of fun and worth buying – on sale! I only stress that this is bought on sale because you can play all of the omd maps on omd2 – with or without a friend.   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=7261685 
194	1	a	One of the most original tower D games ever made. I usually shy away from single player but I did enjoy this game immensely.
196	1	a	 This is a long review so if you want just a brief summary of why I recommend Orcs Must Die! then skip to  Results  and read from there.   Robot Entertainment mixes elements of different game types to conjure up a brilliant rendition of the tower defense genre. Taking action packed battles and mixing them with strategy you get a game that pushes both hack ‘n slash as well as base management.    Story:  The order has fallen, the last War Mage is dead, and protecting the realm is now left up to you his apprentice. You must fight your way through the unlimited hordes of orcs as you defend the rifts from falling into the wrong hands. As you press through your adventure you come to learn the evil forces are being led by a corrupted War Mage who plans to destroy humanity. Will you be able to save the world from falling into darkness?    Campaign:  The campaign is broken down into three acts. The first act has ten levels, the second act has 8, and the third act has 6. Despite each act having fewer levels than the last they are all about the same length as the number of waves increases throughout the campaign. Each level unlocks a new element to the game and once you’ve completed the level you gain the new item for any preceding or future level. Each time you beat a level you get a rating of one to five skulls, unlike most games these skulls actually are given to you as a currency which you can use to upgrade items. You can only get five skulls per level, meaning you cannot beat a level scoring five skulls then play it again to get another five skulls. Each level you can choose from a mastery tree that allows you to kit yourself out for that level, based on your strategies this can vary greatly throughout the campaign. You will progressively unlock more tower/item slots, which start as you only being able to equip three towers/items but later on you’ll find yourself with 10+ slots. You play the entire game in third person, and similar to other games of the genre you are able to join in the battle and help your towers out. This means you are not just sitting there waiting between waves, but rather taking an active part into the gameplay. Some levels you may find yourself not needing to join in, while others you will be right in the fray.    Gameplay:  Each level allows you to equip an inventory which allows you to choose from a combination of spells, weapons, and towers. There are two weapons (crossbow and bladestaff), four spells (flame bracers, ice amulet, lightning ring, and wind belt), two guardians (paladins and archers), and 17 towers. I found myself typically sticking to the same set throughout the entire campaign, but there are many different strategies you can go for. By placing player activated traps you can take a large part of the game, you can sit back and use guardians to do most of the work, or even mix and match. The gameplay is fast paced and really pulls you into the mix by getting you to experience new elements each level.    Artifacts of Power DLC:  Artifacts of Power is a DLC that includes new items and towers. The DLC includes two traps (Shock Zapper and Floor Scorcher) and two spells (Vampiric Gauntlets and Alchemist Satchel). I used the Floor Scorcher and Vampiric Gauntlets a few times, found the Shock Zapper completely useless (as you need a roof for it to function), and used the Alchemist Satchel to get a +50 kill streak for the achievement. All and all this DLC isn’t exactly necessary, but if you can get it on sale and included in the pack it’s worth grabbing.    Lost Adventures DLC:  Lost Adventures is a DLC that includes new level, enemies, and even a new tower. There are five new levels, which offer more skulls allowing for even more upgrades. There are two new enemies the Frost Bat, and Cyclops Mage. It also includes one new trap the mana well which allows you to refill your mana gauge. This DLC is completely worth it as it adds additional content, new enemies, towers, and refined leaderboards. If you can get this on sale or in the bundle you will not regret it.    Results:  Orcs Must Die is an epic tower defense hack ‘n slash game that keeps you pressed and wanting more. With rating systems that actually give you rewards, fun and interesting enemies, a long and arduous campaign, and an amusing little story Orcs Must Die is a Must Buy (too easy). If you are looking for something similar to Sang-Froid or Sanctum this is pretty much in that line. Once you beat Orcs Must Die you’ll feel like you need to buy the second one as it makes you just want to play more.   Pros: +Leaderboard system that allows you to rank yourself amongst friends. +Level rating out of five skulls which can then be used to buy upgrades. +Loads of spells, weapons, and towers to choose from. +Skill trees which can be customized each level to allow you to change how you play (more player intensive, tower support, or mixture of both). +Smooth graphics which look good and don’t push it too far. +Funny and amusing dialogue which gives you a laugh without being offensive. +Intense amount of action, keeps you pressed and fighting between each wave. +Built in level traps (such as rolling locks, acid pots, lava pots, and ballista).  Cons: -I had a few levels glitch where an enemy wouldn’t leave the spawn point and thus I couldn’t kill it requiring me to restart (this was annoying if it was at the end of the level). -If Gnoll Hunters fall into acid pits they do not die (as I learned when I set up a level that used nearby acid pits to kill enemies).  -One of the DLC levels (Reverse Tower) is just The Tower in Reverse. I know this is obvious from the title, but if you purchase the DLC before playing the game its disappointing to find out one of the levels is the same thing just backwards.
198	1	a	Amazing game, totally love it &lt;3.  It has everything to spend a great evening: +Cartoonish but high quality graphics - Great animantions of everything - traps, spells, orcs deaths. Lovely. +Variety of enemies (and even allies) - different enemies, different approaches. +Gameplay: provides awesome replayability which is just great for a singleplayer game - this is a towerdefence game AND you are playing as a hero that places those towers, so you can play with more offensive traps so they do everything for you, you can put more effort into leveling your character and kill all the orcs manually, or you can buy some troops and make more defensive traps to block the enemies. Great game. Good level design and nice story. +If you lucky enough - you can catch this game for 90% on sale - instabuy (dont forget the dlcs they are very usefull) +3 difficulties +Nice OST  Overall, i loved everything about this game. Very well done.
200	1	a	You play as baby Gandalf and you save Mordor with your pew pew magic.  RIP in peace many orcs.
202	1	a	Fun casual tower defense game. Around 10 building types, around 10 buildings upgrades plus some additional weapon/skills. Pretty cool orc variations and nice map layouts. Fun to play when you have less than an hour to spare.  The great thing about the game =&gt; no weapon reloading! Once I'm done with Orcs Must Die I will buy the sequel :)
204	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is a dynamic combination of arcade game and tower defense. The action takes place in a fantasy land where the biggest threat to humanity are hordes of orcs. We, as an unlucky mage, must keep order in the whole castle. Simple, isnt it? Graphics looks more than good. Whole, maintained in a characteristic, slightly cartoon style is conceptually shapely, ingenious and simply pretty, works flawlessly. Hours pleasant annihilation of opponents.  Because good orc is a dead orc.
206	1	a	For those who don't know, it's a third-person tower defense set in a fantasy world. You're a war mage and your job is to defend the human world from the invading orcs. That's the synopsis in a nut shell without giving too much away, the rest is orc slaying fun history.  There's a variety of useful items including but not limited to 2 main weapons, 4 spells, 10 ground traps, 4 wall traps, 3 ceiling traps, 2 minions, and 3 'Weavers.' All of those have various uses and abilities and it's all up to you as to how to best deploy them against the enemy. That's not even including the DLC. Weavers are simply menus with available upgrades you can purchase with cash earned from waves. You get a limit of which items you can use per mission, the max being 9 available slots. You are also able to upgrade traps when the time comes with 'skulls' earned after each victory. So it's somewhat tactical, you need to strategise your approach when starting a new map. It gives you a moment of grace to choose which traps to use and to scout the map.  The music is upbeat and catchy, it compliments the protagonists witty commentary and the bloody orc slaying perfectly. I haven't encountered anything negative to say about it.  The sounds effects are crisp and simple, nothing special of note here. The one sound that got on my nerves was the Autoballista firing sound, it's a loud  WHOOOOSH  and drives me nuts when I have a lot of them. Other than that, I don't mind the rest, it's very atmospheric. The sound that sent chills down my spine was the sound a flock of Fire Babies makes, it's very ominous.  There's no endless mode, if you want an endless mode then get the second game. However, you can create a mod of the existing levels and add or modify waves. It's hands-on and takes patience and some planning on your part to do this, it's not an in-game feature.   Pros:
208	1	a	Don`t waste time reading critics about the game , it`s great ! Play it and have fun.
210	1	a	HANDS DOWN - The Best Purchase Of The Year  There simply aren't a lot of games these days that really bring to the table what Orcs Must Die does. The concept is simple, easy to learn, harder to master. Very addictive and very satisfying to play.   Not sure yet? Looking for a description of the game? Basically it's an indie 3rd POV Tower Defense, with Warcraft look &amp; feel and the action of Team Fortress 2.  If your looking for a reason not to purchase, I really can't give you any and that's been while since I've had that with any game!
212	1	a	I should have read the tags. If you like tower defense games, this one is probably pretty good. It kept me entertained for about 4 hours, and I absolutely hate tower defense games.  If you don't like tower defense games then you should not be viewing this store page.
214	1	a	Very good game, I'm waiting for next part.
216	1	a	Totally recommendable. One of those games you can’t stop playing once you start. Finishing the game on Nightmare mode was a real challenge, but I’ve enjoyed every second I played it.  Congrats to the developers!
218	1	a	I absolutely love this game. Great tower defense game. It has a great and memorable soundtrack. I would get tracks stuck in my head that would compel me to play more Orcs Must Die. The orcs are funny, the graphics are smooth and visually appealing, and a game that has enough challenge without taking away the most important part; the fun. There are few games that after I have completed that would whisper in my ear 'dun-dun-dundundun now that you've finished Nightmare difficulty you gotta go back and get 5/5 skulls on each map' Which I did, and loved every second.  You won't regret buying this game. Do it, for the orcs.
220	1	a	Glorifying the slaughter of innocent orcs.
222	1	a	The gameplay is gritty, easy to learn, and difficult to master. The game is quirky, doesn't take itself too seriously, and is easy to pick up, but hard to put back down. It has a few shortcomings (no CoOp), and Nightmare isn't quite as difficult in this original as it was in the sequel, but the gameplay is still going to challenge players of every skill level.  For those of us who love Tower Defense/FPS hybrids, this game is a solid purchase at anything under $10, and a steal when it dips below $5. If you play through the achievements (all of which are reasonable), you can expect about 15 hours of very enjoyable gameplay.
224	1	a	Orcs Must Die is the classic tower defense game with the added twist your character being controlled in the first person perspective and equipped to help out when those wall mounted axes isn't quite getting the job done. First person tower defense is nothing new but it is how solid and streamlined Orcs Must Die feels that makes it stand apart from it's competitors.  You are the last of the War Mages, not the brightest, not the strongest, just the last one. And you are all that stands between the peasants of the land living in an idyllic medieval utopia and being introduced to the business end of a rusty axe. To stem the tide of orcs pouring in through magical portals you must progress to a succession of levels killing increasingly larger and more diverse waves of enemies. To help you on this task you have your trusty crossbow and variety of traps and magic.  You start each level by choosing which traps and weapons you want to use, completing missions unlocks more and completing them well allows you to upgrade them. As you slay orcs you earn gold which can then be used to place more traps or to gain various in-mission upgrades. As the levels progress you are introduced to all the classic tower defense enemies, the fast runners, the big slow damage sponges, the attackers that run straight for you, the suicide bombers that can kill your barricades, the fliers that follow completely separate paths from their ground dwelling kin and every other enemy that has been in every other tower defense game to date.  Graphically the games goes for a sort of cartoonish look that works fairly well most of the time and the music does the job equally adequate. The various juvenile one liners being spouted by your character grows tiresome rather quickly however.  There really isn't much to set Orcs Must Die apart from any of the other tower defense games out there, it does everything they do and never strays too far from the path of tried and true. What makes it shine however, is how extremely solid it all is. No action is wasted and every item in the game feels like it serves a purpose. The gameplay is tight and satisfying and although the nature of the genre makes it repeat itself quite a lot as you reach the higher difficulties it manages to maintain a longer lifespan than most tower defense games.  All in all Orcs Must Die is your standard first person tower defense game, extremely well made and a must have for any fans of the genre but not a game that will attract any newcomers or a game that brings anything new to the genre. A tried and true fomular, executed solidly.
226	1	a	Orcs Must Die embellishes your devious side, encouraging you to devise clever ways of fulfilling the command of the title. For the not-so-clever, mowing down invaders with an automatic crossbow is also a great time. Whatever your approach, an orc's pain is your gain.
228	1	a	What a GREAT Christmas gift, thank you Mat!! I would highly recommend this game to all my friends who are looking for a fun, single player with endless opportunities to kill hoards of orcs!!
230	1	a	Pros: Fantastic mix of tower-defense and FPS genres, allowing you to tailor your experience to whichever you prefer. Additionally, decent graphics and music, and hilarious tongue-in-cheek narration (you may recognize the voice actor as Axton from Borderlands 2 Cons: Extremely difficult to get 5 skulls in some of the levels, which requires many replays (it reminded me of the rating system for Angry Birds in that way) Recommendation: Buy the game. It's so addicting.
232	1	a	This is a singleplayer game, but you'll definitely get your money's worth from the lengthy campaign.  From Robot Entertainment, developer of Halo Wars. Orcs Must Die lets you play dungeon interior decorator and build playgrounds of orcish murder. So go on and have fun.
234	1	a	Pros  +Good variety of traps, weapons, and spells that allow for different playstyles. Want to go heavy on traps? How about heavy on spells and weapons? Or a nice mixture of both? Finding the perfect combination for what works for you can feely very rewarding and fun. +Good map variance. Maps can force you to switch your build so there's rarely a comfort setup that works for everything.  +Good music that very rarely grows tiresome or reptitive. +Graphics are good and still hold up even several years later. Gives off a cartoony vibe, which I enjoyed. +Good variety of enemies that require different combinations to kill effectively. +A good amount of challenge from the Nightmare level maps that might require multiple set ups or attempts to figure out the perfect combination.  Cons  -Some of the voice lines that trigger when you set up traps can grow tiresome and reptitive really quickly. -I suffered some audio issues where a voice line would either stutter halfway through (but the gameplay would be fine) and some waves on some maps just not playing music. -The story is nearly non existant, but who plays a tower defense game for the story? -No Co-Op or online play.  Overall Orcs Must Die! is a very fun rewarding Tower Defense / Third Person Shooter hybrid that I highly recommend to fans of those genres.
236	1	a	Like Tower Defence games? Check. Like trying to find the perfect combination of traps? Check. None too fond of Orcish Hordes? Check.  Oooooh boy are you in for a treat.
238	1	a	1
240	1	a	Good game i have all DLC´s
242	1	a	A third person tower defense game based around traps and killing orcs. Addictive and very fun gameplay. Has a large variety of levels offering many fun challenges. Nightmare mode offers a little more of a challenge as you need to know exactly how you want to set up your traps and make sure you don't do any misplacements. I was really addicted to this game when it first came out, and bought Orcs Must Die 2 to play with my brother.   Pros: + A large selection of fun traps you can use to maximise killing efficiency + A good selection of levels to play  + Addictive, fast-paced gameplay where you have to use your hero to his maximum potential alongside the traps.  Cons: - I tend not to like it when games offer dlc for extra cash, however the game of year edition is quite cheap when on sale, do it doesn't matter quite so much anymore.  My Score: 9/10
244	1	a	game is kind of racist
246	1	a	I got this game from a bundle sale, I wasn't expecting it to be good.  After some months after buying this game I gave it a try and the experience is sweet!  The game offers you a simple yet challenging gameplay.  Like a tower defense game you only need to prevent the enemies (in this game Orcs,Gnolls,Ogres,etc.) from getting into the Portal (Rift).  You can plant traps and use you hero to cut them,shoot, and kill them with spells, this makes the game more interactive. (which isn't like other tower defense game where you have to wait and watch after planting your towers)  The story is good too simple and funny which makes getting to another level somehow enjoyable as you get to know what and why the orcs are attacking.  The Hero isn't boring either and you get to somehow love the guy as his humor and sarcasm is pretty entertaining and funny.  Grab this game and have some fun. (Have some fun and watch what the traps do to the Orcs.) 
248	1	a	Orcs must die is a tower defence game, without towers. You place traps in expansive hallways and court yard like areas to defend rifts from a massive amount of Orcs. Hundreds on screen at once running toward your rift. You have traps, spells and weapons to fight them back and away from the rift and you are going to need every little bit of help you can get to work the field. So prepare properly and get ready to hold down the fort. Go buy this game!
250	1	a	This game is great for when you want to take out your daily frustrations on something.  YAY for mindless violence ^w^  So simple so addictive &lt;3
252	1	a	Simple, yet fun! A factor that many modern games seem to forget.
254	1	a	Easily one of my favourite games. Truly it is fun setting up traps and slashing/burning/shooting/etc these orcs.
256	1	a	We always think about killing games to include either people or zombies, I never think about orcs. But after playing this killing orcs, ogres and trolls seems to be as easy as threshing a colbalt into a grinder.  The game is a tower defense, with it's main focus being on the traps you setup along the orcs path and not so much your weapons. It allows you to strategize and be creative, in a way I think it helps you intellectually by seeing things in different perspectives as to how you'll set up your traps. By the end of your first level, you'll be dancing to the victory song while screaming, 'ORCS MUST DIE!'
258	1	a	Do I recommend this game? Erm. . . sort of. If you buy Orcs Must Die! And Orcs Must Die! 2, then the levels from game 1 become available in game 2. So I recommend that you buy the first game, but not actually play it.
260	1	a	You get what you pay for. If you are looking for a deep history or a complex rpg level system this is not your game, it's a pure third person action tower defense, well balanced, really endurable graphics and tones of addictive arcade fun
262	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is a fun, addictive game that combines twitchy, arcade shooter goodness with tower defense mechanics to hold back the neverending tide of Orc invaders. The levels are well designed and the traps are some of the most unique I've seen in the genre. From bubbling pools of lava, to spring boards that launch enemies into ponds of acid, as well as the classic spike and arrow traps, you'll have more options than you know what to do with. The story is basic but complimented by funny banter from the main character and is told through voice over and still images.  Perhaps the games greatest strength relies in the the 3rd person shooter elements. You're not relegated to simply laying traps and hoping for the best. Instead, you can fight alongside your machinations, whether it's with a spear, crossbow, or magic; you yourself lend a hand in achieving victory. It's fun and fast paced and keeps the player engaged in each level as well as providing room for error when setting up traps. This is something, I feel, the genre as a whole is in need of. Too often in these style of games, the player is relagated to one or two winning strategies that are only uncovered through tedious trial and error. In Orcs Must Die!, the player can create endless combinations to achieve victory precisely because they can shoot and stab the orcs alongside the traps.  In the end, it's a fun, addictive game with 3 difficulty levels and plenty of replay value. There's also a sequel worth mentioning. So if you like tower defense games, this is a must buy. If you don't, I'd still check this out on the cheap during a steam sale. It just might surprise you.
264	1	a	I love the game for it's humor. Your alter ego is a dork and his victory dance over defeated enemies hilarious. When I saw it first time I almost died laughting. The game itself is a tower defense variation in 3D where towers are replaced with traps. You will find malicous pleasure in seeing endless hordes of souless orcs being impaled, burned, squadshed, shattered, flipped, electrocuted, dissected and pummled to death.  Thanks to the game comic style it's not graphic but hilariously funny.
266	1	a	Was not expecting a high quality gameplay from a bargain. i rate 8/8.
268	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is one h*ll of an amazing game. I loved it so much that I played it over and over again until I got all the achievements for the game and cleared every single stage (including the ones from the DLC) with flawless victories. Then I still kept playing just for the heck of it. And I mean, I usually don't even bother getting every achievement for the games I play.  I don't really remember why I chose to buy this game at first. I must've got the game w/o even watching the gameplay because I thought this is one of those old, classic tower defense games. The thing is, it was actually so much more than that. This game is an excellent combination of a third person action shooter with a tower defense-like aspect.  The best part of the game is there are so many ways you can play this game (depending on the stages and your preferences). You can just lay a whole lot of traps and watch the hapless orcs get sliced, crushed, and burned to cinders without even lifting a finger (this usually requires some advanced traps and upgrades you get about halfway through the game, so you won't be able to do this from the very start). You can also become the ultimate orc-slayer and butcher hundreds of orcs single-handedly with your crossbow and bladestaff (well, with the help of a few barricades to limit their paths). Or you can actually act like a War'mage' by equipping yourself with a bunch of different magic armaments and blast the orcs with arcane fury (again with the help of some barricades, I suppose).  Depending on which traps and spells you choose to employ, the possibilities are practically endless. You just have to be creative.  Also, this game differs from those boring, classic tower defences where you just build the towers, sit, watch, and wait until the long waves end. This game is fast paced (especially on insane difficulty where you only get 3 seconds for preparations!) and action-packed. Even if you choose to just build a whole lot of towers and watch, you will still feel like you are constantly 'In-action' due to the way the levels are designed.  One warning here though: if you absolutely hate third person shooters, this might not be the game for you  as you do have to make extensive use of your crossbow in the early game (but as I said, it is possible to completely rely on your traps and guardians and not lift a finger on most of the later stages if you so choose). Another possible downside of the game is that it has no co-op or multiplay (which became the central part of the later series of this game). It's a pure single-play game. I personally think this is completely acceptable because: 1. If you absolutely want co-op, you can just play the sequels; 2. Unlike the sequels, where the levels are designed for multiple players, the level design of this game is made to be challenging but manageable for a single player.
270	1	a	Awesome because ORCS MUST DIE!!! Seriously now, awesome from all points but the bad thing is : FFS why not co-op !!!
272	1	a	So much fun, killing orcs! This game needs multiplayer :D. Buy it, play it, achieve skulls ... and you know why? Because ORCS MUST DIE! (in so many ways).
274	1	a	Revenge of the Shrek Memes: It is Ogre,  Is an incredibly fun and addictive tower defense game that lets you take revenge on the stale Shrek memes, you can burn them, electrocute them, suck out their life and many more torturous ways to hurt (kill) those Shrek memes.. It's sequels (The Shrek Memes return and The Shrek has been unchained) are great too! (Maybe not The Shrek has been unchained)  I say 10/10  Serious Time: The orcs probably want to borrow some sugar, but we don't want to believe that. 10/10!
276	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is yet another take on the now ubiquitous action-tower defense genre. In many ways, it's similar to Dungeon Defenders (see previous review), but you play as only one character and there is no customization, other than what traps you decide to use on each level. That doesn't make it bad, however. In fact, it's a real plus in the game's favor... as the main character is, well, quite a character! I guarantee his goofy lines will bring a smile to your face. Gameplay is standard fare for the genre - progress through a series of levels in which you must set up traps and defend your magic rift from hordes of orcs. Every new level completed adds a new trap or ally to your arsenal, making for a smooth progression (though nothing is ever really a cakewalk). You will be challenged, for sure... especially on later levels. If you're looking for a new tower defense game (or maybe looking to try one for the first time), Orcs Must Die is about as solid as they come. Give it a look!
278	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is an surprisingly fun and satisfying tower defense/action hybrid based around slaughtering hoards of Orcs in some very creative ways. Playing as a war mage, you use a combination of traps, weapons, and spells to beat hordes of orcs, ogres and other bad guys. The game play is fun, and it's really satisfying to watch the enemies get ripped apart by your traps. There are several levels of difficulty, so even the most skilled players can find a challenge here. The fact that you can upgrade your traps is very handy especially as you move through the levels and there are several DLC for this game as well expanding this game even more. Orcs Must Die! is a very good take on a tower defense game with lots of features and nice graphics. I didn't expect much from this game at first, but it turned out to be surprisingly good!
280	1	a	Plants vs. Zombies but with orcs and in a 3D space. Quite fun.
282	1	a	Donald Trump simulator. A small loan of a million dollars/10
284	1	a	+ Lots of devious traps + Arcade style story that dosent take itself seriosly + Smooth controls with way better graphics then the screenshots show. + Very nice scaling difficulty with Nightmare-mode  - No multiplayer  Better then : Dungeon Defenders
286	1	a	I love Tower Defense games and this definitely has a unique twist to it. Instead of towers, you set traps and fight as yourself in 3rd person. You are rewarded for comboing multiple traps and slowly unlock new traps and powers. I also like the cartoony art style, makes me not feel as bad for slaughtering hundreds of Orcs. Very fun times.
288	1	a	It's like making Orc Salsa!!! Seriously, play this game or you'll die unfufilled, never knowing the pure joy of destroying the Orc and their evil cronies while talking trash as the illegitimate love child of Bruce Cambell and Dirk the Daring. Priceless.
290	1	a	A great single player third person tower defense action/strategy hybrid. You control a Warmage that is able to attack with ranged/melee attacks as well as spells as you defend against waves after waves of nasty orcs that get more difficult over time. The gameplay is very smooth and snappy. An overall well made game that in my opinion (the only opinion that matters) is superior to Dungeon Defenders in every way minus the co-op.
292	1	a	THIS IS THE FIFTH BEST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED
294	1	a	very fun game, a slight twist in the tower defence formula, you have to defend a rift by placing traps, guardians, etc and using your own weapon too to defeat the invading orcs  for old-school gamers, the closest comparison will be 'The Horde', although with less zany humor :p (still quite funny though)
296	1	a	Orcs - Check Genocide - Check Humor - Check Rich in variety - Check Story - Check Achievements- Check  Unfortunately there is no Coop mode, but that's in OMD 2! :F  9/10
298	1	a	The best tower defense game out there probably only because you are actually in it kicking ♥♥♥
300	1	a	its great fun strategic/action orc mashing FUN . need i say more !
302	1	a	Sometimes, i almost feel bad for the orcs. Except... not really.
304	1	a	English:  I'm not an expert in video games, or graphics, or hardware, or anything, I'm just someone who likes to play video games for fun and to tell the truth, with this game I've had tons of fun. What I like is that it combines well the action and strategy parts, you have plenty of options to kill your enemies and that means you can play and play again and again the same level and you'll always find new ways to beat it. Also, if you like the idea of ​​being a wizard and control the elements, cast spells and above all ... to kill thousands of orcs! then this is the game for you.  Therea are many traps at your disposal (you can improve them to make them even more effective) and weapons to choose, to find your own style of play, either fighting melee in the heat of battle or observe from your safe zone at the fortress and let your traps do the dirty work. The learning curve is well achieved with 3 levels of difficulty. If you are the one who doesn't like stories and always skips introductions, prefaces, videos and sometimes even the tutorials, then this game will not give you problems because the story is told as you do the levels and only has a few cinematics so that you can focus on the main task, killing orcs !!!  The only thing I dislike is that if you play in offline mode it won't let you use the orc slayer costume with the double sword, which although pure aesthetic makes you see like a badass XD Finally in short, a great game, plus the sequel is also very good, if you find any of the 2 games on discount, don't hesitate to buy them, you will not regret it.  Español:  Creo que otro análisis sobre este juego esta de más, pero aun asi escribire mi opinión. Para empezar no soy un experto en videojuegos, ni en graficos, ni hardware, ni nada, solo soy alguien a quien le gusta jugar videojuegos para divertirse y la verdad que con este juego lo he hecho bastante. Lo que me gusta es que combina muy bien la parte de acción y la parte de la estrategia, tienes muchisimas posibilidades de acabar con tus enemigos y eso hace que puedas jugar y jugar una y otra vez un mismo nivel y siempre encontrar una nueva manera de pasarlo. Además si te gusta la idea de ser un mago y controlar los elementos, hacer hechizos y sobre todo... matar miles y miles de orcos! entonces este es el juego para ti.  Tienes muchas trampas (que puedes mejorar para hacerlas aún mas efectivas) y armas a elegir para que encuentres tu propio estilo de juego, ya sea combatiendo cuerpo a cuerpo en el calor de la batalla u observar desde tu fortaleza y dejar que tus trampas hagan el trabajo sucio. La curva de aprendizaje esta bien lograda junto con sus 3 niveles de dificultad. Si eres de los que les aburren las historias y se saltan todas las introducciones, prólogos, videos y a veces hasta los tutoriales, pues este juego no te dara problemas ya que la historia te la cuentan conforme haces los niveles y solo tiene unas pocas cinemáticas para que te concentres en lo que es importante, matar orcos!!!  Lo único que no me gusta es que si juegas en modo desconectado no te deja usar el traje de mataorcos con la doble espada, que aunque es pura estetica hace que te veas como todo un malote XD En fin en resumen, todo un juegazo, además la secuela tambien esta muy buena, si encuentras cualquiera de los 2 en descuento no dudes en comprarlos, no te arrepentirás.
306	1	a	Preface: Keep in mind that I am going to review this game... without the DLCs. They're not bad. It's just that I haven't bought them... yet. Even though I've had Orcs Must Die for a while.   The story of the game is about a young-adult, sarcastic, nameless Warmage who's defending rifts in dungeons, which is gateways to the Warmages' medieval world, against waves of Orcs.  I do not wish to spoil any quotes or scenes from the game, because that would just ruin everything.   The gameplay is Tower-Defence... but not in a traditional way with a birds-eye-view. You play as the Warmage in 3rd person, like Gears of War(except, you can't take cover).  You run around in the dungeon, place traps and choose which weapon and spell you are going to choose for the wave.  At the end of each wave, you are presented with a high-score. Depending on how well you played, you will earn orc-skulls to level up your traps/magics/weapons.  The Warmage doesn't Level-up. This game is more based on tactics, than brute strength. Unlike Dungeon Defenders, which came out almost in the same time-frame.   The music in the game is medieval but with a crazy tone to it. I like it.  Sometimes when the Warmage kills an Orc, The Warmage makes a sarcastic/hilarious statement. I can't give away what he says. Like I said, it would just ruin the fun.  It is important that you do not mute the Warmages voice. Because the story presents itself on flashbacks and what the Warmage says during gameplay.   It's a Short-and-Sweet game with a special twist to the story and the gameplay.  Orcs Must die! gets an ''above-great'' 9/10. I highly recommend this game.  [Review in a nutshell] This hilarious game, with green Warhammer 40k orcs, is a ''must have for anyone who loves Tactical-Tower-Defence games''.
308	1	a	I find this game oddly amusing. I, at first, expected a run-around game where you had to go find orcs to kill... but they come to you! I like these strategy games and the graphics are actually well suited for this game. A little bit cartoony but doesn't take away from the aspect. I wish this game had a female character to choose from, but 2 makes up for that! This is my first time playing this game, and I got it since it was on sale on Steam. So worth it!
310	1	a	There is only one thing you must know.   And that is this:  Orcs Must Die.
312	1	a	i love this game so much
314	1	a	Entartaining and humorous exprience 8/10
316	1	a	Tower defense game with excelent aditude.
318	1	a	Awesome single player game, cool story line!
320	1	a	Tower defense with action rpg elements? Count me in! If you've ever enjoyed playing a tower defense game (even those little flash ones) then you HAVE to try this game. Rather than having defense towers, you will be equipped with an impressive collection of traps. This allows for a good amount of strategy and frantic gameplay. Fun, addictive, and challenging.
322	1	a	I bought this game because it was cheap during a sale, and thought it would suck. In fact, it did not suck. I played it alot, and had fun doing so, then just stopped because that's what I do. I should play it again sometime, but I won't.
324	1	a	Easily one of the best games I've played in a long time.
326	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is tons of fun! Tower Defense at it's most fun. The trap variety is great, giving you ample opportunity to come at a map from wildly different directions, and the character dialog is laugh out loud funny! This is a wild and faced paced ride.
328	1	a	A fun active tower defence game, each level unlocks a new defence item and you can bring those back to past levels to help you get three stars, a very cool game with a nice style.
330	1	a	I'm normally not a huge fan of tower defense, but this one is a lot of fun. The humor is charming, the traps are satisfying, the levels have a good difficulty curve, and the whole experience is very polished. Highly recommended!
332	1	a	 'Orcs Must Die!'  is a well designed  indie game  to play a fast round without thinking of playing 'CS: GO' instead.   Desc:  You have a portal with (dependent on difficulty level) 20 lifes, each orc getting into it decreases the life. You goal is to place traps/units and use magic to kill all the orcs without losing any life. At the end you gain skulls for each completed level to upgrade your traps/units. Easy as that.   Pros:  + 'Pointless' killing orcs + Humorously dialogs/story + Awesome level design (no level is the same and each level has its own gimmicks) + Active melee and ranged fight (sword / crossbow) + Terrific trap and unit design (no pointless traps/units) + 3 magical sections + 3 levels of difficulty + No Bugs/Glitches + Downloadable Demo (+ Achievements [some are hard to get]) (+ DLCs)   Cons:  - no Multiplayer (there was a lot of potential to have a MP implemented) - I would write more cons, if I would find some ^^   Recommended , but only if it's  on sale , because there is still the sequel 'Orcs Must Die 2!'.   9/10 
334	1	a	While there's a fair amount of window dressing in the form of traps, guardians, and rifts, Orc Headshot Simulator is the single best game for shooting orcs in the face with a crossbow. Even Orc Headshot Simulator 2 doesn't compare, except for coop mode.
336	1	a	I did all achievments in this game..beat me if you have balls for that!
338	1	a	One of the best discoveries I made on Steam, and with a very affordable price.
340	1	a	The Original, and still my favorite of any of the OMG games.
342	1	a	Wow, What to say here. First this game is worth 50$ Because I have played similar Big name games of this Sub genre and they could not compare at all. Any Fans of Tower defense games or the dungeon master series will not be dissapointed. Gameplay is superbly fun since there are so many different ways you can build your Defense, You can either build defenses and Stay back or get up in the action and hack and slash. All in All i would definetely give this game 5 Thumbs up.
344	1	a	Great game that took tower defense to a new level, but don't buy this one! Orc's Must Die 2 is what you should purchase It's just a better version with more features and coop.
346	1	a	Orcs must die? Definitely!   Ever play Dungeon Defenders? Well, if you have, imagine this is the one where you play alone (a bloody pity) and you do not have to level up or get god-like weapons/pets. You do however, get a bookload of traps and handful of spells to massacre the orcs/ogres/gnolls/batties etc. In most circumstances, I actually had so much more fun with this than Dungeon Defenders (I mainly blame my overpowered Steam friends for it though).  If you never played Dungeon Defenders, well, imagine this as another tower defence game but you get to jump in and massacre the orcs yourself. Spells/traps/archers, plenty of ways to do it =D  Note though, it is a rather short/limited game and it is single player but the joy of seeing that your wonderfully laid traps have worked perfectly - always a fantastico moment! One indie game that totally deserves your attention!
348	1	a	So good. It plays insanely smooth and is absurdly satisfying.
350	1	a	Well orcs must die. Now go KILL SOME ORCS!!!!!!
352	1	a	Can't figure out If I'm bad, or its just too hard. I'm gonna say I'm bad. Good for people who like to restart a lot.  10/10
354	1	a	This is one of the best TDG ive ever played it is funny and gory this is worth the cost
356	1	a	Orcs must die! That one sentence is actually all you have to know about the game with the same title. It's a mixture between tower defense and an kind of action-rpg, where you have to prevent orcs and all their fellow companions like ogres, flying wyvern, and all that good stuff to enter the portals to the outer world. To do this, you have to... kill them. Of course.  Story: If you actually want to play this game because of the story, you're considering buying the wrong game. There is basically no story, except if you call that little bit of dialoges between the hero and the villain a story. They're fun to listen to, as mentioned below aswell, but nothing special. Just the regular 'evil person wants to destroy the world, hero has to stop her'-story. 2/10, but f*ck that, that's not what makes the game the great game it is, so read on.  Gameplay: Before starting a game, you have to decide which items you want to use. There are about 25 different defense elements and 5 weapons for the player, such as a lightning ring, an ice ring or a blade, and of course the crossbow, which is your standard weapon. Then, after having built your line of defence, you enter 'G' and the actual fun begins. Orcs and other creatures come and run to the portal (or portals, as you have multiple ones to protect on higher maps). Depending on your build you'll have to do more or less yourself, while your defence units are killing the mobs. There are three difficulties, one for beginners, 'Warmage-Difficulty' (which is the standard one) and 'Nightmare-Difficulty', which you unlock after beating the game on Warmage-Difficulty. On nightmare, you have only 3 seconds before the game begins, then you can't stop it anymore, so you have to think fast and play fast. There's actually skill required. 9.5/10  Graphics: The game is not the newest. It hasn't got high-end graphics, but I like the comic-style of the art design. It's playful, fun, and excentrical. It fits perfectly to the game and to the main character, who's a little bit narcisstic, sarcastic and feels over-the-top, which makes him super fun. 7/10  Sound/Music: The entire sound is great. While fighting, there's a mixture of rock/metal music with old, somehow medieval music playing. It's fast, it's hard, it rocks, it's just excellent if you like this kind of music. If you headshot enemies, there sometimes might be special e-guitar riffs played, which makes them quite satisfying. The monsters sometimes may comment your actions or say stupid things like 'why does his crossbow shoot 1000 times a second?' with ultra-stupid voices, which makes them REALLY fun to listen to. Also, they make somehow fun of themselfes, which fits into the concept of Orcs Must Die! pretty well aswell. The hero - the Warmage - is nice voice acted and sometimes also comments the action going on on the screen in his sarcastic way. Pretty fun aswell. The villain is nice voice acted aswell, and the dialoges between her and the Warmage are in most of the cases really fun to listen to. 10/10, definitely.  Overall: Orcs Must Die! is a great tower defense game. It's fun, challenging, entertaining, humorous, and hours fly by like a few seconds when playing it. I love it. 36.5/40 (as story isn't important, if you want to consider it, you get a 38.5/50; but trust me, it's a 50/50 for me personally.)
358	1	a	Think Dungeon Defenders, but Single Player only, and more chaotic. Basically, you're this warmage guy that needs to defend these portals called Rifts, and you need to defend it from the orcs and other enemies that try to go through it.  You can lay traps, place guardians, use a bow or sword, or even use magic such as fire, ice, lightning, or even wind to defeat the orcs.  A pretty fun title overall, it has a good amount of replay value.
360	1	a	A very fun defense romp. It feels a little more 'puzzley' than Sanctum or Dungeon defenders, as opposed to hectic and shootery. Very well-crafted, and quite funny to boot. It's very hard to pull off an arrogant, irreverent, wise-cracking protagonist who doesn't just come across as obnoxious; but in this case, I think they did a great job.  UPDATE: I found this game much more fun than the sequel, and if you're only going to play one of them, I recommend this one.
362	1	a	If you have even the slightest interest in Tower Defence games. Then this game is an absolute must to play. It combines classic Tower Defence mechanics in a cool setting and adds third person combat to the mix. Very fun to play and tons of replay value.
364	1	a	Nothing better than slaying hundreds of orcs in a matter of seconds!  10/10
366	1	a	The gameplay is kinda similiar to Plants vs. Zombies but in 3D.In here you can cast spells, upgrade weapons.There are multiple pathways to defend which needs a bit of exploration so you can decide the positioning or placing of weapons before unleashing the orcs (Orcs and additional enemies may varies depending on what level are you in).It's actually enjoyable imo.
368	1	a	An excellent Tower Defense, in Orc Must Die our goal is to kill orcs. The concept is simple, but the execution was ver good.   This is basically a Third Peron shotter mixed with Tower Defense, and our goal is to defend our portal that is inside a castle. Orc Must Die has 24 levels, and everyone level has a different approach, in each level you will fight hundreds orcs.   Now you must be thinking that you are alone on this fight, well no, you will have many traps and magic powers to help you on this journey. On the beginning of each wave you have unlimited time to prepare your set up. Since is the first wave you won't have too many coins but don't worry because on the firsts wave, archers and barrels are the perfect combo.   Graphically speaking this game goes for a sort of cartoonish look that fits fairly well, also the OST does the job equally.  If Orc Must Die has COOP - OMD2 has COOP - would be a much better experience.   After i decreased my backlog a bit i sure want to re-play this game again!   Recommend!   ~ 7/10
370	1	a	An incredibly robust and enjoyable take on the tower defense genre. Tight controls, a plethora of options, and a general fun factor that keeps you coming back again, and again, and again. It is hard not to love this game.Despite its quirky, comical outer shell, it's a game that has a surprising amount of depth to it, a characteristic that makes it both challenging and satisfying. Whether you're a fan of all-out, balls-to-the-wall action games, or more of a strategy connoisseur, Orcs Must Die! definitely deserves your undivided attention.Orcs Must Die! is a blast, offering a fun, fresh twist on one of my favorite genres of all time. While its unique defensive structures will be appreciated by the more creative strategist, I'm sure this title would be especially enjoyed by those that might be bored by the more detached nature of traditional tower defense games.
372	1	a	Entertaining game in a lot of ways high replay value but the sequel is WAY better
374	1	a	Orcs Must Die is a game where there's orcs... and... they must die. Why? ♥♥♥♥ing, I don't know, they're evil and they're breaking into your castle or some ♥♥♥♥. Anyway, it's basically like a 3D tower-defense where you play as a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with a crossbow who can put traps in places to mercilessly slaughter all the orcs. You gotta make sure they don't all get through, or else you'll lose, or if you're like me, if one gets through, then you gotta start over because that's prevented you from getting the highest possible score. In all seriousness though, this is really fun game, and if you can catch it on sale, consider yourself lucky.
376	1	a	The big green slaughterhouse for your pleasure :-)
378	1	a	I LOVE THAT GAME KILLING ORKZ IS THE BEST MLG FOREVA !
380	1	a	At first glance Orcs Must Die! looks like a Tower Defense game. In reality if you rely solely on towers to kill enemies you will lose very quickly. It's more of a hybrid Over-the-shoulder 3rd person action and Tower Defense game. Yes, increasingly difficult mobs lumber brainlessly toward an exit, but they may also try to kill you directly. Around half of your kills will come your main character using his trusty crossbow and spells than by the towers themselves.  This is generally a good thing but if you're looking for a pure Tower Defense game this isn't it. It does however keep the action fast as you sprint around each level where you need to help bolster defenses on various ends of the map. You can't just 'set it and forget it' for most levels.  While the different traps are fun, they generally come in 3 flavors: Single use (the worst, dead after one trigger), episodic worse (deals damage and then cools down), and constant (best, constant damage to all enemies that traverse it). As later levels and difficulties feature tougher and more numerous monsters, you will have no choice but to use traps that deal constant damage, of which there are a limited amount. This makes many of the more entertaining and flavorful traps pushed to way side. There are at least 3 traps I never used.  Regardless the game is still fun. Planning how to handle each wave and setting up a circuitous kill zone is extremely satisfying. The whimsical art style and humorous protagonist also helps things immensely. There's tons of replayability with multiple levels, 3 difficulty settings, and a decent expanion pack to boot. Well worth the sale price.
382	1	a	A very pleasant game. I think there are quite a few traps you won't be using at all, simply because you can't do without the few basic ones (and you only can take a few kinds of traps into each mission.) That's a shame, but not really a big deal.   I was quite surprised how the game managed to drag me in and kill my entire evening in a 'just one more level and I'll go to sleep' fashion, on multiple occasions.
384	1	a	It got me hooked within the first level. It started of easy and the difficulty smoothly increased. The traps are inventive and a delight to watch when several of them work together to obliterate a horde of orcs. Probably the best tower defense game I've ever played.
386	1	a	Quick Summary: Orcs Must Die is a combination of third person action and tower/trap defense, similar to Sanctum but with humor and medieval weaponry. The game is a lot of fun, but unlike the sequel, there’s no co-op gameplay :(  You take on the role of a cocky student war mage trying to hold back the onslaught of orcs coming through into our world. The hero is pretty dumb, but fortunately the orcs are even dumber and their paths through each level are almost completely predictable. With your magic traps and artifacts (for casting spells) you need to make sure as few orcs as possible get to the end of the level and enter the rift (sometimes there’s more than one rift to defend).   The game is broken up into individual levels, each with a different map, and on each map can be multiple orc entrances and exit rifts. At the start of each level you are given unlimited time to run around and see the layout, as well as set up your loadout (which traps or spells you can use during the level). Once you’ve started the game you cannot change your loadout, you’d have to restart the whole level. You have a ton of traps to choose from, although a few of them aren’t much use and you’ll likely be sticking with the basics like wall arrows, tar pits, and barricades for most of the game. You’ll be facing only a few different kinds of orcs (fast runners, arrow shooters, ogres), but they’ll be coming in large numbers so the key to beating each level is channeling the orcs into choke points where you can use fewer numbers of traps. The traps cost money so you can’t just fill the map with them (and unlike many other tower defense games, you cannot upgrade the traps during the levels).   The biggest difference though between Orcs Must Die and traditional tower defense is the fact that you the hero are on site blasting enemies alongside your traps. You’re armed with a reasonably powerful rapid fire crossbow that’s able to kill small numbers of the slow moving orcs, or the really fast runners that die in one shot. Your traps usually have cooldown times so you cannot rely on them to catch every orc. For example, a spike trap might only trigger every 5 seconds, and during those 5 seconds, more orcs might run over it. It’s up to you and your trusty crossbow to fill them with arrows while waiting for your traps to be ready again. Every level you beat unlocks a different trap type or spell (like fireball or lightning) so by the end of the campaign you’ll have a massive arsenal to choose from.   Pros: +The difficulty ramps up slowly and gives you a chance to learn various strategies for tackling levels. In the meantime, enjoy the humor. “Oh no he di’nt – Orc, as he’s knocked into lava +You can go back and replay levels with your newly unlocked traps and spells. The game tells you the top scores for each level that your Steam friends achieved. I’m not that competitive though, I just wanted to finish each level and see the story.  Cons: -I mentioned the difficulty ramps up, and by the end some of the levels seem practically impossible to get max score if you’re trying the Nightmare difficulty.  Overall, Orcs Must Die is a little known gem. The metacritic score is high, but nobody really talks about it. Some of the Steam achievements require mass grinding though, which is a little annoying. 9/10 
388	1	a	Trap defense game that pits you against hordes of orcs with each their unique abilities. At your disposal you have a number of traps and spells to keep them at bay. One of the best things I liked about this game is that on other tower defense games when that one straggler makes it past your defenses you have to just sit and watch as it wakes right into your nexus. On OMD you have the option to run over there and kill that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ yourself! Very child friendly but also mature and challenging enough for older audiences without seeming unfair.  4/5 One of the best tower defense games I've had the chance to play!
390	1	a	I wanted to give this game a legitimate chance before I wrote my review. I am an avid tower defense gamer; there is just something undeniably satisfying about stoping someone from reaching their goal.... its actually kind of sick really. This brings an intresting change of pace. The humor is pretty engaging, I find myself eager with each new level to hear what kind of quip the War Mage will say. The traps are creative and encourage you to find new ways to supress the Orcs. Will your bombard them with Archers while they are arduously walking through a tar pit, or perhaps you would like to take them on yourself while cattle them into a grinder. Whatever menacingly creative way you wish to protect the rift, this game has something for you.  Play it if : You love tower defense (I assure you, you won't be dissapointed) Avoid it if: You are an Orc Lover, You are not creative, or obviously if you don't like tower defense   9/10 in my book The only thing holding it back is no mutiplayer, but the second game remedied that issue
392	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is third person a hilarious sit-game-com settled in fantasy medieval theme.  Technically:    the game is a fantasy / medievial 'tower' defence + third person 'shoot everything that survived trap lines',    30 traps, spells and weapons (total), mostly upgradable    20 (24?) levels to beat + a few in DLC, approx 10h of gameplay,    nightmare difficulty, another 10h of gameplay,    challanges - max score per level - 5-10h,   Gameplay notes:    The difficulty per wave grows with number and setup of enemies, and shrinking space for traps,     The enemies do not seem to have increased HP per wave,    Most of levels are balanced so that the Mage needs both traps, spells and wepons to hold the line,    Weapons require item slot, there are two in the game: sniping crossbow and melee blade staff,    Spells require equipment slots and to use in the mission and mana to cast,    Defender minions require item slot, and gold to place them,    During a level the Mage can buy upgrade from one of three 'weavers': generic trap upgrade, spell upgrade, mixed upgrade.    Traps cannot be directly upgraded during the level. They can be upgraded during the story.    Some levels have two or more distanced attack paths, of which at least one must be fully secured with traps,    No endless mode (can be found in OMD!2),    It is possible to replay old levels with improved trap set for better score.    All of the characters are stereotypic to the point of lunacy.    The main hero, 'The Warmage' is a young, dumb lad. Blindly convinced of his own awesomeness. He needs to prevent orcs from enering portals to our world (at which he is good)... and to figure out (at which he is terribly bad) a more permament solution.     His (former) Master shows up in the story by his memories. He was the last (failed) hope for the world, spare his student, but the only thing greater then his apprentice's ignorance, is his stupidity.    The Sorceress (the prime enemy in the game), does not show up directly, but magically takes quarrels with the Warmage.    Most of her arguments are attempts to insult the Warmage so that he can't figure that out (which is not that hard afterall). Most of Warmage's speech are (futile) attempts flirt up the Sorceress, and show that he is the most handsome and awesome man in the area (which if of course true, as he is the only one).    The orcs are main competitors for the price for The Best Cannon Fodder in video games: dumb, ugly, run and die in hundreds, have hilarious (though still dumb) speach lines, can be headshot-ed.   General info    OMD is settled in medieval-themed bastions / castle / dungeons. There is only one level theme.    Forget about cinematics. The storyline is presended via semi-animated drawings. This is a great idea and fits great into the game.    The orcs, the Warmage and the traps have a bit grotesque, comic design. Again, this suits the overall game mood, and slows down graphics 'aging'.    Amazing music. If you run into game OST, do buy it. I managed to get one from Humble Bundle.   Any problems?    Trap balance - some traps are simply better, some are just useless (Hint: use traps with large AOE and fast or no reload),    Since trap upgrades are permament, The Warmage usually sticks with favourite set with little room for experiment.    No co-op game (solved in OMD2)    The super-arogant hero can be hard to get used to. The humor can be sometimes percieved as primitive.    High emphasise placed on combat, it is not possible / extremly difficult to play only with the economy.    First two levels in nightmate are... too nightmareish, the difficulty seems to be easier further.    there are two levels in the game (including final), which must be simply learnt and played by hearth. In each wave the  Mage must build traps in particular area, buy a proper upgrade and solo secure another corridor.  Mispacing traps will leave the attacked corridor unsecured.     Strong sides    humor,    nice character design,    good overall ballance in map design,    good balance of strategic / economic components in gameplay (unless you don't like action in tower defences),    interesting maps,    high 'replayablity', level score to be maxed.   You should avoid the game, if you:    dislike action in tower defence and prefer them to be purely economic,    dislike arrogant and dumb protagonists   Do play if:    don't mind thinking / action hybrid,    look for a lot of fun,    tend to max each level  
394	1	a	Like tower defense games? How about in third person? Also do you like killing lots of orcs? Well then Orcs Must Die is the game for you as it has all 3. It's a really fun and addictive third person tower shooter game with really good gadgets and varied and tough enemies. You get to be really creative with the defense using all the neat gadgets in your arsenal. Also, the A.I is good in this game. Overall, if you like tower defense games, you'll have plenty of fun times in this game.
396	1	a	It's a physics-enabled third-person shooter and tower-defense mashup, and it's amazing. Setting traps to fling Orcs into pits of acid, shooting them with a crossbow as they trudge through a tar-pit trap, melting them with alchemical grenades (DLC only, but cheap and sooo worth it), using barricades to route the hordes right into your traps... it's brilliant.
398	1	a	I recommend this game for Tower defense lovers, all that you love with a twist. Good combination between being a hero and also the builder.
400	1	a	An action tower defense game. Because the player is actively involved in the action of the game, via setting traps and using weapons/spells, this game is actually fun compared to all those boring tower defense flash games and the like. The traps are mostly all useful in some way, allowing for players to be creative with them. Highly recommended to all, because killing orcs is just to much fun in this game.
402	1	a	It was alright
404	1	a	Definitely worth buying.
406	1	a	A tidy, charismatic point defence game that deserves to be up there with the big names like PvZ yet strangley only came to me attention in the last week. Well worth the price.
408	1	a	To be honest, I prefer the slightly less cartoony and a bit darker graphical design of this game over the second one. Of course, it lacks a lot of the features Orcs must Die 2 adds to the game mechanics, but the gameplay is pretty much identical and just as fun and entertaining, albeit at least the first bunch of levels feel a bit easy. But thats not gonna stay that way, oooh no.
410	1	a	The best part of the game, the freaking kobold runners. If you don`t know them yet, you are gonna love them.
412	1	a	I don't normally like tower defense games but this is great fun. The orcs are well animated, the voiceovers are good, and the gameplay is fun and rewarding. Holding back the Horde as never been so satisfying.
414	1	a	cute and fun. More fun than 2? Harder as it's single player only though.
416	1	a	Great Game
418	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is a tower defense game where you are in control of the hero who will be fighting off Orcs and planting traps. The game plays like a 3rd person action game mixed in with the traditional tower defense formula. The player plays an extremely active role and your crossbow will be needed just as much as wall arrow traps. There are numerous traps at your disposal and you unlock more as you go along. By the end of my play through I ended up using just about every single trap. They are all designed very well and most of them work well with each other to produce great kill boxes.  The game features three difficulties but you'll want to start on War Mage as you don't gain many skulls (the currency used to upgrade traps) on Apprentice (the easiest). At the end of each map you are awarded between 1 and 5 skulls based on your performance. Getting 5 skulls will require a significant amount of strategy (especially on Nightmare, although there's no achievement for getting all 5 skulls on all stages on Nightmare, just War Mage). You'll need to pretty much know what is going to come out and during what wave so that you can prepare adequately. YouTube is an excellent reference if you're having trouble and is great for learning new strategies that you may not have figured out on your own.  There's not much more to the game outside of the general story mode but getting all 5 skulls on War Mage and Nightmare will take a while, making the game a great value considering it's already quite cheap. The game features leader boards so you can always go back one you've fully upgraded your traps and go for a better score on the global rankings or among your friends. Overall this is a great tower defense game that is well worth your time if you have any love for the genre.   8/10

426	1	a	cute and fun. More fun than 2? Harder as it's single player only though.
428	1	a	Great Game
430	1	a	This game out of all 3 games is the best  The first orcs must die is for solo play and its good !!!!!  The second orcs must die is the game for 2 players coop !!!!  The third I dont know what happened turned to garbage
432	1	a	my first steam game &lt;3
434	1	a	The game is great. But outdated since the release of 'Orcs Must Die 2'. While you are going to have a great time playing this, you are going to have a better time playing the other one.  There is really not an story, and no previous knowledge is requiere; so you won't get any spoilers or miss anything.  You can also access this game maps from the second game.
436	1	a	How I got this game? It was on sale and I am sucker for sales. But still it is my personal best buy. Fun, addictive, constantly returning for more. Playing levels over, and over for one more skull, for using new traps on old levels, for finding more ways of stomping squishi `umans. I mean, ergh, stupid orcs. The best thing is you can play it for 15 minutes or for hours at the time depending of your own time scedule. THIS IS the great stres relase game. The commentaries of your character are always funny, and give him personality. which brakes the usual stereotypes in games, which is refreshing. GREAT FUN, WHAT SHOULD YOU ASK MORE FROM GAME? nothing, THATS RIGHT. You squishi ` umies...
438	1	a	The Game is fun an outrages!!! 8/10!
440	1	a	Pleasantly surprised to say that this game is absolutley brilliant. It's so much more fun than it looks in the trailer, you really have to try it!
442	1	a	Good game, it's not the best of balanced TD game out there, as some traps are OP as hell (Swinging Mace) compared to others that are just pathetic (Steam Trap), but balance is good enough that it will let you beat stages in many different creative ways so not everything has to be so cookie cutter and boring.  Now for some advice time for the new players who for some reason is reading this crap on my profile... any-who, your upgrade priorities should be Tar Trap, Barricade, Swinging Mace, and Archer Guardians, those are the GOD level tier of traps and bread and butter to everything.  Other notable traps are your Brimstone, Floor Scorcher, Spike Trap, Spring Trap, Arrow Wall, and Grinder, these here are your second level of tier stuff so start upgrading them when you can.  The rest of your traps can go suck it because they do in fact all suck. Also never ever ever leave home without your Lightning Ring and just stick with the Steel Weaver exclusively, because you ain't no ♥♥♥♥.  Congrats you're a Pro now.  Lastly... Good luck on beating some of my high scores :P
444	1	a	Orcs Must Die! (OMD!) is an absolutely fantastic addition from the indie developer, Robot Entertainment. It's a game that blends third-person action with tower-defense strategy. Casual and hardcore players alike should be drawn to OMD! given its uniqueness, exciting gameplay and its corky sense of humor.
446	1	a	Get this now, loads of fun action and tower defense. Funny main character.
448	1	a	Expertly-crafted casual first-person tower defense with plenty of lampoonish humour. Nuff said.  - Skinny from the Fat B*stard  (curator link) 
450	1	a	Lots of fun!
452	1	a	If you love strategic games where you have to carefully place defensive traps to offensively fend off invaders. Then this is the game for you. It's like Dungeon Defenders, but solo.
454	1	a	Orcs Must Die is a drama of apocalyptic dimensions. You’ll run around killing them with a mixture of clever traps and third person shooting but this tower defense game is really the story of the poor Orcs that you decimate. Every Orc’s story is told with a hallucinatory intensity, whether they were tossed off a cliff by a spring, slowed by tar before being perforated by poison arrows, burned to a crisp by ground based fire traps, or stabbed to death by the merciless protagonist. Orcs may not be real, but their trials and tribulations have taught me more about the fragility and splendor that we call life.  I can’t express how transformative this masterpiece is. Let’s be clear, it’s not just a masterpiece of the tower defense genre, but of humanity itself. Orcs must die has turned me into a better person. As a result of this game I’ve decided to clean up my act. I will no longer leave spike traps on the floor lest my future offspring trigger them. Also, I will try being friendly with strangers rather than freezing and shattering them.  
456	1	a	Rip-off of Dungeon Defenders.
458	1	a	This game is one of the best games ever made, this is the game that brought me to steam. It is a 3rd person tower defense with great humor.  You are the last warmage that left to protect earth by preventing orcs and monsters to get into the rift. Well.. you are not a true warmage.. you are the apprentice of an warmage that died in a very stupid death.  So it is only you VS tons of monsters that wants to kill you and then kill the human race.. BUT you are not just an apprentice., no no no , you are the most idiotic one! You are the last hope of the human race (you and your spells and traps).  Dont worry earth people , the apprentice is here to save you (you are doomed :P )   Score section : Humor : 9/10 GFX : 7/10 great cartoon graphic Voices : 9/10 Storyline : 7/10 Gameplay : 8/10  Score : 8   One of the best tower defense game ever made, worth every dollar
460	1	a	This is one incredible game. It's burning away my time to god knows where. Danger: People that have no time for games, STAY AWAY
462	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is not just an average Tower Defense/Third-Person... It's something special.... Take a moment, and imagine this: You're a Knight. You have a powerful Cross Bow and long Sword. You slay Orcs day and night. And best of all, the adventure is in YOUR hands. How will you kill Orcs? Why must we kill Orcs? Simple. Orcs. Must. Die.
464	1	a	'Get your [axe?] outta my face!' -Orc Archer  10/10
466	1	a	The title of the game says orcs must die but I dont think they should
468	1	a	Addicting, awesome and full of fun! ;)
470	1	a	ONE OF THE BEST GAMES I EVER PLAYED I OWNED THE GAME BEFORE ON ANOTHER SITE BUT ITS SOO GOOD I HAD TO GET IT AGAIN ON STEAM SO THATS HOW GOOD IT IS SO GOOD GOTTA BY IT TWICE ONE OF MY FAV GAMES IT IS WORTH EVERY CENT
472	1	a	Good game for players who like this genre. Very missing lack of co - op mode and survival, because the players it's more fun than going alone. A minor problem with the Czech language in this game only if you have steam in Czech.
474	1	a	Just a lot of fun to play. Simple, fun story and wave after wave of orcs to kill. It does seem like the traps are a bit unbalanced and I do find myself using the same ones again and again while ignoring others but it remains fun all the same. I do wish the barricade were more cost effective; this one simple change would add a ton of strategy. Still, you will get $10 worth of fun out of this one easily.
476	1	a	Very fun game with awesome traps to kill the orcs. The intro of the story is funny and adds to the fun of the game. I recommend playing on War Mage dificulty to have maximum fun rather than just starting on beginner dificulty. 9/10.
478	1	a	Excellent tower-defense action game. Really. It's also not DLC infested like dungeon defenders.  Only complaint could be the lack of CO-OP but then again, orcs must die 2 is right around the corner. Can't wait for it.  This game is more action oriented than Dungeon Defenders, so you're contanstly doing something.  This game offers many traps and 3 different difficulties. And yes, the hard mode is hard. Not impossible though.  One of the best tower-defense i've ever played.  Overall: 8.5/10
480	1	a	It looks good, it plays good, it feels good and the price is good. Can't go wrong with it.
482	1	a	This is one of the best 'Defense' type games I played. It is dynamic and really fun. Jokes are funny (get boring after few hours, but are refreshing, comparing to what other defense games offer in that matter). Enemies are hillarious (which is good, they are orcs after all). If you like Hero Defense, or Tower Defense, you should definitely try this game.
484	1	a	This game is a brilliant blend of the Action and Tower Defense genres. It never turns into a brainless shooting gallery, but it also never slows down, and it's always keeping the player engaged. Advanced players will want to tackle the leaderboards or play with less conventional setups.   It's also funny. Seriously, go play this.
486	1	a	This game is so very unique! A good break from my usual games and a great deal of fun! It deserves the GOTY reward it earned.  So many fun mechanics! Love the gameplay! flatout 9.75/10 It earned it :D:
488	1	a	Nice game... !
490	1	a	It's tough to talk about this after having played 2, but here goes.  I enjoyed this game enough when I first played it. Some of the later levels get tough, and there are really only a few viable traps/weapon combos, but it works out. There isn't a lot that I would say is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, which is more than I can say for 2, but there also isn't much challenge, either. Nightmare mode isn't necessarily hard, it just removes the strategy part of the game. You're not given time to think/analyze/change placements, really. I mean, yeah, that's hard, but it's also not really upping the difficulty in anyway. Of course, maybe that's the best way to increase difficulty in a strategy game: removing much chance to strategize.  There is, believe it or not, a story to this game. I wasn't really aware of it for a while, but it's totally there and you might miss it if you're not paying attention.  One quip I have is that things get redundant quickly, but whatcha gon' do.  It's an alright game, good even, if a little stale/boring/dry at times. Like I've indicated elsewhere, though, Two is an improvement in every way, from the interface to map design. The addition of co-op was a much needed boost to OMD as well.  If you skip this one you're not necessarily missing much. A lot of the traps/dialogue/maps are carried over into two. Still, this was an alright game.
492	1	a	Orcs Must Die! Is one of my favorite games to be honest! This game is filled with humor and has a really nice gameplay. The only drawback is that it's a pure solo game. Something which it's sequel Orcs Must Die! 2 remedies! you take the role of a warmage, protecting the world from invading hordes of Orcs, Gnolls, Ogres and other creatures wishing to enter our world through magical rifts. The story-line is actually quite nice. If you enjoy tower defense games then chances are good that you'll enjoy this game as well!
494	1	a	The most offensive orcs game I ever played but who cares. It's fun XD
496	1	a	Best RPG/Strategy/Tower Defence game to my knowledge
498	1	a	This review was written after I beat the game.  Fun and reasonably challenging. The dialogue, voice acting, and story, though sparse, are pretty funny, too.   Each level is really a puzzle to be solved - there's not necesarilly a 'correct' solution for how to place your traps, but there's 'aha' moments when you discover a feature of the level that makes a certain setup very effective.   The fact that you get to control a hero makes the gameplay much more fun - you can have a big impact on the enemy waves with skilled shooting and use of the various magic spells.  There's plenty of replayability in competing on the leaderboards or among your friends for a high score.  My one major complaint is that several of the levels have a split design where you can't force all of the enemies through one choke point, so you have to split up your attention between them or set up lots of traps and hope they're working well enough. It's kind of annoying to mentally deal with this and spend time running back and forth. I understand the point of the game is to be mentally challenging, but this task is more mentally exhausting than it is fun.  I also don't like that you aren't told in advance exactly what enemies will be coming through which doors before each round. If you want to go for really good scores, it's just an unnecesarry and un-fun memorization tax upon you to remember each wave.
500	1	a	★★★★
502	1	a	I buy it now! And.... i can confirm on HD graphic it's play well :)   Game it's good and a lot of fun!  Now will try org must die! 2! :)))
504	1	a	Fun game. Well worth grabbing when on sale.
506	1	a	Probably one of the most polished and refined games I have played, It is hard to think of faults in this game. Also mass killing is always a plus. 8/10
508	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is another entry in the recent surge of Tower Defense games popping up all over. Fortunately, the good humour and overall silliness of it is what makes it stand out from the rest. With a protagonist resembling a medeival Bruce Campbell, this is a game everyone should give a go.
510	1	a	What you need to know about this game:  It's a First Person Shooter Tower Defence game, where you are up agains a army of hundreds of thousands orcs...  The music and grafics are brilliant, and the humor of the game is simply brilliant! (you get alot of 1 liners while playing the game) and the game have an insane about of replayability, especially if you are the kind of person that loves to complete a map 'perfectly' like me (a perfectionist) and even if you aren't the game is still well worth its price.  I highly recommend this game :)
512	1	a	A great game ! A perfect blend of trap/tower defense to 3rd person shooting. Sort of reminds me of Sanctum ; however, the graphics and 'universe' of Orcs Must Die! are way more fun !
514	1	a	This is a very fun puzzle game with different ways to defend each dungeon. I highly recommend this game to anyone. One downside is the highly sensitive mouse scroll speed, which I still don't know how to reduce. However, you soon get used to it and it doesn't become a hindrance. The graphics and designs are amazing; the audio and voice acting are outstanding; and the game mechanics (level design and weapon design) are dynamic and intuitive. Some players may find it easy - however this is a thoroughly enjoyable game.
516	1	a	SLIGHTY WORSE THAN THE SECOND
518	1	a	This game is freakin great. Hilarious, extremely fun, and incredibly attractive. The graphics aren't necessarily technically stunning, but when I think about good-looking games, this one always comes to mind. Unfortunately, the DLC items are overpowered. For a better experience, don't use the alchemy bombs. They make it way too easy.
520	1	a	Extremely fun co-op defense game that you got traps and spells and weapons to help you w/.
522	1	a	The tower defense genre has always been evolving over the years and seeing FPS games now entering this arena made me nervous at first , but after letting sanctum slip by I thought I would try this instead and......WOW! Frantic gameplay that really makes you use the noggin about what types of traps should go where and how to lure the orcs into them. Great level design and colorful crisp graphics. The arrogant none-too-bright d-bag protagonist made me laugh out loud at times and the story was cute. For the $5 I spent (including all the DLC) I'd say I got one hell of a deal here , considering I would have paid full price had I known just how much fun this is. If I had to rate it : 8.5/10
524	1	a	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSMTAJiMMHQ   9/10  Very entertaining, fun graphics and characters.
526	1	a	A real fun game, with some mindless orckilling, and some not-so-mindless killing. Place the traps right when you can, and you're good!
528	1	a	Fun fact: I dislike Tower Defense games for being boring, repetitive and unpersonal. Oh, and boring, just to mention it again.  Another fun fact: Orcs Must Die is NOT a tower defense game, even though it could easily be mistaken for one. But I would rather consider it a 'Tactical Defense TPS'. You're not a commander building towers, you're a guy building traps which are meant to aid you in wrecking Orcs. Lots of them. And boy, it's fun.  Let's begin with the art style and sound. Both are fluent, coherent and quite fine. I won't say superb, because the game obviously is neither an AAA title nor top-actual, but it's well above what would be necessary as a minimum. A big point of the game is it's humor, that clearly hit my favour. Whether it's Orc's philosophing and quoting famous memes, or the utterly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥-charming protagonist, or his even more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ monologues, the game makes you chuckle. Whilst orc's get gibbed left and right. Which is literally all this game is about: Killing orcs in the most fashionable/efficient/hilarious way possible. You got a wide array of different traps, weapons and champions at your disposal, and often the level'S themselves have special environmental hazards, high bridges ideal to kick orcs off from, lava pits... Even as an enemy of TDGs, the game was great to play.  Which leads us to it'S only downside: 'was'. The game is terribly short. I've beaten the entire campaign + bonus missions at this point, with a perfect completion on about 75% of all levels (many of those on first try). Yes, there is a 'Nightmare' difficulty, but I'm not sure whether I will go for that or rather switch to the sequel ofthis game instead.  But hey, it's a budget game,so we can't exspect 40h playtime, can we? Result: 8/10 Solid and extremely satisfying way to waste time. ^^
530	1	a	One of the best tower defense games ever made.
532	1	a	It's good for stress relief, and for serious 'how do I score high' styles of play. The endless snarking is a great bonus. You almost have to feel sorry for the poor orcs though...except...NOT REALLY!
534	1	a	Fun. Try out OMD 2.
536	1	a	Great game. Doesn't require strong hardware. Even at lowest settings looks good, but needs more adjusting options.
538	1	a	It's good for stress relief, and for serious 'how do I score high' styles of play. The endless snarking is a great bonus. You almost have to feel sorry for the poor orcs though...except...NOT REALLY!
540	1	a	write buy it if you love goryness and building trabs or just for the fun of it.
542	1	a	Jean Kirstein strongly approves of this game.
544	1	a	Oh yes! This game's atmosphere is awesome, never has killing hords of orcs felt better than in this game. While you are busy killing waves of orcs, a pretty good soundtrack will play in the background, which gets you hyped up for the coming battle. Prepare for one hell of battles, if you can't kill Orcs because they look cute, than you are going to easily fail this game, the difficulty in the game is really high and only the toughest players will make it to the end.  With a little plot, which consides of 4 'Cutscenes' this game will keep you excited for the next levels, however be warned that the lines get easily repetive, it helps to only play 3-4 levels a day maximum, to enjoy the game at it fullest.  The big bad thing about this game is that it doesn't have any multiplayer, but the sequell (Ors must die 2) has one, this game seems to have as far as I know the better SinglePlayer out of the two 'Orcs Must Die!' games.  Its defintely a fun experience.
546	1	a	This is a fun singleplayer tower defense game. You are gifted with new tricks and learn to refine their uses to achieve nothing less than 5skulls! bladestaff+vampire glove are killer combo and once you get guardians and really make use of the weaver cars. The combo possibilities are endless they are mostly determined by the level layout.   No fun with friends and fun for kids if they can handle killing monsters.
57	0	a	I don't understand all the fuzz about this game. Bought it in a promotion with all DLCs for like 5bucks but even so it is not worth it. I had fun the first few levels but it got old very quickly. I finished all maps (including DLC) in nightmare+5skulls and the only feeling I have is that I wasted 30hours of my life. Most of the levels, namely on nightmare, are more a game of 'find-out-the-only-strategy-and-loadout-that-works-in-this-map-lol-screw-fun' than a real game. In a lot of maps there is only a winning strategy - not a balanced game for different types of playrs/loadouts.  If you want a tower defense / shooter hybrid get SANCTUM, not this pile of crap.
548	1	a	Super fun co-op game! An absolute blast and a very creative take on what could be considered a 'tower defense' style game. A must play 10/10
550	1	a	Very nice evolution of tower defense. Buy it!!!!!
552	1	a	the 2nd is better
554	1	a	Absolutely amazing and super fun game! Awesome 3rd person trap setting and slaughtering game. It's like a tower defense where you are in it..  I just wish it had multiplayer/co-op...  BUY IT.
556	1	a	A fun defence game where you get to kill Orcs! You unlock new traps and depending on your rating you can upgrade traps to be even more devestating. I highly recommend to anyone who wants a little fun with this game, though be very careful with the upgrades at the later levels can be really daunting.
558	1	a	best of the series. At least it has the awesome awesome archers. all you need is the archers TO WIN! THE BOW RASCALS SHALL RULE THE DAY.
560	1	a	A variation of tower defense where you have to place traps to defend cores from invading monsters. While there's lots of toys (with new ones being thrown at you every level), some get left in the dust/unused (boom barrel, steam trap), while others get progressively more broken as the game goes on (archers, paladins, decoys). My biggest complaint is it's missing the stat tracking most tower defenses have to help you maximize your gold usage, leaving you to guesswork if your traps are laid out properly. The maps are uniquely constructed, often requiring specific tactics to clear effectively, making each map tense and engaging. About a third of your arsenal are weapons for your character which keeps you in the action most of the time, unlike most games in this genre.  With 24 maps you're looking at a sizable tower defense game with plenty of crossbow-twitching, fireball-slinging, ice-shattering orc carnage.
562	1	a	Legendary game 9/10
564	1	a	massive kills in tower def style, kill em Oll ^________^'
566	1	a	If you have balls, u must buy this game and KILL'EM ALL!!! EACH ♥♥♥♥ING ORC!!!
568	1	a	I love this ♥♥♥♥ing game.
570	1	a	Definitely the best and funniest tower defense based game I've ever played. Only thing missing is an coop multiplayer, but otherwise it's pure gold.
572	1	a	If you hate Orcs,then you should try it!
574	1	a	IF YOU LIKE TOWER DEFENCE YOU LIKE THIS =3
576	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is a game that asks a few questions.  1. Do you like tower defense games? 2. Do you like 3rd person games? 3. Do you like RPG elements mixed into either of the above two? 4. Do you like any combination of the the above 3 questions? 5. Do you like shooting orcs in the face?  If you answered yes to any of these questions, then get Orcs Must Die!, and trust me you'll have a blast. It's challenging, fun and the dialouge is funny. Worth it all the way.
578	1	a	Fun with ragdolls! fling, burn, melt, zap, behead, slice &amp; dice... you've guessed it... orcs!
580	1	a	Great 3rd person tower defense. Loved every minute of my gameplay which lasted around 30 hours. Get this game if it's under 5 bucks.
582	1	a	Orcs Must Die is easily my favorite downloadable title for 2011. Why? Because it takes classic tower defense and makes something new, innovative, and fun out of it. The game blends third person action with tower defense strategy creating a very unique experience. The game is very well designed on that regard, meaning that it is impossible to beat a level using only traps or only spells (you must use both). You play as a War Mage able to use spells and weapons to stop the Orcs from entering the Rift. You also have the ability to lay traps throughout the environment. Each trap is uniquely designed and offers different gameplay elements. Some examples of traps are tar traps to slow enemies, swinging maces, spike traps, arrow wall traps, etc. You play a good amount of levels progressing through a very simple but entertaining storyline. Overall, Orcs Must Die offers a very new and unique experience for Tower Defense fans. To put it simply, if you like tower defense, GET THIS GAME!
584	1	a	Good game, but Orcs must die 2 features classic maps ( so all maps from the first game) and is able to played cooperatively.  Buy the second one
586	1	a	They must and they should! Tower Defense, now with gore!
588	1	a	  ok but not the best
590	1	a	Great third person tower defense game for the price!  As a big fan of tower defense games as well as fantasy action games this one really stood out to me. The game not only feels smooth to play but manages to maintain a good pace throughout the levels, adding different towers and weapons to your arsenal along the way. For anyone looking for a funny, fast-paced tower defense game to pass the time, I recommend checking this one out.
592	1	a	LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH
594	1	a	7.5/10 
596	1	a	I think this game is a sin... yes a straight up biblical sin; it's far too fun to be anything but sinful, wrong or cancer causing. I'm serious. There is nothing I can find to dislike about this game. The graphics are crisp. even in the pitch melee you can always pick out high priority targets, the music is very nice for the background and the sounds ... on the slicing of metal and the funny wails of agony never sounded so good.  It is also frustratingly difficult at times, don't be fooled by the early missions, it starts ramping up fast but it's a good challenge, the sort that has you reformulating your strategy when you lose and dancing when you win.  There's also the humor... it is actually funny to listen to the voice overs at time, it sounds like something Blizzard would have done about 8 years back.. around the time of Warcraft 2/3...you know.. before they stopped making games and started designing payment portals..  Give it a try, you won't regret it. Defense with a twist. Now if you'll excuse me... I have a bridge to mine with catapult traps.
598	1	a	I am not a fan of tower defense games, but this game (and it's sequel) give a refreshing spin on the genre. It combines 3rd person shooter with tower defense. This allows you to actively participate in the defense. You'll be shooting down enemies while managing your defenses.  The level design gives you enough choice to try out different tactics. Sometimes there is one obvious tactic. Other times you have to try out different combos. Even though not all traps are as powerful/balanced, you can't always use the same traps. This gives enough variation through out the game.   Orcs Must Die 2 adds a few new features:  + Co-op + Endless Mode + New playable class (mage) + More customization
600	1	a	Well, you get to kill loads of orcs. Rest in pieces, orcs.
602	1	a	Just the most awesome game about orcs and one of the best games I've ever played. It has everything: unique style, humour, cool soundtrack, simple but perferct mechanics, and thousands, thousands of ORCS, even Drizzt would go all jealous about such quantities of greenheads to slaughter, lol=) This game is full of TOTAL AWESOMENESS!
604	1	a	I really like the game, but I couldn’t find the stupid cake.
606	1	a	8/10  This fantasy-action strategy game is great fun and has impressive visuals. However there is already an Orcs Must Die 2 out- which includes more features and improvements, so go with that if you can. Lel.
608	1	a	What a plasure to smash tonns of orks!
610	1	a	Fun, lots of humor and addicting but pick up and play. Worth the cost of admission.
612	1	a	Fun way of killing ORCS!  Give it a Go. 
614	1	a	Surprisingly good for the price. Nice humor, too.
616	1	a	3/5
618	1	a	Think of it as a fantasy Left 4 Dead with traps (Not those, you know what I mean).
620	1	a	This is a good tower defense game with traps and hate against orcs. You may kill them in a funny way of dieing, the person has some nice jokes. it is single player only. Going for 5 star/skull could be frustating. but it has nice music and graphics.  8/10
622	1	a	Classic tower defence, fun one liners....and oddly enofe a actual decent storyline. 14$ well spent imo :D
624	1	a	Just try it! 5+
626	1	a	It might be easy to dismiss OMD! as a FPS/tower defence variant reliant on its tongue-in-cheek humour and simple gameplay to appeal. While these are two of its key strengths, there is far more to OMD! however; it has very well designed levels, plenty of weapon choices and types of enamy, as well as many different potential styles of play. Nightmare difficulty (available after the campaign has been completed) requires particular dexterity and speed of thought and adds further longevity to the mix. All that said, the real reason this game is recommended by so many people is that killing the titular orcs is immensely good fun. Eviscerating an orc wondering whether its parking has been validated as its friend explodes a day before it is due for retirement (the back stories courtesy of the grumbles the orcs utter as they amble towards you) frankly never gets old. Having just completed Nightmare with over thirty thousand kills to my name, I can safely say I would happily sign up to melt, crush, shoot, detonate, squash, burn and generally mangle the little gits all over again. Given this was released in 2011 it comes on sale quite often and is definitely worth a go.
628	1	a	Nice game. Next part comming soon!
630	1	a	I enjoyed playing this game, but soundtrack is limited!
632	1	a	Its a must buy because:  - game is cheap - game is cool - game is fun - achievements are reasonable - can be play as casual or more hardcore
634	1	a	Very fun. Much defend. Many time. Such recommended. wow.
636	1	a	♥♥♥♥ is ♥♥♥♥ing sweet, with or without all that ♥♥♥♥ing DLC. Get it, wait for a sale, pirate it I don't care just play the god damn thing.  edit: not now though
638	1	a	there be goblins
640	1	a	The best 'tower defense' game I ever played.
642	1	a	Meh. Good for a while.
644	1	a	Theese
646	1	a	Killing orcs have never been this fun!  P.S. Also you can kill kobolds, gnols, ogres and other nasties.
648	1	a	*general review* This is an amazing game to get, and it's on sale now! So what are you waiting for, grab it.
650	1	a	With a title like that how is one supposed to refuse? Ok it's actually rather fun. For the seasoned tower defense expert it's a rather fun 3D variation. Tower Defense for the uninitiated is at it's best a grid based puzzler. Choose how and where to defend utilising resources you earn. The more experianced you become, the more traps and defenses you can place. It's biggest failing is that there is no autofire. Constantly having to slam the mouse button to fire an arrow or whack a sword becomes a little tiring. Would I reccommend it? Yes I would on a steam sale, simply for the fun sounds and indie humour, dotted around endearing orcy goodness. A quick level now and again, is what makes a solid indie hit. Without the 'just one more go' deliciousnous of games like this, we'd forget the simple pleasure of gaming.
652	1	a	 In short:  A great fast-paced game that encourages and rewards good imagination with trap placement.  My only regret is that this game did not have co-op, but they fixed that with the second game.
654	1	a	This game was definetly worth it's price! Not getting the sequel though, as it gets boring after some time.
656	1	a	This is the BEST tower defender i ever played. And is comic too. Now is time for the par 2 wit frend in creazy coop :D
658	1	a	Fun Fast-paced Tower Defense Third-Person Shooter.  PROS: - Highly replayable - Decent challenge - Fun, lighthearted story - Adrenaline-pumping metal soundtrack - Fast-paced gameplay with strategic elements - Clever mix of Tower Defense and Third-Person Shooter - Cartoon aesthetic reminiscent of Torchlight and Team Fortress 2  CONS: - Single-player only - Little musical variety - No custom keybinding support - Generic-looking male protagonist - Blatantly misogynistic and anti-intellectual - Barely audible dialogue during heavy combat
660	1	a	Orcs must die is a fun whimsical seeming game that quickly turns into a tactical bloody slugfest with a tenacious and numerous foe.  a fun fresh take on tower defence that will have you playing for some time.  The only bad thing ive found is that like with tower defence games, you quickly grow tired and need breaks from the game.  But if your looking for 2-5 games of fast paced frantic defending fun, this game will fill that gap nicely   (FPS / Defence / Casual)
662	1	a	  No comment . Is too good for comments.
664	1	a	is good but does not have co-op 8/10
666	1	a	Wanna play a tower defense game without having to worry too much about the 'Tower building' part? Then Orcs Must Die is the game for you. Pure, mindless fun.
58	0	a	I won this game in a bet, I'd wished I lost
668	1	a	ANOTHER freaking tower defense game? Okay so long as it's THIS one.
59	0	a	I feel bad killing those orcs, but then I remember, they were trying to kill me.
670	1	a	the game is good but i have say play Orces must die 2 is lot better but both are good games
60	0	a	No built in key bindings. Big convoluted mess to try to get the game working with your own key bindings. On top of that, you can't even have a controller or something your PC THINKS is a controller plugged in to make it work correctly. Not worth the time and effort when there's a ton of other games out there to play. If I hadn't gotten this in a bundle (not to mention hadn't spent over 2 hours of game time trying to get it to WORK), I'd refund the heck out of it. This should not be acceptable. I can't believe how many positive reviews this has. It boggles the mind.
61	0	a	Mouse sensivity is a big problem for this game. Very hard to control the character and camera often. I did not find a satisfactory solution to keep mouse under control in the web. God luck for you. If you ignore this, it is a great game but almost unplayable for myself. I finished all levels.However, I do not recommed this game ...
62	0	a	I had difficulty getting into this, especially after having playing Orcs Must Die 2 co-op with a friend. Many of the levels, it seems, require you to run back and forth between two different entrances. In co-op this works marvelously (10 of the original maps can be played in the second title in the series), as each player can hold an entrance, calling the other when things get hairy. The number of weapons and traps is also less than the second game. Perhaps this is an unfair criticism, but at the very least, perhaps this review will be helpful to others who are tempted to visit the first game after trying the sequel.
63	0	a	It's an action Tower Defense game. You place traps then you help shooting monsters down before they reach the goal.  Buy the second one. Skip this one. The second even has most maps from this game, and has co-op which is missing here. Feels more like an incomplete and simple game.
64	0	a	The lack of ability to respec or refund your upgrades really hurts the game. One of the most fun parts of games like this is experimenting with different strategies and different weapons, so the fact that you can't do this at all very much takes away from the fun.
672	1	a	Very nice game 10/10
65	0	a	Don't get me wrong, it is a fun game, but I say it's inferior to the sequel. The lack of multiplayer is especially disappointing here. I wouldn't pick this up unless I've played through the sequel and still feel like I haven't had enough.
674	1	a	(͡0 ͜ʖ ͡0) Killing a army of Sherks, and Doin' that home alone shet 6/10 Berry gud game
676	1	a	Lots of dead orcs
66	0	a	Tower defence at its finest, intuitive gameplay and a lot of replay value. The only reason this is getting a negative review is because at this point you're better off buying the sequel OMD2. It has everything this game has and more.
67	0	a	Orcs Must Die is at its core a tower defense game, but in 3D, with a below average FPS element. If you are a fan of tower defense games, I'm sure you'll get a lot of enjoyment out of the game, since there is a lot of content.  If you are a FPS gamer however, you'll probably get bored very quickly, as I did. Orcs Must Die was probably never intended to compare to 'real' FPS games, and as such, the combat, difficulty, and enemy diversity and adaptation is lacking when you compare it.  It's really annoying that you can only recommend a game, or not. If you are tower defense player, Orcs Must Die is amazing value. If you are an FPS gamer, Orcs Must Die is disappointing.
68	0	a	The game is uber fun but good luck getting it to work. On multiple machines it just starts to a black screen and shows a sword icon. Common issue and the game devs don't seem to care.
69	0	a	It's taken me 8 attempts but I'm finally about to beat this level with no enemies making it through the ri-  *game crash*  *uninstall*
70	0	a	Could be a great game if it was a mobile app. but it's not
678	1	a	Well you can play it an hour or two......  maybe 3....  F*** it's 6 AM again.
680	1	a	This game is like Dungeon Defenders but without the gear treadmill and useless cash-grabs.
682	1	a	♥
71	0	a	Gets boring waaaayyyy too quickly. Don't know why it has such a high score. Look, it's an interesting concept but just not worth it.
684	1	a	This is a fun defense game that allows another level of emersion towards the gameplay. Plus this game will run realativly well on a decent enought computer and will allow you to enjoy the game.
72	0	a	I really want to love this game, but I cant.
73	0	a	It's fun until you realise it is just a regular horde game and you can't really combo the traps together very much. Just get the sequel.
74	0	a	i dont know, but i didnt found something special in this game
75	0	a	It's a worse version of Sanctum with orcs.
76	0	a	The control scheme is straight up awkward and I don't know what it was designed for, but I can tell you it wasn't meant for controller or kb and mouse. That alone ruins what would otherwise be an uninspired, repetitive tower defense third person action game.  There's much better out there.
77	0	a	Orcs must die!2 buy that one. Steer clear of this one. It`s so much inferior.
78	0	a	Got old real quick, like most games of its kind. Pass.
79	0	a	An okay tower defense game. Gets boring very quickly, but to be honest I really dislike the genre, hence why I might be prejudiced. If you like tower defenses, ignore my review, otherwise I recommend to pass on this one. It's just building traps and watching enemies walk into them and die. Sure, the game provides some challenge, but the gameplay itself is just setting up traps as quickly as possible and shooting some enemies from time to time.
80	0	a	Unplayable for me as performace is very very bad. Even the menus are slow and jerky although i can play OMD 2 no problem so not recommended. Get the follow up.
81	0	a	this isnt a tower defance game, this is a hack and slash game with 2 weak weapons with an idiotic loud mouth duchbag charecter.  traps and defences are useles and weak, and too expensive to buy or update.  money is too low and hard to come by.  way to hard and repetative to eaven bother. and there is the occasional crashing.  nope.
82	0	a	01000111 01110010 01101111 01101001 01100111 00100000 01110011 01100101 01100101 00100111 01110011 00100000 01100001 01101100 01101100
83	0	a	Not fun.. When you start it's already hard without a turtorial only how to press buttons.. The game is too fast and i can't aim.
84	0	a	Very boring
686	1	a	Love the hero and his witty humor, the tower defense part feel just right but it lacks coop. The SP part should make up for it.
688	1	a	Must have.
690	1	a	The best mashup of TD (tower defence) and FPS I've ever played. This game takes the best of both worlds and putes them in one game. Visually pleasing and fun to play, I couldn't think of a bad part about the game. Characters are amusing and the sound effects are nice. I highly recommend this to everybody!!
692	1	a	One of the best tactical tower defense games I've ever played. Unforunately the sequel got hung up focusing too much on co-op, but this original title still stands tall and has a permanent place in my favorites folder.
694	1	a	I've only played this game for a few hours but so far it has been a very fun experience. The early levels are fairly easy but it gets trickier and more strategic as the number of possible enemy paths increases. The cartoon graphics are an acquired taste but bring an appreciable casual twist. A good aray of weapons eventhough the crossbow is completely OP!  I do regret the fact that there is no other game mode available different from 'Campaign', keeping in mind each level warrants a second or third playthrough due to the ability to utilize newly acquired upgrades in played levels to increase score. THIS IS A SCORING GAME. If that is not your thing, you might be dissa.pointed by a too short game. However, if you find it a under 5$ (Holiday sales yay!). It's totally worth it.
696	1	a	A good game to relax your mind with by slaughtering the green masses, thought it gets kind of repetitive towards the end
698	1	a	8/10
700	1	a	Slay Orcs, get combos, feel awesome. What more do you need? If you're feeling kind, check out my high scoring guides on the tube for some pointers and insights that you can use to crush me:  http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC8F49D249E7CAE60&amp;feature=plcp 
702	1	a	This is a great tower defnse game that I could play for hours on end! the combat is fun and making awesome defenses adds to the fun of the game.
704	1	a	Basically the only thing I think about all day long is killing orcs. The cathartic release provided to me by this game sates my orc murder-lust and allows me to sleep at night.
706	1	a	it do not work for me
708	1	a	Orcs and magic and tower defence....oh ya and FUN
710	1	a	This game is really good. You basically slaughter orcs with traps and tower defense skills, but you are also in the thick of the action shooting orcs with a crossbow and other useful weapons.   Cons  This game is racist against all orc kind. For the Horde! Gameplay gets repetive after a while
712	1	a	I bought this game because it was on sale, I played it for hours becasue it was more fun than can be described.   http://geekyblithering.blogspot.com/2014/12/orcs-must-die.html 
714	1	a	If you're looking to pick up a fun game to kill a couple of hours at a time, this is a very engaging tower defense form of game. The price is right.
716	1	a	A really fun tower defence game. The last map is rediculus but the other ones are pretty easy.  + Gameplay + Characters + Perfect to play if you have time to spare. - Limited upgrades to weapons and traps. 8/10
718	1	a	Funny dialogue, solid mechanics, creative traps, and well-designed levels add up to an addictively challenging and fun game. I'd suggest getting the bundle, since OMD!2 is even bigger and better.
720	1	a	Very polished and addicting. Killing orcs was never so much fun!
722	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is probably one of the best games (that I bought on steam for under 10$) that I've played this year. The main character spouts off Bruce Campbell one-liners, the music is stellar, and the gameplay is easy to pick up and addicting. What more could you ask for?
724	1	a	its a great game
726	1	a	This game is much more fun than I expected. Nightmare mode is a bit too intense though...
728	1	a	Awesome tower defense game which lets you get in the action yourself. Not the first of its kind, but definitely the first good one. Super cheap, must have.
730	1	a	Fun and Funny at the same time. I have never laughted so hard while plaing a game before this. Great graphics as well. And the price is right.
732	1	a	Kill the Horde!!!
734	1	a	Most definitely the best indie game I've played. BY FAR!
736	1	a	An over the shoulder shooter / tower defence game. Brings you right into the middle of the fray as you try and stop orcs from entering the rifts to your world. Slice em, dice em, burn, em, freeze em, and a whole lot more with your varied arsenal of traps and spells.  Some of the earlier levels might be a tad boring, however as you progress you unlock more toys to decimate your foes with, and you can go back to older stages with all your unlocks.   Fun for hours on end. Come forth young Warmage, defend your homeland, and remember ORCS MUST DIE!
738	1	a	The best mad-hardkor game in the WORD!
740	1	a	Sucks in comparison to Orcs 2. They started out with some interesting mechanics, but playing it as a singleplayer is kinda boring say compared to Dungeon Defenders. In orcs 2 they built upon all the systems and made it more player friendly and more chances to experiment. Also coop in orcs 2 automatically makes it better.
742	1	a	I only bought this for the Steam achievement but it turns out to be an excellent game. Tower defence plus stubbing, and the Orcs MUST Die.
744	1	a	Orcs Must Die, is a first person tower defence game which pits you as the last master builder to stop the oncoming hoard of endless orcs from destroying your home land!  build traps and defences in interesting levels in order to stop the orcs from making it through your portal.  If you like tower defence games, you'll love Orcs Must Die!  9/10
746	1	a	Solid third person tower defence game. I've played this entire game through and I can tell you it's great. It's a great way to kill time and an awesome strategy game. The DLC is great and adds some really useful weapons, but it is in NO WAY pay to win. Pick it up when it's on sale.
748	1	a	Orcs Must Die is a very fun game - it focuses on one core concept (killing orcs) and sets everything up around that. A mixture of Tower Defence and 3rd person action, you lay traps to slow down, maim, and kill orcs to prevent them from getting to your base. You have to get your hands dirty, though, as you won't be able to kill everything in the early waves with traps alone.  I haven't had so much fun with a game in a long time!
750	1	a	Not just your average tower defense game. Really clever with a fun sense of humor.
752	1	a	Like tower defense? Like shooting hordes of orcs? Well, what are you waiting for?!
754	1	a	This game is a tower defence with third person shooter/ Hack'n'Slash Gameplay. The title tells you the enemies and you only have a limited choice of characters.  7/10  Dungeon Defender is a better option.
756	1	a	Awesome tower defense/FPS where you can use all kinds of towers! Destroy orks to get to the next level.  Also the story, even though it is in the background, is kind of interesting. Main hero has great catchphrases... :-)
758	1	a	Do you think it's a game in which you only kill orcs? Think again! Even though you're in a slaughter-roll, it's all about strategy. With various traps and spells you have to make the best choise in order to defeat them. So.. be free my dear apprentice and show them that they're no match for you xD
760	1	a	Great game if you want something casual that you can put ten min into when you take brakes from other stuff.
762	1	a	It's a great game that offers tons of fun.Players,are tasked with defending the magic orb from orcs,by using several traps and weapons to kill them.In short,killing orcs has never been to so much fun.
764	1	a	This game really rocks =)
766	1	a	Cocky mages, large breasted Elves and swathes of Orcs. Swoon.
768	1	a	One great over-the-shoulder shooter / tower defence game. Challenging toward the later levels with just the right amount of story and charactation to give context to why you slauther so many orcs. Great death animations with gobs of gibs and gore.
770	1	a	The deal is simple, orcs must die and you have to kill them, you can shoot at them, slash them with big sword, trap their approach. What ever you do, no orcs are allowed to reach the portal.
772	1	a	Excellent, fun game. Cheap too.
774	1	a	You're killing orcs. Hordes and hordes of orcs. Burn them, spear them, drop them in acid, freeze them, shoot them, chop them up, make orc stew. I can't think of a more fun way to waste an entertainment hour than to kill a few hundred more orcs!
776	1	a	Super fun! Get some friend's together and play with them. I had some of the best fun with my friends, Our hearts pumping with intensity in this game.
778	1	a	Bought in the steam sale, but oh my goodness...it's been a while since I literally started playing a game and could not stop, but killing orcs was so much fun! The story is just enough to push the story forward. The interface is simple and functional, though don't expect to be able to place traps in the middle of first person orc killing. Graphics seemingly inspired by Blizzard and WOW (not a bad thing).  Overall it was worth the original £11.99...but it feels like a steal from the steam sale!
780	1	a	Fun third-person tower-defense game.  Lots of humour, and the game has character. Very intuitive and good for a quick fix every now and again. Does get progressively challenging to keep you on your toes.
782	1	a	Fun take on tower defense. Third person over the shoulder with traps. Plus it's nice and cheap!
784	1	a	7.3/10
786	1	a	This was a surprising bundle of fun. I tried the demo and liked it, then ended up waiting till it went on sale. I enjoyed it so much that I almost regretted waiting for the sale. I easily dumped 20 hours into this game on a weekend, I couldn't put it down.
788	1	a	Must they?
790	1	a	A tower defense/action game, really fun and varied, great for anyone looking for a new TD game
792	1	a	Fire casting, lightning wielding, crossbow shooting, sword swinging, trap placing goodness. You are some dude who has to protect some portal from the orcs who want to use it. You do so by killing them yourself by means of fire, ice, lightning, sword, crossbow, lifestealing, etc. You can also place traps to make an unpassable death hallway which you can sit back and watch. You even has access to archers and Knight minions to place to kill the orcs. Really Really fun! Running around killing the stuff. The game looks beautiful, the main character is funny and has nice remarks and stuff to say while your killing the orc, very funny. It is part strategy with placing the traps on walls, floors and ceilings while also being a 3rd person view 3d game where you can run around and kill stuff. I have no idea why this isn't more popular.
794	1	a	Orcs try to kill you and various things you defend. So, naturally, you're insulted by their balls, and you decide to ♥♥♥♥ up those jerks.  So you place some traps and go 'pew pew pew.'  That's it, and it's pretty awesome...
796	1	a	Worth every penny when it's on sale. Worth a lot of pennies when it's not on sale, but probably not all the pennies they want. Get the fancy version.
798	1	a	Saying that this game is just slightly addictive would be completely unjust. If you're a fan of tower defense and hack and slash games then this game combines the best of both worlds. Plus this game has tons of load out options for each level, requiring your choices to be well thought out depending on the layout of each level. The game doesn't just entertain you with great gameplay but also with a quirky sense of humor. I definitely recommend this title be bought and played!
800	1	a	It is the ♥♥♥♥ing twenty-first century and games are still being produced that do not allow you to change key bindings in-game. Why? I don't know why, maybe they're just grossly incompetent. But apart from locking you into a potentially ♥♥♥♥♥♥ setup, it's not a bad game. There are orcs, you must kill them, bonus points if you do it in an amusing fashion.
802	1	a	Entertaining. A mix between tower defense and action... It's good, I do reccomend it.
804	1	a	Great game , kills your time for slicing ugly orcs when you are not in the mode :D
806	1	a	A single player tower defense action game. As the name suggest your character must defend a room from an onslaught of orcs. The orcs will come through a door as their starting point. Each will proceed to the end goal at the opposite end (usually) of the room. You will run around setting up traps of all kind. Along floors, walls, and ceilings. Traps consist of lava, tar, spikes, and so on. Unlike alot of other defense games this game has more interaction. During and in between rounds you can purchase and lay your traps through out. However, you can also attack the oncoming orcs with one of two weapons. A melle and range weapon set this game apart. Being able to actively attack enemies makes this that much more fun. No need to feel as just a spectator to the game. Most enemies wont attack you as they are driven to their goal. However, as the levels proceed difficulty increases. With newer enemies comes new threats, and new threats begat new traps to counter. If strategy and defense is your cup of tea. I highly recommend this title as the ability to attack will bring something new that you will enjoy. However, if it is not your cup of tea. I still recommend it for the very same reason.
808	1	a	Dude this game is addictive as hell......Well worth the money
810	1	a	I usually don't like tower defense games because they often turn into just sitting around waiting for the enemies to die, but with the blend of third-person action, Orcs Must Die! is a lot more fun and engaging. It gets especially intense when you have to monitor multiple paths at once. I'm not sure whether I'd recommend the DLC, since it doesn't add that much to the game -- but on the other hand, it's not very expensive. So, play this game! It's awesome.   Full review here:  http://postlaunch.blogspot.ca/2012/01/orcs-must-die.html 
812	1	a	Got this cheap, best value for the money. Unadulterated orc killing goodness.
814	1	a	This game is just plain awesome. Worth every penny. 9/10.
816	1	a	The games title says it all. Be as merciless as possible, they are only Orc's.
818	1	a	Christmas Extra: Gifted to me by a good friend, this actually turned out to be fun and humourous romp, where you must use a combination of weapons and nifty traps to kill as many orcs as possible, defending a central portal. Very fast-paced, very simple, very addicting.  Definitely recommend a buy :D
820	1	a	I absolutley love this game. It is great! I suggest you should get it, you will not regret!
822	1	a	It's fun to play, humerous, great music, and an all round fantastic game 10/10
824	1	a	Not enough Orcs.
826	1	a	Somewhere between tower defense and horde mode there are a lot of dead orcs. A perfectly paced action game that applies enough pressure to induce flow, but has an occasional breather to prevent fatigue. Throw in a few one-liners and a metal soundtrack and this one's a winner. More reflections writ in orcish blood at  http://www.pixelsocks.com/2011/11/30/orcs-must-die-review/ 
828	1	a	Kind of like Tower Defense except with Orcs... and more blood... and not at all like tower defense...
830	1	a	Love this game!!!! so much fun
832	1	a	If you're looking for a classical TD game, this is not it. On later levels, the emphasis is more on shooting, casting spells and juggling between multiple minion entry points than creating clever choke points at good spots. This gets a bit tedious over time. It is a fairly good play however.
834	1	a	Orcs Must Die!!! It's a really cool tower defense game
836	1	a	Pure addictive fun, well worth the price.  Only complaint is that all the traps / units cost so much. By the time you finally complete an effective defence the level is over and you dont get to really watch it in action.
838	1	a	This is what Aliens: Colonial Marines should have been like!
840	1	a	This has got to be one of the most fun indie games I have ever played. The gameplay is addicting and very humorous. A Must Buy, I simply cannot wait for Orcs Must Die! 2
842	1	a	A very simple premise that has enourmous satisfaction once hundreds of Orcs are running into your perfectly designed killzone of spinning, severed limbs and charred flesh.
844	1	a	this game is fu*king awesome :D
846	1	a	The foremost trap defense &amp; hack&amp;slash hybrid, Orcs Must Die! provides a very gratifying experience to the gamer looking for something different yet familiar.  Following the traditional tower defense formula, you protect one or more rifts from a wave-based offensive by a large variety of baddies by placing traps on their path to said structures.  Following the not-traditional tower defense formula, after placing your traps and/or NPCs, you're allowed to join the fray while the orc/ogre/goblin/otherwise offensive is raging. Add your bladestaff, spells and/or crossbow to the mix and help defend the rifts.  Add some very nice music and voicework, and you get one of the definitive games of 2011.  I'll add jokes next time.
848	1	a	Tower Defense game with lots of orcs in it. If you like tower defense game, give it a try. It is a surprisingly good game with tons of upgrades and traps (that are often funny to watch as they trigger various animations TO and ON the orcs). The game is also quite big and thus on normal difficulty may take more than 10 hours to beat, assuming you are good at tower defense. Once beaten the Nightmare difficulty is unlocked. Good luck!
850	1	a	This is a great game :-) The main campaign felt a little long, but the humour and shooting during the waves is really fun. I don't think I'd play it a second time. Instead I'd likely pick up the sequel and do co-op with a friend.
852	1	a	Really fun game! Tower defense, yes, but by no means boring or stale. Orcs actively want to murder you and you have heaps of fun fun tools to murder them back. Or you can do it all by yourself, using your magic shovel-sword thingy. Not a game to be played endlessly, but tons of fun for many hours. Excellent sale purchase.
854	1	a	Wow, really nice puzzle+action game with loads of fun ... kind of gets too hard too quickly, for my liking, but it's bearable.
856	1	a	There's orcs. They must die. Don't let them live.
858	1	a	I was unsure what to expect when i first purchased orcs must die but i was definately pleasantly suprised and it has been a very enjoyable experience. Its an added twist on tower defense games by putting you right into the action allowin you to get your hand dirty with some first person orc killin fun! would easily recommend to anyone!
860	1	a	Racism against orcs! Genocide of orcs! That's what this game is all about! The Humans are portrayed as the 'saviours', even though the orcs are just trying to find a new home. ELVES CONTROL THE MEDIA!!!
862	1	a	Of all the recent first-person tower defenses to come out recently, OMD wins on variety and comic relief. A bit annoying you can't take your upgrade points back, though.  One note: Get the Artifact DLC. The poison satchel has saved my butt several times, and it alone is worth the price of the pack... well, the sale price anyways.
864	1	a	This is a highly entertaining game. There are some difficulty spikes but overall this game is really really fun. I highly recommend it if you like tower defense games/ 3rd person action games
866	1	a	Easily the funnest action/tower defense game I've ever played. Great variety of trap types, weapons and character customization. Fun fun game!
868	1	a	Lots of fun :) I highly recommend!
870	1	a	SO much better than I thought it'd be. Got hours of enjoyment out of this.
872	1	a	Dont go into this game expecting a story or a overly contrived chracter.... The game is exactly as the title suggest... and boy is it satisfying   It promises nothing more than orc slaying.   To understand the game think of it in the 'Tower Defense' genre.   Its real charm is how it does not take itself seriously.    For what it is the game is an easy 8/10 But as a TD game it is a 10/10
874	1	a	Love to kill orcs! Great tower defense with great humour. I only can recommend it to everyone!
876	1	a	An extremely enjoyable single player game with global high scores. Seriously a lot of fun and challenging.
878	1	a	Funny tower defence-type game, which has good graphics, great music and lots of orcs to kill.
880	1	a	Tower Defense is very much in this Season, and so is this game!
882	1	a	A fun game. It strikes a nice balance between action and strategy, but can become frustrating difficult at times.
884	1	a	great, orcs must die is a great franchise. the premis is simple: orcs, kobolds and trolls attack your castle and you build traps and shoot them with your spells and weapons. if you do it correctly it will be a breeze, do it wrong and you will curse the day you chose to do that level.  the good: - many hours of playtime - nightmare mode - is both fun and funny  the bad: - upgrades are permanent (no refunds) - orcs must die 2 gives much more (also value for money)  8.5/10
886	1	a	Never has mass murder been more fun! Those poor Orcs never stood a chance. Even going back to 'perfect' levels was entertaining. Simple premise, months of fun as you find yourself going back now and again. 
888	1	a	BUY THIS GAME. I love it. Such a fun game. Introduced me to the Tower Defense genre. It's a 3rd person shooter meets RTS. Real fun, IMO.
890	1	a	You take place of a special wizard dude who dies, and you have to defend certain areas of a castle from enemys, mostly being orcs. You gain multiple spells, traps you can place, and you also have a set of spells. You gain money from killing these enemys, allowing you to strategicly place even more traps. As you advance through stages, you gain more ways of defending your castle. you can also have a few allies that help you along the way. To be honest my little siblings play this game more than me. Not really my style.  7/10
892	1	a	
894	1	a	It... Just Awesome!
896	1	a	Fun, no bugs met, fast-paced. If you these series only now, starting from first is still a good idea.
898	1	a	Fast-paced and super fun, definitely worth it with the small price tag.
900	1	a	I wasn't interested in this game when I first saw it. Its art-style seemed too whimsically Warcrafty for me, and the recently saturated tower-defense genre generally holds little of my interest. Orcs Must Die, though, is an excellent surprise. Sweet visuals, a balanced challenge-level, tight gameplay, and very good voice-acting and writing elevate this game to the point of can't-put-it-away-'til-I-beat-it (a rare thing for my very real attention deficit issues to lean to). A small price during those wonderful Steam sale holidays, restrained and worthy DLC releases, and a sequel coming out with co-op? Yes. Yes I will.
902	1	a	'kill the orcs , Slay the orcs , Destroy the orcs' - 3 Inches Of Blood
904	1	a	Good lord, this game is addicting! Tower defense + third-person action = Complete Win! If you enjoy tower defense or third-person RPGs, this game will kick you square in the ♥♥♥ with awesomeness. GET IT!
906	1	a	Orcs Must Die is a decent 3rd person perspective tower defence game. You try and stop the attacking Orcs from reaching the portal, you have assorted weapons and traps at your disposal and new ones unlock as you progress through the levels. I enjoyed it for the short time i've played it, but apart from the new perspective on Tower Defence games, it offers nothing ground-breaking in terms of gameplay. A neat idea that for some unfathomable reason doesn't translate as well as it should, still worth a try though.
908	1	a	it's good
910	1	a	♥♥♥♥ me! all the money I waste on 'big name' games. Sometimes i want to just have soe fun and not have to remember hundreds of buttons, tutorials, and every other dynamic in the book. Same time I may want something simple..but not low production indie crap(not saying all indie is crap). THIS game totally suprsed me..concept is simple..production values are very high and it is one of those games you play, you enjoy and you think it will soon pass....a few hours later there you still are. One of the best games i have played in a long time. It has the simplity of the 80's but it has some cool tricks up it's sleeve and is the perfect mix....♥♥♥♥ civ 5 lol get this and actually smile about your purchase!
912	1	a	it was a realy fun game
914	1	a	Great game for basic slice em up's Would play more than once
916	1	a	What a game! Honestly a really well designed game that can make killing seemly endless waves of orcs amazingly fun. The game has aged really well and has provided many hours of fun while playing to completion. War mage is fun, but the real party is a nightmare... though nothing (with the exclusion of the last level of the DLC, great gorge) is exceptionally hard, there is a good enough level of difficulty to keep you focused on what's important and really test you as a gamer. A great game and I would and will recommend!
918	1	a	Great first person tower defense
920	1	a	A real surprise, it's a fun game and has lots of replayability. Get it.
922	1	a	Very good game, use your inttelliegence and accuracy.
924	1	a	I have both OMD1 and OMD2 and I must say that OMD1 still holds up very well. The graphics and playbility remain strong today despite the fact OMD1 is now 4-years old.  OMD1 and OMD2 is all about killing massive numbers of orcs, ogres, and all manner of creatures in a fun, cartoony-violent way. Yes, the game has a large amount of 'gore and violence' but it is 'fine and acceptable' because of the 'fun' way the developers render the graphics. If the graphics were done 'realistically', the 'gore and violence' would make it unacceptable for kids and even many adults who have queasy stomachs.  For example, I find it funny when you kill an ogre, you see slices of meat / chopped meat to represent the killing than a rendering of what a mutilated ogre might look like 'realistically'. It is also funny to watch all the orcs 'suffer' and otherwise react to being tortured and then killed. I know it might sound really bad when you read this but it is really a credit to the developers who pulled off this magical feat (no pun intended) of making all the killing and violence fun and amusing.  Ultimately, this is meant to be a fun, humorous, and fast-paced game where one can escape to kill hundreds of digital creatures. And as of the game and the DLC's wasn't fun enough, I bought OMD1 at a steep Steam discount. When you play a fabulous game for dozens of hours and you buy it for a steal, it just doesn't get any better for a gamer.  OMD1 is a winner. When you get done with OMD1, go to OMD2. So much fun! 
926	1	a	AMAZING GAME. Tower defense RPG FPS. Lots of orc violence and stupid humour.
928	1	a	80%
930	1	a	if you wanna have REAL FUNN, try this
932	1	a	Ayone with a remote interest in tower defence games should get this. 
934	1	a	Fun and nice game!
936	1	a	Great game, lots of fun. Set up traps, watch orcs die. It's also fun revisiting old levels with new tools that you have earned and playing through it a completely different way.  The Artifacts of Power DLC has some fun toys in it; I've found the Floor Scorcher particularly useful.
938	1	a	Good take on tower defense games with a fun little story, doing it three times was not so fun though.
940	1	a	A trap defense game. Fun fun. Well worth the $15.
942	1	a	This is a fun game, but it doesn't have the co-op goodness of Orcs Must Die 2. Both games are very similar, and there's not much point installing this one if you have OMD2 as well.
944	1	a	Nice tower defense and shooter
946	1	a	i had a blast during my 27 hours of play NUF SAID
948	1	a	Aw yeah! A great 3PS/tower defense combination!
950	1	a	Very entertaining game.
952	1	a	Pooty and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥'s Official Seal of Approval.  (Seal represents a game that we've actually completed. These games may not be the highest critically reviewed in every case, but there was something about them that carried us through to the end. When your library has grown as large as ours have, this means something special.)
954	1	a	Simpel, smooth, fast and funny.
956	1	a	You get to kill orcs...what's better than that? 
958	1	a	Great take on tower defense mixed with first person shooter. It is immensely entertaining blasting hoards of orcs and setting up elaborate traps to mow them down.
960	1	a	One of my favorite games - a tower defense shooter with a load of ingenious traps, humor, and fast-paced action.
962	1	a	Very funny and awesome tower defense! I recommend to buy!
964	1	a	I have played relatively few Tower Defense games, it being a genre that does not generally appeal to me. Orcs Must Die essentially said to me, 'Okay, so you don't like sitting around watching towers kill things. How about if YOU get to kill things too?' And I was like 'Okay OMD, I'm listening.' And what fun I had. Orcs Must Die strikes an amazing blend of frantic third-person combat with the strategy of Tower Defense, creating a game that forces you to think and react with equal speed. It is challenging, occasionally frustrating but ultimately very rewarding, not every game leaves me feeling so satisfied when the credits finally roll. It's damn funny too, with its idiotic but endearingly determined protagonist and an Ork horde that's quite disenchanted with the whole marauding business and would rather not die horrible deaths in the service of their whiny sorceress.
966	1	a	If you like 'tower defense' games, then I suggest you to try this one. I found it quite addictive. Also, who wouldn't like to beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of orcs with traps, crossbow and bladestaff? :D
968	1	a	This game is addicting. It's a ton of fun and why aren't you playing it yet?!
970	1	a	Funniest Game Ever! Never seen any other games that can reach this far to be both diffecult and funny at the same time! AMAZING!
972	1	a	One of the best FPS tower defence so far.
974	1	a	Highly recommended if you enjoy both tower defense and third person shooter games as this combines them both. Clever humor and some great challenges that push the brain to solve problems and react fast. I greatly enjoyed trying to get five skulls on every map.
976	1	a	Orcs most definitely need to die. This game allows you tons of freedom to make them do just that. Great frantic fun and if you want something more on the cooperative side then Dungeon Defenders offers a similar experience but for 4 people.
978	1	a	This game is a lot of fun!
980	1	a	Unrepentant fun. It's an easy challenge (though it looks like there's an unlockable nightmare version) but in replaying levels to get a perfect score I've discovered there are wildly different ways to beat each, which makes a game so much fun.   I heartily recommend the GOTY edition, because it's hard to imagine the game being as fun without some of the traps it provides.
982	1	a	relaxing and fun game to play. who dosent love to smash some orcs!
984	1	a	Amazing! After a long day, just give this a whirl. 10 minutes of Orc killin' fun, and a very big smile will be yours!
986	1	a	A must have in the tower defense genre, awesome gameplay and using slicing and dicing traps instead of towers gives it a fresh feel compared to the staple. The only thing I imagine missing in it are multiplayer maps. This and Dungeon Defenders are probably my favourite tower defense games next to Jelly Defense and HexDefense on mobile.
988	1	a	very great game and very fun
990	1	a	You must set up the bomb to kill orcs for great justice.
992	1	a	Awesome game with good graphics and lots of hard challenges and enemies,very good weapons like the Bladesword (or whatever it was called...),Magic Crossbow,Advanced Arrow Trap,Spike Trap,Pit Trap,Lava and Acid Pit.Suitable for gamers of any age  Love it :)
994	1	a	If you like tower defense, this just may be your game.
996	1	a	This game is one of the best combinations of hack and slash and strategy I've ever played and ever will play. The core concepts are engaging and easy to grasp, making conquering a new level never feel like a chore. The mindless killing is backed up perfectly with very strategic trap placement: after a good setup, watching it just run it's course is absolutely worth it. The replayability is totally there, as new solutions to levels and better scores are always there. Even someone who just wants to blaze through it without caring for scores will have a fun and difficult time (but you should try to 5-star every level, as every new star earned in a level is 1 point in the shop, used for upgrading traps and weapons). And traps isn't all there is: the traps would be useless without you, the player, hopping in and doing some killing yourself. And those achievements (if you want to get them all) will tack on many hours to this amazing game. In short, I think everyone should have a chance to expirience this masterpiece (and the sequel). Too bad the MOBA sucks.
998	1	a	Awesome. Its a must have for those who like TD games
1000	1	a	This game is very awesome. A third person, defense game. What more could you ask for? shooting orcs with a crossbow and using traps to kill those ugly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.   Overall great game and is fun for the average gamer.
1002	1	a	Extremely unique and very fun. I love the art style and humor. If only there was coop...oh wait OMD2 does!
1004	1	a	Orcs Must Die is an excellent,very fun to play tower defense style game. If it had co op,there would be no need to buy the sequel. Definitely recommended!
1006	1	a	Nice Blizzard-esque graphics, very amusing.
1008	1	a	Gets my vote for Game of the Year for 2011. Not bad for a budget title eh? I've replayed sooooo many of the levels.
1010	1	a	Tower defense &amp; 3rd person shooter have a medieval crackbaby.
1012	1	a	So much fun! It's a wonderful mix of strategy and action. Plus, you get to slaughter thousands and thousands or orcs, which is surprisingly entertaining. It has an absolutely wonderful tone that makes the game fun to play even when it should be frustrating.  8.5/10
1014	1	a	Great action + cheap price!
1016	1	a	This is one of the funnest games Ive played in a long time. Tower defence and third person action combined makes for an AWESOME game.
1018	1	a	Tried the demo and loved it! Bought it and looking forward to Orcs Must Die 2!
1020	1	a	This is hands-down one of the greatest single-player tower defense games of all time. Do not wait, go buy it now. Learn the game, then continue to replay to compete on the leaderboards. High scoring is where the game really shines. Join the Orcs Must Die forums and learn new strategies. Check out all of my Orcs Must Die! videos on YouTube as well.  http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5A63F9CBCBBC5556&amp;feature=plcp 
1022	1	a	They must die
1024	1	a	Great game, but gets old pretty fast. The multiplayer options in the new one might keep it alive a little longer, but once you've defended against a few rounds you feel like you've pretty much gotten the full experience. If you think a third-person shooter/tower-defense game would compell you to play for multiple hours then it's a pretty good game. Doesn't have much longevity for me.  7/10
1026	1	a	It's good.
1028	1	a	If you want to pass some time doing something meaningless AND fun! Addictive...
1030	1	a	It's good, buy it
1032	1	a	Addictive! Handle with care.;)
1034	1	a	On sale? - Must buy. Not on sale? - Buy if you are not broke.
1036	1	a	I realize that not much can be said about this game that has not already. So buy it. It's awesome.
1038	1	a	This game is so addictive! Easy to learn and to pick up and play! 10/10
1040	1	a	This game is unadulterated fun. It's simple to start, simple to understand, but the carnage that follows is undeniably addictive.
1042	1	a	Great action puzzle game, well worth the cost of admission.
1044	1	a	Superbly made tower defence game. Worth playing even if you don't like the genre. Funny, slick and addictive.
1046	1	a	A great game to pass the time. Fun, fast, and fantastic.
1048	1	a	Coool
1050	1	a	It's tower defence on steroids. Excellent game!
1052	1	a	Skip the console version and pick this up on your PC. The controls make gameplay so much more fluid and fun. A great little time waster with a fun personality!
1054	1	a	Definitely try the demo first. If you grin and chuckle at all like I did while playing it, you'll enjoy the full game. Priced currently at $15, I've already gotten my money's worth with 7+ hours invested and more on the way. There is enough replayability to go back to earlier levels and refine your trap setting and weaver upgrades. My only problem with the game - no coop. This game is just crying for it. I've paid 50 bucks for games that I've only enjoyed 1/4 as much as this one. 8.5+ rating.
1056	1	a	I don't know how I went so long without playing this game, but it is, without a doubt, the single greatest tower defense and hack and slash game I've ever played.
1058	1	a	Fantastic game. Really addictive, humorous and great value for money.
1060	1	a	Damn this game is fun! The art style is perfect and the execution, humor, and fun level is amazing.
1062	1	a	If you like a fast and casual game.. this is it .. it is really worth the 10 dollah including the two expansions..   i just bought it..  amazing game &lt;3
1064	1	a	Its awesome and entertainment game
1066	1	a	6/10
1068	1	a	Really cool little game. I like where the tower defense genre is going.
1070	1	a	A very addictive and funny game!! I recommend it!!
1072	1	a	 The Master  should be proud of me
1074	1	a	Perfect game for anyone that is still ♥♥♥♥♥♥ about the death of Thorin II Oakenshield
1076	1	a	So much fun to be had in this oldie but goodie. Very well laid out and easy to get into. The controls are similar to an fps. the gameplay is a mix of tower defense and fps genres with great graphics, sounds and a humorous story thrown in to keep the fun coming for hours!  Strongly recommend this to fans of tower defense games looking for something fun that gets more challenging and addicting as you progress. If you are looking for a multipalyer component go with the second. You won't be disapointed with either.
1078	1	a	just buy it, this game is great fun! Its not very long but it can be played over and over again.
1080	1	a	Massive dose of fun!   Introducing spike traps to the orcs and making a disney villain like ex apprentice take down a notch is always fun.  Especially loved the beginning. 'One slip, on a kobold's blood...' lol  7/10
1082	1	a	Great Game cant wait for the third one.
1084	1	a	Fun and addicting action tower defense.
1086	1	a	Okay first summary shoot Orcs place traps which shoot Orcs what part of that do you not like, buy it
1088	1	a	Very nice third person TD,unusual,but very nice,enjoying playing it
1090	1	a	This is a tower defense game where you can run around killing off what your towers don't get. A lot of levels are challenging, and if you beat them just barely then you can come back later with better towers and upgrades to get all the points from it.  It's really a lot of fun. The graphics and story are great too.
1092	1	a	Gameplay is fun, normal difficulty is just right in difficulty. There is a hard difficulty when you beat normal, which adds much more replay value. There are a bunch of traps you can lay, and they all work well. Levels are actually really well done. I really, really enjoyed watching orcs get dismembered, blown up, skewered, dissolved, pushed into lava, shot up on the block, carved up, flung into pits of acid, electrocuted, burned, frozen, lit of fire, and so much more.
1094	1	a	its realy fun
1096	1	a	I never knew funneling a bunch of orcs into wall axes and commiting mass orc genocide would be something I enjoyed. Thanks for proving me wrong Robot Entertainment! 11/10
1098	1	a	I have only played the first couple of levels, but the best way to describe OMD! is as a cross between QUAKE and a tower defense game. The screenshots don't do it justice.  I can't decide if it's worth getting at full price, but I am so glad I grabbed this game (and the sequel) when the bundle was on sale.   If they make another sequel, I hope they figure out how to make a co-op multiplayer. It would be nice to be able to compete with a friend to see who can make the most kills, most headshots, and all around biggest mess. 
1100	1	a	Amazing action tower(traps?) defense gameplay bound together by a great theme and execution.   You're given great customization options on what to use to slaughter thousands of orcs. Fireball them from afar, push them into lava with a gust of wind, slice them with your bladestaff or mash/mince/grid/slice/incinerate/freeze/mind control them with any combination of traps you desire.   Level variety and design are also good. Each level feels different and presents you with its own set of challenges and you have to figure out where best to set up your killing fields. Some levels also have some 'consumable' one-time traps, that you have to trigger manually and have a powerful effect.  Sound design is good, dialog is funny, soundtrack is tense and epic and really makes you feel like you're the last bastion of defense, protecting your home from an invasion of orcs.   Overall great game, lots of fun, good challenge for those who seek it, so get it and start killing some orc!
1102	1	a	Congratulations to the Devs, excellent work!
1104	1	a	Really fun, I like it better than the sequal
1106	1	a	This is the end-all for tower defense games. Think 3D Kingdom Rush (subject matter) with Deathtrap Dungeon (lite).   You control a cocky human character who's pastime is slaughtering orcs. If the subject matter is offensive to you, like it is to me, disregard this recommendation--Orcs are the Evil version of Elfs, according to JRR Tolkien, and Elfs ♥♥♥♥ing suck, amen. However; Shooting a crossbow in a narrow hallway while the enemies stupidly run through your trap sequence is incredibly satisfying.  Music is bombastic and appropriate, controls are great, visuals are as good as they need to be. Gameplay is perfect. Out of a scale of -5 to +5 (with 0 being average), this game gets a 4.
1108	1	a	SUPER FUN! if you like towerdefense, traps and the sight of orcs getting burned, shredded, ripped apart, blow up and sliced then don't hesitate: BUY THIS GAME!
1110	1	a	Kill all the Orcs.
1112	1	a	great game to chill with
1114	1	a	Very nice, kill all the orcs lol.
1116	1	a	Tower Defense meets FPS. Game-play is fun and action packed, with a lot of replay value. Have fun gaining new skills and expanding your repertoire of traps to destroy your greenskined enemies!
1118	1	a	This game requires strategy,determination and a small loan of a million temmies.
1120	1	a	Lovable protagonist and simple, addictive, and actually challenging gameplay.
1122	1	a	Recommended... like a lot, game is awesome, played through it twice, and was having a blast both times.  whats not to like in slaughtering orcs by the hundreds, with a 'hero' who is like Ash from ED, he cracks me up.
1124	1	a	Awesome combat, sinister traps. Flawless, fluid performance with great visuals. The best tower defense game I've ever played. A must buy for fans of the genre.
1126	1	a	If you don't own this game I feel bad for you son, I got 99 problems but an orc ain't one!
1128	1	a	Ah, how I love tower defense games. I love this just the same. maybe a little more since i can clean up the messes my tower wont. only been playing a few hours and already addicted. bought it during their 90% steam sale just cause it was cheap and, now I wonder, 'WHY DIDN'T I BUY THIS SOONER?!' It has humor, fun, decent strategy, good music, decent voice acting, and even a story to go with it. Whats not to love?
1130	1	a	I'm actually not into the genre, but this one is a really fun Tower Defense game, plus the cheekiness makes it definitely worth it.
1132	1	a	Tower Defense style game, but with FPS action in the mix. The patch adds new traps and items.
1134	1	a	Awesome game! I'm a huge fan of tower defense games, especially ones with a nice and original twist, which is where ORCS MUST DIE comes in :). This is a must buy!
1136	1	a	Best orc slaughter simulation I've ever played.
1138	1	a	love it, its fantastic...BUY THIS GAME. its story, its gameplay, and its tactics to setting traps make it a great game....too bad they mess it up with the sequal 9/10!
1140	1	a	Surprisingly fun! Addictive tower defence gameplay with the added effect of being a defending unit yourself. Lots of fun trap combinations to try out, plenty of Orcs to kill, and some downright sinister level designs (though only a few). Highly recommend for short burst play!
1142	1	a	Very fun, can be challenging but there is a nice equilibrium between planning and action.
1144	1	a	A game that i wasnt that interested in to begin with. But i got it during the steam sale. And it was well worth it, it was so much more fun then i had thought looking at those trailers. So go get it even if you are just a little bit interested in it.
1146	1	a	If Plants vs. Zombies and Serious Sam got together and had a love child that they then raised in Middle Earth, it'd probably look something like Orcs Must Die!  A frenetic pace and very fun traps keep it interesting, even if the levels look a bit bland and it takes up an obscene amount of disc space. It also keeps new traps and abilities coming, which gives it lots of replay value.
1148	1	a	Lets face it..... Im hooked.... Hooked on slaughtering wave after wave of orcs and other baddies.   Always reccomend these games! tough to find a gamer who doesnt like this fast-paced click or die style of game. But great graphics, and funny comments from the orcs im destroying make this one a must have for me!  A touch laggy on optimal settings with i7 6700 core and a Radeon r9 390 graphics card, but works well on 'high'.
1150	1	a	An absolute blast to play. This game is fantastic. It has a nice, clean art style, funny dialogue, and perfect 3rd person tower defence gameplay. I highly recommend this game along with it's sequel Orcs Must Die 2.
1152	1	a	Very good game, like the name says, you have to kill orcs, there is a single player campaign where you have to defend so called 'rifts'. you can fend of the orcs by creating traps, using magic or kill them with your crossbow or bladestaff. also very funny!
1154	1	a	A very entertaining tower defense. Seeing to Orcs be shredded to bits is satisfying ^^
1156	1	a	The orc mass murder simulator. If you are into tower defense, this mix with action and strategy is for you, it's a must buy for fans of the genre.  10/10 would headshot an orc again.
1158	1	a	Great game of tower defense and hero abilities. There are multiple ways to play- trap focused, archer focued, sniping focused, magic focused. There are a variety of level types, enemies and map layouts.
1160	1	a	Classic tower defence game, it rules.
1162	1	a	Just too addictive! If only all tower defence games could be this challenging
121	0	a	I don't know.. if u have friends to play with u should buy this but if u dont dont buy...
1164	1	a	This has to be one of the most entertaining tower defense/3rd person games that I've played.
1166	1	a	This is hiilarious and fun to play! Also if you're fan of tower defense games, fanatsy and 3rd person shooter, than this game is just for you =)
1168	1	a	Good fun, cheap and easy to get into. Nice take on the whole Tower Defence genre. Well worth a punt.
1170	1	a	Dont let the lack of multiplayer stop you, this game is amazing!
1172	1	a	OMD Review: This game is a solid pickup. Gameplay: Solid. You can take two main approaches: weapon-based or trap-based, as well as various upgrades throughout the game that can improve the cost of your traps. The controls are solid and traversal of levels is easy. Graphics: Good, runs on most anything. Aesthetic: Interesting, lends itself to the game's unique humor. Music/Sound: The music isn't the greatest, and the Archer and Paladin lines get EXTREMELY irritating. Also, if you happen to minimize the game, it will loop the current sound playing.
1174	1	a	Didn't think Tower Defense/Action could be so entertaining and soothing! If you even remotely liked Plants Vs. Zombies, I would pick this up in a heartbeat!
1176	1	a	A FPS tower defense that's actually fun to play. Unlike some of it's predecessors... *cough* Sanctum *cough*.  The developers knew what their strengths were and focused on them. The result is a game that's enjoyable for what it is, without losing its way trying to be something it isn't.  While it's relatively short - it'll only take a couple days to 'beat' - there's plenty of replayability if you want to perfect your strategies or just enjoy shooting Orcs in the face.  Even though I'd never pay $60 for a game like this, it's hard to go wrong with an MSRP of $15.  Try the demo, you'll know right away if this game is for you.
1178	1	a	Old but gold!
1180	1	a	The best game of 2011! (ok, with Deus Ex: Human Revolution)
1182	1	a	On of my favorite games of all time; I keep revisting this like I do the Portal games. A classic. I hope they create a sequel.
1184	1	a	If you're in the mood to kill some orcs while doing some tower defense this is your game. Fun and entertaining
1186	1	a	Great game to pick up for 10-30 minutes at a time for weeks and weeks.
1188	1	a	In this fantastic third person tower defense, you get assaulted by Hordes of Orcs...  ...and you can push them, stab them, pierce them, slice them, burn them, cut them, stomp them, zapp them, shredder them, scorch them, throw acid at them, set them up the bomb and kill them in many many gory ways. 100% uncensored splatter fun :)
1190	1	a	It combines a variety of tower defence and action RPG elements incredibly well and leaves you with enough variety in the gameplay and challenge to want to do everything over again and again. Excellent.
1192	1	a	Garrosh Hellscream DOES NOT endorse this game.  Your favourite television host, Bert Newton on the otherhand, does.
1194	1	a	I don't even like the Tower Defense genre and even I have loads of fun with this. The game doesn't take itself seriously at all, so the plot (well, there -is- a plot) doesn't distract from the mayhem, and vice-versa. Aside from the usual Tower Defense elements, e.g. placing traps and such along the path your enemies will take, the game also features third-person shooter/melee/spellcasting action. You can even choose to specialize in either traps or your own combat ability. Doesn't have co-op sadly, but that's what the sequel is for.
1196	1	a	A sound tower defense game. A great play through on Warmage, if you are brave enough to do anything higher you have my respect!  The mods increase playablity and bring a few laughs to the game.  Well worth the cash!
1198	1	a	Excellent First Person Tower Defence Game. Highly polished, Lots of Levels and Plenty of Play Time. Thumbs Up!
1200	1	a	Simple, yet incredibly fun. You start with just a few tools for defence and unlock more as you move through the levels. Tools range from traps that slow down enemies to those that deal direct damage and spells/weapons that allow your character to hurt or affect enemies himself. Levels start small and grow in size considerably as you play, and many feature additional traps or guardians that aid you in defeating the coming swarms. The game's a must-play for anyone interesting in the tower defence styled genre.
1202	1	a	no options for windowed mode :( have to edit some crap outside of the game to make it windowed mode, but even then, its still in the works, cuz you can't move the window around...
1204	1	a	What a LAUGH!!!
1206	1	a	Thumb Up ! .. Fancy animations blended with pure action :)
1208	1	a	Surprisingly fun, short, but worth picking up for a few bucks. Will probably get the second.
1210	1	a	highly recommend this game while its on special D
1212	1	a	Variety is what keeps this third-person tower defense game going. With the myriad scenarios and cartoonishly gruesome methods of dispatching orcs at your fingertips, it's hard to put down. My only gripe with Orcs Must Die! is that there doesn't appear to be any sort of multiplayer mode or level editor, things that would vastly increase the game's replayability. However, despite being a single player game it's very entertaining. Even after you beat it the surprisingly deep combo/scoring system will keep you coming back for more as you try to inch your way up the leaderboards.
1214	1	a	It's a badass game but gets boring in time = 7/10
1216	1	a	I didn't think Tower Defense and FPS could work. I've tried a few before this one that didn't work as well. This one does a great job.
1218	1	a	Traps are cool. I wish there was more potential to string traps together in this game.  I also wish it was less frustrating. Why no checkpoints?! Still. Good game.
1220	1	a	Simple tower defense game. You are the last hope for mages who keep portals locked or something like that. But you are the extrmely stupid mage apprentice nobody ever expected to be a total BAWS. Run around placing traps on walls,floors,ceilings that blow orks into chunks as they try to get to your glowing orb thing. Very simple casual game that turns out to be pretty fun.
1222	1	a	The concept of a tower defense where the player can also kill directly some orcs is absolutly great. A perfect game to blow off some steam at the end of a long day. A coop mode (which come in orcs must die 2) would have been a plus.
1224	1	a	Fun game with lots of replay value
1226	1	a	a satisfying mix of tower defense and action. might drive you a little crazy if you go for 5 skulls in every level like i do lol.
1228	1	a	Fun as hell!
1230	1	a	Great game fun to play and easy to play a level at a time on lunch or break
1232	1	a	tower defense @ fun. get it when it´s on sale again, you won´t regret it!
1234	1	a	This is honestly great cheap fun. You only get $15 worth of game but it's a good $15 :D
1236	1	a	Highly recommended! If you enjoy tower defense or are a fan of Dungeon Defenders, this humorous game cranks up the difficulty accordingly as you go along and offers an abundance of towers and weapons to use. While the DLC is debatable (you definitely want the map pack, though), the grenade-like acid weapon in the weapons pack makes things a little easier and gives you a reason to use your mana. So, pick this up while it's still cheap!
1238	1	a	Kill them. They have to die.
1240	1	a	One of my favorite tower defense games. The only thing that bugged me is the fact that levels are too short. As soon as your traps are fully set up, the game is already over...
1242	1	a	This is pure, guilty-pleasure fun!
1244	1	a	9/10  I'm gonna go shoot some more orcs now.
1246	1	a	Buy this. My favorite tower defence game by a fair pace, it has great enemies and a idiculous difficulty level. just think and keep your eye on the minimap, its your best freind. Traps are varied and wonderously designed, the player character combat is well made and the upgrade system is interesting, and one of my favorite to date. In short - get this game, and then get the second one for Co-op tower defense :D  COMPLETIONISTS NOTE: luckily, the game is fairly formulaic so for the most part, just pay attention and think smart
1248	1	a	Best game ever xD, 10/10, absolutely recommended...   by the way.. Those quotes &lt;3
1250	1	a	Action and strategy on the same game, what more can you ask for? Also, the sounds the orcs make are hilarious :D
1252	1	a	I simply have to share a quick review/opinion on this game stating that despite its rather silly visage and initial portrayal, it is really one of the most fun-packed and relatively easy to pick up games that I've played in a while. A perfect game to fire up on an off-hour to let off some steam murdering pesky orcs in every single way you could ever imagine. It delivered everything it promised and more, with the possibility for what seems like some rather deep strategy and cooperative gameplay later in the game aswell. I still have to play more to form myself a perfect opinion on the game, but still felt that I had to give my highest regards to the creators of this games already, and to highly reccommend it to anyone looking for a bit of a fun fast-paced thought-requiring time sink.
1254	1	a	YE I LYKE DIS YOU GET 2 KILL ORCS LYK DUMBULDORE LOL
1256	1	a	It is an intensly fun game to play, with great humor, and strategy to boot. I like graphics and the mechanics of the game, as it drives the focus on simply killing orcs, yet you must build the skills required to set the appropriate traps on a given map; failure to do so means your DEFEAT, to only have to try it again. I give the game a 9.9 out of 10: I never thought I would have this much fun with a game such as this.
1258	1	a	It's fun, but personally I prefer Sanctum.  In orcs must die, there's no coop, which I find really saddening. The paths are also pretty much set, and my hand's going to die from carpal tunnel from the amount of clicking I have to do with my crossbow at times D: (no hold LMB to fire; you have to repeatedly click, and your crossbow fires like a submachine gun).  It's difficult at times, but overall I sort of dislike the lack of path freedom. Sure you can build barricades, but those don't hold up to well. In sanctum, you can actually build the path that the enemies are going to take.  However, it has alright graphics, and seems like it will have an adequate campaign length; I haven't finished yet.
1260	1	a	Awesome, really addictive, FPS/strategy/combat/tower defense game. You wield powers and use traps to kill orc invaders! You can choose whether you want to upgrade your traps or abilities. Not to mention the comedy is pretty entertaining. The fact that you can actively involve your character in killing the orcs rather than just sitting there waiting for a wave takes out some of the tedium of a typical TD game. Great idea!
1262	1	a	Rock this party!
1264	1	a	Awesome fun game where you can also use your creativity to kill the damn orcs!
1266	1	a	cool 
1268	1	a	Totally fun. If you like tower defense games and FPS games, welcome to nirvana. They do go great together.
1270	1	a	Really good game, can get into it really easily and great to spend time on througly reccomend it. CAn't wait till i have the money to by the seconded game!!
1272	1	a	Hilarious &amp; addictive!!!!
1274	1	a	I've only played a little bit of the game so far but it's totally worth the money. It's very addictive and fun
1276	1	a	Definitely recommended, particularly if on sale! Fun game that mixes third person shooting with the management aspect of Tower Defence games. Plenty of trap variety also mean a level of replayability and tactical options available to each level.
1278	1	a	Way too much fun.
1280	1	a	This is fantatic. Im a big fan of tower defence games, and ive played alot of them. This is up there with the best of them. Hours of fun. Its so good, ive bought it on Steam AND Xbox 360.
1282	1	a	Not a big fan of Tower Defence Games, but this was a surprise. Very Humourous and lots of fun to spend a few hours hacking and slashing Orcs. Who could ask for more.
1284	1	a	Wow, where to start? An awesome game with an undeniably hillarious sense of humor.  9/10  it would had 10/10 if it had cooperative multiplayer.
1286	1	a	This game is truly unique and very fun! If you are looking for a great new game look no further!
1288	1	a	Spent under $5 on this awhile ago and had more fun for longer then any recent $60 release..
1290	1	a	It's true with the title of this game.
1292	1	a	Nice Integration between TD, Action and killing ORCS!
1294	1	a	Most fun I got from an indie game yet! OMD is basically a revolutionized tower defense game. You play over the shoulder of an arrogant wizard apprentice who must defend rifts from orcs and other beasties. OMD Has some extreme replayability,. Your first run through the campaign will be to complete the story, then you will want to 5-skull everything, after which you then continue to combine traps like grinders, brimstone, archers, and more to rack up serious combo points. A great value of a game, and who doesn't like their orcs extra crispy?
1296	1	a	great if your into the tower defenses, this one is one player but your hero is quite the character
1298	1	a	Drenched with the blood of orcs a3rd person tower defense classic. Love it!
1300	1	a	A good game at it's heart but not enough excitement to get me to play regularly. The only reason to come back is to see what different traps do, and that's not nearly entertainment enough. The story is pretty much non-existent and the Battle-mage's Apprentice's humour is not nearly enough to keep it alive. But if you like mindless fun then this is something for you.
1302	1	a	Хороша Action/Tower Defense.(Good game !)
1304	1	a	This game is amazing, perfect mix of action and tower defense.
1306	1	a	Hehe, I like this game! :)
1308	1	a	A frantic-pace active tower defense game, a bit more on the side of Tecmo's Deception series than some other studios' offerings. Satisfying gameplay and polished visuals keep the replayability high.
1310	1	a	Incredibly fun and addicting for such a price!
1312	1	a	Who doesn't like mercilessly slaughtering hordes of Orcs? Seriously. Who. Just buy it. It's awesome.
1314	1	a	Clever, funny and down rite addictive.
1316	1	a	Have to say, it's a decent game overall but gets very boring really fast.
1318	1	a	Some great one liners. Spikes to mutilate bumholes. And some tough ♥♥♥♥ with a sword.
1320	1	a	Solid game, no noticeable bugs. The scull ranking system gives you something nice to aim for and improves replayability.
1322	1	a	A really fun, arcade-ish tower defense game. A lot of good combat and surprisingly strategic elements that the player must take into account, makes this game a really good game to look out for.  7.5/10
1324	1	a	This game is tons of fun to play and I haven't gotten bored while playing yet. I'm very much looking forward to playing the co-op mode as soon as I find someone else to play. I got this game during a sale but now that I have played it I wouldn't hesitate to pay full price for it.
1326	1	a	Manages to feel unique in the tower defense genre.
1328	1	a	This game provides endless fun. great replayability, killing orcs in various ways on different levels does not grow old.
1330	1	a	Featuring a new, and humorous, take on the Tower Defense genre, Orcs Must Die is a brilliant game.  Apart from allowing you to actually partake in the killing of Orc Waves, the game actually puts you in first-person so you can look at the 'towers' which will completely destroy any- and all orcs.  It's a good game, and it's a nice and mild brain-teaser for when you just want to have some fun.
1332	1	a	more meant for younger people, but definately a well made game that entertains.
1334	1	a	AWESOME GAME, recomend to everyone who loves to splash orc heads, with a large amount of traps and weapons.
1336	1	a	An awesome game, with lot of over-the-top visual effects, sarcastic remarks making it a perfect guilty pleasure. Also challenging on higher levels.
1338	1	a	Fantastic game. Frustrating at times, but only if you're a perfectionist. If you just want to beat the levels, then this game is nothing but orc killing goodness!
1340	1	a	A fun casual tower defense game.
1342	1	a	See: my Sanctum reccommendation, except without the multiplayer, and it's more fast-paced (planning phases never really take as long, largely because barricades aren't nearly as important in this game as they are in Sanctum).
1344	1	a	Pretty fun shot 'em up. Give it a go!
1346	1	a	Rating: 4/5 'A very fun twist to tower defense.'  Orcs Must Die is a comical game, and a unique hybrid of Tower Defense and Platform. You play as a Sorcerer's Apprentice, who inherits his Master's mission after his most unfortunate (and oddly hilarious) death. At your disposal is your late Master's spellbook, which provides you with the means to summon traps, guardians, and magical weapons which can all be used to single-handedly combat an army of Orcs...and luckily so, because that's exactly what your mission entails! Orcs Must Die features a simple control system, engaging gameplay, an overconfident, narcissistic main character, and orcs...lots and lots of orcs! An overall great game for almost anyone's video game repertoire!
1348	1	a	Do you like having fun? Yes? Then buy this game. If your answer was no, turn off your PC, go outside and roll around in poison ivy.
1350	1	a	i like orcs but these orcs are BANDITS thats why u need to kill them :) anyways very funny and nice cool traps/weapons :)
1352	1	a	The best tower-defense game that I have ever played! It's quirky, yet immensely enjoyable!
1354	1	a	I really enjoy this game. I'd describe it as a desktop tower defense game in which you are a player amongst the traps that you lay, directly engaging the Orc horde. The graphics are great, the maps are challenging, the traps and obstacles at your disposal are fun, and it includes a nice sprinkling of humor. A great single player game, especially when you need a break from your coop/MMO game of choice.
1356	1	a	Simply a fun to play Tower Defense game with some FPS/RPG elements tossed in. Easy to spend a couple hours slaughtering orcs.
1358	1	a	You play as the apprentice and try to defend the rifts from the invading swarms of orcs. You get to murder orcs and flying pokemonz with traps, npc assistance, or weapons! The game has a great sense of humor and multiple levels of difficulty.
1360	1	a	TPS Tower defense. Controlls are smooth as butter and the gameplay is great. For a 15$ indie well wroth the price.
1362	1	a	Well made game with days if not weeks of gameplay time. Addictive, challenging, looks nice, sounds good and has nice humour.
1364	1	a	It's really fun to play!
1366	1	a	Surprisingly fun, if you like tower defense and shooter-esque mechanics together. They may not REALLY be towers, but the traps are so satisfying.
1368	1	a	Its really fun If you play this with bruce lee or will smith, but If you play with some1 such as john travolta, then you can get by.
1370	1	a	Tower defense doesn't get much better than this and you can join the action too...
1372	1	a	Excellent game, very entertaining. Easy to understand and plays well. The variety of customization available allows you to choose what setup works best for you, and your war-mage is no slacker in the power department, so whatever the traps don't handle, you can annihilate with your own abilities.
1374	1	a	If this game took a solid ♥♥♥♥ on my door step i totally wouldn't mind because it is a pretty amazing game.
1376	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is a strategy - trap - killing orcs - thingy-majiggy type of game. It's kind of hard to explain. But you start off with a few traps, and you must defend the 'Rift' by killing orcs.If orcs start passing through the Rift, a 'Rift Point' is taken off. You're weapons at the start of the game are the Crossbow and Sword. As you progress through the game, you unlock a series of traps and weapons to enhance your ability to kill orcs. And there will be more enemies. And harder enemies. So basically, in a way, you're never 'stronger' than the orcs. It is a pretty hard game if you try to get the perfect score, so I recommend not aiming for the prefect score just yet. But killing orcs has never been so fun! So the final score is: 9/10 stars. Fun fact: If you have played Borderlands 2, he kinda sounds like Axton.
1378	1	a	Fun game. You place traps to fend off waves of enemies from gettting into the core. You actually have to strategize and think about what to upgrade first (Hard mode). Funny dialogue by the character(s), intense situations, and tons of traps, weapons, and spells to upgrade make this a must-buy game...desu.
1380	1	a	Defense games are lots of fun, and this one is no exception! The traps just excite you when they are placed properly and you just smile during the mass orc kills. This game gives you a good challenge tho later down the road tho.
1382	1	a	This game really surprised me - it's not just a good, original tower defense game, it's also hilarious. Best value for money I have had in a long time.
1384	1	a	Fun main character and lots of orcs dying. There is not much to this game, you lay traps, you kill orcs and you try doing that better than any of your friends did.
1386	1	a	I never had so much fun since Plants Vs Zombies. Can't wait til 2nd part come out of this TowerFreakinFunnyAsHellDefense
1388	1	a	Loads of fun, well worth the fiver I paid. Not sure it's worth the full 10 or 11, but wait for a sale and snap it up, good times...
1390	1	a	Well first of all: Only god knows why this game is rated for 16 years old teens and above in Germany...    Pros:  + Casual Instant-Action Fun + Lovely design of environment and player- and npc models + Great narrator + Orcsorcsorcsorcs + Good plurality of weapons/traps   Contra:  - You get new weapons/traps to the beginning of the next level, this is good, but in this level most of the new weapons/traps are useless - ... which is also for the whole game. There a few items you absolutely not need. - For Core-Gaming, this game can get really boring. The level-design seems repititive after a long session.
1392	1	a	Great game, its a good tower defense game.
1394	1	a	Best tower defense game ive ever play.
1396	1	a	A fun tower defense + Third person shooter/slasher game. As the levels progress you get new traps and spells to blow away the incoming orc waves. The 'hero's' witty humor is a plus, and the story itself is funny with a pretty cool ending.
1398	1	a	This game is a wonderful mix od tower defense and strategy. Using the abilities the war mage has and all of the traps and such makes it a funny and entertaining game that everyone should get. If on sale? Buy it. If not, buy it anyways!
1400	1	a	There aree dirty dirty orcs coming into your castle. Take a spin on tower defense by defending your tower with a custom job of sikes, traps, and magical weapons. Pretty much to the point with what it offers. Simple functions for a game that's more of a pallet clenser from larger games, or if you just want to blow some time with a casual game.  Get it if your a fan of tower defense.
1402	1	a	Killing millions of orcs by hand and by towers. This Tower defence and 3rd person shooter is a must have.
1404	1	a	Once CS:GO or DOTa ♥♥♥♥ you off, you want to play this GAME! :) extremely relaxing!
1406	1	a	I hate this game it's very orcsist.........10/5 :)
1408	1	a	Great game. If you were like me and played the 2nd one first, it's worth it to grab this because it's pretty much the same just with less content but you get to see more of the fun story and humor.  8/10
1410	1	a	orcs must die is amzing so what it is is about well you kill orcs 
1412	1	a	Orcs Must Die is a third person tower defence game. You play as the magicians apprentice and you must stop the Orcs from reaching the Rift, which is a portal to your universe. Each level the Orcs break through the doors (or fly through holes in the ceiling) and make their way to the Rift coming in waves. You lay traps in their path, from spiked floors to swinging blades the Orcs blunder through your traps becoming so much meat and with each death you get more money to place more traps. Of course should you get bored of watching them die you can enter the fray yourself firing either a rapid fire crossbow or engaging in melee. Once you complete the level you get skulls based on how well you did which you use to purchase and upgrade traps.  This game is pretty good, if a little repetitive and the difficulty really ramps up in the later levels, especially if you haven't got the right traps or upgraded them enough. It's very satisfying to see a horde of Orcs be decimated as they wander through your traps, all the while never firing a single shot yourself.  For £6.99 it's a great game, well worth the price. 
1414	1	a	Whether on sale or not, you cannot go wrong for the price. It's very rewarding to see your ever-growing fortress of well-laid traps do its job effectively.
1416	1	a	Catch it on sale, lots of entertainment cheap!
1418	1	a	Fun game. Feels more like a Third Person Shooter than a Tower Defence game. Well polished and with a nice difficulty curve.
1420	1	a	Hero-comedian, armed with spear, crossbow, spells, lots of traps and three chicks against hordes of (dumb/small/big/fast/explosive/funny) Orcs.  Excellent tower defense style game, except towers and aliens, we now have traps and Orcs.   And one dim-witted hero.
1422	1	a	A game for those who like to laugh as they kill cartoony characters :P
1424	1	a	Rly funny, great game to waste a couple of free hours after work/school
1426	1	a	Awesome Game its really fun to play with a controller
1428	1	a	Hi! this is a good game I've got a polish version and i from poland :)
1430	1	a	It's a fun game. If you want straight forward action with not much purpose to it, then this is the game for you. I find it a stress killer. You don't really play for long periods of time, but is cool to kill some orcs for about an hour and then get bored. Recommended, but not great
1432	1	a	Orcs Must Die gets a place right there next to my beloved Defense Grid and Sanctum! This isn't marketed as a Tower Defense game, but any fans of the genre will love this professionally developed defense game. This game evenly balances the importance of you being in the fray, and being thoughtful about your traps. You choose (and upgrade) your loadout before going into battle, and the options are so well varied that you can approach things with a variety of different options. The overall 'feel' of the game from combat mechanics to funny storyline are all exceptionally fun. Plus, like the great aforementioned games, this game leave plenty for you to improve upon and goals to pursue. Oh, and the difficulty curve is a great match to my tastes which is rare (gets genuinely difficult).
1434	1	a	Lacks polish (UI, audio) but still hella fun.
1436	1	a	I love recording this game for my YouTube channel! Check it at  https://www.youtube.com/user/privvygamersplace 
1438	1	a	I love towerdefence games, and Orcs must die just gives it a good story and the caracter is a funny guy XD
1440	1	a	I enjoyed this game a lot and still play it for every now and then. Game has quite unique tower defence -styled theme and it has good voice acting and sounds. There also is a good variety of tactics in the maps.
1442	1	a	Very nice and Fun.  10/10 would spaghetti again
1444	1	a	Tower Defense and action gameplay. What's not to like.
1446	1	a	Good game, its a nice first person 'tower/trap' defence game that involves a lot of player involvment. The involvment is what make this game so good. its nice to be able to set up a tower...and they run out and kill everyone with swords and bows and bombs!
1448	1	a	Hella Fun, You can pick up and play this anytime. Very difficult in the later levels, but i guess the challenge makes it fun.
1450	1	a	An interesting take on the tower defense game, incredible fun from your first spike trap to some of the more interesting stuff you will see in later levels. Buy this game!
1452	1	a	Oh you'll love this ... especially the opening scene .. and the amusing orc comments.
1454	1	a	Fun mix of tower defence and third person shooter, a bit like a Dungeon Defenders with less RPG and more cheesy action in single player, so if that sounds like fun to you then yeah, it's fun
1456	1	a	
1458	1	a	This is probably the most fun Ive had playing a tower defense type game.
1460	1	a	Strange but really funny game ! Killing Orcs by any way is quite ... enjoyable XD
1462	1	a	Very fun to play. Need I say more?
1464	1	a	such a great game! cant help but love the easy play style and the satisfying kill of a headshot
1466	1	a	80/100
1468	1	a	This FPS / tower defence game is real fun. There's a speed and energy to the traps and your participation in the level, plenty of emergent tactics, and an appropriate level of panic and improvisation in some levels. Occasionally you get completely minced by a level, which can be annoying if you have half a dozen stabs at it, and I did 90% of the levels relying on 40% of the equipment, but that's the only downside to this excellent game. Oh, and the music is fabulous. Gonna buy OMD2 on the strength of this.
1470	1	a	Do you own this? No? What's wrong with you? Get it!
1472	1	a	Great FPS tower defence style game. Simple game, but very addicting.
1474	1	a	Good cheap game. Simple to learn and a good game to spend 15 minute bursts on if you don't have too much time on your hands.
1476	1	a	That's simple, Orcs Must Die!!! The greatest defender game I ever played.
1478	1	a	A really challenging and rewarding game. It's looots of fun und until now my favourite TD-version.
1480	1	a	Good, stupid, simple, fun. If you like Tower Defenses, you'll like this. The colorful, vibrant, graphics are nice. The traps are varied. The impacts are satisfying. Well priced at $14.99.
1482	1	a	Interesting take on 'tower defense' type game. Fun, if short. 7/10
1484	1	a	Neat indie title that's highly enjoyable despite the clunkiness of the engine at times.  I would recommend this game over games like Sanctum any day.
1486	1	a	Funny Shooter/Tower Defense Mix, BUY IT !!!!
1488	1	a	Very satisfying and entertaining.
1490	1	a	Best game on Steam.
1492	1	a	Most fun I have had in a while. :D
1494	1	a	fun game where all u do is 1 thing. kill orcs with a bunch of traps and weapons. really fun.
1496	1	a	This game is rollicking good fun. For some reason, it reminds me of Plants vs. Zombies - the other game recently that's made me excited to play. It's got humour, levelling up, strategy, and running around screaming while you try and shoot orcs. Plus, it's an indie game. What's not to like?
1498	1	a	If you've played Dungeon Defenders, a single player DD is the perfect description for this game. It is a tower defense and 3rd person shooter. The down side(s)? (besides it being only 1 player) You can upgrade your traps and weapons... once each, they are unforgiving with the penalties when units get through, and death animations where you arent sure when the enemy dies, not to mention some traps knock down and enemies get back up a few seconds later. It is quite fun. This game is well worth 5 bucks. For me, its not long enough to justify more than that.
1500	1	a	Do you like fantasy? How about comedy? Yes? Then play this
1502	1	a	I really enjoyed this game, one of the few single player games I've took the time to beat in years. Definitely worth picking up.
1504	1	a	OMG ! this game is soooo freakin fun. replay on nightmare is even better! my highest recommendation
1506	1	a	Nice game that requires a lot of strategic thinking, i'd say it's better than the sequel.
1508	1	a	This game is absolutely ridiculous fun. Seriously, it's basically a tower defense game with a bit of RPGing as well as some third-person hack and slash. Plus a game that is actually funny. Get this. When it's on sale? Get this without a doubt or hesitation.
1510	1	a	The main character in this game always has witty remarks and reminds a little of Charlie Sheen. Music is very catchy and appropriate for a game about killing Orcs - organ music meets electric guitars. It can offer a couple of days of fun, but unfortunately doesn't have much replay value.
1512	1	a	An excellent design around the tower defense strategy genre. Great graphics and hectic gameplay, there are loads of innovative ways of dealing a great deal of pain to these orcish gits. I mean, they really must DIE!
1514	1	a	Amazing tower defense but way too short. I need more orc killing :(
1516	1	a	Cost of spring loaded trap? 500 coins. Hearing an Orc mention he was going to retire the next day right before he is catapulted into a pit of lava? Priceless.  Best $15 I ever spent on Steam. Do yourself a favor and buy it if you haven't already. Funny dialogue, interesting levels that let you get creative, and a great soundtrack with a fun art style have kept me replaying levels just for the lulz.
1518	1	a	Do the Orcs really have to die?
1520	1	a	Slaying Orcs has never been more fun!  I still recommend this title, even when you already own the successor. The level-design is more straight forward and always adds an element of variety to the previous level. Every new item you unlock offers a very balanced and strategical approach to beat a level even until late in the game. It also offers a great replayability of levels in which you didn't have the item on the first run.   The game is singleplayer only, but as it was designed to be so, it is far superior in the singleplayer-experience than its (still great) successor.
1522	1	a	Gruesome, funny, good replay value, I recommend this game to anyone who likes tower defense/action games.
1524	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is an excellent blend of tower defense and third person shooter. You're cast into the role of a 'War Mage', caught amidst turmoil from a beastly invasion. Poised with the duty to defend humanity, you must now prevent the orcs from entering the rifts that bind your world to theirs.  OMD is a joyous, albeit mostly mindless affair. It offers the delightful satisfaction of mowing down hordes of enemies and making you feel like an empowered hero (as most games should). There's room for strategizing, but not so much as to make the experience trying.  With over two dozen traps, variety is in no short supply. Players are encouraged to adapt to each map and pick traps that will maximize your deadliness. However, I found myself defaulting to the same half dozen traps each round, indicating that balance might be a slight issue.  Nonetheless, OMD is overwhelmingly enjoyable. For $15, it's a great buy, offering hours of fun. For under $5, it's a must have!  Grade: B+
1526	1	a	Solid tower defence with the addictive upgrade system that lets you want to go back for better scores and more skulls. Love this one! want to play with a buddy? Buy the second one.
1528	1	a	Shockingly, this game is just so much fun. All games with exclamation points are fun. It's a rule.
1530	1	a	Really fun tower defense / action game. You'll spend most of your time actually fighting the Orc's but there is strategy to what you need to do and completeling stages. Gets addictive and the new weapons you unlock after each completion drive you to keep playing.
1532	1	a	Not quite defence grid but plenty of fun to be had, better than Sanctum and Dungeon Defenders.
1534	1	a	The idea is that you kill orcs. How you do that is up to you, and therein is where the fun in this game is found. It has both shooter aspects (you move around shooting a crossbow and possibly other weapons) and Tower Defense elements (you need to design good trap combos to win). Simple enough, but well executed, high quality, and fairly fun.  The only shortcoming is that on some levels there is only one 'correct' build to easily win, and finding that can be a pain sometimes. And, unlike it's successor it does not have Co-Op.
1536	1	a	Fun twist on tower defense. Gameplay is very polished.
1538	1	a	It looks a little silly, and it plays a little silly, but the game is actually pretty fun. If you've played Sanctum, it's roughly the same idea, but they don't force you to be really good at playing shooters just to get past level 3. There can be a lot of satisfaction in chewing through hordes and hordes of orcs with nothing more than a few well placed traps and a twitchy trigger finger.
1540	1	a	10 / 10 would pound.
1542	1	a	Like cocky heroes who's vast array of weapons include their razor sharp wit and one-liners? Like building death traps in the bowels of dungeons? Like having a horde of orcs charge you only to fall dead at your feet? Then definitely check out Orcs Must Die! It's a fast and furious action game that also has you thinking strategy as you set your traps and slay oncoming swarms of orcs after your slice of the pie!
1544	1	a	Simple. Entertaining. Just stupid fun.  That about sums it up. It's on the action side of the Action Tower Defense genre, so grab a 360 controller and kill 10,000 orcs over the course of 6-8 hours.
1546	1	a	The best solely orc-killing game around.
1548	1	a	The best and most fun Tower Defense game ever played :D Loads of uber traps to kill the orcs with. And if that aint enough you can go hack and slash some orcs yourself xD  Must have for any TD Gamer!
1550	1	a	I played OMD2 first, and going back to the original just to see how it played, I am shocked that its single player is actually quite a bit better. The lack of multiplayer, however, is likely why, after my first playthrough, I'll never return to it. Got this in a humble bundle, though, and it was fun for the few hours I did indulge.
1552	1	a	One of the most addictive and energetic games I have played lately is Orcs Must Die. At first I was somewhat alarmed by the fact of non-stop killing with the help of various mechanisms, but when I started to play it I was totally absorbed in the process. It can be classified as Tower Defense game, but among other rivals in this type of computer games it is IMHO one of the best.    The aim of Orcs Must Die is very simple – not to let hordes of orcs, trolls and the like into our world. You are given a tower with one or several portals to be defended from numerous waves of monsters. Upgrading from level to level you are also provided with new different devices, skills, mechanisms, as well as earning money to money to buy ambushes and modernize them. The two most brilliant features of the game are in my opinion the highest level of action tension (what I feared most while playing is that somebody of my household would call me for something) and the elements of tactics and strategy.  read more  http://www.viewforum.net/gaming-dept-171/orcs-must-die-2767/ 
1554	1	a	much fun lovely game 
1556	1	a	Very fun game, if you like tower defense games you probably will like this.
1558	1	a	Interesting tower defense game
1560	1	a	Awesome strategy game with an easy concept but very high custimization would strongly reccomend buying this but maybe wait for a sale I don't believe it is quite worth the $15
1562	1	a	Very fun and adicting! i recomend it.
1564	1	a	The sleeper hit of 2011. As we all know (and the title suggests), Orcs must die. And to do so, they run into traps. Get zapped. Catapulted. Perforated. Burned. Stomped. Slashed. Shot. Cut. Frozen. It's just one of the most fun games there are out there.
1566	1	a	The best 'Castle Defence' game of the year - maybe ever!
1568	1	a	Very pleasing tower defence game. Many hours of playing, lots of satisfaction and orcs blood :)
1570	1	a	good for a single play through the campaign.
1572	1	a	Yet another recommended tower defence game although this one feels a lot more combat orientated. Surprisingly challenging if you go for 5 skulls, more so on Nightmare mode. Only one minor permanent upgrade per tower type while skills are put up through one of three skill trees which reset every level so you can play around with builds to avoid repetitiveness. The cheesy humour and over the top characters fit the game well.
1574	1	a	A light hearted mix of Tower Defense and 3rd person shooting/hack n' slash.
1576	1	a	A pretty cool game, lots of fun! Unfortunately no multiplayer
1578	1	a	Extremley fun and addictive would definately reccomend this game to a friend
1580	1	a	This ♥♥♥♥ hella fun. #OgresGettingTurnt #IWreckedThemLikeAWreckingBall #MyArchersLikeToTwerk
1582	1	a	Worth every dollar, it can get really frustrating but it's just so much fun in the end 9/10.
1584	1	a	A different type of tower defence, where you play a funny idiot. Funfunfun.
1586	1	a	Awesome game, fun and easy to play !
1588	1	a	While steam says i currently have 0.2 hours recorded playing this, I own it on xbox 360 as well and Ive completed the game.  Honestly this is one of my fav games of all time. Absolutely love it so I dedcided to be the first to share my thoughs and opinions.  Now on to the review :)   Its a hybrid third person action game with tower defense. this means all your descisions and actions play out all in real time so when your defending against those nasty orcs, timing and well thought out traps are crucial. Yor goal is to keep the orcs from reaching a certain point on the map called, the Rift.The Rift was built in a forsakened fortress to keep everyone safe but now the orcs want to get to it and destroy you if you get in their way. Your teacher fell in battle so now it's up to you, The apprentice to defend the rift! The story is not really what this game is about but you are greeted whith the occasional cut scene. The game starts off with only a few waves and the basic set of orcs which are fairly easy to kill, as long as you don't sit there and let them attack you....but who would do that right? Each level in the game has a set number waves, each increasingly more difficult. The good thing is you always know what you're up against and just how many Orcs your going to slaughter in that particular level. The Orcs also range from ground units to archers to flyers and big tanks that take alot of damage. Also, each orc has a weakness so exploiting it in your traps and strategy will help alot. While the onslaught of orcs never stops, you have plenty of weapons and traps at your disposal, which brings me to my next topic, The traps! Each trap has a set fuction and there are a number of them which can only be placed on walls, floors, ceilings etc.  They range from your simple barricades to huge swinging ceiling axes, to decoys and meat grinders, to archers and guardians. You also have weapons to choose from to kill the orcs yourself, thats what i love about the game. Youre not just looking down and watching the fight, youre in it. So it is up to you to work with your traps and stop the orcs from reaching the Rift. Although, in later levels you must defend more than one rift at a time which means the game can get pretty tough. The rift will heal you when your close enough so if your ever in a pinch, you can go back and refill your hp which is nice. The game also scores you on your accuracy and headshots and the amount of kills in a row. Depending on how well you do, your awarded with up to 5 skulls, these are your currency. However, you cannot move on to the next level(s) unless you have earned enough skulls in previuous levels. So doing well, is essential. Yes the game can get challenging fast and you can lower the dificulty, but that reduces the amout of skulls to be earned, so its sort of a trade off. With the skulls you can purchase new upgrades and traps as well as bonuses that effect you and your traps, later on in the game. Now again i will say have not played this on pc yet but on xbox, there were no problems as far as framrate and lag. So I would check the system specs before you go ahead and make the purchase, as with all games. The visuals are quite nice and really stand out compared to most other tower defenses. The art style is a little silly and cartoony but dont let that fool you. When your killing orcs or watching your traps bruttally tear them apart..the gore and sense of pain does make the game feel less childish. Controls felt great on my xbox game pad although I would imagine mouse and keyboard is slightly better, accuracy and speed do play a big role here. Now i will say the game may have some flaws but I personally think Its close to perfect. And Im sure OMD2 fixes any issues this one may have.   Theres more to the game than I've mentioned but I wont spoil it all. Lets just say if you like tower defense games and third person shooters/action, you should deffinitely give this a go. Robot Entertainment's Orcs Must Die! gets a 5 out 5   edit: I mainly bought this to replay levels in OMD2, and yes i will be reviewing the sequal when I finish it!
1590	1	a	A good, fast paced tower defence game that has a lot of replayability. Sadly it's only singleplayer.
1592	1	a	Truly glorious , puzzles, lateral thinking, gore, math, everything a dorf could want.
1594	1	a	Fast, furious, exciting and hilarious! This is a work of frivolous genius. I highly recommend this game to lovers of fantasy, action and strategy. Good times, good times!
1596	1	a	I never play for a long period of time but I keep coming back.
1598	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is awesomely merciless and has delicious gore. You should try this game, you will enjoy it. (Even IF it's hard!)
1600	1	a	Fun, cartoony and addictive gameplay. Maps are reasonably sized, and portals add to the strategy. Only real peeve is that some traps never feel useful (looking at you ceiling shock zapper).   Levels can be completed within 5 - 15 minutes, so this is a fun game to pick up and play if you have a small amount of time to kill. Highly recommend for fans of tower defense genre.
1602	1	a	I wasn't sure what to expect going into this one, but I am certainly not disappointed. Tower defense (ok, path defense...whatever you'd like to call it), mixed with 3rd person 'shooter' with humor and plentiful dead orcs? Yes, please. As with any game, I'm sure there are some out there who would not enjoy this one, but so far I have been impressed.
1604	1	a	Fantastic game! The level designs were solid and they always gave you the tools to get the job done. The game isn't as replayable as the second one, but it offers a much better experience.
1606	1	a	Awesomeness Squared!
1608	1	a	All I can say is if you don't buy it you'll regret it. It's fun. xD
1610	1	a	Addictive and funny hybrid of tower defense and first person shooter :) love it
1612	1	a	Not normally a fan of tower defense games, I went into this one expecting the usual bore, what I got instead was an adrinaline filled, well paced action onslaught that knows just how to balance difficulty with fun. The only thing this game was lacking was some sort of co-op mode.
1614	1	a	I recommend this game!
1616	1	a	Good game , try the demo, wish it had MP
1618	1	a	One of the most fun games i've played. third person tower defense game like no other. You need to but this period.
1620	1	a	One of my absolute favorite indie games. If you see this on sale, you have no excuse not to pick it up. Its tons of fun and has great re-playability.
1622	1	a	Shooter/Tower defence hybrid. One of the better tower defence ganes I've played, and I've played a lot... Great fun and very addicting.
1624	1	a	A great Tower Defense game. Try it :D
1626	1	a	A little gore joy for Nerd's eyes!
1628	1	a	Really nice game, lots of fun and the soundtrack is awesome.
1630	1	a	It's addictive, simple to learn and very very fun to play.   Gameplay is smooth and looks great, watching the traps shred, roast, smash  and otherwise destroy orcs is a blast   I started playing this game today and have over 8 hours logged as of my writting this.
1632	1	a	OMD! is incredibly addicting and it gives you an insatiable pleasure of killing and smashing brainless orc heads in. It combines really interesting techniques and levels to ultimately deliver a challenging but enjoyable experience.
1634	1	a	Good to get in a bundle of some kind... although it doesn't have much of a lasting appeal.  Still, it's a fun game for a single walkthrough, and maybe some achievement hunting afterwards.  So, it's only partially recommended.
1636	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is a fun, fantasy FPS mixed with tower defense. The storyline and humor are very enjoyable. The combination of action and strategy is a fresh take of this kind of gameplay. I recommend picking the package deals with all of the additional downloadable content included. The sequel is great, too, but I start here.
1638	1	a	Not just a tower defense game. An extremely well-done tower defense game with fun writing and solid mechanics. If you like tower defense games, it's a must buy. If you don't, you should still check it out.
1640	1	a	A must have game! Definetely worth the money :)
1642	1	a	So orc. Such die. Much quality. Very Traps. Wow
1644	1	a	I enjoy this, it keeps your mind set and the Orcs are always coming out. There's something about it that has kept me hooked.
1646	1	a	Funny, intense, hard; this game is a must-have!
1648	1	a	This is a hilarious and addicting 3rd person tower defense game. You place traps between the door where orcs must spawn and the portal to which they must run to. If you kill enough orcs you win. Imagine playing defense grid but now you can control a character that not only builds traps but can also attack enemies as well. I highly recommend this. 8/10
1650	1	a	This game is seriously WAY too much fun to play!! Tower defense combined with having your own abilities to kill them as well... Definitely glad I got my hands on it!
1652	1	a	its fun when your bored
1654	1	a	So much fun, 3rd person shooter mixed with 'Plants Vs Zombies' is the only way I can think to describe this. Lay traps, watch them splat things and shoot a lot of Orcs in the head, GENIUS ! Definitely worth a few quid of anyone's money.
1656	1	a	Frikkn awesome 3rd person / Dungeon defender / with TRAPS (and a dude who sounds like he's from Evil Dead)
1658	1	a	Fantastic third person action game combined with Tower Defense. Funny story, good attitude and with a lot of replayability.
1660	1	a	This is some of the most fun I've ever had playing a game.
1662	1	a	Hillarious and great fun, but too repetative to play for long periods of time. Best a dip in and out game.
1664	1	a	Makes you feel smart and skilled. As the main character would put it, it gives you smartness and badassness.
1666	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is a tower defence game that uses a third person action oriented perspective instead of the traditional top down view of similar games.  Its a very fun and entertaining game that will last you around 11 hours depending on your playstyle. A constant progression of new weapons, traps and enemies drives you through the adventure, and ensure the same strategy won't work for every level.   Not only do you lay traps as in a typical tower defence game, your character can also move around and contribute to the kills to complement the traps you have set. The graphics are bright and colourful and animations are very fluid. Music and sound are crisp and clear and the game is a joy to play.  Downsides, this game is single-player only. Having a friend in multiplayer mode to help cover some of multiple enemy entrances would have made it an even more enjoyable experience.  Overall Rating: 8.0 / 10 Entertaining and fun game in a new twist on the tower defence genre. Don't miss it.
1668	1	a	Excellent tower defense game - simple and responsive controls, crisp graphics, fun storyline. A good mix of strategy and skill. The 'level grade' system and Nightmare difficulty add extra layers of replayability to the game, forcing you to adapt your strategies and use a wide range of skill and trap builds for different encounters, while simultaneously demanding better playskill from you in the form of aiming (ie. headshots can cause significantly more damage) and laying traps under pressure.
1670	1	a	There are orcs, and they must die. They absolutely must. The title is a bit misleading because there are also goblins and ogres and a bunch of other stuff which also must die.
1672	1	a	What looks like a simple spin on the tower defense genre, ends up being a indepth, fun and amusing game that just has me hooked, the only downsides are how difficult it can get in later levels and that there is no co-op, which could have been soo much fun, hopefully the developers will add it in a patch sometime ;D
1674	1	a	Nice and simple entertain. Best buy with discount.
1676	1	a	Unique tower defense game. I hate tower defense games, but this is dope.
1678	1	a	Awesome! Very Addicted ! !
1680	1	a	Fun pick-up if on sale. Single player was a blast.
1682	1	a	A third person, action, strategy game that was loads of fun. I give it a 9.8/10
1684	1	a	The most charming protagonist ever. And the game is extremely fun.
1686	1	a	This is probably the most value for money game you can buy! Sooooo much fun!
1688	1	a	Tower defense with a serious action/hacknslash twist. Rather funny and addicting.
1690	1	a	Amazing game. Looks good, plays good and is pretty funny.
1692	1	a	Ever played Trapt (PS2, 2005/6)? It's kinda like that except without as much charm, difficulty, atmosphere, synergy or interesting narrative. This game is another one of those innovative third-person shooter meets tower defence games that definitely have not been cropping up by the dozen lately, but don't let that out of the box thinking put you off of this title. As harsh as my opening line might have been, this isn't really a bad game. (Certain) Traps are interesting, the tone of the game is quite tongue-in-cheek and it's very easy to lose a lot of time while playing. Strangely this game puts more emphasis on the actual fighting yourself rather than tower defence mechanisms. Traps are expensive and nearly always fire off too early, catching only the first thing in range and letting the horde behind which through. Still, a fun little arcade title. Worth it in a sale.
1694	1	a	An alternative perspective on the Tower Defense genre. The objective is to prevent several waves of Orc's and other creatures from reaching your portal. You have an array of Traps you can deploy to help slow &amp; kill the approaching enemies. Any that slip through can be taken out with your choice of Hand held Weapon or Spell. It's so much fun, once I started playing this I couldn't put it down till I completed it.
1696	1	a	Lives up to its' title. Fast, furious, fun.
1698	1	a	Fun tower defense game with smooth gameplay and an entertaining protaganist. Good time killer.
1700	1	a	I mean, they don't have to, but its probably for the best if they do. ORC JOB PROSPECTS IN THIS ECONOMY = ♥♥♥♥!
1702	1	a	A fun little hybrid of tower defense and FPS. It starts off fairly easy and escalates after a while. Quite fun.
1704	1	a	Who doesn't like killing hordes of orcs with traps and spells in frantic gameplay. This is an awesome game
1706	1	a	This is a great action/towerdefense game. If you like strategy you should definitely pick this one up. I got it a few days ago and I've already played it for 22 hours.
1708	1	a	Great FPS Tower Defense Crossover game. Good humour (Think Jack Black 'cocky' character) and replay with various game modes and challenges, the DLC does make this game a bit easier from the get go providing more weapon options such as the Acid bombs from teh beginning. Keeps brain and fingers working which is always fun and rewarding.
1710	1	a	If you enjoy killing Orcs (who doesn't?), then this is the game for you.
1712	1	a	Fun combination of third person shooter and tower defence.
1714	1	a	Very fun casual tower defense FPS. Highly recomended for needed single player diversion, expecially if you get it during a Steam Special. Not multiplayer but there is a braging rights Leader Board with your Steam Friends.
1716	1	a	My new addiction. The goofy traps are satisfying to watch every single time they go off. The game design lets you play it in many different styles, whether it be shooter emphasis or traps, or firing off magic spells.
1718	1	a	One of the finest and funniest trap-centric strategy games out there. Definitely worth the money.
1720	1	a	I got this game on a lark, but it's really well made and fun!
1722	1	a	I did't think OMD! was gonna be that great, then i just couldn't stop playing. I wouldn't say it's brilliant or anything, but it is lots of fun. I love tower defense, and considering how legitimately difficult this game (at least in terms of getting perfect scores) and how fun it is at the same time I gotta say it's one of the best tower defense games I've ever played. I'm not even sure it's really 'tower' defense...maybe trap defense? Who knows. Either way, you'll be killing orcs like a fiend.
1724	1	a	Rampant, Roaring, neverending Orc stomping fun! Buy it and stuff!
1726	1	a	Orcs Must Die!! yes, in this game orcs must die. This is a great game, it looks like your traditional 3D Tower Defense game, but instead of watching the AI battle it out you get to join the fight in third person view and personally kill some orcs.
1728	1	a	This game is a fun solo action tower-defense game, similar to Dungeon Defenders without the MMORPG elements. Build and upgrade death traps as you fight off waves of orcs.
1730	1	a	So good.... I 100% 'cheved it &gt;&lt;. Also pre-ordering 2 :P
1732	1	a	With its great selection of traps and weapons, Orcs certainly do die.   It has a high replayability value with its different ways to complete a level and the ability to replay levels with traps you earned from other levels keep the game fresh and interesting.  Its juvenile humour is great if your into it at the end of every act/level.  The level design lacks imagination and seems to have the same layout.  Its lack of multiplayer is disappointing as it would have been a GREAT feature to have to play with friends.  To compare it to another tower defence game, Dungeon Defenders, it lacks multiplayer and the variety of weapons but makes up for it in its clever traps and weapons. 
1734	1	a	It took me a little bit to really get into this game. I would play for half an hour, and have fun, but be done and not feel like playing again for a week or more. However, once i got about 2/3 the way through the levels and opened up a wider variety of the traps I couldn't stop playing. I enjoyed it so much so that the 2nd game was a day 1 purchase for me, which doesn't happen often. The variety of ways that you can approach a level make replaying a lot of fun. The talent trees opened up later offer completely different playstyles that all work if done right. You have to be willing to invest 4-5 hours to get to the meat of the game, but if you do this game is a ton of fun and really well done.
1736	1	a	This game is an awesome single-player experience. It's polished and doesn't railroad you on solving levels. The sequel is coming out soon and will have 2 player co-op!
1738	1	a	Orcs Must Die is an awesome trap defense game, there are tons of levels and even a nightmare mode for challenges.
1740	1	a	Almost as fun as Dungeon Defender! The second one comes out soon. Single player for this one the second one will be co-op!
1742	1	a	Very fun Defense game that is a callback to games such as Tecmo's Deception. Easy to get addicted to and even easier to control. Fits the definition of simple to learn but hard to master.
1744	1	a	This game is a flowering firetruck of fudging awesomesauceness! It is must get if you love tower defence but what a little bit more. Lots of traps, lots of orcs, lots of killing!
1746	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is a deceptively simply and utterly engrossing tower-defense/third-person shooter/brawler. The strategy and on-the-fly thinking is superb; the sense of humor is fantastic; and the overall feel and atmosphere is very well done. Just buy the game and kill some orcs!
1748	1	a	Great game! You can set traps, summon guardians, use spells. A damn fine mixture of 3rd Person Shooter + Defence game. A little bit of humor, and a funky victory dance. Recommended! :D  My score: 10/10 (Must buy!)
1750	1	a	Oh WOW! THIS game is fairly easy to play and SOO much fun !! SUPER Recommended for ALL Gamer Types.
1752	1	a	Orcs Must Die takes the tower defense formula and tweaks it just enough to be something a little different; there's greater emphasis on both traps and your own combat abilities rather than just towers, allowing you to become more involved in the action. Combating the invading orcs and either watching them run through your stabbing, slicing, or smashing traps or dicing them up with your bladestaff and puncturing them with your crossbow bolts rewards you with some entertaining gibs, and the quips from both your character and the green brutes is good for a few chuckles. If you're looking to kill a short time with one or two rounds or fill out a boring afternoon with several more, Orcs Must Die is definitely an entertaining diversion worth looking into.
1754	1	a	Yes, another core defense game. But spiced up with fast-paced oldschool arcade action, witty humor, and visuals reminiscent of the days of Dragon's Lair. Lots of fun, and challenging too.
1756	1	a	Truly a jewel!
1758	1	a	Great Game! Your mouse hand will ache after each level as unlike some games you actually have to make an effort to win..Contstant adrenaline rush to stop the orcs from reaching the rift..Just sheer brilliance! &lt;3
1760	1	a	Very fun! A tower defense game I actually don't suck at. I give it 13 1/2 out of 13 1/2 stars!
1762	1	a	Instant classic! All the fun of a Tower Defense game with just enough shooter to liven things up. Highly addictive.
1764	1	a	Tower Defense - Check Shooting Stuff/Third Person Action - Check  If you like either of those, then you should like this game. Even if you dislike strategy games I feel like you'll like OMD! It's more of a 'blood pounding, hope my arrow traps reset in time, must race with orcs to stop them from getting to the rift' than a monotonous 'set trap here to kill this orc.'   I'd recommend it to anyone who likes killing stuff, shooting stuff, and just generally wreaking havoc with a swinging ball mace repeatedly killing orcs stuck in the tar pit below it.
1766	1	a	i want to kill more orcs. super fun way to make a Strategy
1768	1	a	Neat twist to the standard Tower Defense genre. Check out the demo if you like tower defense (but buy it on sale :P )
1770	1	a	HIGHLY recommend if you like 'tower defense' style games. 3rd person action/adventure tower defense. Sounds weird, but ends up awesome.
1772	1	a	One of those games for wich you can easily find a justification to put on your quarrel hat and go out to people to argue that this is the essence of gaming. An amalgam of various ingredients formin' a peculiar blend catering to many - if not everyone - and yet, still challengin'. The game quickly makes you go 'Whoah, it's gettin' late... Oh, one more level...' And then you play three more, untill you finally lose. Easily enjoyable entertainment.  The only bad thing I can say about the game is it's length. It's not that bad, but it just leaves you cravin' for more. At least a survival mode would be nice.
1774	1	a	As Bret Michaels would say, 'Killing orcs. Is. Awesome.'
1776	1	a	An interesting 3rd person Tower Defense, likeable if you enjoy frat humour and an inconsistent difficulty curve. In its defense your towers seem formidable and there are a few interesting twists. Not a top pick but enjoyable for thoose who like the genre.
1778	1	a	This game is pure arcade fun. A must buy! The only thing missing is multiplayer
1780	1	a	Amazing game about killing orcs and good level based. But its sometimes will be freaking hard. Now I'am in last 2 levels and i can pass levels after 2 or 3 triying.
1782	1	a	Tower defense in 3D, this is an original quirky game which combines the by now well known elements of tower defense with that of a 3d action game. The developpers then sprinkled in some extra humor and then ended up with 'Orcs Must Die!'.   If you are interested in either of these two genres I can recommend this game to you.
1784	1	a	Really really fun! Set traps for orcs and slaughter them by the hundreds/thousands. It's often compared to tower defense but it's much more action packed as you control a guy down in the midst of the battle.
1786	1	a	Realy cool game. All orc must die) I think today orc in red book ! lol
1788	1	a	★★★☆☆
1790	1	a	A less serious, third person Sanctum. Fun.
1792	1	a	Tower defence gone horribly right, there's something both compelling and charming about this game.  Also the whole killing orcs brutally thing.
1794	1	a	The Tower Defense Game for those who don't want to just watch!!! Intense gameplay, a hilarious setting, and hordes of orcs that MUST DIE!!!
1796	1	a	One of the better TD games I've played, mixes up the formula a bit with various traps instead of towers. Worth your time, if you aren't tired to death of TD games.
1798	1	a	Tower defense meets 3rd person Hack &amp; Slay. Very fun game with more than 10 hours of gameplay. Highly recommended.
1800	1	a	Unreal amounts of fun, so epic.
1802	1	a	Fun game, let all the Orcs die!
1804	1	a	This game is quite fun. Far more active than most 'tower defense' games. Do not pass it up, especially if you find a good sale.
1806	1	a	Hack em, slash em, shoot em, zap em, drown em in acid. Orcs must die. Awesome game.
1808	1	a	I have to say that when i first heard of this title i thought it didnt sound much fun. but i have to say there is a great deal of joy when you just basically curbstomp some orcs with magic. its VERY polished and pleasing to look at. the sound effects and music are as if midevil musicians decided to play some form of hiphop. its definitly a game that is hard to put down. basically it just feels rewarding and the things you use to kill them vary widely, and they all have a nice look to them that fits well in its suroundings.   though i am cheap i say wait for a sale. but if you really REALLY like tower defense games and a bit more polished version and a little bit more thrilling version of dungeon defenders, this is a title for you.   as much as i would like there to be a multiplayer, it shows that they spent their time focusing on the game in place of a split focus of how to make multiplayer work and how to make the game look nice and better yet FEEL nice. it just has a great feel!
1810	1	a	I love the Orcs Must Die! series, if you like the idea of a tower defence game mixed with an action game then get it now.
1812	1	a	Get it. Seriously. Although I like tower defense, I was on the fence about games that put you at the front of the action. This one does more than convince me of this take on the genre - it keeps me coming back for more, time and again. It's a simple game on the surface, offering an incredible amount of depth and replayability. The story, though rather stark, is carried by a hilarious, well-acted lead (think a somewhat less intelligent Ash meets a less annoying and offensive Duke) and I genuinely wanted to know more about the world. This is certainly a franchise I hope Robot Entertainment expands on in the future. Go get it now and duke it out with me on the leaderboards!
1814	1	a	Do you like Dungeon Tower Defender Game? Well look no far the the Orcs Slayer, Trap Killing , Spell Casting game known as Orcs MUST DIE!
1816	1	a	Very racist against orcs, would not recommend. 10/10
1818	1	a	Out of the.. 4 some odd dozen tower defense games to be out right now, buy this one if you want a supremely well made single player experience that rewards you for both being good at shooting, and using that pink wrinkled mound between your eyescopes!  I love the protagonist, I love the orcs, I love the traps, and you feel genuine satisfied for killing them, and killing them well.
1820	1	a	Orcs Must Die takes the classic Tower Defense formula and flips it on its head by allowing you to take control of a protagonist, the War Mage, and let's you take control of combat. There are ~25 traps, spells and weapons at your disposal to take out the Orcs any way you can. The most fun part is mixing and matching between the different combinations of traps, spells, weapons and skill trees to find the best way to tackle each map. Highly recommended!
1822	1	a	actually an amazingly fun game, and worth 5 bucks, steam xmas sale.. got it for 3.80
1824	1	a	This game is very good. It's a mix of tower defence and 3rd person shooter. The swinging traps are sooo good.
1826	1	a	This little gem dosen't shine for long, but it is enjoyable while it does!  A quirky little venture into Tower D, and it succeeds pretty well. While the content is limited, this risk was well appraised by the community, and so the sequel to this should be quite grand. (Especially with co-op)  If ya got a few bucks just sitting there and want to kill a few hours and orcs, this is a purchase you won't regret.
1828	1	a	Fun, frantic, and silly, it's a well-made game that doesn't take itself too seriously.
1830	1	a	I've spent more hours in Orcs Must Die than some other 'A+' titles, and that's because it's just a lot of good old fashioned Orc killing fun. Solid game mechanics with a solid game engine makes this game more polished than most. Can't wait for the inevitable follow up with the addition of Multiplayer ;) Though the leaderboards on this title make you feel like you are playing with your friends too.
1832	1	a	Very fun, well designed and a good level of polish. Took me a couple levels to warm up to it but as you start unlocking more trap types it picks up. If you're into leaderboards it could definitely eat up a lot of your time.
1834	1	a	Take tower defense. Add in Dynasty Warriors brawling. A huge helping of quirkyness. You get the next best thing since Plants versus Zombies.
1836	1	a	Suprisingly good in many ways! The style, graphics, humour and gameplay all blend together really well. Killing orcs in creative ways is satisfying and funny.
1838	1	a	I didn't wanna kill them at first, they were such big, dumb, lumbering creatures. But then I realized how that made them real good targets.
1840	1	a	It is very fun and interesting game!
1842	1	a	A unique twist of the Tower Defense genre of games using traps instead of towers and 3rd person action. You are encouraged to use a crazy mix of traps and spells to rack up ridiculous combos and kill streaks. With 24 Levels, plenty of trap, weapon and spells, 3 upgrade trees and a lot of orcs and other nasties to slay, for $14.99 you cannot go wrong with purchasing this game.
1844	1	a	Killing thousands of orcs, what can be better?! Only killing zombies, but orcs also fine!
1846	1	a	One of the greatest Strategy Defense games you will ever play.  I give it a 9/10  Pro's: Great gameplay, funny lines and characters. Awesome ways to kill those pesky orcs. Neat little story built into the game. It's immersive, giving you the final outcome in your defense, and allowing you to make it stronger by fighting the hordes yourself.  Con's: Crossbows shouldn't be fully automatic. Some items seem to be ten times better than others. Kinda repetitive trying to build up skulls to buy upgrades.  Summary:  If you love Strategy Tower Defense games, why aren't you playing this right now?
1848	1	a	My only criticism of this game is that it has no multiplayer; what a fun game!
1850	1	a	Really Really Great Game, Can't Recomend this enough. IF you Love it (Which you will) and get it OMD2 Comes out end of the month, Buying This unlocks a 'Classic Mode' for it.   IT's £.75!!!!!! BUY IT! and LOVE IT!
1852	1	a	Orcs must die is a action strategy defending game with a tower defense feel. orcs must die brings these kind of games to a whole new generation into games. Orcs must die is addicting yet really fun. Your main goal is to not allow Orcs from getting into a portal. While Defending you build traps, barracades, hire guardes, and much more. While defending you also learn spells at one point in the game when the orcs get harder and stronger. Orcs must die is easily one of my favorite games to play on steam and has a lot of replayability. Orcs must die is probably one of my favorite games of all time, so if you're a fan of these games get it now!
1854	1	a	A fun, short, and overall enjoyable third-person tower defense romp. Writing is adequate. Worth 5 bucks or so.
1856	1	a	Very fun and addictive game. Also, Steel Weaver is my waifu.
1858	1	a	A great game! Tower defense meets shooter. Worth at least 10 bucks.
1860	1	a	Great Game for Hours of Orcslaughtering ! But only if you not slip at Kobold blood and break your Neck!
1862	1	a	Most addicting game EVER!!!
1864	1	a	Nice tower defense type of game. It has some more depth then the standard flash games you can play on the internet.
1866	1	a	Really fun stuff!
1868	1	a	This is a game!
1870	1	a	Excellent and fun tower defense game. Think Sanctum but with better graphics and a larger array of turrets. Looking forward to the next one with co-op.
1872	1	a	Kill the Orcs, slay the Orcs, destroy the Orcs  You returned late home that night Evidence all around you from the flight You see your family's blood spilled on the ground There's no trace of the Orcs to be found  Take the broadsword in your hand Follow the Orcs to their camp You will have vengeance in blood  With their heads they will pay the price Spill blood On their trail we hunt them tirelessly Spill blood Bloodshed eases their loss Spill their blood  Their decapitation leads to the cessation Of the sadness, of the woe  Spill the blood
1874	1	a	Multiplayer and Endless mode are missing, but otherwise it's awesome. The artstyle is hilarious and there is just so much fast paced carnage and so many ways to execute orcs that you can replay it over and over just for laughs.  Personally I think this is faster and more intensive than Dungeon Defenders.
1876	1	a	Pure fun! Amazingly cheap game.for the amount of quality entertainment you get. Placing traps Dungeon Keeper style is also a good thing.I will never tire of finding new ways to fling orcs into lava or push them into a wall of rotating axes.   Recommended buy at full price, it's a 'no brainer' on sale.
1878	1	a	It's tower defence game, where you can place traps and create your army. And fight for your own.    Pros:   -Traps, weapons, upgrades  -Orcs  -Army  -Isn't so bad    Cons:   -No multiplayer or co-op  -Just one character   6+/10 
1880	1	a	I may have only played it a short time it's a pretty fun game. One of my other friends recommended it on here and im glad i i bought it.. I bought bother versions OMD1 and OMD2
1882	1	a	A great laugh and a bargain under a tenner.
1884	1	a	a very good mix between tower defence and TPS. fast-paced action and good maps. the story mode is too short imho and you have few reason to replay it
1886	1	a	Fun and original game mixing tower defense concepts and action/shooter gameplay
1888	1	a	Amazing game for mindless fun. Lots of replay value too!
1890	1	a	Hilarious game! Loving killing orcs? This game is for you! HIGHLY recommended!
1892	1	a	this game combines some of the best parts of tower defense games, third person shooter games and presicion strategy games, all this makes for an absolutley fantastic game, :D 10/10
1894	1	a	Fun but I wish it was MMO
1896	1	a	It's a blast! Tower defence with third person shooting is awesome.
1898	1	a	It's true, they have to die.
1900	1	a	50% tower defense, 50% third person shooter, 100% pure fun!
1902	1	a	I had heard a lot about this game from friends and online review sites but I never really thought this game was for me. Boy was I wrong! Seeing it in a bundle I ended up buying it and Orcs Must Die! 2 and I am so glad I did. Being able to setup traps and try to link combos is so fun it's stupid. For anyone that read about this game or seen videos online and thought it wasn't for them, give it a try. You won't regret it! Now only to get more free time to play the game...
1904	1	a	This game takes my love of a good defense game, with a wide array of traps and some varied terrain, and combines it with some goofy humor and a 3-D first-person perspective. Watching orcs get hacked to bits is fun!  You can't entirely rely on your traps to do all the hacking, though: Some you will have to handle yourself, with crossbow, sword, or spells. I'm ambivalent about that part, as it does keep you on your toes and give you a chance to catch what your traps missed, but trying to chase down a scurrying kobold with a crossbow detracts from the base-building gameplay if you have to do it too much. All in all though I found it reasonably well balanced at normal difficulty.  In addition to your choice of traps and spells, in later levels you can choose for each level which of three 'weavers' to work with, each with their own upgrade tree, which opens up more strategies. How do you want your orcs to die today?
1906	1	a	Hate orcs? Then this is the game for you. Here you take on the role as a war mage, and defend 24 fortresses on 24 levels. Choose from a number of traps and spells to defeat the orcs rushing towards the rift.  One of the funniest games I've played in a long time. Killing orcs has never been funnier!
1908	1	a	This is a great fusion of a first-person shooter and a tower defense game. Rather than passively setting up traps and defenses and hiding behind them, you're encouraged to wade into the fray and take an active role in defending your base.
1910	1	a	I have not seen much yet, but there is one thing I would like to announce: This is a game with a usable interface! Key remapping would be nice, but is not strictly required with the simple and robust gameplay here. Contrasting to interface snafus like Bunch of Heroes and the tears-of-rage-inducing Mass Effect 2, this game still has an interface that works. All hail the developers.
1912	1	a	Mindless mayhem with a great sense of humor. The main hero has one liners Ash would be proud of. A good thinking game along with lots and lots of killing Orcs who, have some great dialogue of their own. Unique trap upgrades along with multiple skill paths for your hero make this much more than your usual tower defense game. My only complaint is there isn't a multiplayer option but you can compete with your friends via a leaderboard.
1914	1	a	First Person Shooter meets Tower Defense with a dash of comedy. Fun to play and replay.
1916	1	a	Bored? Don't know what to play? Cant concentrate? Well this is a game right up your alley. I love playing this as a relaxing fun game, although doesn't have to be one of those games.... it can also be competitive... compete between friends so see who is the best orc killer!!!!. Out of ten I would give this game a solid 8 - because is easy to get to grips with, its fun, interesting and did i mention fun? personally I loved it so much i brought all the DLC for it and the follow up 'Orcs Must Die 2'.... yet to play that though. If your still unsure look at videos on YouTube of the gameplay, playthroughs or let's play videos. I started a lets play series on this game on my channel so you could check that out and see if this game is for you.
1918	1	a	Amazing game! Amazing soundtrack!
1920	1	a	Damn I love this game
1922	1	a	Tower Defense plus action RPG. A bit more balanced and fast paced single player Dungeon Defenders. Lacks the co-op but makes up for it in the polished style and endless possibilities.
1924	1	a	The kind of game to play when you're on a road or something...  Is not a really hard game,there are only a few tactics...  7/10 And the character looks kinda gay.. But is a fun to play game.
1926	1	a	Yes, this game is fun! I rly like this one more than secon one..
1928	1	a	Another version of a defense game. This one however has its addicting factors for me. As you do beter in stages you are able to unlock upgraded version of your defense structures. I would advise playing this one before the second one for the sake of story and getting a feel for the game, however once I started playing the second one, its overall fun and the much greater pool of things you have to unlock increased so much I find it hard going back to the first.
1930	1	a	A good all around tower defense game.
1932	1	a	Epicness on a stick! This game is the ♥♥♥♥! Its like someone said 'F you tower defense!' And stepped it up a notch, and by a notch i mean TURN THE NOB OFF!
1934	1	a	I love this game!! Think of sanctum with more levels, weapons, and towers.
1936	1	a	FPS &amp; Tower Defense brought together in such a wonderful way
1938	1	a	Best 'tower' defence game I've played. Great visual style, humorous and challenging. It helps that you're part of the action at all times and feel very powerful.... however, you can't be everywhere at once and this game doesn't hesitate to stretch you. Even after you've completed the campaign it's still great trying out new tactics on earlier levels with all the new traps you've unlocked as every completed level gives you something new to play with!
1940	1	a	A well made mixup of tower defence and first person shooter.
1942	1	a	A little tower defense, a little action. Orcs Must Die! is a great mix of genres, both fun and hilarious.
1944	1	a	If there was a way to mute your dumbass character then this game would be good. Its a good game.
1946	1	a	An entertaining game! Love it so far :)
1948	1	a	An amazingly fun and addicting fast paced third-person action game in which Orcs must die. You achieve that with your magical abilities as well as with the help of a large number of ingenious traps that you continuously get throughout the game. The difficulty and challenge gets constantly ramped up but never feels overwhelming.
1950	1	a	Alright so if you are a fan of tower defenses you have to play this game. The many traps that you can set up to unleash devastation on the endless orcs gives way for an enjoyable gaming experience that is different every time you play.
1952	1	a	An old but fun game combining Tower Defence with 3rd person action. The game goes with a silly and awesome humour and there is just some strange satisfaction of mowing down wave after wave of enemies. The big drawback of this first game is the lack of co-op which you get in Orcs Must Die! 2.
1954	1	a	The traps, abilities, the endless hordes. It's the imagination and creativity of the player that makes this game endlessly fun.
1956	1	a	This one is surprisingly fun, I've been having a blast with it. If you like tower defense game play even the littlest bit, you'll enjoy this.
1958	1	a	Smooth and fast paced, good fun!
1960	1	a	If you like the tower defense genre then i would highly recomend this game, it adds an interesting take on the genre. the first person aspect definentally adds to the game, and the upgrade system encourages you to not let anything pass you, yet at the same time not force you to replay each level.
1962	1	a	Very fun game if you like tower defense. Some of the traps seem worthless though and sometimes you don't even need them so it just turns into a FPS. The light atmosphere and dialogue is hilarious, but the story is non-existant. Def worth the money if you like good ol' fashion TD. Just don't expect any multiplayer.
1964	1	a	Deadly traps + Lots of Orcs = Lots of dead orcs. Fun and addictive game.
1966	1	a	I played Orcs Must Die! 2 before this one, and I must say, the second one is better. For those that wants to know what happened in this one, I will spoil it for you and say there is no boss fight with that woman. There is no upgrading your actual weapons, there is only upgrading once on your traps. The DLCs' made this game easier. Skip this game and get Orcs must die 2 if you want gameplay rather than story.. If you want to know how this all started, then feel free to get this when it is on sale. 6/10
1968	1	a	I will save the long review on this one, all you need to know is this game is a tower defence third person hybrid and it is freakin fun. Excuse me i have to get back to playing now. 10/10
1970	1	a	You like tower defence? You like slaying orcs? Or crushing them? Burning maybe? Or penatrating them with arrows? All whilst listening to comments of the most selfcentered ♥♥♥♥♥♥ since duke nukem? Well then this is the game for you. Fend of orcs in an epic onslought, using your wits and your crossbow to prevent them from entering the rifts. With lots of different traps, spells and a decent amound of enemy variety this game does one hell of a job in the third person TD genre. The game is not perfect though. The levels are all very gray and brown and as you are nearing the end of each lv, your defence has usually become so solid that there is no need for you to even be there.  But if you can live with that (and I know I could), then this game sure is a hell of a lotta fun.
1972	1	a	A must have if you love tower defence games
1974	1	a	Good game, very original.  Third person combat combined with tower defense, reasonably well executed. I'm not sure there's a point to all the stuff in the game - there seems to be some equipment and spells that are just objectively better than others - but then again that might just be my play style. Reminds me a bit of Dungeon Keeper, if it were possible to place traps while posessing a minion. That said, I haven't played anything quite like it, so it gets points for an original fusion of genres. The player character is highly irritating - I think he's supposed to be an endearing doofus, but he just comes across as an out-and-out ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Even so, this is worth getting.
1976	1	a	There's just something about deploying the traps, bottlenecking the Orcs, and watching the combos fly that balances its charm between arcade tower defense and creative puzzle making. This game has kept me from jumping back on World of Warcraft...FOR THE ALLIANCE!!
1978	1	a	Worth it
1980	1	a	Entertaining! Hulk smash!
1982	1	a	+1
1984	1	a	This is an awesome game: awesome gameplay, graphics, and music (symphonic metal ftw)! If you like tower defense at all definitely check out the demo.  And true story: this game was developed by a lot of the folks responsible for the classic RTS series Age of Empires.
1986	1	a	Fast, furious, and most importantly; fun. Well worth the money.
1988	1	a	Great mix of tower defense and 3rd person shooter.
1990	1	a	Requiring a degree of strategy and finesse (especially by the time Nightmare levels present), Orcs Must Die! is lots of gruesome fun that will test both your mettle and ability to adapt in ways that will bring you back time and time again to see just how many ways those pesky orcs really can die! Kobold sappers can really be frustrating as can minor bugs with trap placement on a few levels, but overall this is a very enjoyable experience. I definitely can recommend it!
1992	1	a	Very easy to play, great sound track and voicing. Well worth the buy plus alot of replayability for sure graphics are unique and great.   You can create you own death gauntlets!!  10/10   
1994	1	a	Another excellent tower defense-shooter hybrid game. Unlike Sanctum, though, this is third-person and emphasizes the action portion. Instead of spending time building mazes and giving your towers assistance, you will be doing most of the killing in this game, assisted by your traps. Highly recommended.
1996	1	a	a lame dreamworks looking character kills a bunch of orcs. pretty fun tbh
1998	1	a	Pretty good time waster. Can be challenging at times, too!
2000	1	a	Amazing game! Strategic, addicting, and competetive! Try to get the most combos and beat all of your friends highscores! (I derped and put this as a comment on BigDave's post lol)
2002	1	a	Quite a suprising fun game and for the price currently in the sale, its worth it!
2004	1	a	Tower Defense? Check. Third Person Shooter? Check. Tricky levels, intricate traps, enemies in all shapes and sizes? Check. Tons of fun? Check. Like all of these? BUY ORCS MUST DIE! It's awesome!
2006	1	a	The game blends 3rd person shooting and tower defence incredibly well. If you prefer playing it as a shooter it gives you a handful of ridicilous weapons that can throw orcs around or freeze them in place. If you'd rather play a tower defence game it gives you tons of traps and towers that let you turn orcs into gibbed bits in creative ways. Overall it's a colourful, energetic and all around great game. Buy it.
2008	1	a	Fun, fun, fun !  Great map design, good difficulty increase during the campaign and nice game experience.
2010	1	a	 Recommended 5/5!
2012	1	a	This game is amazing. It is a game where you fight off waves of Orcs that slowly increase in difficulty. You go through a certain amount of waves before you get a break to heal, build, and rebuild. You slowly gain more weapons, items, and buildables as you progress through the game. It has a great amount of replay value. This game is a must have for those seaking a challenge as well as a person who loves strategic games.
2014	1	a	You are a Communist Taliban agent from the Axis of Evil if you don't get this game.
2016	1	a	You're gonna love this game, there's many fortresses to defend and lots of good enemies to fight, the horde will never stop coming, it's worth your time!
2018	1	a	Orcs Must Die is an awesome version of a 3D Tower Defense game, although in this case it's Trap Defense. It is easy to play and loads of fun. One of the best games I've played in recent times.
2020	1	a	Cool game and good tower defense.
2022	1	a	It's a pretty great tower defense game.
2024	1	a	An awesome FPS/Tower defense combo game which seems to be really in these days. A Single player worth every penny. Alas its graphic engine is comparable to Valve's Source engine... this means it's rather unstable and causes the 'Graphic card not responding' bug on certain levels or using certain abilities. If you are farmiliar to that bug dont buy it unless on the discount rack. Edit: Using Nvidia's 'Alternative rendering mode 1' resolves the problem.
2026	1	a	Simple, yet satisfying. Mix HomeAlone, Tower Defence, and one of those Three Dynasty RPGs, you have this.
2028	1	a	This game's fun ^^ but some little stupid mistakes will largly take down your score :) love this ^^ you should play it PS. still no co-op mode...  i think if this game have a co op mode, this will be the priceless and fun with your friend !! :)
2030	1	a	it's pretty good
2032	1	a	Traps. Orcs. Castles. WOOHOO! 10/10 ign. Its was oke
2034	1	a	great non-stop action game :D
2036	1	a	You don't have this game yet?! What are you waiting for?!
2038	1	a	Cartoony, and humorous slap-stick style turret defense with added fps elements. Extremely fun and engaging from start to finish. You are the guardian of the warp-gate thingy... baddies (orcs, trolls, bats, goblins, etc) spawn at a specific location and traverse the map to get to the glowing blue pillar of light that must be protected at all costs. The AI isn't amazing but it will alter its path if there is one of lesser resistance, or even move to attack you directly if you're close enough to them. Your task as the guardian is to stop them by any and all means necessary. be it shooting them with arrows, magic, or traps that you've cleverly placed along their selected path. All the while upgrading your skills/traps along the way to improve your chances of preventing them from escaping.  In short, Orcs must die! like, a lot...
2040	1	a	Play this game. Now.
2042	1	a	24-38-12   IF YOU WANT CO-OP GET OMD2!!! 
2044	1	a	One of the best indie game i have played.
2046	1	a	Fun game, a little bit to easy but was so much fun it didnt really matter, Orcs must die 2 is coop so make sure you buy that game as well to play with your friends!
2048	1	a	Still fun after a few years
2050	1	a	A lot of fun here. It's basically a 3D tower defense game with FPS integrated. A lot of traps to choose from to kill the horde trying to invade your castle. The ultimate integration would be a multiplayer option. Who knows, maybe in the next version.
2052	1	a	Great gameplay. The upgrade system is different for a tower defense game (you buy one upgrade for a tower, such as more damage or making it cheaper to use in-game, and it then persists for the rest of your campaign, rather than upgrading each tower individually in combat), but it works pretty well all the same.  Some of the protagonist's ejaculations get quite annoying, as they're pretty limited in variety, and often don't make sense. For example, when laying a simple barrier tower, he'll shout, 'That'll hurt!'.  Overall, the game is great. I played the entire thing in one sitting. :P
2054	1	a	One of my favourite games EVER. Great balance between action, strategy and humor. All scenarios are very well designed to make every level as fun as possible.
2056	1	a	Strange Genre but its funny. If you love third-person-shooter or tower defense. Pick it up. And Play it!
2058	1	a	Not bad at all! Great for when you are just bored and need something to do and the graphics of the game are very good compared to most games.
2060	1	a	This is easily one of the most intelligent (and yet, one of the most stupid) tower defense games I've ever played. It lures you in with a gentle learning curve, then smashes your face through the curve before discarding your limp form into a pool of acid. Via a floor catapult.
2062	1	a	Really fun and funny, and surprisingly it has a good story
2064	1	a	This game is absolutely hilarious and fun with a twist of style. The game's great if you like games with a mixture of strategy (Via traps) with action. Well worth the money. :)
2066	1	a	this is second in place for fp tower defense, i hope you like orcs
2068	1	a	Orcs Must Die is a wave based tower defense game that does the only the title does in this game you kill orcs just because...  The gameplay is fun and easy but the game is hard to master there is no story but who cares KILL THE DAMN ORCS
2070	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is a great addition to the Tower Defence / FPS genre. With the great selection of funny traps and weapons, it make Orcs Must Die! a must buy.
2072	1	a	A fun take on the tower-defence genre. Well-designed levels and trap variations provide endless ways to kill orcs! There is no set blueprint to beating a level and it is easy to try out many different strategies. OMD is suited for casual players who want to breeze through the slaughter but also provides a challenge for those who want one -- 5-skulling all the levels on nightmare took quite a lot of strategy tweaking and redo-ing. My only big complaint is that in nightmare mode you don't have any time to set up before the level starts. The game should be about planning a good defense, not how fast you can place your traps.  Overall great game: 9/10  The humor coupled with good voice acting was an added bonus.
2074	1	a	This is a pretty fun game. Novel and addicting. A good break from more serious games like Skyrim.
2076	1	a	This game has an extremely casual and funny gameplay style + setting! But beware... very addicting if you like Tower Defense!
2078	1	a	Good Old Tower Defense, Orcs Style.
2080	1	a	Awesome! I just need a bigger shoota and letta kill them all !!!!
2082	1	a	Orcs Must Die has appealing graphics, crisp sounds, and addictive, fun gameplay! Setting up your own traps to kill orcs is fun, and every level feels fresh.
2084	1	a	You play from a third person perspective as you lay waste to wave after waves of orcs. Using a wide array of spells and traps at your disposal. Tower defense with third person aspects. It is a must buy.
2086	1	a	Great trap defense game, with lots of content. Quite a bit of cheap DLC as well.
2088	1	a	Fans of the Tower Defense genre, FPSers, and strategy games enthusiasts will find a lot to enjoy here. This game has the perfect mix of action, humor, and charm that is rarely seen in games today. Easily one of the best budget titles of the year and I urge anyone considering purchasing this game to buy it now.
2090	1	a	Whats more entertaining that seeing orc's being grinned into mince meat or pummeled withe a whirlwind of logs!?
2092	1	a	Awesome game, great art style and character design and a really fun and unusually complex addition to the tower defense genera.
2094	1	a	They must die...
2096	1	a	A good combination of first person shooter and tower defense game with some low brow sarcastic humor.  Pros: + It is not an easy game on the higher difficulty levels and in later stages of the game. You will have to know your traps, choose your traps wisely, and get good at quickly placing them. Be prepared to lose often and a whole lot on the Nightmare difficulty. However, I do feel like I earned the win after I have been getting my ♥♥♥ handed to me on levels that I have had trouble with.  + Sound effects, music, and the voice overs from the orcs are cute though a bit repetitive.   + Graphics and level design are nice to look at.   + While a single set of traps can get you through many levels, some levels have a design that occassionally forces you to rethink whatever strategy you have settled into.  Cons: - When using the crossbow while the monsters are at point blank range, I often shoot through a monster. Not sure if this is a bug or a feature to force you to use the melee weapon.  - While there are a variety of trap types that are unlocked as you progress they seem to fall into categories of use that make them seem like 'upgrades' of older traps instead of a new unique trap. For example I found that I pretty muched replaced the Spike Trap with the Tar Trap and the Wall Grinder replaced the other wall traps when making my trap selections.  - The Gnoll Hunter moves through barricades without breaking them first. This might be a legit ability of that monster but with their speed and ability to poison it feels like this is less 'increasing the difficulty' and more 'cheating.'  - Some issues with the camera that I mostly notice when backing up against a wall that has a small alcove and when standing under the Swing Mace Trap.  - Some of the spash screens that pop up while loading do have some scantily clad characters that could cause some awkwardness.  
2098	1	a	A fantastic, if not unorthodox version of the tower defense genre. Now you get to defend from the inside! As the War Mage, you defend the rift between worlds from orcs trying to get into our world.  How do you do that? Why, by using traps, spells, and weapons, of course! Brutalize orcs with spikes, arrows, acid, and more!  See more in my short video that asks the simple question: Why didn't I play this game earlier?!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sH1I2j5D2p8 
2100	1	a	Very fun and challenging game with excellent voice actors. I highly recommend it.
2102	1	a	Hilarious, exciting and challenging. This game is worth Every penny.
2104	1	a	I had a ton of fun with this game. Kept me interested and the story, although basic, was decent and had enough funny quips to stand out.   The achievements weren't super easy, and were obtainable and getting 100% is both obtainable and rewarding.   Great game, definitely reccomended.
2106	1	a	This is the funnest game I've played in a long time. It's all about killing orcs in various ways of course. The fun though is creating an ingenious way to kill said orcs. The game offers you a large variety of traps and such to kill 'em off, plus it offers some 1st person shooter style mechanics where you can kill 'em with your crossbow, your sword and your magic gizmos. The only drawback is the guy you play. He tries to be funny but the jokes just fall flat. Despite that though, I love this game. Very polished, fun and worth the money.
2108	1	a	incredibly fun game, very humorous and contains plenty of challenging maps, there's a nightmare mode that I haven't tried yet but the regular campaign can get pretty difficult as well, tons of replayability.  great price too.
2110	1	a	This will be the first half of our review for the Orcs Must Die! series. This is the review for the first game, the overall score of which will be averaged with the overall score of Orcs Must Die! 2 to give us our final score for the series as a whole. So far, it’s prospects of a solid score are looking fantastic. Let us begin.  I – Story [7/10]  Orcs Must Die! is a third-person tower defense game from Robot Entertainment, in which, the player assumes the role of the Hero; an otherwise unnamed character and the last living member of the Order. The Order is an ancient and powerful guild of War Mages who have taken it upon themselves to guard Rifts (magical portals that connect the human world and the “Dead World which also provide a source of magic throughout both worlds.)  The Dead World is home to a faction known as “The Mob and is comprised of various creatures such as gnolls, ogres, and (of course) orcs. The Mob is lead by a former student of the Order known as the Sorceress. During the course of the game, the Hero is fighting to keep the Mob at bay despite their every increasing aggression and frequency of attacks.  Spoiler Alert: In the end, the Hero steps through a Rift and closes it forever by means of a spell. Although he saves the human world from destruction at the hands of the Sorceress and her limitless legions, he also destroys the source of magic for both worlds. The human world, now dependent upon magic, begins to steadily deteriorate. The Sorceress, stripped of her powers, is trapped in the Dead World with a gratuitous amount of angry monsters.  The of OMD! should be thematically familiar to the vast majority of gamers, moviegoers, and readers alike. It is tried and true and it worked wonderfully for the game. That being said, it has still be done before.  II – UI [9/10]  The user interface was great. It was simple, the minimap worked like a charm, and I kept pressing the “ready button long before I was actually ready. (Please note that that was not the game’s fault, it was all mine. It felt necessary to talk about it though.) In-game HUD was very user friendly and all of my stats/currently equipped traps (towers) and equipment were easy to refer to. However, the menus seemed to feel a bit clunky. Maybe it was just me, but I felt that they could have used a little tweaking.  III – Gameplay [10/10]  As I mentioned in a previous article, I wasn’t always a fan of tower defense games. In most cases, I’m still not crazy about them. But, every now and then, one comes along that attaches itself to my heart like a parasite and sticks with me for the long haul. Orcs Must Die! is one of those special little parasites.  The vast majority of the maps are incredible free form as far as defensive strategies go. The game starts you off with fairly easy maps and they continually increase in complexity as you hack and slash your way through the campaign. As someone who is (in general) not very good with strategy, I weirdly loved this. It gave me a good chance to brush up on my defense skills and figure out what needs to be where so I’m not eyeball deep in orcs in a few minutes. Should I build outward or inward? Do I need to worry about aerial a-holes or not? Loved it.  As far as using your character in combat, the third-person perspective was implemented expertly. A reticle is clearly displayed (and not easily lost) so that I can wade straight into the action if need be or snipe fools out from afar. Primary and secondary weapon functions are easily used and easily mastered. Movement is very fluid and the character’s sprint speed is comfortable fast.  IV – Content [10/10]  Orcs Must Die! has a lot of content, especially for a tower defense game. The core game has 24 maps, 6 weapons, 19 traps and minions (in total), and 11 different enemy types. Not only this, but any upgrades you purchase for weapons, traps, etc. are permanent and stay with you throughout the entire game. This is fantastic, in case you were wondering.  There are two different DLCs for OMD! (Artifacts of Power and Lost Adventures) and both add their fair share of extra content as well. Really though, if you end up purchasing this game, you’ll probably end up picking up the DLC at some pint as well because you’re going to want more.  V – Visual [10/10]  Every last graphical detail of Orcs Must Die! is enchanting. Character and enemy models are very well done and have a charming, cartoon-esque quality to them. The environments are wonderful and every map has something new for you to ogle in your downtime. When you’re not setting traps or slaying orcs, it’s really worth it to take a few minutes to just explore your surroundings.  VI – Audio [10/10]  Seldom has a game had a more fitting soundtrack than Orcs Must Die! does. Seriously though, just phenomenal. You can annihilate thousands and tens of thousands to this epic score and never grow tired of it. That goes for the annihilation too. It has a very metal feel to it on the whole and I’m sure that War Mages the world over could happily crush skulls to it all day long.  On top of the score, the voice acting is absolutely superb. The Hero is hilarious and you’ll find yourself laughing at his one-liners and his celebratory dance moves map after map.  VII – Overall [9.3/10]  Overall, Orcs Must Die! is a great game and a true testament of what a tower defense game should be, in my opinion.
2112	1	a	Fast-paced and hilarious combination of tower defense and third-person slaughter. Lots of great humor, lots of brutal ways to murder orcs to pieces, fun and challenging and all around a great game, held back only by the lack of some form of multiplayer. Definitely a must-play.
2114	1	a	Very surprising game! Orcs Myst Die! is a very good example of the mix between tower defence and action games. It's a solo only game but if you get into the first couple of levels you get hooked by the variety of the maps and the sheer number of traps you can set to stop the orcs from reaching your base. I would also recommend the sequel, which has a coop mode and alot more content.
2116	1	a	Orcs Must Die! is a fun and refreshing little game. It's easy to drop for a quick 10-minute session, but addictive enough to want to go at it for hours.
2118	1	a	played it and it is odd but good fun
2120	1	a	Real funny game! :D Fps/tower defence :D
2122	1	a	Great fun, tower defense done in 3rd person. If your traps don't kill the orcs you can do it yourself. Fun across the many levels provided, with a good variety of traps too.
2124	1	a	8/10 - Very Good  This game is the perfect combination of Tower Defense and Hack-n-Slash. Strategic elements play off of the rip-roaring action perfectly. Comical dialogue and interesting backstory supplement the excellent gameplay. If you like Tower Defense, Hack-n-Slash, or just a generally interesting and funny game, grab this immediately!  PS: This game has NOTHING to do with Lord of the Rings whatsoever. 
2126	1	a	people keep saying its like dungeon defenders, it has a similar concept but it is no were near it. this game is amazing and has its own twists.
2128	1	a	Fun as hell!
2130	1	a	Very entertaining and addicting, killing enemies feels really satysfying when you create some effective traps.  A lot of laughable one-liners by main character and orcs make that game really fun experience.
2132	1	a	A great game for everyone that loves Tower Defense or a classical shooter, with a lot of humor to boot!  Highly recomended!
2134	1	a	Orcs, traps and other funny stuff.  
2136	1	a	Fun RTS recommend for RTS fans
2138	1	a	Such an awesome game. Last a long time, but not much replayability. No multiplayer either, but aside from these 2 things it's aweeeesooommmee and well worth the price!!
2140	1	a	super cool game - worth every penny
2142	1	a	lots of fun, made me laugh.
2144	1	a	
2146	1	a	Quite possibly the most underrated game of the year, this gem is filled with fine-tuned and 'always fun' values that I never see anymore. It combines the best elements of effecient defense strategies with TPS/beat-em-up gameplay. The variety in different ways you can play each level gives it immense replay value. Only downside is that the first playthrough might be a bit easy for experienced players of either genre. Fortunately, there's a Hard Mode included that can appeal to you.  Ever played tower defense games, and wished you were on the field to make up for the terrible micro happening before your eyes? This can put your abilities to the test if you use tactics that empower your own character instead of countless traps and guardians.  There's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ demo, see the glory or yourself.
2148	1	a	Fun game. Good for single player. If you like this TD style play sanctum or Dungeon Defenders II for multiplayer.
2150	1	a	Must-have to any tower-defense lover in need of a bit of shooting,
2152	1	a	soooo epic!
2154	1	a	I was a staunch hater of the Tower Defense genre at the time of launch for this game. They were everywhere, everyone played it and I found them insanely pointless. Back then they were limited to simple wave-defending, waiting for inevitable death.  After trying the demo, I bought the game immediately. Orcs Must Die! was (and still is, in my opinion) the high point of the Tower Defense genre.  With amazing art, ingenious level design, creative traps and a hilarious main character whose idiotic banter can lighten even the darkest days, this game stands out among its many peers.
2156	1	a	Awesome Game! 9/10 overall
2158	1	a	This probably the best and most fun tower defense game I've ever played. I stopped playing Skyrim to finish this game. So good.
2160	1	a	Really quirky first person tower defence. The main characters wit and quips make this well worth a second run through. Although some levels can be infuriating the over all feel and perfomance of the game make this one to return to time and again.
2162	1	a	This game is a trip, lol. Endless killing of orcs is so much fun.
2164	1	a	Don't let the fact that this is an indie tower defense game put you off. OMD! is an example of superb craftsmanship, a fast-paced, strategic, and genuinely funny game that also happens to look and sound exceptionally well. The artistic direction is smooth, coloful, and appropriately stylized, and the sound and music combine to create an immersive experience.
2166	1	a	worth buying! very fun!!
2168	1	a	Great fun for a small price! with interesting maps..
2170	1	a	If you enjoy tower defence with a bit of third person firepower thrown in, you're gonna love this game. And hey, who doesn't love mincing orcs into a spray of giblets? Over all this game is LOADS of fun and can get pretty tense when you don't know if your traps will hold back the oncoming army of orcs.
2172	1	a	i'm so happy with this purchase!
2174	1	a	...
2176	1	a	I love tower defense games!   Though this game is more about traps than towers, the concepts the same. Obliterate hordes of enemies before they can get to a specific zone/s.  The gameplay is smooth, arcadey, yet tactical. You have to manage your money, abilities and traps. You find yourself more in the fray of the battle then your traditional tower defense game. Its easy to pick up and have fun if you're short on time.   The better you do on levels the more 'Skullz' you get, which in tern can upgrade your traps. So I find myself replaying levels just to get that extra Skull. Lots of fun.  However this title would be a whole lot better if it had multiplayer. I would get a real kick out of cooping some levels with friends.  Orcs Must Die has humour, traps, replayability and of course lots and lots of Orcs. Definitely worth buying
2178	1	a	This was a game i didnt think i would like but in the end i loved it. Its a great game with an odd and funy storyline.
2180	1	a	If you like Tower D games at all, you would like this game.
2182	1	a	If you're a fan of indy games and tower defense, this game is worth a go. It's cheap, so you won't be out much if you won't like it. There are plenty of acheesements, and it's got some nice humor about it (like Magicka! go go!).
2184	1	a	Just FUN! The game is a box of pure entertainment!
2186	1	a	headshot headshot headshot headshot headshot headshot headshot headshot headshot headshot headshot headshot headshot headshot headshot headshot headshot headshot headshot headshot headshot headshot headshot headshot
2188	1	a	Not a game where you can spend 1000Hours of playing it, but its wort buying all the DLC and Orcs Must die 2. It's a great game to play if you are bored and wanna have some action while you can watch orcs running in your traps. It runs on 4k Highest Setings 60 FPS and has a Comic look kinda. And its a basic game where you have a simple goal.
2190	1	a	Coming just after TF2 this is definitley the funnest game I have ever played!!! I highly recommend this game for anyone who has ever played Kingdom Rush or Incursion. This game is not a 2-D tower defense game, but a 3-D Trap defense game!!! The story line is very well made and extremely interesting. If you haven`t played Kingdom Rush before then i highly recommend u check it out. You can find it on many websites but the only one I have found number two to be playable on is  play.kingdomrushfrontiers.com .
2192	1	a	Most enjoyable Tower Defense game that I've played so far. Didn't finish it but moving on to Orcs Must Die 2!
2194	1	a	Can't stop playing, so addicting!
2196	1	a	Very good so far. I use it as a snack before other game. 10-15 minutes session. Very enjoyable, good athmosphere, somehow I didn't find the maps to be easy to read and apprehend (but it's no big deal) 
2198	1	a	This was a really good game. Just the right amount of challenge and tool progression in it to keep you wanting to move forward. It took me too long to play this.
2200	1	a	ORCS MUST DIE IS THE GREATEST GAME EVERY MADE!
2202	1	a	So what does this game has ? It's got orcs and traps . Is that all ? Yes . Why the heck do you even play it ? Cause you can kill them by the dozens in more then one way . And that never gets old.
2204	1	a	A nice twist on the 'tower defence' genre
2206	1	a	I like this one better than sequel although couple last level isn't really suit my playstyle, but it's doable.  I prefer stationary gameplay, I still can do that with this game OMD2? no can do.
2208	1	a	It's like a single-player-only Dungeon Defenders with more attitude.
2210	1	a	I RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO ANYONE WHO WANTS TO GET ARTHIRITUS EXTREMLEY YOUNG WOOOOO HOOOOO
2212	1	a	One of the best TDs out there
2214	1	a	Game mechanics of this title is awesome. Even though that story line is very poor, this game is very enjoyable and addictive. Unlocking new possibilities, how to stop orcs and have better score, pushes you to play more and more.  Positives: + Decent graphic; + very good game mechanics; + unlocking new things.  Negatives: - Game is short, but as I said, you will try to overcome other players; - when you are killing only one race, this game is little bit racist (joking :-D).  If you like puzzle games with action elements, this one is tottaly for you!
2216	1	a	Orcs Must Die! 3 words: Amazing, Addiciting, and Fun. 
2218	1	a	This game is my first experience on the hybrid of first-person shooter and tower defense. I always play it in single-player mode and it is fun. In my opinion, it is better than the second one.
2220	1	a	I most admit that is a fun game to play, It will keep you busy for a couple of hours
2222	1	a	One of the best games I have ever played!  Great music, even greater gameplay and tons of humor! The first few fortresses are very straight forward, easing you into the game, but as you get more traps and more orcs coming at you from more passageways, it really is intriquing to figure out how you can keep them away. The game is so fun that once you finish it, you really do want to start over on the harder difficulty! And now that I have finished that too I am sad that there is no more... Gonna have to move on to Orcs Must Die 2, hopping it's as good!
2224	1	a	Tower-defence and 3rd-person shooter are two game genres that can work wonders together.
2226	1	a	I bought the game about two weeks ago and i've been absolutely glued to it. It has to be one of the most refreshing and fun takes on tower defense I've ever tried! Lots of bang for the buck, nightmare difficulty will offer a good challenge.  Really engaging, adictive and entertaining, instant fan. Recommended wholeheartedly.
2228	1	a	I have never had so much fun chopping orcs into pieces. It's very easy to get a hang of the controls and I'm certainly in love with this game. With an appealing art style and nice soundtrack, I'm definitely going to be playing this some more. And I mean a lot more.
2230	1	a	Fantastic game, best combination of tower defense and action mechanics I've seen so far.
2232	1	a	This game is an absolute blast, 3rd person tower defense as it should be! LightJimmy I will beat all your highscores one day!
2234	1	a	Quality tower defense game with a 3rd person twist
2236	1	a	Honestly the only bad thing about the game is how high the lowest mouse sensitivity setting is.
2238	1	a	Awesome.Fun and more content.
2240	1	a	A really fun and frantic 'TD-ish' singleplayer game.  Though it isn't really a TD game; I think it's safe to say that the game got quite the inspiration from the tower defense aspect but instead makes use of traps, utilities and whatnot to defend your fortresses. It's even possible to make use of 'pathing' with well-placed barricades as to lure the waves into chokepoints.  I don't have much to say about this game except that I enjoyed it for what it was worth. The downside with this game is the rather short campaign/story and once you've got the right set-up it''s just a matter of adding stuff for overkill. In my opinion it would have a lot more replayability if it had some sort of survival mode or challenges with increasing difficulty.  This is however subject to change with possible DLCs but as for now, this is the verdict..  Definitely a fun game, worth a playthrough but unless you're obsessed with killing greenskins over and over again, it won't offer much replayability.
2242	1	a	Very nice Shrek exterminator game. But realize this game has no multiplayer support.  Still a good game tho. Can't wait for the OMD Unchained.
2244	1	a	Can't say anything different than has been said, it's a great game. Just wanted to throw my thumb into the ring.
2246	1	a	Good Game Even Better then OMD2..Thought i played OMD 2 first..then Unchained one..but The most Epic i think is 1 :3 Those Weavers Also Effects on Guardians and Sword..Epic &lt;3 Worth of 7$(but u can buy it on Sales also)
2248	1	a	Worth it
2250	1	a	
2252	1	a	Push traps over lava pit. Mmm, so satisfy,
2254	1	a	love this game!
2256	1	a	First Person Tower Defense. FPTD™. :P This game is a ton of fun. Played it lots elsewhere. Was happy to get it on my PC with expansions.  Great game, good quality. Good challenges, always keep you looking for a better gimmick or technique.  Part FPS, part Puzzle (sort of, in a strategy way), part Tower Defense.  I would HIGHLY recommend this game. Lot of fun, and humorous.
2258	1	a	If sokka from avatar: the last airbender and the kid from home alone had a baby !0/10
2260	1	a	great game. The song Kim by Eminem somehow fit the game well.
2262	1	a	great game very fun and its great
2264	1	a	It is tower defense without the towers.  It is also very good.
2266	1	a	mind numbing fun
2268	1	a	Medevil 'Trenched', I love it!
2270	1	a	There are orcs. They must die. It's a reverse 'Lemmings' as you create deathcourses intended to turn rampaging greenskins into ground meat with extreme predjudice. Fast paced, funny, and plenty of awesome moments you create for yourself. The demo is insanely easy compared to the rest of the game, but worth checking out to see if it appeals to you.
2272	1	a	Just what i need after really crappy day... Kill a few hundred orcs!
2274	1	a	Excellent! Simple to play, easy to learn, definitely a one-of-a-kind Third Person Shooter + Tower Defense game. Gameplay is easily summarized - Defend your rift(base) from orcs, with melee, range weapons, magic, traps, and guardians. There're over 10 different types of enemies, and 22 weapons, traps and guardians added up altogether. I would strongly suggest downloading the demo first before trying (I got hooked on the game this way). Maps are playable in 3 different levels - Apprentice(Easy), WarMage(Normal), Nightmare(Explains itself). The game has practically no ending, you can replay your maps as many times as you want. No rewards, but the gameplay itself is rewarding. The only 'ending', is probably when you completed all achievements, upgraded every single trap, and 5 Skull-ed all maps on all difficulties. Pretty fulfilling!  Pros - Graphics are cartoon-ish. Great for casual players. Graphics which are too clear makes me really stressed. - Gameplay varies, dependent on the type of player you are. Melee, magic, shooter, you choose! - Achievements are all attainable. Last broken achievement was removed, hence, 27 workable achievements. - 24 different maps, excluding 5 DLC maps(Might as well get it). - There's a difference shooting at the head, and at the body. Dealing different damage really draws the line between players who only want to complete the game, and those that REALLY wants to perform. You can't just spam. - Simple upgrades. Basically you complete a map well, you are given up to 10 skulls per map, then you upgrade it. There is simply no need for a guide on what to upgrade. Just do it. Eventually, all skulls will be used, and everything upgraded.  Cons - Single player. Might not be too optimal for couples, or a group of friends. Orcs Must Die 2 has co-op though(Recommended as well). - Despite 'Practice makes perfect', some really tough maps are really argh. You would be finding yourself restarting the map many times just to achieve 5 Skulls(5 Star Rating). - Endless isn't available, so once you're done with the map, you're done. Clearing the map isn't tough, but getting 5 Skulls for it might be a chore for some. - Too damn addictive. You really can't stop playing!!  On the overall, apart from perfecting this game by achieving 5 Skulls for all maps on all difficulties, even as a casual game, it will not fail to entertain. Definitely.   On a scale of 1-10, I would give it 9.5 (: Lack of companionship in this game kinda killed it for me, but I still completed it nevertheless! Fantastic game!!
2276	1	a	This game is purified awesome. Seeing Orcs thrown from ledges and gibbed to pieces by traps of your own design is extremely satisfying. The style of the game is funny without making it feel gimmicky. If you don't have this game, get it! Now! 8.5/10
2278	1	a	A pretty fun game for some lazy hours after work, but gets boring quiet fast. I recommend buying it only with a good discount - but nevertheless i d recommend the game.
2280	1	a	If it's on sale it's 100% worth to buy it. If not it's better to wait it out.
2282	1	a	Nothing like a mass slaughtering of Orcs to make ones day complete.  Place 'tower' like defences and create 'kill boxes' to slaughter orcs by the hundreds. And pick off the survivors with a crosbow or polearm. Or go for the straightforward approach and slaughter them by hand.  In my opinion, this is possibly the best title for its genre I have seen yet.
2284	1	a	A tower defense game like no other.
2286	1	a	This is a great game. Lots of humour and really well thought out gameplay. The lack of multiplayer is a shame though since it would really fit well.
2288	1	a	I really recommend this game to everybody. Lots of fun comments from the young hero and wild ways to kill orcs :-)
2290	1	a	Challenging, fun, addictive.  Also: Full ragdoll physics on hordes of exploding/crumpling/gibbing/squashing orcs. Enough said.
2292	1	a	Not a bad purchase, though I definitely recommend waiting for a sale rather than paying the full $15. It's a fun action-meets-tower-defense game, but it's also very repetetive. The humor is great (the Orcs have tons of bizarre lines they yell, and your hero's victory dances are awesome), but the gameplay gets old kind of fast. I really enjoy playing it in short bursts.
2294	1	a	simple and easy to get fun
2296	1	a	While I have a review on record for OMD2 I thought I should come back and write a review for the original. Awesome game that should be played (before 2 if you are ok with single player), doesnt have the multiplayer you would now expect, but for frcks sake is it fun. My hours don't reflect actual playtime, but 984 hours on the second one. The first 2 are just that good.
2298	1	a	this game is really good for people who like violence . But really frustrating when you die or lose.
2300	1	a	If you want to have fun while being challenged in a tower defense type of game OMD suits your needs. Keep in mind that this game doesn't has CO-OP. If I had to give it a score 7.5/10 will be my rate.
2302	1	a	this game is just straight up fun. so many interesting ways to kill the orcs who must die! 
2304	1	a	Very fun, but I have to vote for Dungeon Defenders because it has multiplayer.
2306	1	a	funny, smooth, high strategy gameplay. Definitely a game who wants to relieve some stress and have a laugh doing it
2308	1	a	Entertaining game that indulges your creativity and capacity for violence. But in a non-alarming kind of way.  Heh.
2310	1	a	Orcs Must Die is one of the best Tower Defense games, I've played, to date. Being a huge fan of MOBA (ARTS) &amp; Tower Defense games; I looked at Orcs Must Die with some glittering hope. The combat looked good, the adventure seemed fun, and everything seemed to work together.....  Boy was I dissapointed when I learned that I bought Dungeon Defenders first. Not that Dungeon Defenders was bad, or even not on par with this game; they're just two different experiences. DD is a multi-player TD game designed to challenge you in a completely different fashion.   On the other hand, Orcs Must Die is a single player game challenging you to work within game mechanics and limitations of resources to build the best killling machine you can. It does this with ease for that matter.   The combat is viceral, allowing you to 'feel' every kill. The sword based combat could have been more refined, but each time a trap goes off, or you hit someone, you know you did and you just want that action to happen more
2312	1	a	This game is awesome lol
2314	1	a	Best kind of game genre hybrid. This game takes the mechanics of a tower defence game, and adds the excitement of fast-paced FPS gameplay into the formula to make killing orcs as satisfying as possible. And it doesn't take itself too seriously, either, leading to a fun time on every map, during every cutscene, and in every part of the grueling challenge that comes with completing the final levels on nightmare difficulty.  A dang good game that entertains and plays well.
2316	1	a	Ever felt a lil bit ticked off ? annoyed ? Just wana go on a killing-spree ?  Then this is the game to play with awesome cynisism of the story/char, and lots of orcs to kill for u in whatever way u want, the funnier the better :)
2318	1	a	Mix of first-person and tower-defense, with great traps and spells. The level designs are quite good, and it gets surprisingly hard.
2320	1	a	Interesting and new take on a rogue like tower defense, highly suggested!
2322	1	a	My friend thought this was a stupid game. Im not saying it isnt. But its a good kind of stupid.
2324	1	a	epic fights and traps
2326	1	a	setting up traps and watching orcs and their friends run into them is incredibly satisfying. there’s even some mild story that i appreciated but probably wouldn’t have missed if they’d left it out. it surprisingly doesn’t let you remap keys in game, but does support creating a text file that worked for me. also while traps and weapons / spells are in the same bar across the bottom you can’t scroll wheel from one to the other. mostly those issues didn’t get in my way though, and i’m excited to see what orcs must die 2 is like!
2328	1	a	Proactive tower defense. That's the best way I can describe this game. Lay out your traps and minions along the path to the goal, let loose the dogs of war, and out pours the horde of orcs, goblins and assorted ghoulies in droves to rush into slicing, searing, piercing and so many more ways to meet the reaper. But the traps alone won't cut it, oh no. Taking up blade, crossbow and sundry magical widgets steps our protagonist, a cocky, arrogant, sneering wiseass with an ego the size of Cleveland, delivering orcish genocide with a level of 'Lovable ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥' charm not seen since Ash Williams (Evil Dead guy), or Booster Gold. I admit, I haven't beaten it yet, it gets hard rather quickly on any setting but easy, but I'm having fun in the chances here and there I get to play.
2330	1	a	This game is an extremely fun single player Tower defense game.
2332	1	a	Stupid fun with some thinking
2334	1	a	It's super fun and has very fluid mechanics. Must try if you like tower defense type games. The first shooter aspect isn't fancy, but the variety of traps and level design gives a lot of replay value.
2336	1	a	Such a simple and fun game. Build archers non stop let them rain fire.
2338	1	a	that's pretty nice game mix beetwen td and action . if you want some relax time that's the rigth game for you !^_^
2340	1	a	A pretty little game for people what dont have time to play and just need a short game what kills the time this game is very good but for me it is too short and the maps too but its a good prize for a game like that ;)
2342	1	a	Quirky but fun little game that will give you hours and hours of orc slaughter!!!
2344	1	a	What a bargain price game.  Set traps in your castles to stop the advaning hordes of orcs. The early levels build you up nicely to show you how to use the various orc killing machines at your diposal. Very addictive. This is how a game should be done. 
2346	1	a	Awesome game!!! The story is kinda weak but the gameplay is awesome!
2348	1	a	Great balance of over the shoulder combat with trap laying, if you like games like Trenched or really just a fan of tower defense you should get it.
2350	1	a	Unbelivable fun. A third person shooter game, combined with a tower defense twist. Try this and you will be amazed.
2352	1	a	I have been missing out! Pretty fun. Worth it on sale for sure.
2354	1	a	Tower defence game with a bit of a twist. Great game all up and hours of fun.
2356	1	a	Fun and dynamic gameplay, definitely worth trying it.
2358	1	a	A piece of art: funny and well balanced, I really like to play it
2360	1	a	If you like Tower Defense type games this is for you. It's unique in that it's in 3rd person and you are included in the defense itself. It has a basic upgrade system but nothing to complain about it. Solid game great buy you won't regret it
2362	1	a	An older game that holds up well. The game with the DLC will provide several hours of entertainment. The game does not require any major time committments and can be played for less than twenty minutes at a time. At the usual sale prices, this title is strongly recommended.
2364	1	a	A great game.  Build defenses and destroy some orcs. Easy, simple and relaxing!
2366	1	a	Burn them, squish them, stab them and throw them... Killing Orcs can't get much better...
2368	1	a	It's not Tower Defense, it's trap killing Orc machine!
2370	1	a	This is a great game for some mindless action entertainment, not overly difficult but can certainly present a challenge if you are attempting to ace levels. The only nitpick I have is that some of the traps and combos are just -so much- better than anything else, that once you have these sorts of traps unlocked there's no real reason to be experimenting with other combos.
2372	1	a	Nice tower defence game. Nothing too special. But not terrible either. Still, if you like tower defence games, this is a good one.
2374	1	a	its a real fun game to play totaly good time killer
2376	1	a	This should be bought before food
122	0	a	DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!  A few things that it does it does, decently.  This game, and its successor, in my opinion, were attempting to ride the coat-tails of the highly anticipated, and much more highly refined, Dungdeon Defenders. It is a poorly coded, excessively bland, tacky, generic FPS tower defense crossover. The DLC may as well be called 'EZ-mode'.  the voice acting will grind on your nerves, the enemies are so stupid.... its indescribable. They said they would come out with some multiplayer component (i.e. WTF THE GAME YOU WERE ATTEMPTING TO COPY HAS THIS AS ITS 3rd SELLING POINT, WHY DID YOU NOT INTEGRATE IT?) that would be DLC, but saw that there was enough demand for it that they would just crank out a sequel. That is the kind of developers you are supporting by buying this game. Yes Dungeon defenders has an excess of DLC, however they are still supporting it, this game has been left in the dust less than a year after it was released. The developers should feel shame.
2378	1	a	Classic.
2380	1	a	*kills orcs and wins*  Sounds easy enough  TO BE CONTINUED 
2382	1	a	LoL! Litterally, it's funny.
2384	1	a	Finding intelligent ways to mutilate hordes of orcs in ever more brutal and bizarre ways never stops getting amusing, especially when your character is an idiot without remorse and the orcs are so unbearably adorable and comical.  It is perfect escapism. Satisfy your OCD cravings by making the perfect trap system while also satisfying your desire to cause untold mass slaughter.
2386	1	a	A fun and unique tower defense game. If you prefer single player games, this first installment is better suited to you.   8.5/10
2388	1	a	A very underrated tower defense with an action twist that keeps your attention and adrenaline flowing. The second one is better but this is a good place to start.
2390	1	a	This game is outstanding. Great gameplay, nice graphics, likeable characters, challenging missions, and a lot of replay value. Definitely worth the price, and even better it's always on sale during each Steam Sale.
2392	1	a	Still amazingly fun game, funny storyline, just awesome! You should buy it if you haven't already!
2394	1	a	I never really enjoyed playing a tower defense game, until I played Orcs Must Die! Orcs Must Die! is a third person shooter perspective of the tower defense genre, but the time to complete each wave feels faster than your typical tower defense, like Defense Grid, depending on how well you do. Also, Instead of building towers your building traps (upgradable) against waves of enemies and on top of the traps you build your also given weapons (upgradable) to fend off individual enemy types.
2396	1	a	Outstanding controls, unique style and nothing but fun. You will not regret adding this modern classic to your library.
2398	1	a	If you don't like orcs this is the game for you.
2400	1	a	Classic :)
2402	1	a	Awesome tower defense game! Loved it!
2404	1	a	9.5/10
2406	1	a	this game is a 10 out of 10 highly recamended for gammers who want somthing fun and different
2408	1	a	Combine Metal Slug, Ikari Warriors and Steam Punk into a game. You now have Gatling Gears! What a great twin stick shooter from Vangaurd Games! It's a BLAST to play! My nephew and I had so much fun, we completed the entire game in one day!  GREAT NEWS! The game no longer requires any additional DRM from EA! It plays just like any other game on Steam! SUPER NICE!  Pros +  + Local Co-Op - You and a friend can battle the evil empire from the same couch! + Colorful World - It sure is pretty and filled with vibrant color! + Visual Upgrades - Your walker not only gets stronger, the upgrades can be seen too! + Boss Battles - Each boss is dangerous and just when you think you have won... + Solid Design - Single, Multiplayer, Survival mode, lengthy campaign and a diverse menu. + Difficulty - Easy, Normal, and Hard modes cater to different skill levels. + New Game+ - Everything you have unlocked can be used again at the start of the game!  Cons -   - Visual Noise - This my ONE and ONLY problem. Not to worry! It's an EXTREMELY TINY gripe about how stunning the world is. The game looks fabulous and it is filled with tiny details. Some players might have trouble knowing where certain attacks are comming from because of how 'cluttered' the screen can get. I hate to mention this because of how much time and effort was put into creating this beautiful game.  This is a very easy choice for any one who likes video games. Spend $10 and buy this now!
2410	1	a	Gatling Gears is an excellent indie game in almost all respects and it is definitely worth the price of entry. Gatling Gears is a top down, 'two joystick' (you can move and shoot in different directions) action arcade game with very modest level-up RPG elements. The campaign is a respectable +6 hours. While the narrative is rather vapid, it's hard to notice since the action is perfectly paced and the levels are solid. The only other thing that is lacking is the number of players ready for co-op - multiplayer is essentially limited to local games only, since there is no drop-in multiplayer mode. Had this game been released in the arcades, I would have probably spent a ton of money plugging quarters into a Gatling Gears arcade machine.
2412	1	a	Great mechanics and pacing. The camera is very frustrating at time.
2414	1	a	If you're a fan of Iron Brigade / Trenched, Assault Heroes, and Sine Mora, or even old school vertical / side-scrolling shooters, you'll probably get some enjoyment out of this game. It's pretty well-polished, with some cool mech designs. Same screen co-op is a nice plus, as are the various powerups and large boss fights scattered throughout the game. Story is pretty much non-existent, but when you're blasting hundreds of dudes while dodging hundreds of their bullets, who cares??
2416	1	a	This game is really a lot of fun. While admittedly pretty simplistic, I like the cartoony graphics and it's a solid twin-stick shooter. You have an arsenal of four weapons from the start and unlimited/regenerating ammo for each - there are no weapon/ammo pickups in the game. While I like the upgrade system for your weapons, I don't understand why the upgrades are purchased with the gold bars placed through each level instead of the parts or 'gears' that you're already collecting from everything you destroy - it seems that would create more incentive to try and destroy everything (at least, as much as possible) in each level. Regardless, I still think it's an incredibly fun game, though challenging enough to not be completely mindless. I definitely recommend this to fans of twin-stick shooter action games.  Note: I've only played with keyboard/mouse so I can't speak to controller functionality.  UPDATE: The one big thing that annoys me about this game is how you can't go backwards. As you advance through the (completely linear) pathway, the camera moves to follow you so, if you miss a gold bar and walk too far ahead, you're out of luck until you play through the level again. However, I read somewhere that there are more gold bars in the game than it takes to fully upgrade your mech so it's not that big of a deal but it still delays your ability to upgrade if you miss some gold.  Something else that may be of interest to some prospective players is that there seems to be little if any replay value to the game. The entire game is very straightforward and totally linear so the only reasons I can see to play through again would be 1) to collect any gold you may have missed or 2) to try a higher difficulty setting. Of course, this depends on what type of player you are - it's feasible that you could love the rampaging shooter action so much that completing the game once just isn't enough. If you think a single play-through is kind of a ripoff, you'll probably want to wait for a sale.
2418	1	a	cool very very cool
123	0	a	In a world where Renegade Ops didn't exist, this might be a solid title, but it does, and so it's kinda lame. Being saddled with that horrible 'we're hedging our bets' proto-Origin EA account stuff that they shoved onto every possible game for a few years (which means a net hiccup can silently eat all your progress by logging you out! the saves require you to be online!) does not help a mediocre-at-best title feel any more fun.
2420	1	a	Like my god~ old school top view shooter and MAYHEM galore...Minus a few bugs this is a diamond in the rough for killing time with a friend~
2422	1	a	Nice graphics, addicting and great story. Recommended!
124	0	a	Gatling Gears would be GREAT if the game wouldn't get stuck almost constantly. You kill the enemies in a given area, and you're prohibited from moving on to another area because you can't proceed to the end of the level due to the fact no enemies are spawning. The enemies you need to kill before you can proceed with the level. You have to restart the level when this happens and play through again in hopes that the game will actually let you beat the level. But usually what happens is that I remain stuck at the exact same point or at a different point altogether.   The game just isn't playable and I've yet to find a solution to the problem.
2424	1	a	Entertaining little twin stick shooter. Passed 6 hours or so.
2426	1	a	I strongly recommend this game. Nice visuals, plays very well. If you have a partner for co-op, it's even better. However, I finished the title alone and had a really god time.
2428	1	a	Wanna blow ♥♥♥♥ up? Maybe? Well, what if you're driving a bad ♥♥♥ mech with some very destructive weapons?! Good game and easily beaten in 5 hours. Keep the XBL games coming to Steam please!
2430	1	a	An awesome shooter / bullethell game. Has everything you need. Good music, artstyle, great gameplay. Game modes are single- &amp; multiplayer, co-op online and local co-op as well as a survival mode. Control options are gamepad for leisure or WASD + mouse for extra precision.  Get it!
2432	1	a	First and foremost: THIS GAME HAS TERRIBLE DRM, courtesy of the great satan EA. It will require you to register your game using an EA account, and will require you to log in everytime you want to play. If you do play while logged in and you get signed out of EA, THE GAME WILL DROP YOU LIKE A HOT POTATO INTO THE MAIN MENU.  That having been said, it's a fun enough game. Mindless shooting galore and explosions are continuous thanks to crisp controls if you have a 360 pad. Don't expect any depth in the gameplay, even with the upgrades and whatnot. Though the story's setting seems polished enough, the game's repetitive and predictability squarely puts it into your library's 'play once and never again' category.
127	0	a	I just can't finish this. It's slow, boring and no fun at all. I think there are about 6 worlds (with several acts each) and I managed to finish 3 worlds of them. The acts are each about 15 minutes long. And it's just shooting. I can enjoy a mindless game from time to time but this is too much. Twin stick shooters are not for me I guess. The fact that you can upgrade weapons and your mech doesn't help either. It's still not incentive enough for me to keep playing.  Aaaaand... deleted.  [Rating: 67/100]
128	0	a	requires setting up an account with EA (‸ლ)
129	0	a	..and another EA activation CRAP -&gt; never played it, but instantly deleted local content, dmn.
130	0	a	Requires origins to play. Don't buy it, it's a trap!
2434	1	a	79/100
2436	1	a	A great over the top arcade shooting fest with destruction and carnage everywhere. Do you want to feel very powerful but also very close to death? then this great game is for you. It doesnt bring much new under the sun tho, but the great world its set in and the way its made makes up for that either way.
2438	1	a	Very fun twin stick shooter. Great graphics. You get to upgrade your walker throughout. Less than 4 hrs to beat, but a lot of fun. Has great co-op. Def check it out if you liked Renegade Ops...and if you haven't GO PLAY RENEGADE OPS!
2440	1	a	a simple and fun game set in a cool steampunk like world and it is very addictive  if you like greed corp you definetly gotta try this one 
2442	1	a	Intense, fast-paced and fluent shooting game.
2444	1	a	Gatling gears is a pretty solid top-down shooter, I enjoy these for some reason, pretty smooth and neat graphics, the unlockables and upgrades are kewl. It's not too long though as it can be finished in about 4 hours, it still has online coop though, well worth the sale price. 
2446	1	a	This little game is fun when it works- especially in coop, but frequent crashing and game-breaking bugs rarely allow you to play it properly. Plus, it requires an EA account, and you must be logged in with it to play online, so people less inclined to have multiple DRMs tacked on like cancerous growth on good games will probably find it annoying.  All in all, you should probably wait for a MASSIVE discount before trying this one.
2448	1	a	This game is ridiculously enjoyable.
131	0	a	I'm seriously dissapointed.  Expected a lot more than just a console port with no story at all - unless you count oneliners on pictures after each chapter. Oh, and don't hold your hopes up for pictures either - you get one per chapter &gt;.&lt;  It's good for instant fun, but gets tedious after a short while. Feels more like a chore than a game.  Also, needing to have EA Something account (Origin, or whatever they decided to call it this year) and needlessly long activation process is an additional minus - like this game needs any more.  Upgrade system is very basic, on 90's level, and doesn't even provide info on upgraded parts other than 'more damage'/'more health'.  Unless you really wanted to play this and waited for the game like I did, avoid it like a bad joke.  If a friend gifted it to you thinking he's doing a good deed, buy him a drink and forgive his foolishnes.
2450	1	a	Repetitive shooting yet fun
2452	1	a	Sequels are a funny thing. When a game is good-but-not-quite-great, we see the smallest solutions to itty bitty flaws, a few things that could have been spectacular given just a little more spit-shined development time. Yet those few tiny tweaks typically aren't enough to regenerate interest, never mind entertain for hours on end, when a sequel turns up. It' almost as if that game had its chance, and now we expect more, more, more.  Shank 2 doesn't reinvent itself in the slightest, which is why, more than most sequels, it's difficult not to compare it to the original. Developer Klei used past criticisms to patch its pants and glue its building blocks together. It shuffles its pieces around, finds better places for them to fit, and defies the idea that overhauling a flawed experience is absolutely necessary.  The result is, of course, a better 2D brawler, the kind most wished it would have been the first time around -- and it'll absolutely turn your Shank crank again.  Shank 2 addresses flaws Klei is acutely aware of, so it practically shouts about how much better it is now than it used to be. Main character Shank dodges with an effortless flick of the right stick, which is a massive step up from the clunky trigger/stick combo from the first game.  Attacking and healing aren't tied to the same button as they were previously. Where the animation system used to inhibit Shank, it now enables him: He moves faster, pounces farther and higher, and can switch between weapons mid-combo without a split-second delay signing his death certificate. In addition, exclamation marks above enemies' heads act as an instant-death counter-kill indicator, which is massively helpful for plucking particularly troublesome guys from a group. Also, disarming and executing dudes is quick enough not to break your rhythm, but slow enough to glorify the grossness of kicking a baseball bat down someone's throat. Uninterrupted murder is a beautiful blend of graceful fluidity and harsh ferocity, and few melee-centric action games achieve this kind of big-combo bliss.  The combat is improved for more than basic input reasons, too. Enemies attack in different ways from various places -- dudes chuck grenades from across the screen, careful shooters take precise pistol aim from above, and maniacal machine-gunners fire bursts in your general direction. Instant-kill pits make short work of bad guys (and you) too, and throwing switches to crush five guys beneath a shipping container is sickening fun. Each encounter is an unpredictable puzzle where evasion, aggression, and an impressive array of acrobatics earn you a personal accomplishment greater than any leaderboard high score.  Juggling and switching from your quick-attack shanks to a heavy sledgehammer to the shotgun aren't just cool-looking tactics -- they're completely necessary to surviving. By comparison, the first game is slow, unsatisfying, and cumbersome. (Really, you can never go back.) Shank 2 is demanding, and in a 2D action game so reliant on player precision, these simple tweaks make your life a hell of a lot easier.  Even the most difficult problems in Shank 2 have easy solutions. More importantly, its harshest conditions can't come close to the maddening challenge of its predecessor. This is perhaps the best step forward -- the first Shank had some ridiculously difficult spots. In Shank 2, you'll only bash your head against the occasional brick wall as long as you let it stand. When shotgun blasts or the scythe aren't doing enough damage to certain characters, swapping to the revolver or chainsaw is usually enough to take 'em down. Main character Shank no longer switches weapons on the fly during a level, though, and must instead trade gear between deaths. It's small inconvenience, but knowing weapon properties -- bonus damage against fat enemies or a knock-back effect, for instance -- and changing your strategy accordingly is the key to powering through tougher sections. Boss battles are a particularly great example of these and the rest of Shank's greatest design elements coming together. As bosses are meant to be, they're the final exam for everything you've learned along the way -- if you didn't pick up on and make use of something new and important, you're going to have a tough time with their interesting patterns and brutal attacks.  Co-op would have made the campaign a cakewalk, which is perhaps the reason it's single-player only this time around. Shank 2 trades the first title's local cooperative campaign for wave-based online multiplayer. It's both a trade-up and a trade-down. Clobbering coordinated bombers before they blow up supply caches for 30 waves involves all the single-player's best Shank-isms -- two players use the terrific combat, mount weapons, and set off traps to eviscerate and burn bad guys -- and requires serious skill. Dying doubles your ally's duties, plus they're responsible for reviving you, so bring a coordinated comrade or suffer the consequences.  Earning cash for kills to buy mini-guns, turrets, decoys, and, uh, a wild boar gives you a reason to seek out incoming enemies as well, rather than just let your buddy take care of the worst situations. There's an alluring draw to replaying the three maps with new characters, too -- each has his or her own statistics, like health bonuses, item discounts, or damage modifiers, and each match plays out differently based on how you experiment with various pairs. Survival Mode feels thrown in out of obligation rather than inspiration, yet it still brings enough new to the table that it'll melt away an hour in an instant.  Survival Mode is probably where most will spend the majority of their time -- Shank 2 is only a couple hours long, and there's little incentive to replay the campaign. Granted, the single-player is flashy, gorgeous, and where the coolest stuff happens, like escaping giant boulders and buzz-saws, fighting through a burning village, or exploring a massive boat with a bunch of diverging paths. Survival Mode is missing distinctive qualities to call its own, so it exists if you feel shortchanged but is inessential if you'd rather move onto the next great game in your library.  If there's one major change in Shank 2, it's the tone. Thematically, Shank was absurd. The game was dark and violent, which didn't quite fit in with the Luchadores, strippers, guys in gimp masks occupying each arena. Shank 2 is about martial law, facist oppression, and endangered family. It doesn't do anything to capitalize on this stuff, which is a shame -- the cinematics are still goofy, profane, and senseless, and some of the bosses are a bit out of left field, visually. The grim approach a nice touch to the gameplay, anyway, and fits into the grand scheme of making Shank 2 feel much more in line with itself.
2454	1	a	Very good oldschool beat 'em up.  I like first Shank much more, but sequel is still a good game. I only wish it was little bit longer...  Or there was Shank 3 ;)
2456	1	a	 Shank 2 is a 2D side-scrolling action beat 'em up published by the hated Electronic Arts. The developers, however, are known for making great games such as 'Mark of The Ninja' and 'Don't Starve'.
2458	1	a	Shank 2 stays safely in the bounds of a typical side-scrolling action title. It never takes any chances but delivers an overall solid beat ‘em up. Inconsistent difficulty, nonexistent story and a lack of gameplay variety hold Shank 2 back, but those looking for a better playing experience from Shank’s last outing might want to give the sequel a try.
2460	1	a	  “When you're pushed, killing is as easy as breathing.    Shank 2 represents a solid 2-D brawler game with good fighting animations, mixing the grittiness of graphic novels with a cartoonish look. Compared with its predecessor the combat feels more fluid, and the difficulty has been increased. Especially the boss battles and co-op levels are more challenging.  On the other hand, the storytelling in Shank 2 is rather weak. It remains questionable why the developers did not continue the entertaining storyline from the first instalment.

2462	1	a	Alright so you can definitely tell that this developer has matured since Shank 1. The animations are more fluid, the music and gameplay are better. I think its about the same length as the first game. It's also slightly harder.  The enemies and situations are more varied, requiring different styles and moves to finish each level. The boss battles are also more varied and nicer to play. One problem I have is that the story doesnt seem to connect at all to the first one, I dont even know what the hell is happening between both games. Oh well whatever.  Overall I think its a great game. Especially with the addition of the survival mode, that adds extra replay value. This can also be played local or online.
2464	1	a	Like the sequel Shank 2 is a cheesy 2D platformer &amp; beat'em up game that plays in Mexico. It has it's own graphic style. There's a little bit gore and brutal scenes especially on the boss kills. You start with 3 different weapon classes, melee = chainsaw (yeah!) double pistols (akimbo style, you can fly during shooting in the air because of recoil wtf?) and 2 daggers to pounce on enemies. Somehow the movements and controls are a little bit clunky. There are still lags even on high end systems.  They added lately some MP gamemode Survival which means you have to survive in a certain map with applicable traps &amp; buy equipment mode 30 waves. There are even zombie waves. Strangely if you play over internet it gets at some point dissynchronized. So if you are protecting your armory piles some Goonies can blastup another one than on your teammate map. That's unacceptable and makes it either incredible hard to survive 30 waves.  Good is that you can unlock many new charcters. My favourite is Sunshine dressed like the girl from KillBill with a longsword and desert eagles. The main game suffers from repetive enemies and a quite flat boring story.Though you can do some counterattacks the gameplay hasn't really changed. The hard mode still exists. So you can play story mode at least twice ...
2466	1	a	Well, it is immediately noticeable that Shank 2 ups the ante in every which way. It is more fast-paced than its predecessor, it is more violent - once again the bosses get the goriest executions. Gameplay-wise not much has changed - perhaps now there's more emphasis on countering enemy moves (a small, red exclamation mark indicates an incoming attack). Also, I decided to keep the sledgehammer and bid farewell to the chainsaw.  We can now throw molotov cocktails and use mines as traps. One particular thing I liked is the way the game wants us to use the environment against enemies. Cars can be dropped in the garage, hanging sharks can be used to slap enemies at the docks and there are several places where machines can be turned on to lay waste to the oncoming hordes of the militia.  Oh, the militia: don't expect a great story here, either. Shank just wants to go home but after the fall of Cesar a so-called General Magnus took control with the use of his soldiers. Since Shank's mentor is captured by the enemy, once again he becomes enraged and we can see his revenge story through just like we did the last time.  Although there are fewer levels than in its predecessor these look more varied and the drawing is excellent just as it was the last time. I particularly like those scenes where the foreground is deliberately barely lit so we only see the shadows / silhouettes of Shank and his enemies. Levels end in boss battles and as always they are pretty challenging. At one point we control Corina, Shank's aid, who seems to be faster, more acrobatic, but weaker. Also, her scythe has a better range than Shank's chainsaw.  Shank 2 continues to be a very good side-scroller, brawler game. There's a greater variety of enemies and with countering / evading there's more maneuverability here. The camera now shows a smaller Shank - this more zoomed-out approach helps with the flow of the combat and makes this action-packed game heaps of fun.
2468	1	a	Shank 2 brings back good memories about side-scrolling action on NES and Sega Genesis. Pros: - Great cartoon graphics; - High dynamic fights; - Co-op survival mode. Cons: - Short storyline. P.S. For best experience play with a controller.
2470	1	a	Shank 2 is a pretty gruesome and awesome 2D side scrolling hack and slash beat 'em up action adventure game.At first it felt pretty basic gameplay with your weapons as a pair of shanks,a gun and a heavy weapon which were sometimes overpowering in normal mode,but in hard difficulty the enemies were smart and thier was a large variety of them.A good indie game but the best and most enjoyable part of the game was it's survival mode!You are gonna absolutely enjoy it with a buddy and it is quite challenging.Just make sure you get a partner for survival because their is no proper matchmaking.
2472	1	a	Awesome slasher! I loved the 1'st game, and the sequel is even better. Very relaxing game to play for me. Score: 9/10
2474	1	a	'art game' excellent choice for comic fans . disadvantage short story and different gameplay from the first game
2476	1	a	i like this game it is hard but very fun
2478	1	a	[STORY] ✮✮✰✰✰ [GAMEPLAY] ✮✮✮✰✰ [REPLAYABILITY] ✮✮✰✰✰ [GAMEPLAY HOURS] 3+  'After defeating Caesar, the villain from the first game, Shank 2 lands the player in Shank's homeland. Shank quickly discovers that several militant factions have ravaged the land in attempts to gain superiority. The new cartel leader, Magnus, gains control and seeks to destroy the remaining rebellious forces.  Shank 2 contains the same bloody comic art style of the original, but adds more depth into its combat system. Shank now has the ability to use a multitude of grapple moves and more importantly, a new countermove which redirects enemy attacks. Instead of the cooperative mode from the first game, Shank 2 features a 2-player survival mode where players fights hordes of various enemy types while defending key points.  With an assortment of weapons and the addition of a survival mode, Shank 2 is another short, but sweet beat 'em up.'
2480	1	a	Game is nice .. but KB/mouse controls ruined the gameplay .. character follow mouse even for slash attacks .. which totally ruin the experience because many time cursor is not visible .. not get it if u dont have and xbox controller !!
2482	1	a	Shank 2 is a game I managed to play alittle bit while it was on free weekend, an I have got to say its pretty enjoyable. The Shank games are a blend of hack and slash, platformer and arcade beat'em up. You fight trough the story with a variety of weapons trying to chain together the longest combo you can. Shank 2 has more weapons and tools to use in combat than the first game including things like pipes, baseball bats, mines and even Molotov cocktails. The gameplay itself is pretty much the same as Shank, but everything feels far more refined and the combat 'works' better.   Overall I wish I could have put more details in my review, but I only got to play Shank 2 around 2 hours before the free weekend was up. I would recommend it to sidescroller, beat'em up, or hack and slash fans based on what I did manage to play.
2484	1	a	First person gameplay 100% fun  Survival Mode hard to find players - have to wait long time 7/10
2486	1	a	Shank 2's ~5 hours of brutal action will remind you why you loved Shank.   As usual, the story is something that you won't bother following, but we now have more weapons and new mechanics to kill enemies. Always a good thing. Other than that the Shank 2 is an exact copy of the Shank in terms of gameplay.  Also, the nasty Mac OS bugs from Shank are fixed, so there's nothing that can get you frustrated.
2488	1	a	Beat em' up created by Klei. This thing is some serious thing full of murder, brutality and alcohol. Yes, alcohol. In fact, it acts like medkits. The graphic and animations are beautiful, just pure perfection. And even my wooden PC is able to run it on full graphics!  Pros: - Perform long and very brutal combos; - Amazing graphics; - Hard to beat even on normal; - Bloody executions; - Healing alcohol!; - Coop mode to make sick combos together!  Cons: - Hard to play on keyboard; - Some enemies can ber very annoying; - Not for casuals. Hardcores, be warned.
2490	1	a	Shank 2 is 10X better than the original Shank. With improved gameplay and proper PC controls I can recommend Shank 2, unlike the first one. This game is just as short as the original clocking in ~3 hours, however there is an added survival mode to add some replayability. Most of the game is pretty mindless bashing and shooting up enemies where you actually feel like a bad-♥♥♥, however there are couple of frustrating parts. Hint: There's a part when a rocket launcher shoots at you, you can shoot down the rockets, and when you fight a certain doctor use the shotgun!
2492	1	a	Amazing game + need players to play with.. in survival mode
2494	1	a	Well its a quite fun game, lot of improvements and stuff face to shank 1, but i dont know how i did have more fun with shank 1 than this one... plus id rather a co op campaign than co op survival mode.
2496	1	a	If you're playing Shank 2, you more than likely played the first before it and thought 'holy crap this is a really cool cheesy game' and you're right it was. Shank 2 is just more of the same, just with a different setting, a few improved features, and not much else.  Now, more of the same isn't a huge problem, but in its haste to do better than the original it missed a few key points. For starters, while the original game's plot is basically Kill Bill only with a badass mexican dude, it felt structured as if there's a direction and application to the titular hero's badass anger management sessions. Shank was all about revenge, but not really in the way you first expect. It's not shocking, but every set piece and level felt like a step closer to your goal as you eliminated each threat one after the other. Shank 2 is just 'Shank is going to visit his home town, ♥♥♥♥ happens, Shank doesn't care but kills things anyways' so it's less progression and more absentminded wandering around the country until Shank shanks the right people. While from the beginning it's clear the goal is to rescue the woman who ran Shank's orphanage, there's really no direction to that point. Shank just runs from location to location being Shank until things happen. Even worse, because Shank follows this narritive structure, every boss battle becomes 'Shank meets and kills people who get in his way.' Sadly this also extends to the final battle where Shank fights someone who - again - mirrors his attack patterns, except rather than be the guy who taught him these things, you fight someone who just attacks recklessly and is defeated by dodging his attacks until he blows himself up on his own explosives. Honestly it's really hard to follow up from the last game's final boss.  As you noticed I haven't really talked about the gameplay yet. Well, it's because, like I said, it's more of the same. There's less demand for Shank's signature flying tackle move but fighting is incredibly fluid and combo heavy, there's also many items to pick up and use to make use of every combat. Really the strong selling point to this game however is the various new enemy types. While you still fight the endless same-faced melee and gun mooks, you also get to play footsies with larger enemies, fat guys, women, and small guys, each with their own style of combat. So while it is more of the same, it doesn't feel stale. Co-Op has been incorporated into an all new Survival mode, which plays pretty well and is a good way to test your fighting skills though there is no Co-op campaign this time around.  So Shank 2 still is a solid game, but it's a solid meh kind of game. The flashy straight to DVD Shank compared to the original worldwide release Shank. If you liked the original or you just like beat-em-ups, you'll probably like this but don't expect to remember it a few weeks later. Game's been out long enough too that it sells for pretty cheap to boot.
2498	1	a	Good and kind game )
2500	1	a	Shank 2 is a great sequel and in my opinion, better than the first game in basically every way.   The visuals are definitely an improvement over the first game, and one of the very first things I noticed was the larger variety in locations you visited. The first game suffered a bit from repetitive areas that didn't change very much, but in 2 you're always fighting in a different area from level to level which is a nice addition.   Another improvement is the weapon variety. You still have the signature weapons Shank uses in the first game, but there is a lot more to choose from this time around, and also you're able to pick up quite a few weapons that the enemies drop for a limited amount of uses until they break and they usually do fairly good damage. You can also change weapon loadouts in the middle of playing which is extremely useful, especially when you're on a boss fight and you don't have the optimal weapons equipped to do the most amount of damage.  Everything else in the game is quite similar with not much change. There are quite a few boss fights which are all fun and some are fairly challenging, especially when other enemies come out to join the fight. My only complaint of the game would probably be the length. It seems to be shorter than the first game, but it could be because I didn't die as often as I did in the first game. It's an action packed few hours, but it's a minor gripe. I didn't get to the play the multiplayer section of the game, but it would definitely add more replay value to make up for the shorter single player campaign.  Overall, definitely worth the money if you're into the genre.
2502	1	a	This game is like the dark souls of side-scrollers its balls hard but when you finish a level such joy fills you like you won a milion dollars 9/10
2504	1	a	Really fun game! I love the 2-D element of it. It feels like a flashback, like something I played during my childhood. The speed of the game makes it even more enjoyable.
2506	1	a	THE ONLY GAME these days that allow u proper carnage cartoon violence.. everything these days are rpg-ish.. mysterious and stealthy or Call of Duty (too political and realistic for my taste) .. its good to have good old cartoon violence again. There needs to be more of those games.. all games these days are dull.. this game makes me smile :D

2510	1	a	Klei disappointed me with Shank, so I didn't purchase its sequel until it was part of a bundle. Thankfully, Shank 2 improves in nearly every aspect from the original, resulting in some good, mindless platforming action. This game is much different than the type of platformer that requires thinking and precision (a la Giana Sisters or Rayman), and instead focuses on combat, dodging and counters. While I still prefer the thoughtful gameplay of the aforementioned platformers, or even Klei's other game Mark of the Ninja, I enjoyed my time with Shank 2 and loved experimenting with different skill sets and weapons. The story was laughable but inoffensive... for the most part, and the visuals matched the nonsense going on in the story.
2512	1	a	A High Impact, Violent, Intense story with amazing graphics and fun side-scrolling gameplay.  Would buy.
2514	1	a	A bit like a stylized Metal Slug, but with more customization and grappling-style combat. The boss fights can be a bit over-reliant on dodging and rolling, but it's a pretty sweet game overall.
2516	1	a	Single-player is a blast. Beat it on Normal, and then beat it on Hard. THEN, beat the survival mode by yourself. Oh how I love this game. I AM a glutton for punishment, however.
2518	1	a	first game was really nice piece of fresh air for me in gaming, i was blown away with spaghetti western revenge theme and atmosphere, anti-hero and bunch of similar things.... i also highly recommend this second instalement in the series but in my opinion it is too identical to the first game. i assume i would be equaly amused with it as i was when i played shank for the first time, but to me it seems like some extra levels for the first game, it really does not add anything to feel like new game. i found nothing new in sp part but challenges are fun to play with friends i guess.
2520	1	a	I recoomend you to buy this game ONLY if you like what you see. If you're a fan of Action Platformer game you will enjoy this game, but if not...
2522	1	a	Shank 2 is a spiritual journey. I can't say that a whole lot of video games had made me cry, but Shank 2 is one of the few that managed to pluck all the right emotional strings. This is what they mean when they talk about 'emotional games', 'focus on storytelling', 'superb character development', 'a tour-de-force'. I fell in love with the shakespearian dialogue, the witty comebacks of the sidekick -- which serve the purpose of, like Sancho Panza in Cervantes' masterpiece, Don Quixote, giving the player a stark contrast to the grim, serious, philosophical nature and theme of this game, and ultimately remind the players of our own humanity. Planescape: Torment doesn't hold a candle to Shank 2.  Every one who likes amazingly-written stories, top-notch gameplay and are willing to have a game touch their hearts in a way no other game has done before owe themselves a go at Shank 2. You won't regret it. Also, this is Steam, people buy games just because they feel like it.
2524	1	a	You can drink as much as you want and never get drunk.
2526	1	a	Shank 2 - Incredibly addictive, beat-em-up brawler, it's amazing. Definitely worth the price-tag, frequently on sale, recommend picking up a copy, however what Shank lacks in terms of Missions, it excells in Character progression and combat-combo varied fighting styles, it's quite basic, however You shall never stop playing! 8/10
2528	1	a	a great co-op game great desings
2530	1	a	A ton of button mashing if that's your thing. A decent game.  6/10 just alright. Get it dirt cheap only.
2532	1	a	this is the most EPIC game EVER u are need to play this ♥♥♥♥ING GOOD game if u never play this befor so PLAY IT THIS IS ♥♥♥♥ING AWSOME  nice to talk and this is 1 of the most bast epic awsome game EVER I PLAYED BEFOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!     PLAY THIS ♥♥♥♥!
2534	1	a	In Shank (1) you could only shank one guy, thus why it was just called 'Shank', singular. It was a good fight and I enjoyed shanking that guy, but I always felt as if more could be done with the concept. It seems that I was not alone.  In Shank 2 you can can shank two different people for a total of two shanks. That's *twice* the number of shanks that you got to perform in the first game, which is a significant improvement if you're the number crunching type (and I am). I know that they say that quantity should be subservient to quality (i.e. was Aliens better than Alien just because it added an 's' to the title? I'll leave that for you to decide, but the answer is yes), but for my money I'd rather get to enjoy shanking two different guys over just shanking one*, and I think both the developers and you will agree.  Shank 2 delivers.  *It's possible to replay the game on two higher difficulties, giving you a total of *six* possible shanks. I don't know why you're still reading this and not clicking the buy button so you can start shanking the first guy already.
2536	1	a	Only played the 1st level so far, it was FREE for the weekend, and I flipping LOVED it.
2538	1	a	It has better graphics than shank 1. Short but good slash game.
2540	1	a	This is a very good game i recomend it
2542	1	a	Shank 2 fast game with modern day graphics with easy controls that moves from location A to B to C and so on,  good amount of action and special effects  good game.  Free Weekend 11-12-2015 to 11-15-2015 
2544	1	a	More of the first really, a high octain mash-em-up of a game. The story in this one is more like Collatoral damage of Taken 2 where you should know not to mess with someone who just tore your troops apart like mere tissue paper and killed one of your generals in a horrific way.  Really, Shank was just fine, drinking booze on the bus and if you left him alone nothing would happen. To quote spoony: 'But oh no. You had to come down and shake his ♥♥♥♥ing tree and now he's ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off and going to come after you' which is the basic plot of the story, plus for a single level you get to be a different character and switing weapons is done in a in-game menu whilst paused which is so much easier.  Only real downside is I feel sick that it had to be related to EA. Eitherway, if you liked the first you'll love this and if you didn't like the first. Well, things have improved and controls are less confusing and better made for PC use but generally I'd say only buy if on a sale.

2548	1	a	in stab 2 u play as jeremy from pure ownage and you go around beating noobs
2550	1	a	awseome story.. but KB/mouse controls ruined the gameplay
2552	1	a	This game is awesome. Test yourself to see if you like it. One point for every question you answer with yes: Do you like 2d scrollers? Do you like monstrous combo moves? Do you like a good story?  1. You may or may like this 2. You will probably like this 3. You need this game 4+ Stop cheating. This is why we can't have nice things!
2554	1	a	I expected a prison simulator, 0/10
2556	1	a	I love this game, and the survival mode is really fun too
2558	1	a	One of my best game ever i played !!!
2560	1	a	It reminds me of metal slug.. anyone? No? Just me? Maybe my Dad?
2562	1	a	A heavily under-rated sidescrolling action platformer. Its similar to the first Shank, although more complex. The combat system has changed a little, new weapons, new moves. Lots of welcome new additions to story mode, a co-op survival mode, everything that made the first game great plus loads more. Definately recommended.
2564	1	a	Fast, responsive, quick, deadly  SHANK 2 M O T H E R ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ E R
2566	1	a	hack 'n slash fun for the whole family.
2568	1	a	awseome story , the drawing , recommended to 2d platformer fans
2570	1	a	Its a hand drawn 2-D sidescrolling shooter, it doesnt try to be anything it isnt, the story is simply a backdrop to you smacking people with chainsaws, machetes, and sledgehammers. It wont win an emmy, but the art and combat system should (though be warned, it is build for a controller, its not impossible to use a mouse and keyboard by any means, but its also not as easy) Shank and the other playable character (only playable in one campain mission, but is accessible as a coop partner) have a good number of nice, hand drawn outfits, which sounds simple but every single animation had to be redrawn for them to have these, so i think thats fairly impressive.   The story consists of 8 levels, it is fairly short and as said in the summary, isnt emmy material but it gives you an excuse to hurt the bad guys.   Shank has 3 melee weapons, 3 ranged weapons, and alot of outfits. The coop character has 2 melee and 2 ranged   The gameplay is best described as a twitch beat em up, you will have to dodge and click buttons at the right times and with some precision in order to look like a badass and not get hit. Its hard to learn but once you do manage to get the rhythm down, you feel like a badass with animations that seem to be built for those times when you stab a guy, throw him into another before leaping over them with a shotgun.   Get it on sale if you like twitch-beat em up style games!
2572	1	a	♥♥♥♥ YES THIS GAME IS DA BEST, YOU CAN ♥♥♥♥ING CUT ♥♥♥♥'S TO PIECES, WHAT'S BETTER THAN LETTING OUT ALL YOUR ANGER AT RANDOM ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S!!!!!!!!
2574	1	a	This game is extremely fun but the survival mode is damn near impossible alone.
2576	1	a	A bit easier than the 1st game. But it's still a great experience. Brings back the good old beat'em up feelings we all enjoyed in the past.
2578	1	a	Shank 2 is, much like the original, an enjoyable 2D side-scrolling beat 'em up. While the game offers nothing new, it's vastly better than its predecessor. Unlike the original, the campaign is singleplayer only. Instead, they've added a new co-op survival mode. This is actually quite fun and a worthy addition to the game.  The combat, graphics, controls and overall experience are all a fair bit ahead of the original Shank. Most of the flaws it shipped with are not there in the sequel, except for one: Monotonicity. It's still really straightforward, with little variation.  From start to finish: hordes of enemies which just fail to become interesting. It's a dull roller coaster heading towards a boss battle at the end of the level. These generally are enjoyable, fairly challenging and well designed fights.  You can, however, fight the lack of variation by becoming a varied fighter yourself. Some achievements are in place to encourage you to make more stylish kills, it's just not enough to make the game really stand from the crowd. Regardless, it's fun - just not that great.  + Good boss battles + Much better than the original, in every way + Survival mode in co-op is a lot of fun  - Very straightforward - Little variation - A little short   6/10
2580	1	a	Such a nice game!Gotta commend this game to my friend!Give the game creater a medal!
2582	1	a	Don't make me shank a ♥♥♥♥♥, twice.
2584	1	a	This game is for crooks who like killing and intense blood!! i am one out of them  9/10!!
2586	1	a	Pretty good combat, challenging at times, or at least until you get a hang of it, multiple weapons. The story was pretty short, or at least I felt like it was over pretty quickly. Shank as a character is quite predictable, so expect no complex plot. I actually expected a bit more from coop, but overall a good game.
2588	1	a	  7.5/10 TJBs
2590	1	a	A bit easier than the 1st game. But it's still a great experience. Brings back the good old beat'em up feelings we all enjoyed in the past.
2592	1	a	If you want to see the gameplay of it here it is on my channel:          YouTube™ Video:  BLOODY AS F#CK! | SHANK 2 | PC/OSX Gameplay&nbsp;
2594	1	a	Great game for when you have nothing else 2 do! 
2596	1	a	♥♥♥♥ this game. Too hard for me. Replaying segments over and over in just the first level just pisses me off.  If you like this kind of thing go for it.
2598	1	a	Once again, ignore the plot, focus on the blood.
2600	1	a	Shank 2 is agreat arcade feeling game with some great art and detailed mechanics.  8/10 -1 some textures arnt 1080p -1 canr see tones of replay value
2602	1	a	The is the ♥♥♥♥. Fast, funny, hard to master but not insane. If it weren't for this game I would have had a really bad week in the hospital ( don't ask ), but with this and some pain killers it wasen't so bad. Blody cartoon action hero to the rescue !
2604	1	a	Samurai Jack Directed by Quentin Tarantino and written by Robert Rodriguez
2606	1	a	9/10, a great action hack n slash brawler game!  + Graphicstyle + Story, well, kinda. + Many playable and unlockable characters OK: only 6 different main weapons to choose from - Hard to find players to complete achievement requirements with - Only playable either alone or with just one friend
2608	1	a	Note: If you dont own the first Shank game , go buy it now !  *All negative reviews refers to the dissapointment ofrom teh seqel . Combat system: Pros: Pickups, + new weapons and throwables. Cons: No gourd, missing weapons. Charecters: Pros: More charecters with uniqe abilities+ female charecters.  I would really like to NOT recommend this game , Why? Because there is NO co op campgain !!! But you still get a co-op survival mode though , overall shank is an alltime favorite of mine so how could I dislike it? Shank 2 is awesome ! great game fluent gameplay , Fun as hell ! one of THE BEST 2D SIDE SCROLLING BRAWLERyou'll ever encounter. But still If you dont own the first Shank game, go buy shank 1 Its better in my opinion , and then come back for some more ! (shank2)
2610	1	a	help how do i beat this fu.cking boss cyclops i cant kill him he is the most hardest boss iv seen and iv seen alot of bosses example god of war on psp pls help
2612	1	a	Youth will be inspired to do great things after experiencing this wonderful game.

2616	1	a	  It's really good!
2618	1	a	There I was in the prison shower bubbles flowing down men like tears from an angels face. I reach far up inbetween the walls of my ♥♥♥♥ can grab my lucky shank I fashioned from my left toes right pinkie toes nail and turn to the guy on my left. I smell him violently and stab him in the bridge of his nose he screams in pain, 'F%&amp;@ I GOT SHANKED IN MY NOSE F&amp;%* YOU FA%&amp;*@ HOLY F%*&amp;.' 'Rage much?' I ask to the dead fa*%^@ (♥♥♥♥♥♥) and people proceed to swarm me with ears of corn so I immedietly pee and poop on the floor. 10/10 best game of the year. 
2620	1	a	Totally awesome side scroller game. Very fun and always something new to find. It will keep you entertained for hours!
2622	1	a	Even more stabby than the original.
2624	1	a	Awesome game, i enjoyed the first one very much, so it was a no brainer to get this one. Visually it looks better, the art style is still the same as the first but more refined. The single player campaign is cool, but not very long. In my opinion the single player was just enough, because the Survival mode co-op is tonnes of fun.   Highly recommended and if you get it during a steam sale then its a win, win.   Make Shank 3!  10/10
2626	1	a	wow  very action  much stab  so wow  much addictive   10/10
2628	1	a	Cool.
2630	1	a	A warning to parents who might want to watch this with small children...don't! I downloaded this movie for family movie night to watch with our 7-year-old son, 11-year old daughter, my wife, and I. Overall, the plot of the movie was engaging, but it is definitely NOT kid-friendly! There were several adult scenes during which we had to fast-forward through.
2632	1	a	One of the greatest 2D games to be used with a controller
2634	1	a	Got shanked. Don't want to get shanked again. 7/10
2636	1	a	Improvement in every aspect over Shank 1. Extremely fun to play, purchase recommended.
2638	1	a	Totally awesome side scroller game. Very fun and always something new to find. It will keep you entertained for hours!
2640	1	a	So much blood.
2642	1	a	Even more stabby than the original.
2644	1	a	The art style and gameplay is just amazing. I love it so far, very action-packed, good platformer. Good job Klei!
2646	1	a	seems like the makers took a good amount of time on this..like the game luv the audio the characters have alot of character.and its a good challenge but not to hard to figure out,thats what kept me coming back to play. There might have been a few babies who say its too hard but its really just a good challenge. you pick up new weapons to use over and over and even change shanks looks in campain, or play survival multiplayer.there is gore and language.
2648	1	a	Great side scrolling beat 'em up. Took about 4 hours the first time through with plenty of unlockables/characters for replayability.
2650	1	a	It's great.... for 3 hours.
2652	1	a	Really fun game, although it did make me rip out my ♥♥♥♥ing hair. 8/10 good but really ♥♥♥♥ing annoying
2654	1	a	If you like beat-em up games with a tequila-drinking, chainsaw- and shotgun-wielding man who can rip shark jaws wide open with his bare hands, whose main weapons are the name of the game, then you'll probably like this one.  &lt;Minor Spoiler&gt; The campaign is a rather shallow story about stopping a dictator, who kidnaps the most mother-like person that the main character has. &lt;/Minor Spoiler&gt;  However, the splitscreen couch co-op survival mode that follows is great! It contains 30 waves of increasingly difficult enemies, which are incredibly hard to beat towards the end. Two controllers are recommended for this.  + Works well with controllers (Tested with Logitech F710) + Great fighting moves + Challenging (and beatable) splitscreen co-op survival mode + Very responsive controls  - Works not so well with keyboard and mouse, since meleé attacks are directed towards the cursor. - A few minor bugs
2656	1	a	Even better than the first one
2658	1	a	Better than the first part in every aspect
2660	1	a	Just as fun as the 1st one! Only some extra features!
2662	1	a	Happy to mash buttons like an angry kid again. Story mode is super short but fun. Survival co-op is nice to have, but nobody plays this game any more. 6/10 It's slightly above an average, still I would recommend it, cuz its very cheap.
2664	1	a	This is the best 2d action game I have been played. Very very good for playing with friend or your brother.
2666	1	a	Lots of action, classic story and BRUTALITY.
2668	1	a	This game is really fun. Shank is he toughest guy around. If a shark attacks him he rips its jaw out.
2670	1	a	the game cant go through the survivor mode till level 21
2672	1	a	Combo potentional bonanza, loved this game, shank 3 please!
2674	1	a	A completely average 2D platformer/brawler game. The cut scenes and the story are quite nice, but the gameplay is repetitive and not very innovative. Overall opinion: bland, but worth a try!
2676	1	a	nothing to say other than this game only improved upon what its predecessor layed down, making every single mechanics even better than it was. only downside is that theres no co-op storymode
2678	1	a	If they were to ever make a game based on Brock Samson from the hit TV Show Venture Bros. this would be it considering everything Ive seen from just little time Ive spent Shank is exactly like the Murdering Man-Mountain that is Brock Samson, in other words fantastic game if there ever was one.
2680	1	a	Anyone looking here for story is fooling themselves. With the main hook gone from the first game, ie revenge, the story in Shank 2 is clearly as deep as the 2-dimensional graphics but no more or less poorly executed than it's predecessor. The story is a thin veneer but, if you want a modern beat'em up that opens up the mechanics of the previous entry in the series, then the game will provide. Controllers recommended for best experience.  Survival is challenging and a nice addition geared towards repeat playing but one hopes that there would be a custom level editor or future content to expand on it, as it only sports three maps. Blocking from Shank1 is replaced with a rolldodge. 2 also lacks the prior's co-op campaign with it's nice killsharing, but that's not so bad with the Survival mode in it's place. Recommended for anyone who loves a grisly cartoon and can stomach thin plots in their games, ones that rips the jaws off of sharks gratuitously for your viewing pleasure.
2682	1	a	Cool graphics, exquisite gameplay. This 2D action game has a very sophisticated fighting engine, and hordes of enemies to try it on. Plus, the local/online survival co-op mode is pure fun.
2684	1	a	i was very impressed with this game. i started the game on normal and found myself back on my library so i guess i must have won. replaying on hard is not much harder 8/10
2686	1	a	Simply put, Steam needs more beat 'em ups like Shank 2!
2688	1	a	Good ol' fashion beating\shooting the hell out of everything in sight. All in all really fun. Definately better with a controller, so keep that in mind.
2690	1	a	Its pretty simple really: there are a lot of games out there that try to make you feel like a badass, and those that succeed are examples of some of the best games out there. Shank 2 is far from my top ten list, but it surprising how well it translates the experience of badass to a 2D plane. The art design is cool. The shotgun blasts are satisfying. The combo system always challenges you to be better. It might be short, but its a hell of a lot of fun.
2692	1	a	Not as good as the first but still pretty decent for the price. Its sharper and Shank is a little more savy in combat but there's something about the mechanics that can make the game very frustrating.
2694	1	a	A throwback at old school gaming
2696	1	a	Bloody as fun :D  Awesome 2D game :)
2698	1	a	To be honest, its not as good as the first one, the story lacks of emotion and characters lacks or depth, making it just a mindless beat 'em up. Also, the commands are kind of sloppy.  Still, you can kill some hours on it without much problem
2700	1	a	Button mashing madness, it's loud, its in your face, its rude,crude and loaded with attitude its SHANK 2 GET IT!
2702	1	a	2d scroller retro awesomeness!
2704	1	a	Awesome game................and the survival mode too awesome
2706	1	a	A much less cohesive story this time around, but is that what you came for? The murder-controls are tightened up a bit (but the default config is different from the original), but at the expense of weapon diversity (last melee is unlocked only at the end). Hard difficulty is much, much more difficult than the first game. There's a brand new game mode that is basically co-op (tower?) defense, and can be played online and not just local. The art definitely stands out, but for me it straddles the line between awesome and amateurish. Voice work ain't all that hot, but the music fits well.
2708	1	a	Really enjoyable game with the gamepad :)
2710	1	a	This game takes he repetiveness to 11 and removed the multiplayer game, which I found added to the original's experience. I feel the tower defence excuse for multiplayer didn't do it for me. Also, the boss fights are less unique, wih only 2 or remarkable boss fights out of 8 levels.  There are things to like in this game. The combat is more fluid , and there is an extra character. But I think the original is better. This seems more like an ' Advenures of Shank' or Shank 1.5 then a full on sequel. if you didn't like the original, then you would HATE this game. You could do worse if you decide to get it. Worth a shot if you like beat em ups.
2712	1	a	If you've never played the original Shank, then I suppose Shank 2 is as good a place to start as any. Events in the past game are barely referenced to, if at all. So how well does Shank 2 fare against its predecessor?  To begin, the first Shank wasn't a remarkable game. Even with its short single player campaign, the plot was weak and the gameplay repetitive. Shank 2, with its superb art, suffers a similar fate but with an even weaker story and more uninspired foes.  Gameplay-wise, Shank 2 tries hard to be diverse. There is a large variety of actions and attacks at your disposal and in moments of high intensity, it's all too easy to get buttons mixed up, resulting in eventual death.  To encourage replayability, Shank 2 boasts a leaderboard that tracks player scores built up by combos and items collected. Additionally, there are a dozen or so alternative skins unlocked by completing achievements. If you're not interested in those, then one playthrough may be enough.  Grade: C
2714	1	a	Really great sequel of Shank. The soundtrack is awesome. The executions are really awesome. Great for killing time! :)
2716	1	a	This game is so damn fun i can't even describe it. Crazy action, dynamism, sweating, tryharding. Swearing when that boss killed you when he had like 2 shots worth of hp. The victory dance you do after you finnish a hard misiion. The endless hours of multiplayer gaming and the time you spend to get all the skins and achievs. It offers you alot. I recomand for both casual and dedicated gamers.

2720	1	a	Great looking cartoon graphics, very dynamic fights and un to paly :)
2722	1	a	Definately one of the best beat-'em-up games. Best played with a friend. On a couch!
2724	1	a	the game cant go through the survivor mode till level 21

2728	1	a	Not as good as the first but still pretty decent for the price. Its sharper and Shank is a little more savy in combat but there's something about the mechanics that can make the game very frustrating.
2730	1	a	nothing to say other than this game only improved upon what its predecessor layed down, making every single mechanics even better than it was. only downside is that theres no co-op storymode
2732	1	a	It may doesn't look like good game, but it's great.
2734	1	a	From the creators of Eets, this is a completely different game. A hardcore 2d slasher-shooter, that requires lots of getting used to. I'm not a fan of this genre, but I do like the style of this game. 8/10
2736	1	a	This is a decent, button-mashing time-waster. It's worth it if you can pick it up for cheap.
2738	1	a	A bloody tale of delicious revenge, same as the first one. Same great combat and art style too. However they added a bit more variety overall with this one, including the ability to play as a girl.
2740	1	a	A great blood and gore filled, over the top hack and slash.
2742	1	a	I recommend this game!
2744	1	a	Better than original, and GO-GO-GO SURVIVAL MODE, shell-for-brains!!!
2746	1	a	They hit the nail with this one.
2748	1	a	Really enjoying this game so far. Between the cartoony art style and the various gory ways to kill enimies with a chainsaw, this is one of the most enjoyable games i have played in a while. :)
2750	1	a	Super fun brawler. Lots of really gratifying combos and button mashing. Combat is simple, but complex enough to keep it interesting throughout. Campaign is only about 3.5 hrs. Also has a co-op survival mode that seems cool if you like that sort of thing. The art style and violence are both over the top and a lot of fun!
2752	1	a	I like the blood.
2754	1	a	This game is a wicked side scroller. wicked.
2756	1	a	This game has a very cartoony art style and I like that, the style is very similar to that of 'Mark of the Ninja' (by the same people) which i loved. However, this game just wasn't dynamic, if I had played this before mark of the ninja I probably would have viewed this more highly, but when i was playing it it just felt like a less interesting version of mark of the ninja. That said the game is still good and deserves a look. 7/10.
2758	1	a	While Shank 2 is a more responsive killer this time and there's more game to go around, it adds as many issues as it solves, and can't seem to fill in all the old gaps. When Shank 2 is at its best, it's the proverbial 'best it is at what it does.'
2760	1	a	i was very impressed with this game. i started the game on normal and found myself back on my library so i guess i must have won. replaying on hard is not much harder 8/10

2766	1	a	Like a great grindhouse action movie turned into a 2D platform. Just like its predecesor Shank 2 has been infused with awesome fighting mechanics, soaked in blood and sweat, and left to bake in the hot desert sun. As all sequels should be, Shank 2 turns everything up to 11, trumping its predecessor on all levels. Klei would only continue to outdo itself with Mark of the Ninja
2768	1	a	Awesome sequel, this game is everything the first was with just a little bit of updating and better animation. Survival mode is addictive , fun and challenging. Really hoping for a 3rd game in the series.
2770	1	a	Just as fun, if not more so, than the first game.
2772	1	a	Happy to mash buttons like an angry kid again. Story mode is super short but fun. Survival co-op is nice to have, but nobody plays this game any more. 6/10 It's slightly above an average, still I would recommend it, cuz its very cheap.
2774	1	a	Very good game! Fun and fast
2776	1	a	A great blood and gore filled, over the top hack and slash.
2778	1	a	A smooth, slick, and rather gruesome beat-em-up, but nothing more than that. Also hard difficulty is freaking ridiculously hard.
2780	1	a	Not as good as the first game, but fine nevertheless. Beware: it's as hard as the first one. Even harder. :)
2782	1	a	Nice gameplay, owesome graphics. The campaign is fun though it's not the mai npoint of this game. I Really enjoy play with friends to the 'survive' mode (local &amp; web) which is a big challenge. If you see this game in sale, don't hesitate ... buy it ! =)
2784	1	a	Great game,very entertaining but it would need some improvement :  I first played with the keyboard and mouse and it s not manageable so switch to a controller,it s better but still messy in my opinion.The second annoying thing is the lack of saves, once you start a level you have to finish it! If you quit for any reason you have to start all over again.It can be quite frustrating if you want to play a quick game. Concerning the storyline, i mostly skipped it all as I think this kind of game are not about the story but about the hack'n'slash.So the fact that the story is poor is not really a problem ! Overall it s still a really fun game!
2786	1	a	Improvement in every aspect over Shank 1. Extremely fun to play, purchase recommended.
2788	1	a	Got shanked. Don't want to get shanked again. 7/10
2790	1	a	Pretty much a side view hotline miami styled platforming game that is really gory yet quite entertaining.

2800	1	a	Play this if you just want to have some senseless violence
2802	1	a	A platformer with a God of War style play. Attack and dodge is the name of the game and with good timing you will do fine.
2804	1	a	Great game! A Hack and Slash at its best! I started a blind lets play/first look on my YouTube Channel. Below is the link to my channel! Thanks for watching and let me know what you think!          YouTube™ Video:  &nbsp;
2806	1	a	Really fun game, although it did make me rip out my ♥♥♥♥ing hair. 8/10 good but really ♥♥♥♥ing annoying
2808	1	a	Life in the hood with white guys and chainsaws  11/10 for accuracy
2810	1	a	I have not played shank 1 A really competent brawler with quite sophisticated fighting mechanics that might be slightly overwhelming in the beginning, but feels really satiesfying once you've mastered it. Tight and fair controls - It is mostly your own fault when things go bad. I recommend a controlled for a better experience even though keyboard and mouse works well.   Great art style and animation, similar to other klei titles. Perhaps a bit too bloody for my taste but it fits the theme. It is animated in a cartoony style but perhaps not the best game for the yonger audience due to gore and violence. The story is otherwise completely forgetable.   You have two fighters that you get to play through the story. They vary slightly in play-style are based on the same mechanics. What matters more is what weapon-load you choose - I spent quite a lot of time on a certain bosses until I realized I could do much better with different weapons. Bosses are otherwise just right and are easily beaten once you've figured out what patterns they have and what weapons work best.  Campaign mode is just right timewise, and then you can unlock outfits for the two characters and also play survival mode.  Probably one of the better brawlers I have tried.
2812	1	a	A platformer with a God of War style play. Attack and dodge is the name of the game and with good timing you will do fine.
2814	1	a	Really fun beat em up game. If only there're more levels, I've completed the game within 9 hours :/

2820	1	a	10/10
2822	1	a	Ill come out and say the first one is better but this one is worth a purchase if you liked the first, catch it on sale.
2824	1	a	Shank 2 is a lot of fun. It is very fast-paced. The campaign is quite short but you can play it again for achievements on Hard.  Survival is amazing with a partner next to you. Unlocking characters through achievements is brilliant. I had a friend over and we both had a blast.
2826	1	a	Chainsawed a guy's head off, then leapt onto a helicopter and chainsawed that in half, fell into the ocean, chased by a shark, broke that shark's jaw with my bare hands  10/10 would do again
2828	1	a	Same as first one, only little longer but still funny action game...and you will still think that script wrote Tarantino/Rodriguez but didn't have enough of red color and limbs of all kind. :D
2830	1	a	This game is really awesome  Sometimes its really hard to catch because many details on a 2D games
2832	1	a	Short game but lots of fun. More replay value than the orginial Shank. Pick it up if it's on sale.
2834	1	a	  Nice Game but Hard but... Award !!! xD
2836	1	a	Story mode isn't particularly long, but gameplay is extremely fast-paced and fun. Lots of weapon variety and endless replay value in survival mode. Local multiplayer in survival mode is particularly entertaining.
132	0	a	I very much enjoyed Shank and was really looking forward to playing Shank 2. I was very much disappointed.   What I liked
133	0	a	You ever seen a film you thought was really special and then the sequel comes along wanting to be bigger and better, and completely loses all the charm of the original? That's this, unfortunately.   I wanted to like this game more. I really did. And let me be clear; this is not a terrible game by any means, and if you enjoy beat-em ups, you'll probably enjoy this. That said, if you loved Shank 1, this is a sequel that pales in comparison to its predecessor, to the point that I can't recommend it.   What's Improved  -Visuals are great, with some improvements over the previous edition. -The addition of interactable scenery and weapons are a nice touch that add a fair amount to the game. -No apparent censorship in the steam edition requiring tinkering on the player's end to restore the content like in the first game. -The one button input for picking up healing items is generally easier and less finnicky. - Decent enemy variety. - Collectibles offer an element of exploration now, though the rest of the game's design hinders this.  What's Not Improved/What's Questionable  -The dodge mechanic is now mapped to the right joystick, which requires some rather awkward hand positioning at times relative to the original Shank. I found it less intuitive and clunkier overall, though your mileage may vary.  -In some ways the level design flaws of the previous game are even more apparent here. Sometimes lethality won't be apparent to you beforehand, which can be aggravating given the new consequences for death (loss of grenades and picked up weapons).    There's less wall climbing/running, so you won't be getting as much of that parkour/Prince of Persia feel.    Scene transitions are absolutely the enemy, and it encourages a sort of trepidation that runs counter to the pacing the game wants. It's impossible to tell when the game will arbitrarily prevent you from going backward, thereby cutting you off from healing items and the newly-added point orbs and collectibles.   Further, the yellow point orbs will frequently drift offscreen while you are locked on a combat screen, and given that they fade away in a few seconds, will ultimately be lost through no fault of the player. Also, more than once for me, cutscenes triggered near healing items, causing them to be missed due to forced scene changes.  -Aiming projectiles is still frustratingly inexact sometimes.  -While the scenery weapons offer some nice variety, the overall selection of standard weaponry in the campaign is smaller now, and the Loadout System prevents you from fluidly switching between weapons on the fly as you could in the first game.  -Checkpoints are far fewer and do not persist between sessions. Got frustrated on a boss and quit? Be ready to do the whole level over.  -Explosives now cap at three, and every time you die (be it your fault or poor level design -- rest assured both will happen), you lose some automatically. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it may be offputting for fans of the original.  - Bosses, in addition to lacking the character of their predecessors, aren't as puzzle-oriented as they were in the previous game. They're not bad for what they are, but now they feel like bosses in every other game.  -Story and presentation probably suffer the most. Yes, the visuals are nice, but gone is the grindhouse/kung fu revenge flick vibe in favor of a more scattershot presentation. Shank 1 felt unique. Sadly, this does not. There's no overall solid theme or feel this time. Whereas the previous story was a simple but well told revenge flick which revealed more as you went (moreso before the developers came back and cut content, causing plot holes) with clear and familiar film archetypes, what we have now is a weird Rambo-inspired mess where you will have literally no idea who any of these characters are, why you should care, or what's going on unless you read the bios in the main menu. It's the sort of tell-don't-show thing you'll find a dozens of other games.    The story in the previous game added quite a bit to the experience and, despite being simple, was tighter and better told than in most games, but that restraint is gone now. Here, the story in this game does absolutely nothing and gives you no reason for investment. If that seems like a weird nitpick for a beat-em-up, know that I only mention it because Shank 1 did it so well. In keeping with this loss of uniqueness, Shank's new voice, while perfectly servicable, now sounds like every other growly video game protagonist, something which, given the character's lack of motivation this time, doesn't help things.  To conclude, this game, while not terrible by any means despite the above, is sadly a quintessential example of a sequel that, in trying to be bigger and better, loses a lot of the charm of the original and winds up taking a few steps backward.  
134	0	a	Shank was one of the best games I've ever played. The combat was intense, the controls were fluid like water, the music pumped your adrenaline and even the storyline was engaging. Everything about it was amazing. Shank 2, on the other hand, is a shining example of exactly what you should not do with a sequel. It was as though they took everything that made the first one great and said, 'let's do the opposite of that!' The combat is frustrating, the controls are different and clusmy, the music is repetative and the storyline ranges from cliche to cheeky to downright bizarre. They even changed Shank's voice! He sounds like a putz now. I don't understand how a developer can ♥♥♥♥ up their own game so thoroughly.
135	0	a	Shank 2 is one of those games that seems to think the best way to make a sequel sell is to take everything that made the original great and throw it out the window. The boss fights are awful, the weapons aren't nearly as fun to use, the enemies aren't as fun to fight- but really, the worst thing is the controls. Original shank: move, weapon, weapon, weapon, jump, block. Shank 2: those, plus dodge roll, sprint, and counter. Shank 2 seems to think that for a good sequel, you need to add a bunch of gimmicky crap. All a sequel needs is a fresh coat of paint. Exhibit A: Portal 2. I think the best way to put it is this: It's rather liked getting bopped on the head once ($9.99), given five cookies (Shank,) then bopped on the head again ($9.99), and promptly kicked in the shins (Shank 2.) Don't get kicked in the shins. Keep your ten dollars. Go buy Subway sandwiches for yourself and a friend. It's valid sustenance, you'll develop social skills, and you won't repeatedly pound your head against a terrible for a bad decision. Assuming you don't add mayonnaise.  Shank 2's Final Score: 5.75/10 Letter Grade: F Verdict: Worse than mayonnaise.  Mayonnaise's Final score: 6.0/10 Letter Grade: D- Verdict: At least some people like mayonnaise.
136	0	a	Don't expect a deep plot. This time Shank guides you through eight episodes of brainless action: no effort in enhancing the game experience, the controls are good only if played with a controller.The violence level is so off-the-charts to the point it will put a smile on your face...As long as you don't fall asleep while playing. A survival mode - with an offline/online two player option - is the only thing added from the previous title, it's also easier in comparison to the original Shank.  In short: it's a brief and dull game. Play it only if a crazy amount of gore, beefy guys and explosions doesn't grind your gears (the cutscenes are somewhat enjoyable).  Machete anyone?
137	0	a	This game is nothing but a ragefest. Its pretty and interesting but all the weapons do the same move all the finishers are the same and all boss fights are is ur ranged weapon and a lot of dodging me personally i rate it down it looks good but plays kind of bad so its a no for me...
138	0	a	a total downgrade from shank 1, terrible controls, cheap bosses, only new features are gimmick weapons (like a turret you're going to want to switch to mouse to control decently) survival mode and an enhanced pounce + gore (only on male enemies, because equality i guess)  story is also a mess but it's not like the first one was hamlet  just play the first one again instead of wasting 10bucks on a survival mode
139	0	a	Fun game however controller is required to play this! I do not care what it says you will not be able to play this with a keyboard the handling is terrible.   Cool Art Dumb Story Terrible on Keyboard Fun with controller once you buy one.
140	0	a	the game gets VERY repetitve once it gets to a point... the story is lacking in almost every way and is painfully dull, and fr a game seris with canabals, a mistical amazon women that shoots lightning at you and all the over the top violance, youd think the story would aleast be over the top, but sadly it feels out of place and oddly safe for a game with so mach madness behind it. gameplay is hard to get the hang of at first, then get fun and frantic, but then becomes repetitve.  even with its great animation and its ideas...shank 2 fails to keep you in for long.
141	0	a	I want to recommend this game I really do, however the controls are awful, range of motion is cardinal directional and the responsivness of said awful controls is even worse. I don't mind that fact that it's tough hell I like tough games, when it's the game that's challenging. I don't like a moderately challenging game that is made hard by it's horrific controls. The original Shank was great, the controls were all there and made sense. This one however... using the thumbstick to dodge,  why ? OK they removed block that's ok with me, but that block button was how you initiated a dodge, so now they muddied up the game play by forcing you to have to pretty much play with your right thumb over the stick to dodge at a moments notice, which 90% of the time will fail horribly or not even respond. I will still give a pro and con list so you might use this review to help you out.    Pros:   -The animation in this is much nicer and smoother -Same violent slash fest as the first one -Editable load out pre-mission/player's death (there will be deaths)    Cons:   -Responsivness? What's that?  -Lacks intuitive controls. -After the time I spent it still feels like I'm playing the same stage. -360 degree world? No we only have North South East and West in this world thank you very much!  As for KLEI check out their other games, they really are a great company, I loved the original  Shank , and  Mark of the Ninja  was superb. I haven't played  Don't Starve , but that looks pretty interesting as well. They also have another game in the works, just look them up I don't work for their advertising department so I'll leave that to them to give other details.   So in short I don't recommend this game, but honestly if you loved the first one still give it a shot, the controls might not bother you as much as they did me. I only wrote this to give people and idea of what to expect. If worse comes to worse; download the demo. Take Care.
142	0	a	This game is in a lot of ways better than Shank 1. There are a lot less 'cheap' deaths, although a lot of the enemies themselves pull some pretty cheap/unblockable moves. The result is that most deaths in this game feel a lot more justified than in Shank 1.   The original game's controls were dumb enough - it required 12 buttons to perform all actions, completely ridiculous for a fighting game with such a shallow combat system. This one is even worse, with 14 buttons required. They added a dedicated 'pick up/use' button, and added 2 (!) dodge buttons. These add absolutely nothing to the gameplay, but make it so that you have to map a couple controls to the right analog stick... really really stupid. Do you want your dodges to require you to move your thumb from attack/jump controls? Probably not.  They mostly got rid of the QTE type boss fights from Shank 1. Boss fights in this one involve shooting your guns A LOT, maybe 300-500 hits kills a boss. They feel more like Mega Man bossfights than fighting game boss fights. When EVERY boss gets to half health, you can grapple to trigger a short cinematic.  Presentation wise, this game is quite a few notches below Shank 1. What little story there was there is pretty much eliminated here. Cutscenes are quite poor quality, and some of them look like they were hand drawn, scanned to 720p and then stretched poorly to 1920x1200. The game takes place in south or central america, but all voice actors sound like they're white game developers from Seattle. The drop in quality makes me think the budget for this must have been a step down from Shank 1.  Due to less cheap deaths, I'd say this game is better than Shank 1 by a hair, but still pretty poor. The controls are stupid and overly complicated for such a simple game, the combat system is still pretty much button mash with the occasional jump out of the way, and the presentation is almost non-existent.  I WILL recommend Mark of the Ninja, don't be scared off of it because of this, but by the same token, don't by Shank thinking it'll be the same quality as MotN.  
143	0	a	Might be fun if the controls weren't so tedious and the gameplay so dull. I completely see the appeal in a machete-like game, but I feel like this REALLY doesn't capture it correctly. Go play any other of Klei's games and you will have fun, this, not so much.
144	0	a	They really f♥ ♥ ked up the dodge controls compared to Shank No. 1.
145	0	a	Shank 1 was better. Shank 2 has more bells and whistles but feels watered down. Basically, has a change in art, gameplay and controls that not everyone will like. (and a lot of people dont.) I think voice acting also is worse here. When I played I always had the feeling that the game was targeted towards much more... younger players than Shank 1. Its difficult to backup this up with an argument though, but it's like the whole game has sunken. To make the whole game worse but to add a mini game where you have to defend against waves of thugs. Why? And those constant hints... oh god 'press ... to grab ...' 'this is water, dont go there. its wet. fish lives there.' etc.
146	0	a	Pretty much the same game as the first with different weapons. The story, like the first, is rather dull and doesn't really make you care about any of the characters. On the plus side they varied the enemies up a bit more and the stages are more creative. Co-op is a nice addition but doesn't add enough to make me care.  Pros: - Gorgeous Graphics with very appropriate hit boxes for the most part - Variety of characters and weapons  Cons: - SAME GAME! Seriously, it's the same game. If you didn't absolutely 100% LOVE the first one, don't get this. - Boring Story - No reason to use anything other than the chainsaw and knives (other weapons don't have alternative benefits)
147	0	a	If you liked the first Shank game, be wary of this sequal. While the core of the game is the same, what they added is not enough to make up for the subtractions.  The controls seem to be a little nicer with the ability to stop combos and such, but the ramped up difficulty on 'Normal' can cancel out that ability as it seems there is always a new wave of enemies (always including a ranged mob) that will knock you out of the combo.   Boss fights, as well boss fights. We all know the jump, dodge, attack and repeat nature but this time they liked to add in atleast 2 more random baddies to the equation. It's bad enough I need to jump, duck, dodge and roll and then attack the boss but adding more random crap in to the experiance doesn't make it 'hard', it makes it tedious.  If your looking for the sidescroller, try the original Shank or Mark of the Ninja, both a much more enjoyable experiance.
148	0	a	It's a nice throwback to old-school brawler games, with great looking cartoon graphics. Unfortunately the gameplay gets repetitive fast, and the difficulty is not designed well, random points in levels will get extremely hard, with the rest being relatively easy, even the boss difficulty varies. Gets old fast when you have to retry certain areas a few times. It might just be me, but I play simple cheap games like this to kick back and kick some ♥♥♥, not for a 'challenge' because I'm a 'hardcore gamer'.
149	0	a	this game fails at being a good hack n slash fighting whatever the ♥♥♥♥ its supposed to be. thats because the dodging system sucks ♥♥♥♥, since enemies attacks got stupid super tracking, grabbing and pummeling is more of a suicide thing to do since enemies can hit you freely while you do that ♥♥♥♥ and you can easily find glitches that break the stage progression forcing you to start ALL OVER AGAIN (if youre playing in hard mode)
150	0	a	This game has an intriguing story, nice graphics and fun boss fights. BUT,  its really in bad taste when it comes to a Klei game. The controls are wobbly and the gameplay is the same basic gimmick. Dodge and counter-attack. If it wasn't for the constant waves of enemies you have to fight, it would be a much duller game. As for replay value, it serves no purpose in going back, unless you're an achievement hunter. There would be no way of going back to this game aside from playing survival mode with your friends. Which gets pretty lame after the first few rounds. Would not recommend if it wasn't on sale. 4/10
151	0	a	While it keeps most of the mechanics of Shank, Shank 2 is ruined by the need to carefully block opponents instead of building awesome combos like in its predecessor. This not only messes with the fluidity of the game, but spoils most of the fun as well. It's a shame too, because it could be a very promising title. Would not recommend unless you are very much into defence driven action. If not, the first Shank will keep you more than satisfied.
152	0	a	Great art direction and characters ...but unfortunately lame combat system which is so frustrating that I can not recommend this game unless you have nerves made of titan!!
153	0	a	no local co-op like Shank 1
154	0	a	This does NOT, in anyway, shape, or form live up to the first Shank. Shank 2 is just like when the action movie Taken got a sequel that SUCKS (even if you never saw the first Taken!).
155	0	a	make more fatty and gunners then thats it  derp
156	0	a	How do people finish these games they're so difficult ;( I can't even imagine dark souls. This games is like a really hard flash game for $10. I Got this in humble bundle so i'm not dissapointed. The game play is fun only the game is just too difficult for a scrub like me. The only thing about a few flash games. Which is they are so hard to finish. The game play is not good so it gets boring when you try over and over again. The game is just hard but pisses u off when u die non stop (not as much as some indie games) 5/10
157	0	a	Compared to the original, it's really worse in most departments. Story is a disjointed mess, just serving as a vehicle from one stage to the next. Combat is similar to the original, but dodging is much worse (and doesn't work half the time) and hot swapping weapons is gone. Bosses are less gimmicky (compared to the original), but are just long, boring brawls. In general it's 'like' Shank, but Shank 2 is really a different game. Having played these two back-to-back, I can easily say the original one is superior.
158	0	a	People seem to either love or hate this game. I fall under the hate side. I loved the first mission however for whatever reason it goes to a snow level and Boss you have to kill in a certain way without dying once otherwise its back to the start of the boss fight again. No thanks. If you enjoy uber hard challenge and little to no hand holding and little to no help from the game then this is the game for you. If you enjoy rigid and only way to kill certain things then this is the perfect game for you.   The game is not for people who get frustrated easily. As you will die a lot and then die a lot some more.
159	0	a	Note: Skip straight to the bottom after Pros and Cons for tl;dr. Note 2: I also have not played the first game. This review examines the game from its story as a standalone. Note 3: I also have no one to play co-op with. This review excludes the co-op part.  Pros:  - Responsive combat - If you have a controller, use it. It feels excellent.  Cons:  - Typical story, replace damsel with older damsel. Also the story makes me cringe. But that may be just me. - Relatively short game if you play on normal - Combos? What combos? Maybe I'm just bad at this game, I dunno :(  Shank 2 is a game that is not for the story-driven. As a guy who loves story-driven games, this is a game that just... what? That's not a story man. Shank 2's story doesn't feel like a story - it feels like filler for the game's mechanics, which are solid; not revolutionary, but solid.  It's hard not to keep a negative tone about this game because I didn't really enjoy it; I was soon playing it for the sake of 'finishing' the campaign. However, the game's combat is very solid (that's a third) and it felt great to play with a controller. Sometimes the combat makes me feel as though the situation was out of my control, but those moments are few and far between, and it was actually me not being alert most times.   Overall, I don't really recommend this game, but for reasons that may not ring with you. If you like playing a game purely as an excuse to whack baddies, this is OK. But for people who are story-driven and like a good campaign, stay away.  TL;DR: Get this game for an excuse to whack some baddies; platforming combat is good here. Stay away if you like good stories and a long game, regardless of the gameplay.
160	0	a	It's the same game, only marginally worse. Here's some beat-em-ups I would like to see instead:  - An Edward Gorey-style beat-em-up where a young Tim Burton travels in time to the future to assassinate Present Tim Burton (Johnny Depp is the final boss) - An adaptation of Edward Abbey's Fire on the Mountain where the grandfather puts on a gi and goes to town on encroaching government agents - Drunk Fights: A two-player game using the Euphoria physics engine where two incredibly drunk people fight each other in a bar (special characters like Charles Bukowski are either DLC or unlockables) - Christmas Drunk Fights: see above, except it takes place in a shopping mall - Sudden Ninja Attack: Like The Sims, but there's NINJAS that you have to kill with your superior reflexes
161	0	a	I don't know if this game is good or bad because I couldn't play it. Do not try to play this game without a game-pad. I couldn't get through the tutorial. Try pressing d L and shift, and use the mouse. If you can your an octopus. I couldn't so this game was rendered unplayable.
162	0	a	Despite the fact that I absolutely loved Shank 1, I have to give negative review. Trust me, I tried. Emulating gamepad,changing controls for over 30 min. First of all controls are absolute garbage, you'll find dodging only to te left side and different control bugs gamebreaking. Because of that fact I wasn't even able to win first level of the game. Because of that I can't really review different aspects of the game. You are probably thinking 'Well gamepad maybe is broken, but what about keyboard?'. Who would like to play fighting game on keyboard? It's bugged in the same anyway. All in all if you are planning on buying this game I'll have to persuade you not to. I had 2 attempts on playing this. First one was right after I managed to beat Shank 1 on hard difficulty. Decided to go with the flow and I got gifted this. Now after few years I thought to give this game one more shot. Like said before, fighting over controls then with enemies. Great way to ruin the series. I'll probably buy Shank 3 but at least I hope they'll fix controls issue.
163	0	a	When I picked up Shank 2, I was hoping for some old school platforming and hack 'n slash. The screenshots gave an impression of a brutal and fun game.   Alas, I found it far more focused on picking off hard combos or accomplish certain area stunts than to get from A to B and kill the boss. It's focused more on being a hard old school game than entertainment. And instead of experimenting in various ways of killing your opponents you are stuck with throw X there, or beat Y to death here.  I do applaud the developer for the games beautiful graphics, and the idea behind the game.  As well as the multiplayer aspects (as long you find someone to play with). But as I said, I was hoping for something more open and less restricted game.  :Game Quality: 3/5 :Controls: 3/5  :Effort: 4/5 :Re-playability: 2/5
164	0	a	Do NOT buy this game if you dont have a gamepad. It is almost unplayable on keyboard.

169	0	a	A bit better than the first game and if you liked the first game, this will certainly be better. If like me you didn't quite find the first game bad or good, you won't find Shank 2 memorable enough to suggest a recommend. But it's better, I'll give it that, and totally better if you did like the first game, once again. But here's my opinion.
170	0	a	Easily one of the worst games I ever played.  Bad animation (running consists of two shapes) Bad coding (huge fps drops in some regions) Bad control (X-Box port) Bad gameplay (some bosses are frustrating, the rest just easy) Bad story (if you can even call it a story) Bad mechanics (tons of unlockables) Everything else (unskippable cutscenes, savepoints set too loose or every few steps)
171	0	a	Another one that I'm neutral towards. It was okay, but not worth buying.
172	0	a	DONT BUY THIS PLAY SHANK 1 ITS THE BEST
173	0	a	There is no campain coop.
174	0	a	After playing few hours, completing some missions (not so much, in fact), I made my little idea of this game. I don't like it. Why? Because it's very repetitive, the musics are the same for the whole game, and that's very annoying to play with that dümb music playing and playing again. But, nevermind the music, you can turn it off (Of course you can, if not, I would be god damn dead right now), let's talk about the gameplay itself. You play Shunk, or whatever, and you cut people. That's all ! You cut people with knifes and machetes again and again ! Enemies are all the same, checkpoint is a forbidden word in this game, bosses are just boring and wasting your time, etc. But at least it's pretty decent when you look at the graphics, yeah, it's all drawn-by-hand, and it looks awesome ! It 'looks' awesome. Looks.  Ups :  - Nice graphics - In the first hours, it's still fun to switch between Knifes, Machetes, Guns, etc., it makes the first levels a little more exciting - You don't need a PC from the NASA to make it work, and that's a good point if your PC is cheap. - A little coop mode, didn't test it yet. (I need to find someone who likes this game first...)  Downs :  - Musics are... BLEH. - Too repetitive - Enemies are all the same - Bosses are full of bugs, and seriously not interresting - The story. I don't understand anything about this 'conflict' or whatever. You maybe need to play the 1st game before playing this one.   I do not recommand it, but I cannot spit on it, I had fun on this game !
175	0	a	play a newgrounds flash game or something
176	0	a	Campaign is 3 hours long (well Shank 1 wasn't long either). Although there are some unlockables, most of them are grind based. Fighting is well done, but boss fights are just simple fights with evading. Shank 1 had some strategy and tactics in boss fights. Based on this, I would say Shank 1 is better game and this one shouldn't be bought (story isn't even that interesting) without discount. And no one plays co-op.
177	0	a	Game was so boring it actively kept me from installing Mark of the Ninja when I was done. It's like one of those beat-em-up flash games, right down to 'your character follows your cursor' tracking that results in janky movement. Coulda totally done without levels full of ninja nurses who all had an identical voice.  I didn't dig it.
178	0	a	+ Good art style + Fortunately, it's not that long + Well-balanced difficulty + Good feeling of the weapons, especially the scythe - It quickly becomes boring - Uncomfortable controls - OSTs without any kind of style/charm - Cheap boss battles
179	0	a	Luckily that I got free play for this game, and I got ♥♥♥♥♥♥ by the rocket luncher part in the last stage that I wasted 30 mins to solve it just because there was no checkpoint in normal mode for that, so I had to deal with a large wave of enemy because I die with a stupid combo rocket instant kill every god damn time. 10/10
180	0	a	Don't bother. Mark of the Ninja is made by the same guys and is really good though.
181	0	a	Why did they cut co-op?        ...seriously, why did they cut co-op?
182	0	a	ok game but gets boring after a while.  looks more like a tablet game

184	0	a	Controls are highly inconsistent
185	0	a	Unnecessary complex controls bring this one down unfortunately.
186	0	a	Another broken console port? Either make a game for gamepad only (and let the buyers know), or make the keyboard+mouse controls right.

188	0	a	The original was like getting aids...  This one is like getting cancer...  Didn't improve on ANYTHING, made everything worse... the co-op mode is tacked on garbage... just waves upon waves of enemies frustrating the hell out of you every 5 seconds...  Horrible.
189	0	a	- The game is frustratingly hard. Most people (including me) died severa times in 1ST LEVEL! and it is worse from there on. - There is no strategy to learn, just repeating every frustrating level and boss until one time you luckily wount die. - Dont look for Easy difficulty setting - there isn't any. - The control scheme is a mess on both keyboard and controller. Dont buy !

197	0	a	One word - unbalanced! I only get frustration from this game when I'm forced to re-play some stupid ♥♥♥♥ over and over and over and over again. Shank 1 was much better.
198	0	a	Very arcadey feeling, it seemed a lot like the flash games I'd play on  miniclip.com  and  addictinggames.com  when I was younger, just with better graphics.
199	0	a	Absolutoly shoddy, purely based on the fact that the game doesnt' support MAC OSX 1.7.5 despite reporting to support anything beyond snow leapord.  Hopeing one day to actually play this game so I can see what it's like but either way the review stays the same as I believe that this sort of ranmpent consumer neglect shouldn't go unremembered   0/10

206	0	a	Controls are a disaster. Movement around the screen makes it impossibe to keep track of where your mouse pointer is in relation to your character and -- for no reason at all -- the mouse has to be on the side of your character you want to attack with using LMB. So I end up attacking the wrong direction as often as the right one. Don't even remember how this ended up in my library. Some junk bundle at some point I guess. So after a half hour of frustration, I'm just idling for cards then uninstalling.
207	0	a	3/10  Granted, I didn't play Shank 2 for very long. I like to give games a chance and play at least an hour or two before I form any kind of opinion. But I had nothing but contempt for Shank 2 and its endless mindless button mashing! My hatred for this game has become an inside joke with my friends. Don't talk to me about SHANK 2!!! It's actually the reason I didn't try Mark of the Ninja for so long. But I must say that the latter turned out to be a fantastic game.
208	0	a	Unfortunately, not good. The devs changed the control scheme from the original and in the process, completely broke the game's dodging mechanic (by moving it from a trigger button to the right stick). In the original, gameplay consisted of dancing through crowds of enemies, shooting and stabbing and murdering as you go. In this installment, it's just frustrating because the controls are busted and can't be customised.
209	0	a	why? just why?
210	0	a	Poor combat: I've had enemies shoot/grab me from the wrong direction somehow, leaping move randomly misses because the enemy decides to move back a step, etc. Very frustrating.

212	0	a	Note: I only played the game for a couple hours, maybe you will like this game but I did not. It is an arcade style platform combat game with a few added features in it. It may be better the longer you spend on the game but it was not for me.
213	0	a	One more really cool-looking game with absolutely no hardware support. If you don't have an XBox controller, don't buy this game. This isn't even a Game For Windows Live game, and it still doesn't want to play nice with my PS2-style controller, which is functionally identical to the XBox controller, just laid-out for a human hand instead of a jock meat-claw. I don't understand why developers refuse to acknowledge and support this issue. It happens with every single game of this genre since Arkham Asylum (probably before, but that's the oldest recent one I've played), and every time we're forced to hack open our ini files and fix it ourselves because nobody in the dev community cares enough to properly port their game to PC.  Shank 2 gets an F for being completely unplayable. And too bad, because it seems like a lot of fun.
214	0	a	Where do i even begin with this awful game.The controls suck the difficulty is near impossible especially when the mahince guns dont work when there are hordes of brutes runing your way.Its like the developers didnt even test the game b4 they released it. I thought shank 1 was a bit shabby with it controls but this is just 2 much.Dont buy this game.Its not even worth playing if u get it for free. I finished 95% of the game and than quit because the crapy controls wouldnt let me use the machine gun that u would use to kill the waves of brutes running your way. 0/10 worst game ever made i'd rather give a homeless guy on the street 10€ insted of buying this excuse for a game. DONT BUY IT.
215	0	a	I borderline hate this game. After about 30 minutes, I was so frustrated and unhappy with my experience, I almost uninstalled it and hid it from my library. I was too stubborn to do that and ended up beating the whopping 2.5 hour campaign, though I'd hesitate to say I actually enjoyed any of it. Thank god I got it in a Humble Bundle.  My biggest problem was the difficulty. It's a bit too hard for my liking right off the bat, then ramps things up a bit more each level... until you get the shotgun and the game becomes 'mash shoot to win'. I mean, I guess I should thank the developers for making it so utterly overpowered or I probably would never have beaten the game. Unfortunately, the plot isn't much better. It's your standard 'retired hero gets thrown into the middle of a conflict and defeats the big bad' affair. The first game (which I also didn't really care for) had a much more interesting plot, but that's more thanks to Quinten Tarantino due to it basically being a poor man's Kill Bill.  All that being said, I can see how some others may find enjoyment in this title. If you like hard-as-nails beat-'em-ups with copious amounts of gore, then this is for you. I guess I'm just too soft these days.
216	0	a	I love the original Shank. It's a fun brawler with a good story with over-the-top ♥♥♥-kicking.  Shank 2 improves the gameplay in some areas and downgrades it in others, but the main problem with this game is the story.  Pros:  -The dodge button was a welcome addition -Adds more fun ways to dismember people, like throwing them in the air and shooting/slicing them -Forward attacks involve more charging forward  Cons: -A bit too tutorial-heavy -There are way too many enemies to defeat. It makes the game not fun and more of a grindfest. -The story is absolute ♥♥♥♥. In the first game, the story was straightforward. Shank=good guy. Everyone else=bad guy. You kill bad guy. Also some backstory, but mostly that. In Shank 2, you rescue your mentor/girlfriend and it's pretty dark and gritty. No. The story in Shank should just be him going around and killing things. I don't want to deal with moral choice in Shank. I just want to dismember people. Also, Shank apparently has a daughter? This is wrong for a couple reasons. One, Shank is a terrible role model. He runs around getting drunk and killing people. Why should he care if he has a daughter? Two, Shank is such a badass that giving him a moral compass takes away a lot of that. It's like giving the Terminator a family.  Conclusion: Shank 2 is more of a gritty grindfest than the over-the-top popcorn action game that the original Shank was. If you prefer a more complex story, then buy this game. I personally think that the story should complement the gameplay, and the original story did that a lot better. In Shank 2, the story and the gameplay don't match, and it detracts from the experience.
217	0	a	Those on Windows may ignore this comment.  I want to love this game. I really do. As a fan of beat-em-up games, I can't complain about the gameplay itself. The combos are easy, and the game itself is challenging.  Unfortunately, playing this game on Linux with a 360 controller is basically impossible. On the menu screen, right maps to up for some reason. The dodge input doesn't work, the RT and LT buttons do nothing. While I had similar issues with Megabyte Punch, that game at least gives you the ability to change your controls. In Megabyte Punch, you select the command you want to change, then press the button you want to change it to. Simple. In this game, I don't even know how the control changing works. I click one control option, and it always changes to either Y or Z rotation.  It's too bad. Maybe if I ever own a Windows machine I'll try again, but for the time being I'm going to be avoiding this game and the original.
218	0	a	I stuck in shank 2 after elena was put into a container cannot grab the ladder to go down
219	0	a	I've only gotten 42 minutes into it and know I've played similar games that did it way better.   Kinda clunky, very repetative, not the greatest art style and story.
220	0	a	not much shanking i met more shanks in prison than this
221	0	a	cheep game ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off
222	0	a	Boring game. - Little variety - Each level is more or less the same - Boring story
223	0	a	Short campaign. Too many cutscenes. Bad story.  my rating: 2/10
224	0	a	I really wanted to love this game, it has so many cool elements to it. Ultimately the controls are clunky and frustrating, the dodge roll is pointless, enemies do too much damage, and bosses make for pointless tedius frustration. I like a challenge, but not when I'm battling my controller.
225	0	a	While I liked the first Shank I had problems even playing the second game for the cards. The whole combat system is overhauled making it frustrating to play. They removed blocking and replaced it with dodging and countering. Dodging is put on the right stick which takes to long too reach when you are having your thumb on the attack buttons. The countering is done with the same button as you grab with. The problem with this system is that it works really bad when facing large groups of enemies. You will die a lot because of that. They also put more focus on the story which is really bad. A simpler story but acceptable story like the first one worked much better.
226	0	a	Shank 2 is an old school beat-em-up of the sort I thought were obsolete. It turns out, I was exactly right. Shank offers nothing new or interesting in terms of that genre, yet is demanding, repetitive, and consequently tedious. There’s also a surprising amount of sexism and racism to boot.
227	0	a	Okay so I gave it a positive review before, but now that I have played a bit in hard mode, I can honestly say that the good things about this game do not outweigh the bad things.  It's poorly optimized and unnecessarily difficult and slow compared to the first game.  Take it from me, buy the first one instead.
228	0	a	Nice looking fun game. But the controls are really bad. Not worth the dollar.
229	0	a	Fun game, but the Boss fights are such a worthless waste of time. Boring. repetitive. And with lame Mechanics. I'd play alot more if the boss fights weren't garbage.
230	0	a	Enjoyed Comicstyle Graphics every second but can`t recommend it  The combat system really sucks, there`s little to no way to protect yourself. WHY grab an enemy to make a 'stylish' attack when you can be hit by ALL other in that time. Shooting enemys are the ONLY danger in most levels. If you like good graphic style and simply mashing buttons until reaching the checkpoint then buy it. I´d rather put the money to a novoline gambling machine  How did the makers of 'mark of the ninja' mess up like that ???
231	0	a	This seems like a fun game but every time I attacked, my character automaticaly faced the opposit direction I wanted him to face. I don't know if it was a bug or if a setting wasn't set correctly but it was frustrating enough to not want to play it.
232	0	a	Shank 2 is only a big disapointment. A complete downgrade from Shank1. And I really enjoyed Shank 1.  But Shank 2 is 'heee'. The cutscenes are terribly awful. It really hurts the eyes. The animation are very bad and the voice acting is only a joke. Every cutscenes is a bad-joke, and really takes you out of the game. Ingame also the animation are poor.... The whole visual experience is not very pleasant also ingame. The level design lacks of every kinda form of imagination and aesthetic. The colors are fade. The sound design is as bad as is the music... And the controls are wobbly on windows and sucky on linux. Managing a turret with the gamepad is impossible so you have to jump on your mouse to control it decently. Bosses are cheap and have a poor patern move system. You can kill them all only using your guns. Survival mode is funny for sometimes with a friend and will bore you after a short period of time because it's lame.  The support on steamOS/linux is very bad. Performance are terrible. It seems than a gtx980 on a i7-5960X is not enough to run the game smoothly. It lags a lot, perf are about 15fps on many occasions ( everytime it rains it's barely playable ). The controller support suxx, specially if you use a xbox360 controller. Who on earth use the start button to grab or the select button to pounce?! Changing the layout is buggy. Y'ou'll have to find out by yourself how to trick the bug since there is absolutely zero technical support from the devs. And sometimes the d-pad is simply stopping to function for a few seconds, specially this will you make rage-quit. They've killed Shank by adding this sequel.... that's very sad indeed.  The only positive point, the game is hard and challenging, and the poor almost no-support of gamepad on linux makes it too frustrating. I don't really understand how devs can claim to support an OS while the support of that OS is a bad and sad joke...  Shank 1 is a great game. Shank 2 would only make you hate both of the games. I recommend you playing the first one again, even on sale that game is not worth your time and money.
233	0	a	This feels like a point and click and i hate that if an enemy is behind you...you dont trun and press an attack button you have to click on him/herthat ruins the combat alot when it is a fast paste fighting rampage game. 6/10 recommended on xbox 360
234	0	a	I enjoyed the first game a lot, but Shank 2 is in my eyes a game, which nobody needs. All positive things from Shank 1 are now gone.  - Very weak story. To be honest, I even can't remember the story anymore from the second game. - Cutscenes are pixelated. What they did wrong and why were the cutscenes in Shank 1 perfect? - Gameplay is boring. Because the story is weak, you kill people without sense.  Only one good thing is, that this game has an online coop mode. But I tried it out last in 2012. I would wonder if the Multiplayer is still alive.
235	0	a	Well,this game is just the average Beat em up. But to be honest a rather bad one.The controls suck badly, its extremely hard,even on the lowest difficulty,and the checkpoints are unfair. The game is also very repetitive, since there is only 9 Weapons in total and there arent any minigames. There is (very hard) bosses tough, and some turret sections, but they are all boring too. There seems to be alternative skins ,but idk if they change the gameplay, and I will probably never find out because after the first 2 levels or so I got too bored and quit the game. If you are a TRUE fan of Beat em ups you MIGHT like it,but in my opinion, spare your money for another game!! And even you got a free key (like me,I got it from  {LINK REMOVED}  ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.com) , think about installing it twice,because it might not even be worth the space.  2/10 Juggs
236	0	a	If you are an average gamer like me, this game will really p**s you off. I have played the first Shank on normal difficulty without problems, however, this second Shank is too hard on normal difficulty. I wish they have created an easy difficulty for this game! There are too many s**t going on at the same time, you have to be very skilled gamer to press every different button on each situation. I could only do that if I sniffed cocain and took amphetamines and an energy drink. I know we can change settings on controls, but I don't understand why they have changed some buttons compared to Shank 1, that was brainless (specially if you got used to controls from the first game). There are enemies (specially the bigger ones) whose attacks are very unfair, they grab you and drain a lot of health. If I knew the game would be that hard, I wouldn't have bought it. I regret wasting my money on this unbalanced difficulty game. I didn't find this game as fun and playable as the first Shank...
237	0	a	Note: I only played the game for a couple hours, maybe you will like this game but I did not. It is an arcade style platform combat game with a few added features in it. It may be better the longer you spend on the game but it was not for me.

239	0	a	Poor combat: I've had enemies shoot/grab me from the wrong direction somehow, leaping move randomly misses because the enemy decides to move back a step, etc. Very frustrating.
240	0	a	Thoroughly dissapointed.
241	0	a	The stages are too claustrophobic for this style of gameplay, it's very crowded with no room to manuver.
242	0	a	not recomended. why? 1.keyboard controls are awful. 2.even with my 360 controller still awful. i gave 2 chances.  no more. ty 
243	0	a	Didn't play the first one... don't feel like I missed a lot... this is alright, and the turret sections are fun (as turret sections usually are), but overall it feels samey and I didn't feel particularly challenged. Controls are a bit sticky. The last two boss fights are quite nasty.
244	0	a	I can't believe the people who made Mark of the Ninja made this piece of ♥♥♥♥. The only way to beat the bosses without tearing your hair out is to just use ranged weapons. Which takes all the fun out of the game. Such a frustrating combat system that always leaves you guessing as to what exactly the developers were trying to go for in that specific instance.
245	0	a	Beaten in 3 hours on Normal, with quite a bit of frustration along the way, mostly due to the combat mechanics and a couple bad checkpoints. Here are the main things that made the experience frustrating for me:  - Awkward combat and controls. Even by the end of the game, I never felt like I could control Shank's movement as precisely as I wanted, and half the time he and the enemies just bounced around the screen as we desperately tried to hit and dodge eachother's moves. It's just really clunky and silly looking a lot of the time. I would have liked more precision in the movement.  - Too much dodging. If you try to fight stuff straight up, you'll die over and over and over. Dodge is controlled by the right joystick, and you have to hover over it constantly and use it every time an enemy flashes yellow, charges, fires a projectile, leaps at you, etc. When you have 7 enemies on screen charging back and forth in different patterns, firing waves of bullets, and cleaving at you it's just incredibly annoying that the key to winning is to dodge dodge dodge dodge. I'd have preferred more straight up combat where I could fight something without watching 6 other things and constantly being interrupted.  - Difficulty spikes in weird places. I spent half an hour (1/6 of total play time!) on a single turret section that was preceded by a long easy section with no checkpoint. Every time I died I had to re-do the easy section to get back. I got stuck on a boss earlier in the game for half an hour, yet beat the final boss on the first try without even knowing his attack patterns.  All in all, it's not a bad game. The controls and style of combat just really annoyed me. I'm glad I finished it though and there is a sense of satisfaction you get from beating the difficult parts. The cutscenes and story are groanworthy, but clearly that was their intention. I just found it all very forgettable, whereas Mark of the Ninja was just a fantastic experience with a great ending. If you're choosing between the two, I'd definitely go for the latter.
246	0	a	This is essentally the same game as Shank and comes with all of the same flaws, plus a few more.  Mainly, that the game just isn't very challenging and has been severely dumbed down for the casual market compared to old school beat 'em ups like Streets of Rage. Giving you infinite lives and checkpoints takes all of the fun out of this type of game. If nothing else at least offer an option to set limited lives and continues while retaining an 'infinite lives' option for casual players who are just playing it through for the 'story'.  Speaking of story, it also took a turn for the worse. While the original Shank's revenge plot was at least interesting enough to care about, the plot in this game is just generic 'B-movie' fare and makes no mention of the characters from the original at all. The settings are also a lot less diverse and interesting, boiling down to dark dismal jungle and industrial environments which are a lot less nice to look at. The added in-game voice acting is also unnecessary and for the most part downright cheesy.  Essentially the game retains the same flaws with little in the way of improvement, and a few additions that make the gameplay worse:   *Easy, short campaign, little to no replay value with the only unlockables being alternate costumes and character bios that add nothing to the gameplay  *Poorer controls than in the original (having to use seperate buttons to dodge left and right)  *A survival mode which had potentional but is multiplayer only (and with no one playing it online this mode is only accessable if you have a real-life buddy to play with)  I really can't recommend this except to casual gamers who typically play Facebook or Zynga games (and even then, the strong language and gore will probably be a turn-off to the type of people who play Farmville or Candy Crush Saga).
247	0	a	My time with this game was short and frustrating. Not the fun kind of frustrating that the original Shank was, but the kind of frustrating where I just wanted it to end. If you have it in your library, then it's a fun few hours, but don't pick it up unless you really, really love the Shank franchise.
248	0	a	 Garbage   While they managed to fix flaws of the first game, they also completely screwed the combat. Blocking and grappling are now on the same button. Playing with controller feels like being handicapped, since when is dodging on the right joystick? It is complete lackluster since I have to spam X, A, Y, B for attacks in synergy to dodging. A good thing is that they are giving you an option to re-bind the keys. Yet there is no free or comfortable buttons left. This is why they combined blocking and grapple in the first place. I would of been fine with this if it allowed me to bind dodging to Left Trigger in synergy with movement joystick. Simply put, controller felt like a complete garbage to this sequel while it performed good enough in Shank 1. This forced me to switch to keyboard &amp; mouse, which has been improved in the sequel. Dodging was way easier to do on keyboard, since all I had to do was hold shift and move into the direction I was going to dodge. But yet again I found a problem, my heavy attacks were on shift+lmb. So i tried to re-bind it on a mouse4 or mouse 5. Sadly those were not programmed in to the game. So without much hastle I just mapped it on my keyboard to not mess up my dodges. To sumarize my whole experience in one word, frustrating.  While playing through campaign, I found out that it wasn't really worth using meele. Since I was constantly jumping/dodging while tossing darts. This made it an ultimate weapon on hard to take down enemies. Even the boss couldn't withstand it. Kinda sadenss me to see it this way, because even if the first game had it's best equipment you always ended up using them all.   Even worse they took out the momentum of finishers. In the first game you couldn't be harmed while in the momentum, just like assassin's creed. Making it 1 on 1. Though it wasn't perfect and sometimes you still got hit by it, at least it was an efficient way of staying alive during enemy hordes. I guess it was over abused on hard mode, but heck it didn't even had checkpoints. So they ended up trading momentum for checkpoints and as a final effort we got a completely useless battle momentum.  Story wise, I can't really say it's any better than Shank 1. Voice acting is at the same degree. Enemies were all the same as in shank 1, only difference was the skins. Game lenght wise, it was shorter than Shank 1. Basically only noticeable difference was a little improved graphics.   Verdict: Worse than the first game. If they just... wouldn't... of... screwed with game controls and mechanics and improved upon the first one. This could of been a great hack &amp; slash game. 
249	0	a	this is a game where every time you die in a boss fight you have to watch the unskippable intro 'cutscene' again unrelated note i know the entire choreography of the first boss cutscene off by heart
250	0	a	Horrible game, it's pretty but thats pretty much all it has. The gameplay is boring, unimagniative, repetative, without any flow and all in all this is just a big stinking waste of everyones time.
251	0	a	A regular 2D beat em up game so awkwardly balanced it's barely playable. The game is hard, but it is super tedious to get through. The first few levels are fun until the overpowered bosses get a hold of you. I would not have a problem with this if the bosses were programmed to be as strong as me and as good as me. But they are so strong I got bored mid fight. For a fast paced action game to be like this really takes away a lot of enjoyment out of the game.   A boss fight should not be about how long you punch the guy but about how much skill it takes to land the punches. I won't even go into detail about checkpoints, whoever designed and placed them clearly had no idea what they were doing. Why? Just why? For hardcore mode going to the beginning of the level is no big deal, or even mid level. But to have it even on normal is just overkill.  Play if you enjoy small burst of enjoyment and bosses with infinitely health. 
252	0	a	This one's tough for me to recommend. It's a solid concept: you're an alien that's crash-landed onto earth, and you've been brought in for experiments in a lab on the bottom of the sea. You and a mysterious alien friend of yours need to escape. The catch is that you get this ability to warp from place to place around you, including within objects. It's a clever concept, and it looks and feels pretty good for a game that lists a usual price of $10. The puzzles are generally challenging, and some of the challenge maps are quite tough.  Unfortunately, that's where the praise ends. You have to deal with stupid EA account BS every time you log in, or you can't access your save file. The story is pretty flat and not that dynamic, and from what I've heard, the game runs like crud on systems with older CPUs. There's little incentive to collect everything you find (no achievements, no end-game rewards, and the powerups you can get from SOME of the collectables don't change up gameplay that much). I really had to force myself to finish this game after spending maybe 4-5 hours on it total. It's not even that long, I just wanted to collect as much as I could.  If you're really desperate for an indie game, I guess give this a try? Otherwise, it ain't worth it, especially if you're giving EA your money.
2838	1	a	Buy?  Likely  -=TL;DR=- WARP is an amusing action puzzler about an alien that is trying to escape a high security research facility using it's ability to teleport, internally combust canisters and enemies, and create an intangible clone of itself called an 'Echo'. It's a neat mechanic that isn't used in many games and lends itself to some intresting puzzles.  -=Overview=- WARP is a pretty neat game. It's semi cartoonish appearance hides it gory nature, as fragging enemies result in gory and satisfying explosions. The protagonist is a yellow alien that has been captured by humans for research. It soons gains or regains the ability to telport short distances, which allows it to move quickly and hide in objects of it's same size - which are mainly various canisters and the torso's of humans. The alien can 'charge up' these items, causing it to explode violently. Eventually, you can earn the ability to create an echo of yourself to distract enemies and later, swap places with objects, as well as the ability to throw objects that you are hiding in. Throwing and telefragging are the only ways to kill enemies beyond environmental hazards, so you need to use the camera to scope out an area and find out to get past guards and hazards,  -=Presentation=- On the PC, the game looks somewhat bad. The modeling and texture work itself and actually fairly smooth looking (though the alient model has some slight blockiness close up in cutscenes). The content and assets actually look good, but the total lack of anti-aliasing destroys that work, as everything on your screen looks almost as jaggy as PSX era games. I have a feeling the console versions doesn't have this problem. You will need use your graphics card anti-aliasing in order to improve this, but even after that, it looks more like an effect than a proper in-game smoothing. The developer failed on this part. There's not much to say about the soundtrack....I'm sure there was music and ambience, but I don't remember any track. The main menu has a nice extraterrestial sound though. The sound effects are great however - the warping effect sounds believable, explosions of objects and people seem realistic, and the alien makes a chittering, sqeaking type noise that make it seems like it came from another planet. The sound design, besides the lack of music (which admittedly, does help with the sterile research environment) works well for immersion.  -=Experience=- The game is fairly easy to play and may occasionally challenge you, but most players should be able to solve the game if you understand the mechanics. I only got completely stumped once. The game plays in an isometric fashion where you never change height (slopes and stairs) except for elevators to another floor, so I never thought about the game in that third height dimension. There is one moment where you must throw a canister over a obstacle about the height of the alien. Since you never have to do this anywhere else, it's easy not to realize you have to use the crane in the area to throw a canister over that obstacle. The average player is more likely to die from environmental hazards and turrets than they are from guards. Bosses provide some moderate challenge (especially the very annoying last battle). The biggest challengs comes from finding grubs through out the world and from challenge levels, These grubs are currency for minor upgrades available at certain checkpoints. There is no respec or buyback, so you should choose upgrades wisely, but fortunately, no upgrade is so necessary that you will loose if you didn't 'Build your toon correctly'.   The experience is severely ruined by the Origin/EA requirements. You have to log in to the game every time you launch, which doesn't make sense as there is no online experience beyond leaderboards and oddly enough, a friends system just for this game (it's possible that it would pull from your Origin friends - I don't have any though). You need to enter a key upon first use of the game. The login experience is pretty annoying, as it's easy to accidentally log out (at least for me) and have to log back in again. The login screen is mouse based, even though the game is mostly keyboard based and after typing your user name, you have to press tab twice to get to the password field where you can then login, and have another screen telling you that you have logged in (while still being able to control the main menu with your X Input controller, oddly enough), but having to use the mouse to click OK. It's way to clunky. More clunkyness ensues as you can't rebind the keys and it looks like the game assumes you have a controller connected (I did have one plugged in at all times, but I have a feeling the game will always show XBox style prompts regardless)  -=Conclusion=- I did enjoy the game and it's unfortunate that this game didn't appear to sell well (perhaps it did ok on consoles) - I only have two friends who have this game, and nobody else has wishlisted this. I've had this wishlisted for a long time due to its interesting mechanics. I think this game could have been extended tremendously with a level editor, where players can make levels for each other. Players who like to speed run can probably get enjoyment out of finding the fastest way to play this, but unfortunately, I've only seen one video for this. Funnily enough, some of the challenge levels have clearly hacked/cheated leaderboards, with times of literally .500 seconds. It's a good puzzler that gave me about 7 hours of enjoyment. A high skill player can probably do so in 1-3 hours less.
2840	1	a	The concept is good. Gameplay is fun.  The game is CPU intensive but shouldn't be. It is badly optimized, it lags horribly. It can become a slide show sometimes.  There's also a UI problem where you can use your gamepad for everything except for login into your EA account. At that exacte moment you have to use your mouse.  The puzzle difficulty is fine, but the challenges are impossible. I recommend this game only if it's on sale for 5$ or less. You can finish it in a cople of hours.
2842	1	a	This game is an absolute brilliant idea for a sneaky stealth type game. You are an alien that humans have beat up, drugged, and experimented on now it’s time to get even, it’s time to free yourself.   You have abilities to trick, deceive, and even make the humans explode. There is a limited amount of skill upgrades you can purchase using grubs you collect while sneaking around.  The first time I warped into one of the scientist bodies and made it explode made me laugh harder than I have in a while.  You look a lot like one of Gru’s minions, the one with the scuba googles on.  I hear some people complaining about EA’s need to have you log into their system to play. I personally didn’t find it that bad I already have an account with them for some of my other games.  I highly recommend this game one of the better ones I have played in a while.
2844	1	a	plays pretty cool with a controller but has pretty long loading times.   also freaks me out somtimes because one of the noises the alien makes sounds like it is saying my name
2846	1	a	its a very unique and fun puzzle game has a strong Portal 2 feel as i was playing it it felt like Mr. Peanut Vs. Apature Science... i will be doing at least 1 more playthrew of the game
2848	1	a	This game is just... Wow. In a good way.  Let me begin with the concept as a whole. You see many games about fighting some alien(s) that escaped containment, but how often do you actually get to play one?  Then there's the playability. Even though the unusual control scheme may be hard to get used to at first, it's completely worth getting used to. The only keys you need to know are the arrow keys and C. The mechanics are wonderful.  Finally, we have the story. I'm not going to say much because spoilers, but the ending was incredibly touching.  Of course, there are also bad things about it. Here are some of the things I thought the game was lacking: Level editor :c A sandbox mode after finishing the game, to explore the area. A demo.  And that's pretty much it. I absolutely recommend the game. It's got some of the best mechanics I've ever seen.
254	0	a	Entertaining, perhaps, for a time, but ultimately underwhelming. The learning curve is basically flat for the whole game till the end, where it suddenly spikes hard. Oftentimes you are placed in a situation with no solution discoverable -- obvious or otherwise. The narrator-type character's onscreen effect is the moral equivalent of alien beergoggles, it killed me more than once. The game proper has very little depth, the upgrades are too expensive for you to ever see more than two of them (of which you will most certainly want the fast-warp upgrade).  I never seemed to unlock the swap/launch upgrade, even now at the supposed end of the game.  The 'Explode people' mechanic is trite, the violence is unecessary pandering.  Taking a large view, this game feels short, two-dimensional (in terms of gameplay depth), and probably not worth 2$, much less 10$  Strong Reject on it's merits.
2850	1	a	My wife bought me this game because I assume it looked cute. Holy hell was I suprised when I blew a dude up.  It's an EA published game, take that with a grain of salt. Your 'progress' isn't tracked if you don't sign in but 'progress' is limited to high scores and distance travelled (and, you know, other things that GTA3 did for free) and all that. Don't let the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t cover the diamonds though.  The game is actually pretty fun. Took me a few hours and I didn't actually collect everything, not that it stops you from winning at all. Collectibles are... forgettable. I think they opened concept art or something. Didn't care. No real reason to collect all the grubs since the power ups are hardly neccesary. There are multiple ways to solve some rooms and some of the puzzles took a bit of thought. Death is quick and reloading is quick too, which is good. No long, drawn out, slow-motion falls or anything.  I have a newer rig so I didn't experience any slowdown or lag issues until one wierd room in the final areas but it cleared up after I died.  Overall, I recommend it. It's fun, it's different and it's a bit of a challenge. If you can stomach handing $10 to EA, go for it.
255	0	a	Can't even play the game becuase of EA, waste of 10 bucks. If you wanna take your chances and try to figure it out go ahead but i don't recomend it as it's a huge problem for everyone who bought the game via steam.
2852	1	a	good game but requires thought and patience while playing
2854	1	a	Funny action puzzler with a cute little alien. Nice game idea
2856	1	a	Simple and short. Puzzles are well thought out. A controller is a must.
2858	1	a	Cute sounds and graphics ? Check ! Good performance ? Ok-ish. Fun gameplay ? So so.  It's puzzle oriented, but there wasn't enough going on to keep me interested. And somehow, it reminded me of Splosion Man (don't ask me why, I think because of the graphics and somewhat repetitive gameplay).  [Rating: 70/100]
257	0	a	♥♥♥♥ EA and ♥♥♥♥ DRM!
2860	1	a	10/10 one of the greatest games I've played and it's cheap too. better make a sequel xD
2862	1	a	this game is a good puzzler with unique gameplay  8/10
2864	1	a	WARP is an action puzzle game with a very unique twist, your character is able to warp through objects or into them, allowing for all sorts of possible ways to access different areas or complete challenges. Initially the game felt a little too derivative of Wall-e in style, until you are introduced to the ability to warp inside of people and explode them from the inside out. From that point on I was intrigued and enjoying the aesthetic of cutesy style mixed with over the top gore. Both the Steam Overlay and widescreen modes are supported, as is the gamepad. The only unlikable aspect of the game is the third party EA DRM, but it's significantly less intrusive than the Ubisoft launcher or Windows LIVE. I would recommend this title to most gamers who enjoy twitch action and puzzle solving, but be prepared for some very difficult challenges and a high twitch factor similar to Super Meat Boy.
2866	1	a	Great puzzle game, with awesome mechanics.
260	0	a	Couldn't even stomach to play the game. I have an origin account and I use Origin regularly. But this ♥♥♥♥ is just annoying, and the menu controls reek of bad PC port. Can't even use a mouse in the menus? ♥♥♥♥ that.
261	0	a	You have to very obnoxiously create an ORIGIN account to 'play the game,' and by 'play the game' I meant have it repeatedly crash before getting to the main menu. Don't waste your money, no matter how cheap the retail price.  PS, Why can't Value, Microsoft &amp; EA implement the OAuth protocol so we can share a single profile &amp; authentication scheme across distributers?
2868	1	a	A great little game, its cartoon style belying a great deal of violence and disdain for human life (even more than the 'Splosion Man games). Smart puzzles, well-paced upgrades, and definitely doesn't outstay its welcome. Some of the cutscenes feel a bit awkward. Otherwise, no complaints.
266	0	a	♥♥♥♥ING EA, first you have to log in to your origin account and verify the game outside of the game, then you have to do it again inside the game. I'd tell you about the gameplay but it ♥♥♥♥ing crashed when i accepted the 200 pages of terms and conditions So ♥♥♥♥ this game, im going to go play some age of empires 2.
2870	1	a	Nice game!
2872	1	a	Bad port of an average game. Should have stayed on console.
280	0	a	Don't ♥♥♥♥ing buy it! You'll pay to get headache, not a good rest time. Technical implementation for PCs is ♥♥♥♥ing total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Pay me 100$ back - I won't ♥♥♥♥ing play it!  ) Rrrrrridiculous graphics optimization. Ingame graphics config is abscent.

281	0	a	I really want to WRAP my hands around the neck of the developer of this game...
2874	1	a	This is the greatest alien of All Time.
285	0	a	Should have been better...  The game clearly has something going for, the aspects about the premise in combination with the wonderful and shining aesthetics, all of that sharing a diverse and simplistic style of playing. It is a concept that i enjoyed, however, the biggest problem about the game comes just from the first minutes as i realize the game just doesn't have the options necesary for any 'pc game' to have.  My fear began as i witness only three options in the video settings, resolution, vsync, fullscreen, i could have accepted that if the game had allowed me to play or even traverse to the menus using my mouse, it didn't. Not only that but the game is locked at 30 framerates per second.  It's dissapointing to say the least, frankly the game is fun, but as i said before, it could have/should have been better.
2876	1	a	Once again, i find myself encountering a game that people refuse to buy for some reason (such as my friends, wont even hear me out on it!).  You play a Zero , a mysterious alien brought to a underwater science facility. Under a innocent facade, you are underestimated, until you regain your abilites...now reap your revenge in an effort to escape this evil place. Your ability? Easy, WARP. With this you can teleport a short distance in front of you, through walls, blockades and into barrels...and people. As you move through the facility, is becomes clear that stealth is vital and that you must uses your brains to solve reacurring and puzzling traps as you try to escape the clutches of the scientists. And now things get serious, as your abilites grow with (spoiler alert)    echo (a projectable ghost image of yourself), Swap (use your echo to swap places with a distant object) and Launch (shoot objects your hiding in at a violent force). And then there's Frag, the ability to explode things while your inside them, such as barrels, power supplies and...people , yes it can get a bit violent and in cold blood too, however, the scientist do talk like jerks...    With impressive graphics and a rare, third-person, open roofed take on gameplay, WARP packs quite a memorable punch and will have you unable to put it down until you have all those little, slippery, impossible to catch- why-would-you-put-food-there- grubs...(one day, one day i will have all of them and purchase all the extra abilities, oh yes i will...)    (for more great but surprisingly unknown games, cheak out Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet) 
2878	1	a	I just don't get why people complan about the whole EA thing. It doesn't border me AT ALL. Fun game, really addicted playing with a controller, and nice maps. I like the frag ability, especially when you make a scientist explode
2880	1	a	This is a conditional recomendation. Only buy this on sale. Only buy this if you have an xbox controller.  It is a fun game, with frustrating moments, ie you need to solve a puzzle the way they imagined or it glitches out, and the port is so lazy (you cannot tab between username and password fields. seriously.)   Also people have used memory editors to cheat the challenge system so dont question your sanity when the leaderboards have completed mazes in 0.023 seconds.
2882	1	a	Funny little puzzle game. Absolutely not for kids, even if the graphic at first approach seems so. A tad to hard last boss battle and and abysmal sad ending if you kill too much people which ... it's one of the game fun things. My suggestion ? Kill all and then see the good ending on the tube
2884	1	a	This review is coming from somebody who only has a mouse and keyboard (basically just keyboard for this game) and beat the entire game.  The concept of the game is decent enough to keep you playing, the legnth is roughly 6 hours and the difficulty curve is simple enough to grasp at all points in the game. There are some MAJOR MAJOR flaws with this game though, however, its not enough to give it a 4/10, I would rate this game a 6.5 making it a game that I enjoyed moderately.   The problem with this game lies in its final stages, clunky control and hit and miss gameplay, literally.   Final stages: The last boss will send you to anger management. It is the most uninspired fight i have ever seen and is reminiscent of a bad crash bandicoot boss fight. The final stages are also painful to play for a keyboard gamer (controller players seem to be ok) seeing as you need to be very precise with your aiming and control of the character.  Clunky control: If you preform the same action twice the results may not be the same. If you line your character up with a specific warp or you choose to throw an item the item may just wind up doing different things due to the physics engine; now don't get me wrong, in some games this may be good, however, in this game it is unforgiving and frustrating at times.  I still recommend this game simply because throughout all of my rage, and at times fun gameplay i still finished it, despite origin and whatnot. The game never crashed and never loaded slowly (and I loaded A LOT, TRUST ME.)   TL;DR: 6.5/10 Not great, not bad, precisely average. Pick it up if its ever on sale, 10 is a wee bit over what I would think this should cost.
2886	1	a	Fun little stealth-action and puzzle game.   Short but sweet. About 6hrs to complete, im about 1/3 done.  Does require EA or orgin login. Nice graphics, arcade style, fast-paced, lots of checkpoints but a bit shallow. However, very unique and reasonable price so worth a play imo if you have the time and played the other superior games. A bit spy chamelian favor.  Recommend for most ages even though it has a tad bit of dark humor.  7.5/10
2888	1	a	It's actually really fun, Stealth action like classic metal gear + puzzles elements like portal. but instead or portals you can warp short distances (through walls, into object even inside peoples bodies) it also features and upgrade stystem to gain new abilities or upgrade them. only thing i didnt like was i needed to sign into origins to activate the game on my PC, already had a origins account but I can see that being bothersome to some people. 
2890	1	a	Fun and original game, well done!
2892	1	a	Once you get past all of the EA crap, This is an original, highly entertaining game. I've only just started to scratch the surface and I'm really impressed with the mechanics. The teleporting system is cool and it's really great that you can choose whether or not to be a giant ♥♥♥♥♥♥. The EA Login is a massive pain in the ♥♥♥, but it's a one off thing and doesn't really matter. You can literally just put in a fake account, that's how little it affects everything else. All in all, a great game. 8/10
2894	1	a	If You dont like Humans.. then, this is the game for You.
2896	1	a	Loved the game! Took me a good chunk of time to play, simple controls, challenging, fun puzzles, and a neat protagonist. Highly recommend.
2898	1	a	THIS IS SO AWESOME!
2900	1	a	Of the six games included in EA's very own 'Indie Bundle', two titles had never crossed my ears: Gatling Guns and WARP. When I accepted from the latter its offer of a five hour journey, my expectations were low. I didn't expect anything earth shattering, but I also didn't expect WARP to be as fun as it is.  Played in aerial perspective, WARP's narrative follows the exploits of an alien named 'Zero' who finds himself captured by scientists and held hostage by mercenaries. Using his assortment of powers (primarily teleportation), Zero must escape the lab that confines him.  WARP breathes fresh air into the stealth genre with its deceptively childish visuals. Make no mistake, this is not for kids. F-bombs are dropped quite often and deaths are particularly gruesome. The gameplay demands of you to not only think, but also act hastily.  At the price of $9.99, WARP won't give you the most bang for your buck. But should you find it at a discount of 50% or more, it's worth a look.  Grade: B
2902	1	a	Solid puzzle game with an enjoyable plot, interesting puzzles and intuitive layout. Only about 4 hours of content though, so buy it on sale. Great little indie adventure.
2904	1	a	Bloodsire asked me to review this so here you go:   You can tell this game was built for consoles. If you warp into an enemy you have to hit left and right in order to burst them from the inside. Which is cool and all, but you have to use the arrow keys. For some reason it doesn't think that WASD should be default movement, and you can't change the key bindings in options.   Its okay I guess. Its kinda a puzzle lite sort of game, has some sort of clever stuff but also some frustrating stuff as well.   WARP MORE LIKE PORTAL LITE IMO GET ♥♥♥♥ ON NERDS!
2906	1	a	Warp is a great game if you like the combo of cute but deadly, you play as an alien who was captured by scientists who want to find out what makes you tick, you soon escape and find that you are not the only one, it is a pretty gory game, but an excellent one. It has a lot of challenges and pure genius moments that will make you smile when you complete them, very fun to play and easy to get into. My only complaint is the length of main story, but it does have challenge rooms that should keep you busy.
290	0	a	I would rate this as a good game, except for one thing. The graphics are pretty decent, the storyline and concept are original and attention-capturing. However, the controls are so screwed up on the computer that some sections are frustratingly difficult, and one boss is impossible. I can't recommend this game.
2908	1	a	remember how telefragging was so cool in quake? well now you can do it ALL THE TIME in warp!. coat the walls and floors in other people's blood. give this game a new paintjob, in sticky red.
292	0	a	Can't even get in to the game since EA forces you to sign up to Origin and then forces you to log in every time you boot up the game and when I log in it automatically crashes. P.S if someone knows how to fix it, tell me please.
2910	1	a	Great Game! Very addicting. I had no problems with EA, playing offline is the exact same fun. Do reccomend, escpeically while it's on sale.
293	0	a	Pros - Warp is interesting and pretty fun to play. It is also looks pretty good.   Cons- you have to deal with origin...ewww. The gameplay although fun at first is pretty flat. The game is 10$ which in my opinion is too much for a game like this. Might be a worthwhile purchase for $&lt;5.
2912	1	a	Great game, highly recommended!
294	0	a	DO NOT BUY THIS GAME  It's advertised as being indie. I buy it.  Cue forced Origin launch and crappy EA DRM.  So you jump through their hoops, and...  Come to a crappy Xbox 360 port with graphics that look like they came from the Playstation 2.  With no graphics settings besides screen resolution.  The keyboard controls are terrible, so you're pretty much forced to have an Xbox 360 controller. I have one that gets dusted off whenever I play Sonic Generations.  You get to uninspiring, repetitive gameplay that gets old FAST, and some of the worst boss fights I've ever played.  0/10 DO NOT BUY
2914	1	a	not bad for a puzzle game with little brutal allien, i would cost higher price than $10 if they build more stages in the game, actualy everything all end in quick and unplayable
2916	1	a	Funny misanthropic alien-bee with inconvenient controls for keyboard
2918	1	a	THis is a great little game. Well designed and the pacing is great. Once compelted, you will not likely pick the game up again- but its a great weekend spend!
2920	1	a	An instant classic if I ever played one. It reminds me of Oddworld in a way, in that your ability to fight back is extremely limited and require thought. Combine that with some very clever mechanics and Warp guarantees a fun time. Some parts can be frustrating, but getting through those parts can be a major source of satisfaction. All in all, a very unique atmosphere and very unique setting that makes for a very, very unique game.
296	0	a	EA has managed to lock me out of this game with their 3rd party activation scheme. Avoid this game like the digital plague. EA has managed to sucker me out of the purchase price. I'm extremely sorry I purchased this game.
2922	1	a	Very fun worth the money. But there is not mucht replay value.
2924	1	a	Cute (z)Hero and explosive mechanics, I've worked on this upgraded puzzle game during some great time @Tradpoor Inc.
2926	1	a	Once you get passed the one time EA annoyance of entering the CD key and having it sync with your Origin account, the game is a really well thought out action puzzle game. Some of the puzzles further on in the game can get a bit tricky but nothing is overly complex in my opinion. This is a really fun cute game. I personally wouldn't buy it for $10 CDN, but it was well worth the $2.49 CDN I spent during Steam Summer Sale 2016.
2928	1	a	Very fun game, creative and funny, while having the grit to make it balanced out and not slapstick. Highly recomended.
2930	1	a	For anyone stumbling across this review, 30,000,000 years after this game found it's final resting place deep in the bowels of the steam store; shell out your $5 to get this game. It is one of those little gems which has all the luster and charm you could possibly hope for. Adorable character, fun and interesting game mechanics, charming story and enviornments. And zero hope of the IP getting the continuation it was hoping for.
2932	1	a	Typical Tower Defence. There's not much I can say about this one. Good for a casual boring afternoon. I think it could be a good gift game but that about sums it up. 4.5/10
2934	1	a	Fun little tower defense game was worth the $1.24 i paid for it so it gets a good review from me.
2936	1	a	Really good &amp; fun Tower Defense game..... Enjoying my time playing this game..... Even more addicted than GTA V for sure.  It's been a while since i played this game, recently i just started to play it again and now i remembered why i stopped played it before... how time flies away while play this game.... so much fun to plan your tactics to encounter the incoming enemies.   You got to have strategies to deploy your arsenal under budget given at the start of the round, you received money after killing enemy which you can use to buy more arsenal to play with. Every mission contains about 20 or more rounds and every campaign contains multiple missions.
2938	1	a	Really hard tower defense game.  Has two main campaigns, the first is of which is easy enough but the second gets a bit harder. Also 'Quickplay' levels which are the same as in the campaign but with more limits on what turrets and upgrades are available.  It's very easy to pick up and learn, and smashing through the campaigns even on hardest difficulty is not terribly hard if you've played any tower defense games before, but the Quickplay missions for the second camapaign get diabolical, so good luck getting the associated achievements! Nice simple visuals, sound can get a bit annoying because certain things (explosions) are repeated a lot.  Overall it's good for a playthrough, and if you're into TD at all then make sure to play this.
2940	1	a	A pretty plain tower defense that's better suited for maybe a tablet. Still, surprisingly difficult.  6/10  It took me 2.5 years to beat two missions.
2942	1	a	 A 'rough gem'.
2944	1	a	iBomber Defense is about what you'd expect from a WWII themed tower defense game. Basic MG, Artillery, and AA emplacments are each designed to counter the stadard threats by land, air or sea. The maps can be challenging, particularly in areas where terrain prevents placement along likely paths, unfortunately, this isn't always obvious as occasionally open spaces will not allow placement. The campain mode is unfortunately linear, however, there will occasionally be 'defense' bonus levels, where you get to play a previous map with already placed towers and a nice purse to upgrade and expand from the get go. Although you'll be trying to defend against a more challenging string of attackers, extra 'action' points (for upgrading and expanding available defense options) will be easier come by  All in all, an easy game to pick up and put down whenever you get bored. It doesn't really stack up to some of the more dynamic tower defense games, but it gets the job done.
2946	1	a	I don't know why but I love this game. When I don't feel like thinking much I load this up and play for a bit. Its a pretty generic tower defense game. I think I got it for $5 which I'd say its worth that, any more than that is pushing it.
2948	1	a	Pretty good TD game
2950	1	a	Great little tower defense game. But there are equal alternatives that you can play for free. If it's on sale you can't do anything wrong buying it.
2952	1	a	Ratings: 7.1/10  The game is fair enough to play. Unlike any other tower defense game. Just have built-in aspects of its' own and creativity. Not much to say as I would sometimes play when I have the time. Worth playing if you like tower defenses games, but this is the average.
2954	1	a	nice tower defense - where's my touchscreen? td on mouse is so oldskool
307	0	a	I enjoy Tower Defense titles.  I did not enjoy this one  2/10
308	0	a	I don't even know when I got this game.
2956	1	a	As everything else has already been said before, only one word from me to describe this game:  B-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-M ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !  (And as 'Firepower' *hinthint* does still matter: ... Remember to turn the volume UP! ... :)
2958	1	a	I like this game. Gave me a good 'coffee and wakeup-game' experience. A few missions are damn hard, but not too hard, just like a good Tower game should be. I just wish there was more missions. I'd love some DLC here. Cheap and good, go for it.
2960	1	a	Alright 'Tower defense' game 7/10
2962	1	a	This game is very addictive. Maybe its the sound effects, maybe its the blowing up of stuff, i dunno but its definitely fun :-)
2964	1	a	A good, neat and well presented little TD that has a nice, logical and familiar control layout (reminds me of Gemcraft to some degree). ****
2966	1	a	if you are a tower defense buff then this is a great game to add to the collection requires patience like any tower defense but still an overall joyous experience
2968	1	a	iBomber Defense is one of the funnest tower defense games I have played in a long time. Especially because it is based on WWII. Also, the game developers are badass and didn't mind putting swastikas as well as iron crosses on Nazi jeeps, tanks, and other forces. A great game especially for the price. I'd have paid twice as much. By the way there is a sequel of sorts called iBomber Defense Pacific, which as you may have guessed is against the Japanese mainly from islands and mainlands shooting at boats and the occasional air raid. I have both but this one is my favorite. Fighting in the forests of German, and eventually Berlin is indescribable in how fun it is.
313	0	a	I got this game and it gave my computer some kind of major error. So be careful if you get this game.
2970	1	a	Great game. I've been playing these games on iOS for a long time asnd the deskyop version is judt as much, and just as challenging as you want it to be.
2972	1	a	This is a standard tower defense game, reasonably well done - you have the standard decisions to make of which type of turret to place and where to place it stop the waves of enemies making it to your base. As you kill enemies you earn money to either build more defenses, or in later levels to upgrade existing turrets to do more damage and/or increase their range (if you have unlocked the higher levels of that turret type).  The weapons are fairly well spread with clear differences and advantages which are fairly intuitive/sensible - machine guns fire fast but low damage and short range, artillery is slower but harder hitting and with bigger range, AA guns can only affect planes, etc. Equally the enemies have a decent variation - easy stuff for the beginning, then you will usually get mixtures of fast low armour units, slowish moving tanks, and so on, so you can't just build one type of turret and leave it at that, usually every wave you are having to react off what is coming and beef up the turrets of the appropriate type or add new ones to deal with the every increase numbers, speed or toughness of the units charging at you. Oh and then a wave of bombers comes onto the screen and you suddenly need to place down a couple of AA guns near your base, etc.  There is certainly nothing special or innovative here, but it is a solid tower defense game that is pretty well balanced, and could act as a good starting point to learn the basics of the genre, or just a more casual atmosphere and challenge than some of the more in depth/complex or genre blurred variations on this theme (Tower Wars or Defense Grid or Sanctum or Defender's Quest etc)
316	0	a	I love every kind of Tower Defense games and I would probably love iBomber Defense IF... yes, there are many bad things. Starts very slow, every each of level is slow and that goes from beggining to very end of game. Not many different enemies, those are same in every level. You can't switch to other window while playing because the game will be paused - WHY WOULD YOU DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN DEFENSE TOWER GAME WHERE EACH OF WAVE IS GOING VERY SLOW AND THERE IS NO WAY TO MOVE IT FASTER - EVEN ON HIGHEST SPEED IT EVERYTHING MOVES LIKE TURTLE. Level desing is also rather poor and graphics aren't 'fantastic', like Steam store page is saying. I don't mind that i's iOS/Android port, there are game which can be also good. Too bad there are almost no devs which would care about making it more enjoyable on PC. I had trouble enjoying it thought first campaing. The rest was just a hell which has finally ended...
2974	1	a	A really fun and simple tower defense game. Looks quite nice too and has some fun maps. Quite cheap and provides some good fun and challenges.
2976	1	a	One of the best Tower Defense games I ever played..
2978	1	a	A good, if dull, tower defense game. Doesn't really have it's own style, which is where Plants vs Zombies really thrived, and even Defense Grid had a bit with the robot narator, but nothing here. Regardless, good TD game that is only $5, and I have not completed both campaigns yet and have logged on 8+ hours so far. Seems like a good rate to me.
2980	1	a	I got this on sale for 60% Off. This is a really fun game to un-wind with; casual, easy, fun and addictive. There are plenty of Steam achievements to make it more interesting too, but no trading cards. Check a youtube video to get a feel for gameplay dynamics. Kick back and mow-down the incoming mechanized infantry and armor when you need to take a break from your favorite RPG first-person-shooter.
2982	1	a	The game is a tower defense game. Is it worth $10 maybe not for something you can play on a Browser for free. If you can get this game for $5 or under. I think its worth the game time. Its fun and I enjoy playing this.
2984	1	a	Very good tower defence game and a cheap one too =)
2986	1	a	Cool, simple tower defender. Limited in scope, but not bad for $5.
2988	1	a	Great game, highly recommended!
2990	1	a	An ok TD for a ok price. Bog standard TD where enemies go on a set path (no mazing) and just build/upgrade towers. Decent amount of missions and can be quite challenging.
2992	1	a	It's oke, i r&amp; 8/8 pls no h&amp; i'll open the g&amp; for my m&amp;
2994	1	a	It's super funny to play this!
2996	1	a	This game is well worth the £3.00
320	0	a	A lazy port from a tablet game. The different levels have random difficulty and there's nothing really unforgettable or just cool in this very classical tower defense.
2998	1	a	70/100  Good military TD with Support buildings and a 1-time REPLAY button for the round ;D Long Missions and good Campaign (WorldWar2), but 1 mistake can cost you half the game ;)  Worth the money, but needs some finetuning to become a classic!
322	0	a	Very Very bad sound quality on towers. very short on towers, you can choose from 5 difrent only. ive seen free to play tower defence waaaay better than this. dont buy this....
3000	1	a	Addictive and deceptively tough little Tower Defence game. One of the top 3 TD games I've played. Well worth the price.
323	0	a	It seems cool, it seems nice, but it's a trap. It's not close from being a solid platformer. The music is nice, I must say, but the game is deadly short and Storm is not that easy to control. All the nice mechanics are in the bonus levels. There are some cool parts in the game that are hommages to older games.  It's not worth 5$ at all in my humble opinion.
3002	1	a	Storm in a Teacup is a variation of the saying “a tempest in a teacup which really means taking a small event and blowing it out of proportion. Since it means making something out of nothing, I’m really struggling with why you’d name your game that. Good news though, the title is really the only thing about this game that’s not awesome. And that’s worth making a bit of a fuss over.  Storm in a Teacup’s controls are pretty straightforward. There are controls to move left and right and then a button to jump, though it’s really more of a take flight kind of motion. You have a charge meter that starts to deplete the second you tap the button and take off. Once the bar runs out you start falling back to the ground and the meter refills. You can double tap to boost higher, and building up speed before launching will definitely send you further.  You’ll use this jump to navigate obstacles and avoid pitfalls, collecting keys and triggering little contraptions to move your way through the various levels. So really, all the standard tropes you’d find in any platformer, except it puts a heavily reliance on its use of physics in the game world. As such, you could safely say the game took some of its inspiration from titles like Little Big Planet. Because both you and the objects you interact with are supposed to convey weight and momentum.   This is one of those cases where the game seems to have been changed in order to accommodate a witty title. Why is the character onscreen named “Storm and why does he fly around in a teacup? Cause it fits the name of the game. Don’t get me wrong, it works gameplay wise, it’s just that it makes zero sense in the game world or reality.  Speaking of “game world Storm in a Teacup continually dazzles with its style, looking like something a child would dream up. Mean dark clouds have sinister frowns, platforms are tied up by rope, and some enemies look like they’re made out of cardboard. It’s adorable and trippy all at the same time.  But don’t be fooled by the cute look of the world, this game gets hard with a capital H. Storm in a Teacup will look to test even the most veteran platform gamer’s skill and patience. Luckily the game is never unfair about it, and you’ll never find yourself in a place where you can’t see because of a bad camera or faulty level design. You can always see what you need to do, it’s just a matter of making it happen.  With the exception of the name, which is cute, but when taken at it’s meaning does a disservice to the game, I have nothing bad to say about Storm in a Teacup. It’s gorgeous, controls well and offers a good solid challenge. I’ve played a lot of games that I’d consider a tempest in a teapot, but Storm in a Teacup isn’t one of them.
3004	1	a	This game is a perfect game for kids. I played this with my 4 year old and my 8 year old and they loved it. It can be tough at times, but most of this game is forgiving. It's a typical platforming game with a cool floating/soaring gimmick attached to it. It takes a bit to get used to, but once you get the hang of it the game itself is pretty simple. The graphics aren't anything to really brag about, but they fit the gameplay. Overall, a great game to play with your kids. If you are an adult, you might lose interest from its simplicity. Even the achievements are simple.
325	0	a	I genuinely feel bad about this review. I don't recommend this game, and yet, I do. I did not particularly love my time with this game, but I have family members who would. Its charms were fairly lost on me, but I have no problem imagining that others would be completely absorbed.  The reason for my conflicting emotions is that this game does not have any specific failings. It is enormously adorable, has a great visual style, pretty tight controls (including controller support), a charmingly cute soundtrack, and simple level design / gameplay.  The only real problem is that it is not captivating at all. It is spectacularly simple, and fairly repetitive. I could have kept playing without really forcing myself, but I also would have been just as happy to stop playing and turn on an old rerun of Top Gear.  So, I'm torn. Do I review a game for how I could see others taking its charms? Or, rather, do I review a game with my own personal opinion of it? I tend to lean more towards the personal aspect of reviews, so that's why I chose not to recommend it.  It's not that I think it's stupid. It is cute, it is easy to play, and it is incredibly cheap. If you have a young child in the house, they will probably love this game. In fact, I will be recommending this to my father, since he loves buying games for my nephews to play when they visit. I tend to like my sidescrollers with a bit more substance, however. Give me Cave Story+, Chasm, Guacamelee, or any 2D Castlevania any day of the week.  Take this all with a grain of salt, of course. If the video in the game store looks interesting to you, give it a try. You have only $5 to lose, and you can barely buy a burrito for that much any more.
326	0	a	The best thing you can say is that this game is incredibly average. Just another mediocre platformer like hundreds of thousands of others. No special and interesting ideas, no cool/spooky/funny story and nothing that would make you improvise while playing. Gameplay is very forgiving so its good for kids or if you look for easy game.
3006	1	a	This is really quite a sweet little game, very relaxing. There's challenge if you want it, in beating each level first time, but it can be played slowly and in bits too. Quite fun!
3008	1	a	Decent platformer, worth getting in a sale/bundle.
3010	1	a	A fun 2D platformer that provides sufficient challenges to frustrate yet reward the player at the same time.  The game is easy to play bar from one or two of the later levels that see a difficulty spike.  Trying to achieve a perfect score on every level kept me coming back for more, yet it never felt like a chore; more like a fun way to further enjoy the game.
3012	1	a	Storm in a Teacup is a nice little platformer with puzzle elements; the levels are short enough to play on coffee breaks, and there's a nice amount of variation in backgrounds, game elements, and throwbacks to classic games like Space Invaders. It runs on a 2D physics engine meaning there's a lot of things bouncing and swinging off of each other; this gets especially interesting in the bonus levels that can turn sideways and upside down. Once you've completed each level, you can try to do it again finding a hidden object and without dying, to get extra rewards (well, achievements).  The downside is that there's only one song in the game, which may get repetitive after awhile. There's no story to speak of, and not a lot of replay value. Still, the game is well worth a shot.
3014	1	a	Nice little game, good getaway from all these AAA titles. Also, its my first perfected game on Steam :D
327	0	a	I really dont reccommend this game, it was a waste of money when i bought it, very repetitive gameplay, one whole music track thats just 20 seconds of music looped, and just in general an extremely boring game:/
3016	1	a	If you like mobile games, but wish they were less mobile, then this game is for you, I guess.
3018	1	a	Great for competitive play. Worth the 74 cents I spent on it.
328	0	a	It's... really bloody basic. It looks kinda cool, but the gameplay is just way too simple. So... just like every other iOS game!
329	0	a	Quite boring.
3020	1	a	Cute platformer with cute graphics. I don't really understand why they chose a teacup but that's not really important. It took me around 4 hours to get perfect in all the game modes and I had a lot of fun completing all of them. There's really nice and unique level design thoughout the game. For the price of ~4€ I will happily recommend this game.
3022	1	a	This game gives me nightmares
3024	1	a	If Super Mario 3 and Braid had a baby, this game would be it LOL....Dodge the madbro clouds of firey doom, jump over the buzz saws of death, and flying/gliding through death traps...this game is pretty cool. ( ps - don't fall in the lava XD )
332	0	a	This looks awesome but it deosn't. Repetitive and annoying music. Gameplay is bad. It should be a free flash game. Waste of money!
333	0	a	Repetitive... good for a mobile, got this game in a bundle so.. 6/10
334	0	a	This was the most painful 92 minutes of my life. It is not only locked at 30fps, but it makes no ♥♥♥♥ing sense. Why is the ♥♥♥♥ in a teacup? What is the premise of this game? Why is he so slick? But most importantly, why the ♥♥♥♥ would anyone pay $5 for this peice of ♥♥♥♥. I am physically sore from the stres this game has put me through. I am fairly sure that i have lost %50 of my hair. I need compensation for this, but mostly, i need answers. 
335	0	a	This game gave me progeria.
336	0	a	The simplest and least-adorned iOS/Android 'worthy' side-scroller that I've finished on Steam. An appropriate challenge level and presentation for young children, who are probably much much better than me at video games. But hey, at least it ran on my impossibly unhappy video card!
3026	1	a	This is such a cute little awesome game, I highly recommend it!
3028	1	a	This isn't really a POSITIVE recommendation. It's more of a 'Beware of buying this' recommendation.  First of all, this game is SUPER easy. I'm thinking it was probably developed with 10-13 year olds in mind. As in, if you have a 10-13 year old, they MIGHT find this game challenging (maybe), but you certainly won't. The only way you'll find this even remotely challenging is if your fingers don't work, for some reason, and you're forced to play with your toes and/or tongue.  That being said, it is kind of cute, though. The levels start out super bland, but as you advance through the levels, the puzzles and gameplay turn more and more clever and amusing, although still not any more challenging.  I'm betting a good gamer could finish the whole game in about half an hour. I guess that's why it's only 5 bucks.  I'd suggest getting it if you're extremely bored and have nothing else to do and want a good way to waste half an hour. DO NOT expect a hard game, though.
3030	1	a	Game of the century!!!!!!! 100/100 10/10 5/5 1/1 PERFECT SCORES OMG YES SO GOOD PLEASE BUY. THIS GAME SUPPORTS SLAVERY. THIS GAME ADVERTISES NUCLEAR WAR. THIS GAME RECOMMENDS DRUG USE, SPECIFICALLY ECSTASY. THIS GAME IS LITERALLY A BAG OF RAINBOWS STUCK IN A HAIRY GORRILA ♥♥♥♥. THIS GAME IS SO GOOD THAT I BOUGHT THIS FOR EVERY SINGLE CHILD IN AFRICA BECAUSE IT'S SO NUTRITIONAL. GREAT GAME. YES. MUCH BUY. VERY GOOD.
3032	1	a	With many similarites to 'Little Big Planet', this cute classic platform game has you running and jumping around crayon-drawn environments with moving obstacles, collecting sugar-cubes and stickers before finding your way out of the level. 'Storm in a Teacup' also has lots of Steam achievements and is definitely worth every penny of its tiny price tag.
3034	1	a	A very short platformer game. It's not bad, but I wouldn't recommend it. I went through all the levels in approximately 90 minutes. I finished a quarter of them with perfect score, but I don't really see any reason to return to the rest and try to improve. All the same with the bonus levels.   The game itself is pretty decent and the difficulty is quite okay. The physics sometimes behave a little erratically, and/or counterintuitively, but at least the behaviour is consistent, so once you get used to it, it's not a big deal.   Overall, the game is not bad, but I suggest you go and play some Tobe's Vertical Adventure instead.
3036	1	a	Super Meat Boy, as imagined by Disney. Don't be deceived by the looks, this game is ruthless.
3038	1	a	If, like me, you dream of piloting a giant tea cup, through a hazardous land, collecting sugar cubes for ... tea, presumably. Then this is basically not to be missed. Even if you have at best an impartial attitude towards oversized tea cups and the collection of sugar cubes, it's hard not to recommend this one. I imagine the experience of playing this for such a person to be something of a spirtual awakening. The soundtrack alone is worth the money, infact if anybody knows where I can get a CD copy of it to play in my car please post below. I should mention though in this review it's probably not suitable for youngsters due to the obvious adult themes and content.
3040	1	a	Not quite worth the money it is, but it's a fun little game!
3042	1	a	Fun game, not to hard to 100% if you're into that. The game's style is cute and I would describe it as a Super Meat Boy for kiddies. Buy it if you have a boring weekend!
3044	1	a	Appart from the classics, I'm not much of a fan of platformers, but this one is pretty good! Appart from the fact that the art is crap (I know it's obviously aimed at kids but even then it's still pretty poor) the gameplay is really good and it's very addicting! I got it in a ♥♥♥ pack otherwise I probably wouldn't of picked it up myself!
339	0	a	What the ♥♥♥♥ is this ♥♥♥♥? yes 420/teapot   if you buy this game with real money re-evaluate your life
3046	1	a	I love this game! I had a lot of fun playing this game! I totally recommend!
341	0	a	This game belongs on an iPhone, and it's a bad port for PC. The music is repetitive and the controls are floaty.
3048	1	a	Should be a free game i guess...  But well its ok to play it with your kids or little cousins.  Too much hearts and stuff like that going on tho -.-
3050	1	a	The game is fun and challenging without being frustrating. I recommend it. There is nothing that I disliked.
3052	1	a	I love how this game makes me think creatively when I play it. Excellent example of how the latest computers and graphics are not required for a game to have a surprising amount of depth. Bravo to Rohrer for creatively expanding the medium without perpetuating the industry's ever expanding, harmful, and needless hardware and software upgrade cycles.
348	0	a	It's entertaining for all of five minutes, by which point it begins to feel like it has outlived its purpose. The gimmick is neat, but there's so little actual game here that it's not worth even a few bucks to give it a try. If you want a sense of infinity, go look up Space Engine or some such prodecural game with real scope- IaSFS just manages to feel claustrophobic, and since the entire premise is procedural generation, thoughtless.
3054	1	a	Inside a Star-Filled Sky is an extremely clever concept that doesn't ultimately end up going much of anywhere.  The idea is that you're a symbol exploring a top-down universe, shooting at monsters and collecting powerups. The trick, though, is that everything is fractal; instead of grabbing a powerup you can shrink down inside it, and then shrink down inside an enemy inside of that, and so on. You have a procedurally-generated infinity to explore.  Exploring is all there really is to it, though. As far as I've been able to tell there isn't any actual goal except to survive as long as possible and travel as far as possible.
3056	1	a	This game is mind-destroying, but very fun (even though I'm terrible at it, I still had a bunch of good laughs at my fauilure). The systems are simple on the surface, but can be as complex as you are willing to make them.
3058	1	a	I really liked this game. It was frustrating AS ♥♥♥♥ sometimes, but I still enjoyed it a ton. It does have a far-off goal for you to reach eventually, and it was very pretty. Would recommend.
3060	1	a	It's a weird game, a shooter where you're plopped in and never really ends. Sort of a zen-like experience that is fun to just pass the time away. There isn't much of a failure state, when you're shot you are sent back a level. It's one of the games I don't mind just plopping back into for it's simplicity.
349	0	a	This game is punishment wrapped in desire mixed with hope.
350	0	a	Frustratingly poor game design. Single idea with crap tacked ontop. Game doesn't have a menu, don't have a clue wtf I'm doing or if there are even any other buttons. WTF do flags do? Is there a ♥♥♥♥ing goal to the game? No? Good, so I won't have to worry about sleepless nights wondering what happens at the end. ♥♥♥♥it
351	0	a	I just don't get it.  The game throws you violently into gameplay, with little explanation on what to do. There's no tutorial later on, you pretty much have to figure out everything by yourself.  The game itself is very confusing if you don't know how it works. For my part, I still can't figure out what each thing does, or what the goal even is. The art is fine and pretty good actually, but there's nothing much more to it. What a pity!  Unless you can reach out to the developer so he can explain what the hell you're supposed to do, then you might be better off not getting this game, or at least, not until it gets polished a little more!
3062	1	a	An amazing bullet hell shmup. A marvel of simple design using complex concepts with confident execution. Jason Rohrer finally makes a gamers game, without abandoning his lofty concepts of art in the framework of game design.  I could go on about the procedurally generated levels and enemies, the over one hundred thousand bullet power up combos, the recursive progression through (into? out of?) levels and the emergent game play the arises from this mix. I could talk about the philisophical implications that these factors evoke. But I'm just going to leave it at this; It's a blast of a shmup that will give you infinite variety within the framework of its design.
3064	1	a	This game is so wonderfully confusing. Honestly the reviews say more than I can think to say. I will say this, just as you start to comprehend the rabbit hole you're exploring it slaps you in the face and amazes you all over again. It's freaking hard but it's just so beautiful.
3066	1	a	Interesting concept, but not very engaging and seemingly directionless.  Worth a recommendation for it's novelty and interesting design (concerning the items.are.a.world.within.a.world.ception mechanic), but if you're anything like me it'll lose interest as soon as you've examined and appreciated this clever little idea enough.
3068	1	a	So this game doesnt make any sense AT ALL. You play as a whatever the hell you play as then you can go inside of things and explore them... Well this game is infinite and has more than 2,000,000 stages. You need to get your score up as high as you can. It really doenst make any sense at all, watching something being burned up under freezing water makes more sense than this.
357	0	a	Quite a letdown, only thing i regret having in my library
3070	1	a	Inception: The Game
3072	1	a	This game rocks. I've not gotten such a combination mind/body rush from any other game for some time. I like to play in short bursts, unless I really get on a roll. It's not all apparent, or easy, at first, but once it clicks it's a blast. Give it a chance )
3074	1	a	The reviews come close to showing what this game is about, but it can't show you just how good it is because what you'll see will be different than what anyone else sees. The strategies that you will come up with will be different. It's because your arenas will be different, your power up options will be different, and your enemies will be different. This is a different kind of game.  There are only two things about this game that some people may not like. The graphics are blocky and there is no goal other than the level you reach.  If you love a challenge, and enjoy slick game design, you should play this.
3076	1	a	Recursive, funny, cute, harcore, bullet hell combined with mind faxing mechanics, only meant to be played for an eternity.
3078	1	a	SHUMPception. A level within an enemy, within a powerup within yourself within another enemy. Stop. Look at your level. Where are you? Inside another enemy. What did you just enter? A pickup, Up a level. Now your back within yourself. Look again you are now within another enemy
3080	1	a	This is the soul of video games right here: one man doing all the artwork, music, and programming for a game. It's how the industry began! The result in this case is something more unique than most corporate-funded teams would ever think of, much less dare to release.  Ever seen the movie 'Existenz'? Don't. It's silly. See 'The Thirteenth Floor' instead. It's way better. Anyway, both movies tackle the idea of recursive realities. Inside a Star-Filled Sky puts CONTROL of that concept at the core of a gaming experience. That enemy's too tough? Enter him, dumb-down his abilities, exit, then waste him with ease. Alternatively, enter yourself, learn Kung Fu, exit, then waste him with ease.  Jason Rohrer has made a game that's thought-provoking, moderately mind-bending ('What was I trying to do again? And which level of reality IS this?!'), a good bit of pixelphilic fun, and simply worth your money. If nothing else, I admire his proper use of hyphenation. Support literate games!
3082	1	a	A really fun, interesting game. It's based around the idea of infinity but as to not sound pretentious, I'll just say it manages to be thought provoking with very little.   Thankfully, its also quite good as a game. The shooting is fun with a variety of different projectile types that can be combined for a ton of completly different combinations. It is a shmup so expect it to get hard quite fast. There a few other cool systems. Can't get past a enemy? Dive inside it and give it mediocre weapons. There is much more to it then it seems at first.   My only complaint is that the backgrounds get repetitive fast, which isn't the best thing when the game never ends.  For the price your getting a really unique and fun shooter that could last you a very long time.
3084	1	a	Hello Gamers.   Look at your level. Now back to mine. Now back to your level. Now back to mine. Sadly, it isn't mine. But if you stopped shooting blindly and started deleveling enemies, it could look like mine.  Look down. Back up. Where are we? You're inside yourself in the level your level could look like. What's in your hand? I have it. It's a power-up that increases your Rate of Fire. Look again. The power-up is now Bullet Size!  Anything's possible when you play 'Inside a Star-Filled Sky' and not cover-based rail shooters.  I'm in a Health-Up.
3086	1	a	Inside a Star-Filled Sky is by far one of the most curious games I have played in a long time. Featuring a recursive level diving type system that allows you to go into your enemies, power ups and even yourself and change aspects of the respective object to change the game around. The gameplay itself is much like many other twin stick shooter type deals but a lot more tactical. I myself am not entirely sure who I'd recommend this to but it certainly is an interesting concept.
3088	1	a	So, pretty much everything on a game map is itself a potential game map and you can enter them and collect powerups to change the thing the game map was based on. The powerups you collect inside an enemy affect its abilities, the powerups you collect inside powerups affect the nature of the powerup you are in, and the powerups you collect inside yourself affect your own abilities. Only the last 3 powerups have an impact, and not until you leave the thing you're in and pop up to the level you entered it from. Every map has a square for popping out of it, so there is no 'top' layer.  It can get a bit dizzying, but the awesome number of potential powerup combos, plus the strategy of altering the game elements around you to suit your needs, plus the difficulty scaling based on depth and powerup collection, plus the ability to plant your flag and mark those places where nobody has been before make this a fairly worthwhile game. (My flag is a black glider on a blue field. Try to find it!)
3090	1	a	Where am I?
3092	1	a	I don't play free flash games in my browser anymore, I pay $0.50 and download them on steam now.
3094	1	a	This is a really charming game, I only found this game because I won it during the Winter 2014 Auction, and i'm surprised that i've never seen it before because it's fantastic. I like the art style of the game, The game has quite a lot of attention to detail, such as a 'level select' area where you can pilot a space shuttle and you can mess around with it for a few minutes and crash into space rocks. I've only played through two levels so far but they've both been quite atmospheric as well and i love the underground areas as they feel like they add even more to the levels.   I really like the physics of the game too as the physics add to the experience and add another element to the gameplay rather than how physics are incorporated into most games now, and just 'being there' rather than actually adding anything to the game.  So far it's quite simple and i'm not sure if it will manage to stay captivating for the entire game but right now i'm having a lot of fun with the game.  Only had a quick play of this game so far but definitely looking forward to playing more.
3096	1	a	Worth every cent of the $0.21 I paid for it.  Best game made with MS Paint ever.  Okay, a more serious review.  Beep has some good ideas, and with the recent sub-$1 sale it's was a good value, but this game was tossed out to customers before it was done.  Game play concepts are good and the game is fun, but it starts too slow and the early levels are somewhat boring. Later levels get better, but it doesn't seem like this title was in development for a long time. It seems a little rushed.  Every time something like a bomb explodes, I see black blocks on the screen where I suspect smoke would be, but instead I am getting some kind of graphical glitch.  The user interface, especially the main menu and options, were slapped together at the last minute by an unpaid intern.  Barriers and puzzles are unfortunately a bit weak. I was hoping for a better challenge.  And finally, I think some players give up in the first few minutes to game play when they have trouble figuring out how to deploy for the first time. It took me a few minutes to figure out what I was supposed to do, and it was unnecessarily frustrating.  Beep is kinda fun, but be sure to get it on sale. It's not a value at full price.
3098	1	a	Tight controls, colorful levels, zany enemies...would recommend for younger audiences, not really equipped to challenge an adult audience.   Play this one with your kids.
3100	1	a	 B  rilliant  E  ntertaining  E  xcellent  P  latformer
3102	1	a	I made a profit from selling trading cards I got from this game.
3104	1	a	A real gem of a game, I haven't finished it yet but what I have played so far was really enjoyable. Even if it seems there won't be hours and hours of gameplay, what I have played so far is still incredibly fun and since the game is cheap, well worth it. I recommend this game!  (There was a slight bug at the start with screen size, but to fix this all you need to do is press ALT + Enter to go windowed)
3106	1	a	I played this with my son, so I may have a bias here. This is a simple platforming action game. You are a robot in search of gold in different worlds. Your robot can fly temporarily and you must go through a few different worlds ranging from ice worlds, to desert worlds. The game doesn't necessarily stand out, however the tight controls and the cartonny graphics and animation make it a good play for young children. Definitely gets a thumbs up for its accessibility for my son.
3108	1	a	You be a cute WALLE-esque robot and try not to get blown up
3110	1	a	its nice, starting to get boring but.
3112	1	a	It's better than it looks. The gravity gun mechanic is done really well, and the physics puzzles are solid. And there's new stuff to play with introduced in each world to keep things fresh.  Plus it's really cheap. I recommend it
3114	1	a	This game is a cute adventure that starts out a cakewalk then ramps up.
3116	1	a	A fun little platformer. Took me a little over 6 hours to complete the whole game and I'm usually not very good at these games. The later levels were quite challenging. Aside from some graphics glitches (black boxes sometimes randomly appear when you kill an enemy) this game was a lot of fun. Too bad certain game elements were restricted to specific worlds, like flying and grappling. Some sort of Expert levels with all of these elements at your disposal, mixed with hordes of enemies, would have made a great and more challenging addition.  Well worth the price tag, but I reckon most of it will be too easy for fans of the platformer genre.
3118	1	a	Just bought the game the day before writing this review... I don't usually write reviews on such short play time however this is one of a very select few side scrolling platformers that have actually kept my interest...   1&gt; the little robot you control is absolutely friggin adorable...  2&gt; the gameplay is so smooth and clean...  3&gt; the graphics and sound are just crisp and clear... 4&gt; Great setting  A VERY WELL put together game... I bought it on sale for $1.29, buI feel it's definitely worth it's usual price tag if you are into the puzzle side scroll platformers... Similar games I'm also a fan of are: Limbo, Giana Sisters and Trine...
3120	1	a	Awesome game   A simple game with sweet graphics and good physics and awesome soundtrack.
3122	1	a	This had to be, one of the best 19 cents spent.            Just gets hard at level one in desert xD
3124	1	a	Extremely fun, highly recommended
3126	1	a	I bought this game, laugh and tears, looking for a reason to live. I then proceeded to download the 2 mb of joy this gem has, and clicked install. At first, I was astonished, stunned in front of such graphics. I was in the main menu, in the space shuttle. I bought this game expecting nothing, but it was so big. I have no further need to buy No Man's Sky, this game has it all. Alien tractor poop with physics of gamemaker 2003, I still don't know how I could be more amazed by such a game in the next years. This game has revolutionized the industry of gaming, and renamed the whole concept of fun. As an ex-Christian, I have to admit I changed my religion, to BEEP. This living creature gives me chill everytime I open it. It's a tunnel of fun which leads to confidence and creativity. Before BEEP, my life had no meaning and sense, but I now follow the true life that other people would be jealous of. I often post screenshots of BEEP on my facebook page, but it seems like no one else likes BEEP as much as I do, which is why I think it is the greatest spiritual presence I could follow.  If you are reading this, I am truely greateful for you, because your life can get meaning with the simple ''Add to cart'' button.   This game is a masterpiece, and I will forever be happy that BIG FAT ALIEN released this incredible pearl.
3128	1	a	If you combine platforming from the Mario games, and mix it with the half-life gravity gun and physics, you have BEEP.  BEEP is a colorful game about physics and platforming.  Pros: Colorful and bright graphics. Amazing puzzles and physics. Picking up random crap and throwing it to kill enemies is the funniest thing ever. Many different levels and worlds, each with their own enviroment. Cons: The physics can be broken very easily. Not a very good storyline. A few bugs I've ran into, but not very many. There should be a 1-2 second delay between reloading your gun.   I would recommend buying this game on a sale (I got it for around 0.20$ on a sale) because the game goes on sale often.   Now, for the rating: I'm giving this game a recommended 6.0 rating, but that's just my personal opinion. I love these types of platformer games, so if you don't like platformers, don't take this rating to heart.  Anyway, that's my review.  I'm out. ~Darkel  
3130	1	a	Fun little platformer with a nice physics engine, a nice combat and a very forgiving difficulty. At the current price it's a must have for all.
3132	1	a	Amazing game! would recommend this! 10/10

3136	1	a	ehh~~ buy this game for fun pls, not for farming card :P
3138	1	a	BEEP... The BEST...ROBOT...EVER!
3140	1	a	Robot has gravity gun 11/10 Half-Life 3 confirmed
3142	1	a	BEEP is a simple physics based puzzle platformer. No controller support that I could detect, but the WASD keyboard and mouse controls provide a good degree of control and feel right. You maneuver a little robot that is equipped with a cannon and a tractor beam which allows you to shoot enemies and manipulate objects in the environment in an effort to collect energy crystals. The game also has some fitting sound effects and music for the game's theme. Kind of average--nothing that hasn't been done before.
3144	1	a	It's a game where you play a little robot who I imagined is the love child of Wall-e and Eve. The game has puzzles that range from easy to agonizingly easy. It did however play on my love of throwing crap at other crap. If you are going to play it I recommend playing it carelessly (John Rambo style) otherwise there is no challenge, except for the last level which the horrible swinging physics will kill you. There's a hint that there will be a sequel, so hopefully they will ramp up the difficulty and give us a proper ending. Alright, could've been better.
3146	1	a	-Buy this game on sale -Get trading card -Sell it  Profit $$
3148	1	a	Somehow the soundtrack is more expensive than the game itself.
3150	1	a	This game is adorably fun! Like some weird cross between Yoshi's Island, LocoRoco, the Gravity Gun from Half-Life 2, and imaginings of Dead Cyborg (look it up, it's awesome!), BEEP is worth $5 USD!
3152	1	a	 ..beep?   Seriously, though. It's a fun game if you're looking for something to waste your time on or just mindlessly explore.
3154	1	a	Worth every ♥♥♥♥ing penny at .19 cents.
3156	1	a	Thanks for cards! YAY!
3158	1	a	' a gravity gun right out of Half-Life' not quite 'Despite its friendly art style, this is a hardcore platformer in the truest sense.' not quite. it's a casual time waster but it's okay not worth $5
3160	1	a	' a gravity gun right out of Half-Life' not quite 'Despite its friendly art style, this is a hardcore platformer in the truest sense.' not quite. it's a casual time waster but it's okay not worth $5
3162	1	a	Very good! Genuinely puzzling yet fun levels, at least 4 hours of gameplay.  Remarkable physics for an indie game, though totally exploitable to glitch through some of the obstabcles, though that part just adds fun. I would buy this even if it costed more. The graphics are a bit cartoon-ish, more appealing to children, but that's fine. The only downside is - I could not find a settings menu, so I guess you can't change controls and volume.  10/10
3164	1	a	Tab and Click for Beep  BEEP is cute style platformer with puzzle solving and action shooting, but pity that it's Keyboard and Mouse control only.  Good: - Cute character and world design - Nice Happy mood music - Stage select by spaceship is funny - It's cheap and with cards  Bad: - No controller support - Step on damaged evil robot as platform sometimes tideous - Stage and enemies type is few  Verdict: Only recommend to get it on big sales  Score: 5/10
3166	1	a	I bought this game on a sale for 0,19 cents, hoping that the steam trading cards that come with it, would grant me a profit once I sold them.  EDIT: 0,08 cents profit lolz
3168	1	a	Relaxing gameplay, makes you think, cute grapchic, awesome music and sound effect, fair price for this kind of game.
3170	1	a	Very fun and calming game to play. The physics are amazing while the plateforming mixes perfectly with the physics and combat. I recomend this game to any type of gamers because it really does capture almost all types of gameplay in one amazing game. Pros -Includes trading cards -Puzzles mixed with physics and plateforming make it a superior game with combat -Can run on a wired potatoe -Small price for a large and amazing game -A good game to play offline in like a airplane ect. Cons -Multiplayer I would really like to see a multiplayer version of this either its just playing the levels with a companion or its a death match I would really like to see it -Level editor Same as multiplayer I would really like to see this in the game and you could download other peoples stages off the workshop  But anyways, with or without multiplayer and/or level editor I strongly recommend this game to any type of gamer. 
3172	1	a	Great platformer to play when you have some spare time. Simple yet very fun and gives a challenge. Was trying to move a rock and hit myself with it and launched myself off the map. 10/10
3174	1	a	This game really shows how we can make good 2D Platform/Action in our time. It's the perfect exemple of a SuperMarioBrother-Like that evolved to the better. It's not Super Meat Boy but... The Gameplay is great, the sounds are good,  The Graphics are simply awesome, taking you where we couldn't before  Short and Sweet. The New School of the Old School. A must Play, A must Have.
3176	1	a	Fun little side scroller with a nice art style and music that will lead to marital problems in your 30's.
3178	1	a	It's an ok game. I bought it for 15p so I can't say I was expecting the world. It has trading cards which is pretty nice for the price I bought it at. The game feels decent, it feels slightly like one of those free flash games you'd find on the internet though but generally it's a nice experience that I'm sure many enjoy. If it's onsale for a price similar to what I bought it at, get it. I don't think I would buy it for 3.99 though.
3180	1	a	Note: I'm trying to play all the games on my Steam library and give a quick review. This is based on aprox 30 min gameplay.   Despite looking like that Flash game your dad played one night that gave your computer a virus, BEEP is kind of ok. It's certainly not as tight as Yoshi's Island, and how dare anyone mention this glorified browser game in the same sentence as Half Life? The cheek, the very cheek of it! Despite being slightly overated, and over priced, BEEP has got some substance to it. The hub world in which you select your stage by navigating a rocket ship around planets is kind of cool. Shooting enemies and throwing them around with the gravity gun is also pretty neat. There are better games out there that are more polished and cost less that the 5 bucks asked for BEEP. However I will say I can recommend BEEP if you have little kids , or are looking for something kind of relaxing and easy to play. Pick it up on sale like I did (paid .21 cents) and you shouldn't be dissapointed.
3182	1	a	Considering how cheap this game is, I'd definitely say it's worth a go. The graphics (and art style in general, as well as some of the programming) seem to be pretty sloppy at times, but it has a unique charm to it!
3184	1	a	fun and challenging platformer, great art style, and right now very cheap (1,95 CAD) if you like platformers, then this is definitely worth your money.
3186	1	a	I am definitely too underaged for this game.
3188	1	a	game of psyco or you can throw any onbject do you like xD and some shooting POWER pew pew :U
3190	1	a	You play as a robot that has a gun that can be used to break physics. It's addicting and you die quite frequently. Play this before going to bed.  10/10 would rage
3192	1	a	This game is sooooooooo BRILLIANT! Its addicting like addicting games and coolmath games and that one game RUN 2!
3194	1	a	I got it on sale for $.20, and it was worth it. It's a fun platformer you can play when you're bored, but sometimes it can get too repetitive. It's a short game, so don't spend too much money on it because it doesn't last too long. With some more development, this will be a really good game.
3196	1	a	Kinda fun, puzzle game that you would play if you're waiting for something.
3198	1	a	This is pretty nice game for it's price. It has all kind of different levels, i recommend this game to all who like Puzzle games!
3200	1	a	Super Shooter Mario.  HL3 Confirmed.  10/10 would no gravity noscope360 again.
3202	1	a	Simple game that has some interesting physics aspects. It is cheap so don't expect amazing but if you are looking for simple yet a little challenging here and there, this is a good game on the cheap.
3204	1	a	A gorgeous little game where you play as a jumping and flying little WALE*E robot. I played it for about an hour, but then I fell asleep. In that hour, I had loads of fun playing this cute game. I highly reccomend this if you have a rough internet connection, or none at all, as it can keep you occupied for hours on end.   Things I don't like: *The 'rogue' robots, they die too quickly. *The unlimited ammo on you and the 'rogue' robots, it just gets a little unbalanced. *The death screen, It could be a little less 'horrifying', instead of the 'YOU ARE DEAD :(' It could instead be replaced with a soft depressing jingle, along with a little less dramatic or terrible death screen.  7/10
3206	1	a	Got it with Developer Alliance Bundle for something like 0.99 $ on summer sale.  Died about 100 times and got about 13 hours of gameplay on completion (ok i suck at it).   + The controls are tight (keyboard + mouse combination) and platforming action is decent.  + Physics is unassailable. You could try all kinds of weird stuff in game without the engine complaining or acting out. + Initially the gameplay seemed too easy, but eventually the difficulty ramps up(especially towards the end). Challenges are not very hard though. + There may be more than one way to get past an obstacle. + Enemies are nice, and each have their own unique strengths, quirks, and weakness, which is not immediately apparent. It may be a while before you figure out how to kill an enemy. Again several approaches are possible.  + Some twist or break in gameplay on different levels, maybe a new weapon, power, enemy, new kind of environmental hazard. Doesn't get monotonous. + Music is ok. I liked the weird arab/oriental/fusion track in the ice planet. - Graphics are meh. Simple, cartoony, flash-like. I don't mind those things. Its not poorly done or anything like that but overall it doesn't come together to build a suitable feel or atmosphere. Each planet (of which there are 3) has it's own climate/environment. The last planet is the better of the three. The world, ominous music, come together nicely to give good atmosphere. The creepy firebreathing monster in that planet is a nice touch. - No real story or setting. This could have made the game more interesting or provided reward for progression.   Overall. This puzzle platformer was competant if forgetable. Passing a stage while collecting all the lums - or whatever it is we are supposed to collect- is a good way to while away 10-15 minutes. Definitely worth the price and not unworthy of your time either. Get it if it comes on sale.
3208	1	a	BEEP is an amazing physics platformer made from good developers. It has lots of fun and tricky puzzles that will make you feel determined to solve them. Definitely worth its price especially if on sale.
3210	1	a	Cheep Game only $0.49. Real fun game and easy controls. Nice look and feel. It feels like a android game but is right at home on the pc. If I found this for $10.00 knowing what it was I would still buy it.
3212	1	a	  It's a really cool game, It's like Wall E and Mario
3214	1	a	Get it soon now, as it got big discount, only cost few bucks. It's a good game to wasting your times btw
3216	1	a	I really liked this game. It may be a bit short, but the puzzles are challenging and the graphics are cute and delightful. That being said, I did get this game when I saw it on sale, but it seems to go on sale all the time, so consider keeping an eye on it.
3218	1	a	Bought it for 19 cents and isn't that bad tbh
3220	1	a	Simple, colorful yeah may be too much simple but it has a gravity gun! Give it a change
3222	1	a	For 0.19, it's deffinetly worth it.
3224	1	a	This game is awsome! The level design is good and can be challenging at times. I love the sound affects from the chacters and the music. The game also has a lot of levels and will keep u busy for a LONG time.
3226	1	a	BEEP is probably one of the best 2d puzzle games I've ever played
3228	1	a	Not really a big chellenge here, but a simple, fun and colorful game. Excelente for an younger audience. The controls are pretty simple, enemys arent a big problem. Easy but brilliant game.
3230	1	a	I don't know where to start with this review. I started playing smaller indiegames not that long ago and I'm totally addicted to it. BEEP is one of that little games that just is totally worth it's small price. The only reason that I write this review is that this game really deserves to be bought.   Pro's
3232	1	a	Do not be deceived, this game is trickier than it seems... It was given to me and I went 'oh sure, I'll try it before going to bed'.... an hour an a half later, I'm still on and no longer asleep.. &gt;.&gt;   
3234	1	a	SUPER fun! My only problem is that the gravity gun is broken. You can get anywhere by jumping, pulling the object up, and jumping off of it. Repeat until you get to your destination. Other than that (especially with the Steam sale), it's a really fun game!
3236	1	a	So far of what I have played in this game has been amazing. This platformer is a must buy and is unique.
3238	1	a	In this game you’ll control the eponymous Beep bot in search for energy blobs around the galaxy, a simple setup for a platform game. While you might take this as a small budget indie game, this is actually much better polished than any flash game you’ll find flooding the net. The animation is smooth and the stages are smartly designed, not only will you find it a challenge to complete each stage perfectly, you’ll have to devise your own strategies in doing so as well.  The protagonist is essentially a clone of Wall-E given Gordon’s gravity gun, but the mechanics used is perhaps the most innovative aspect of the entire game. You’ll use rocks to block incoming projectiles and you’ll use your enemies’ miniature carcasses to activate switches. When all else fails, you can always jet pack your way out while gunning down bots with your machine gun; like a boss.  Another twist came from Beep’s partial immortality, since the mothership can churn out any number of bots as it wished and beam it down to the last checkpoint. Beep is by and large, expendable. This means you can be free to explore the stages as you wish, completing areas via some bizarre manners manipulating the physics engine.  If you can’t tell by now I’m totally recommending this game, with its low price tag and the aforementioned features, there is no reason why you shouldn’t give this a chance.
3240	1	a	If there is one word that I would use to describe this game, it would be adorable. Everything about this game is adorable. The world design, the level selection, the characters, the hints, even the death screen. Also, this game has the most satisfying mechanic of picking up your fallen enemies and doing as you please. Wheather that be throwing them away or stacking them up to get to higher places, the gravity gun is one of the most genius things ever and it works so smoothly. The platforms are super fun to jump onto and move around with the gravity gun and the world is just overall fun to move around despite being linear. There is so much detail in this game that dirt specs fly when you ride over grass, but they aren't at all distracting. I love this game so much, and if you do not have it yet, get it. Now.
3242	1	a	Side scrolling &amp; Rage inducing, two of the most addictive things about games today. It has several planets, each planet containing different levels.   In the game you play as BEEP, BEEP is a small robot which has a Zero Point Energy Manipulator and a cannonball launcher, you are up against several different enemies, these include; a Robot, Zappy fish, Allhau Akbar robot, and many more!   There are several types of levels including; Desert Levels, grassland Levels, Ice Levels and Lava Levels!  Flying through space in your little rocket ship, choosing from the levels, gradually getting more and more difficult, enemies aim getting better and a less defined goal.   The soundtrack belonging to this game is also calming, it is space age music, but relaxing. As if 2001: A space oddesy &amp; Wall:E had a child, this would be it!  This is a great game for children aged 7-11, I give it a 6.5/10
3244	1	a	Great game. I'm skeptical about games with large discounts but this was worth the money and I reccomend this no matter what the cost
3246	1	a	Fun and definitely worth your money, I got the game on sale for 50 cents, but the full $2 seems worth what i have played so far, definitely reccomended  ~Rating~ 8 bacon strips out of 10
3248	1	a	An exellent casual side scrolling platformer that is one massive homage to all platformers before it. Fun to play and cheap too. Has very fun and challenging puzzles and gameplay. If the nostalgic premise doesn't pull you in, the beautiful art style will.
3250	1	a	i swear to god i hear '♥♥♥♥ you' come out of the BEEP's mouth
3252	1	a	But seriously what is this game, i bought it for my whole family since its cheap but, I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO SO BUY IT AND TELL ME WAT TO DO STEAM! Oh wait steam cant buy games XD
3254	1	a	A game where you can shoot robots, and use their corpses as a stepping stone. Really smoothly controlled and it is easily worth the price that you get it for.
3256	1	a	An exellent casual side scrolling platformer that is one massive homage to all platformers before it. Fun to play and cheap too. Has very fun and challenging puzzles and gameplay. If the nostalgic premise doesn't pull you in, the beautiful art style will.
3258	1	a	i swear to god i hear '♥♥♥♥ you' come out of the BEEP's mouth
3260	1	a	This is a Indie 2d Platform Puzzle Video Game  I like this game to begin with it;s like a Mario game...  It's have some good soundtracks. Game has a very good tutorial how to play the game. It's not a really hard game to learn and pickup. Fun..... and gives you a good challange.  There are no achievment and some people will not like this. For me not a must have. It still haves trading cards... so you can make a badge !!  I give it a 7/10 score.
3262	1	a	No man's sky in 2D and guess what the price you pay for, it worth it and same as no man's sky it has the need for co-op. Game is fun though.
3264	1	a	It's regularly on sale for $0.49 and while it's short it's worth way more than the asking price.
3266	1	a	Beep  Pros: -Great art -Easy gameplay -Cheap -Trading card  Cons: -None (imo)  Summary: this is a puzzle game with some arcade. the art is great. the gameplay is easy. This game got some trading card too so its worth it.  9/10
3268	1	a	this is a really fun game  
3270	1	a	Cheap and great game !!
3272	1	a	well BEEP says the robot.  10/10
3274	1	a	There's a chapter where you have to stack two robot bodies in order to reach the exit. ♥♥♥♥ing brutal. 10/10.
3276	1	a	Good game, a little too short tho. 8/10.
3278	1	a	It's 2 dollars and could probably be worth 5. Spend the money! Super fun concept in this game.

3282	1	a	HL2 + Yoshi's Island = This Game Anyways here is my formal review about this game Gameplay - Pretty awesome platforming game, totally worth buying it :)  + 4 Graphics - Cool graphics though, I forgot what game engine did the developer use though + 3 Controls - Its ok :3 +1 GUIs and stuff - Can't change resolution and audio volumes D: -2  Overall - 6 / 10 Would stack dead robot's bodies again xD
3284	1	a	This is probably the best 79p I have spent. It's a fun relaxing platform game with some little puzzles. It looks and sounds great. To quote Bob Ross, “This is a happy little game!
3286	1	a	Great Game
3288	1	a	Awesome game with unique graphics and interesting level selecting design.
3290	1	a	It's like Mario with guns. 9/10
3292	1	a	HARDER THAN DARK SOULS. CHEAPER THAN DARK SOULS.   I can't tell if that's good or bad?   11/10.
3294	1	a	Not bad game, I like to play it sometime.  Im selling this game gifts for cs go skins (it can be even 3.00$ or 4.00$ ill see, what u gonna offer), invite me to friends if you need. (2 left)  And i have one more game who costs 5.00$ and im selling it for cs go skins too  Invite if you need
3296	1	a	I do recommend this game, but play it at your own risk. It's ♥♥♥♥ing impossible. The third level from World 6 is the hardest level from a video game I have ever played (I know World 6 is the last world meaning that level is technically the second last level, but still). And yes, that includes COCKING DARK SOULS AND HOTLINE MIAMI! If I gave this game a difficulty score between 1-10, this game would be 12. DS would be 11 and HM would be 10.  Even world 2 was stupidly hard.
3298	1	a	I love indie games that have a story with them just like this one! And for those of you guys who do like these types of games be sure to check out 'Thomas Was Alone', another awesome indie game I played a while back.
3300	1	a	A cool platformer with some puzzle elements. It controls well for the most time, has a good progression through 24 levels divided in 6 'worlds', and it's fun to play. It's not difficult, although some parts can be a bit frustrating. But most collectibles are mandatory, so they feel a little pointless. They should be just collectables to unlock extra stuff. But what's here is worth 5-6 hours of good content. Some achievements would also be appreciated.
3302	1	a	This game has changed my life for the better : ^)             Kappa
367	0	a	An annoying platformer, some will say this is fun because it's difficult, and I'm sure for some that is fine and good, but for me this doesn't do anything special or fun enough for me to want to spend the extra effort it takes.  In the fourth level I started running into physics issues and that sealed the deal for me. When my character just starts flying around the screen not because of anything I did (I think) and falling into a pit, I can't recomend it.
368	0	a	one of my favorite games the story is very touching
3304	1	a	Not as easy as it seems...
3306	1	a	BEEP, is a funny Plattformer, Puzzle and Brain game. It´s was fun playing it even if i do not personally like that Art of game. (i´m a Fast Paced Action lover) Still BEEP was so far one of rare games that i would play some hour´s (until i get frustrated because i somehow being very bad on such games) It doesnt really has Story.  It´s more like short explains about BEEP´s Skills in the levels (There are those 'info plattform') Controls were good i do not had any problem´s with my Mouse and keyboard playing it! Graphics are good. Emeny´s make you think about how to get not killed or get the Tresure´s you can collect. In overall i would say play it and make your own opinion about this game!   Here is now a small list how i would give points for the game in each categorie:  Gameplay: 8/10 (Well made)  Graphics: 6/10 (serve´s the meaning for the game and it fits good with the effects etc)  Support: ?/10 (never had to go support)  Price: 7/10 (5€ seems fine to me)  Story: 3/10 (There isn´t really much about to say)  Sound: 7/10 (like the Graphic´s it serve´s the Gameplay as well in a good way! like having a Jet to Fly with it´s effects)  Performance: 10/10 (no problem´s @ all)   FAZIT: 6.8/10 (well made game, but it could contain more Story in it for better gameplay and more Addiction for the game, as it really has good gameplay!)
3308	1	a	It's a very nice game, where you play as a small robot that collect orb fragments scattered on the levels also 3 antimatter fragments. You have a gravity weapon to move objects, obstacles or dead robots, and a gun to shot and kill the enemy robots. It's a really good game, and it's fun and addictive to collect all the orb fragments. The level select screen is a small solar system i loved that, its better than other games where the select level screen is just something with numbers.
3310	1	a	The game is alright, and at a fair price.
3312	1	a	Spent 20 minutes attempting to stack 4 dead robots from the previous areas to get to an unreachable spot, :P ____________________________________ Seriously i love this game ____________________________________ 10/10 would waste my time gathering and stacking dead robots again. XD
3314	1	a	Heeey and this is my review about the game  You are a little robot, with asmall hover jet and some machine gun.  It's sort of a mario game, because u have to collect coins and 3 stars and it is a platforming game. You have unlimited lives if you die, you have the option to be teleported to your last checkpoint. Graphics are a little bit, classic? it's not high tech at all, same goes for backgrounds. You also have a weapon to move objects, like dead robot bodies. You can take this with you to use it as a weapon. Like bashing it into the enemy's face. Or just small the dead robot body against the wall or ground :D  If you are playing the game, and u leave in a middle of a level. Every collectable that has been collected will be kept and safed. So you don't have to pick them up again. checkpoints however are lost.  If you are in a dark area, you get a light lamp. the light is well done though. Game has some puzzle elements. The game is calm, music is calm.  Game is okay if u like platforming. Otherwise wait for a discount.  7/10
3316	1	a	It's really good for a cheap game. Well made little platformer. I like it!  7/10
3318	1	a	Great, cheap, platformer game. One of the better ones. I recommend buying this game. Don't forget that there are trading cards dropped as well!
3320	1	a	Ruined my life    10/10
3322	1	a	You know what they say, a little BEEP never hurts, if you don't like it there is this other game named Brilliant Bob and it is just amazing trust me, (Don't see my review in Brilliant Bob) so yea you'll have the best gaming experience with BEEP and Brilliant Bob in your library, trust me, I do.

3328	1	a	Not as easy as it seems...
3330	1	a	  The Brave Little Toaster Rebooted
3332	1	a	truly ganteng
3334	1	a	Not as easy as it seems...
3336	1	a	A good platformer especially for the 19 cents I paid for it on sale. I just bought it for another title in my collection though and it probably won't keep me entertained for long since puzzle games just feel like a chore, but the game is made well enough to enjoy if you have a lot of patience. I don't. 7/10
3338	1	a	good game! you will smart by playing this brain games
3340	1	a	i BEEP love this game like holy BEEP this BEEP game is so BEEP good I BEEP recomend this to all you BEEP people out there so BEEP get this BEEP game and if you don't I will BEEP you up and BEEP you in the BEEP with my BEEP so get get this......BEEP
3342	1	a	physco robot flying around killing peeps and making more beeps while the animals hang out with eachohter no hommo  420 Blaze it/10-IGN
3344	1	a	A fun little game that is quite simple but still makes fun. Recommended if you like Puzzle/Indie games.
3346	1	a	The best game for 10 cents^^
3348	1	a	BEEP is a pretty decent, challeging platformer featuring slightly unnerving robots.
3350	1	a	easy to play  
3352	1	a	hahah what a good game! i got it for 15p, i dontn know if its worth £4 but £3 would be good. i played polarity witch was good so i looked at this game made by the same people, 1337 times better then polarity!
3354	1	a	Great game 10/10
3356	1	a	LocoRoco is that you?
3358	1	a	Surprisingly Fun.
370	0	a	I got this game for cheap. I'm happy I didn't pay the full price, since the game doesn't work. The resolution of the game is messed up and I can't run it in a windowed mode, even with startup commands. This means that I can't even start the actual game.
371	0	a	BEEP has very little going for it. The overworld serves little purpose in the hour that I've played other than to make it take slightly longer to select levels and is overall awful. Once you get into a level the aesthetics are unappealing to say the least. The background and characters are cartoonish, but don't have any particular thing that grabs you about them, but the pickups (antimatter nuggets and cores or something) look like bad gif files of 3D modeling done by high school students.  The music and sound I can't comment on as I turned them off within 3 minutes of getting in to the game. As far as the mechanics go the controls are sluggish and sometimes not responsive and the camera is attached to the cursor but not smoothly and you can easily get motion sick from the jitteriness of it.  It isn't a terrible game but there are so many other better examples of interesting platformers that I cannot recommend this one.
372	0	a	cannot enter the game. tried several times but it always freezes when loading  I believe it is a good game such a pity :(
373	0	a	Well I was expecting BEEP to be a lot worse that it looks like at first glance - yet another 2D platformer.   Still, the controls aren't insultingly clunky, and the artwork, while really low effort, isn't the worst I've seen either.  Should you buy BEEP, then? No, not really. It's got fewer flaws than most 2D platformers, but neither is it the king of the genre.   Also, technical problems prevent the game from being run under Windows 10 if you have a high res display and use DPI (required if your PPI is at or near retina level). Overscan means you can only access 1/4 of the screen with your mousepointer in full screen mode - you have to run it windowed.   So, while not worth buying, it's worth acknowledging the game is polished enough to be tolerable, meaning at least some of the developers on the project could achieve greater things in future.
3360	1	a	It's a fun game.
374	0	a	And yet another platformer which I'd love except for the controls. Come on, devs, if you expect me to do a skill jump while waving a robot around on a grabber beam (2-2, 2nd 'supergrain'), the least you could do is to make sure that: - Movement and grabber can be fine-controlled, separately - The grabber doesn't accidentally release the robot (in like 50% of the cases) - Once held in an orientation, the robot doesn't randomly revolve, exposing me to the big bad laser beam  I like challenging setups, but the challenge shouldn't be hoping for the lucky situation where all controls work properly at the same time. Also, on a multi-try challenge, spending one minute to get back again from the last checkpoint tends to grate after a while.  It may be harsh, but I'll keep giving non-recommendations to any game which frustrates the player by control inadequacies - no matter how good the other aspects are.
375	0	a	Just another unpolished, probably unfinished platformer. It felt like one of the games I would play for 5 minutes on AddictingGames as a kid. The art style is inconsistent throughout the game, and sometimes it feels like they didn’t even try. The gameplay isn’t anything special and the only redeeming feature, aside from it’s somewhat ok lighting and physics engine, is the anti-gravity beam, which only seems to work when it wants to and likes to drop things a lot.  I would never pay a full $5 for this, but it might be worth it to someone else to sell a couple cards when it’s on sale for $0.19. In the end, I’d just recommend you go and play some free flash games or something instead.
3362	1	a	&gt;buys for 19 cents &gt;gets 24 cents in trading cards &gt;best game i have purchased 10/10
3364	1	a	  Worth every penny
376	0	a	At first, I thought this was a great game. I soon found out that on one of the levels, it is literly too easy to get stuck. I got it during this steam summer sale, so I thought why not? But then, I ran into the level. A few weeks past, and here I am, writing this review. If its on sale for cheap, pick it up, I had a blast on the few levels I did.
377	0	a	 Won't start
3366	1	a	I spent the first 10 minutes in mode A flying around the universe wondering what the BEEP am I doing wrong. Once I figured it out I got to the platform side of things where I found it very enjoyable. I am not big on platform games but this one I could make an exception for. This is like a little hidden gem that everyone should try at least once and for the lovely price of 19 cents, how can you pass it up.
3368	1	a	Good Game!! Recommend!
380	0	a	It would be fun if i was four again
3370	1	a	Old but gold.
3372	1	a	I'll tell you what this game, and what this game isn't.  It is: -An addicting, yet casual platforming physics games -Very ingenious with its puzzles  -An exprience worth having solo, and people should go into it blind or based off little reviews -Quite calming -Very buggy at times, but only adds to the goofy charm/replay value as some of the 'glitches' add new ways to finish  levels -Intense at times with battles against other robots, and a lot of the fun figuring out what weaknesses what robot has  It is not: -A game that should not be speedrunned, take your time with it -A hardcore game in any sense, I don't believe the few times that it can be intense isn't enough for the hardcore crowd  It should be: -Apreciated more, I do believe it is quite underrated  Buy it, especially on sales.
3374	1	a	Pretty good
3376	1	a	This Game Sucks. Enough Said. 5 Outta 10...
382	0	a	This game is too hard and whacky to handle not my type of tea the achievements are worthless and they cant speak for themselves!  it doesnt deliver an epic tale,cool preference tho,and globally might satisfy some old school gamers but not me love the burrito master
3378	1	a	A fun strategy game that increase in difficulty with each level.  This game is a really fun, yet challenging (at the later levels) timekiller.  I bought it on sale and it was totally worth it, would recommend you give it a try :)
3380	1	a	i realy liked beep. it has fun chalenges and is a game all librarys should have
3382	1	a	Goes on sale a lot. Worth the $.19 i had paid for it. Great Platformer.
3384	1	a	Take the f****** checkpoint, because 'The 'Lie' its a 'cake''.    After this game -&gt;&gt; Einsten genius -&gt;&gt; P. Nobel of Peace -&gt;&gt; Die  11/10
3386	1	a	I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO ANYONE THIS GAME IS DA S#@T BEST ♥♥♥♥ING CHANGE IVE SPENT EVER!!!
3388	1	a	Better than War thunder
3390	1	a	I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO ANYONE THIS GAME IS DA S#@T BEST ♥♥♥♥ING CHANGE IVE SPENT EVER!!!
3392	1	a	Its a fun game, good to get your mind off things :)
3394	1	a	I thought that it was only an cheap not interesting game. But it is not fully true. The graphics is enough for me and you can kill time with this game without getting bored. Worth the money
3396	1	a	Great game for free time and worth trying !!!
388	0	a	I hate when I accidently go into a portal and I have to start over to get all matters.
389	0	a	I typically don't like hard video games, so this review might be biased. And, my definition of hard might be easy for someone else, so there's that too. I bought this game for the full price in India (55 Rupees). If you get it on an offer on the bundle (was on sale for 23 Rupees with three other games), then you can make your money back just with trading cards (and that's how this game got so many positive reviews). With the above in mind, here's my review:  The game, as such, was too hard for me. The story was not a story, just mere reasons on why you had to go out and control the bots. The monsters/enemy robots/whatever they're called are way too powerful. Many of them can't be destroyed and fire at you a  lot . The game has a demo on the game's website for three levels. The fourth one was OK, but the fifth was down-right impossible in my opinion. The first three levels, on the other hand, were extremely easy. The difficulty curve is  not  a curve at all. it went from easy to impossible in no time flat. Also, the game introduces new mechanics at an alarming pace, with little to no explanation on how they work. No training wheels, nothing (Portal: First Slice was far better).   The graphics are OK, but by no means good. To be honest, even the game 'Thomas was Alone' looks better (or at least I think so). The 'Bonk' engine is not so good at physics either. In my opinion, the developer could've easily used Unity or even a tool like Stencyl. The controls are non-remappable, so you're stuck with WASD/Arrow Keys. Also, right-clicking to reload is a bad idea. Why can't we just use the E key? All-in-all, the game could use a lot of work and in it's current stage, don't recommend it to anyone who wants a game to play.  Want to make money? Buy it on a sale and sell your cards. Want to play? Look into something else.
390	0	a	Kinda janky, and feels pretty cheap.
3398	1	a	It's like mario meets wall e
3400	1	a	I finished the game on a short time period with all things gathered and it was really fun. Waiting for the second of the game . Best money that i spent.
3402	1	a	Bought it on sale for the cards.
3404	1	a	i got this game for 13 cents  +has nice graphics +has a cool asf menu selector like you fly in a spaceship to pick what map you want to play  10/10 id pay 13 cents again
3406	1	a	This is a videogame.
3408	1	a	Made a 4 cent profit on the game after selling the dropped trading cards. The game is a cute and very fun platformer, that deserves the good reception it has enjoyed on Steam (91% positive reviews). What more do you need to know?  5/5 would get 0.04€ of wallet credit and a great game again.
3410	1	a	Gr8 Game  It seems Mario and Wall-e meat each other. There are many ways to solve Puzzles. I'm in love &lt;3
3412	1	a	♥♥♥♥ yeah  I am beep  the master and ruler of the galaxy  I fly around ina spaceship ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ up  on inferior organism through the universe  with my awesome all terrain robot and dark matter  machine launcher cannon
3414	1	a	Pros:  - Nice Mechanics - Physics are really good. - A useless story that you can put a theory to... - Cool cheap puzzles.. - Paid 10 cents for it...  Cons: - ♥♥♥♥ you - More ♥♥♥♥ you - You ♥♥♥♥ you - Killing of your own kind while you ♥♥♥♥ you. - 10 cents for an innocent high pitch babbling ♥♥♥♥ you!  Overall rate 7/10...
3416	1	a	Very cheap and well worth the 19 cents
3418	1	a	This game is cool! If you can't start the game because of resultion problems, you have to press the 'F11' button on your keyboard, then you can press the full screen mode view in the up-right corner in your screen. And then you can play in full screen without any problems! Super cool little game, I like it!
391	0	a	Have you ever gone online and plaid those crappy flash games?   That is exactly what this feels like. It's great for bit if you are playing for free and just wasting time, but there is nothing substantial enough that I found in this game to actually warrent paying money.
3420	1	a	It reminds me Wall-E :) What do you want for 19 cents ? :D :D :D I made 5 cents profit :D   9/10
3422	1	a	Got this, bcouse my roommate is funny  Even do this creeped me out.... (see the screenshot)  69/10 - Would play this game again and again to see weird,... things.. like on the screenshot again . 
3424	1	a	3 hours of platforming for not even a dollar - worth it completely.  If you're able to pick this up on a sale, go for it.  The difficulty ramps up nicely (to the point of mild frustration towards the very end)
3426	1	a	Nice gameplay! ;dd
393	0	a	The game does not even display the whole area. You're often under your screen, and getting attacked from units off the scrren too. This game needs to be updated to even be playable.  Other than the bug fix, I believe that the game lacks a lot of depth. It is very basic. Basic and buggy are not examples of anything one should spend their own money on.
394	0	a	what a stupid game, when you load up the game its just blank grey  the develpers are stupid for not finishing the game and i have a huge pc
3428	1	a	Platform. Walk, jump, shoot stuff with weird balls. Fly sometimes. Nice game to play while you wait for dinner to be ready, if you get it for less than 1€.
3430	1	a	Unless you can get this for 19 cents like i did dont buy it
395	0	a	Beep. A game made for children under the age of 12. Except for the fact that it's hard, and JEEZUS the screams of a robot as it goes off a cliff, thinking there's a hidden area there... *Shivers*   TBH, only good with a mouse. And then to a point. Confusing as hell as to how the game actually works, and basically makes little to no sense throughout the whole game. Haven't played much, but doesn't seem amazing.
3432	1	a	Really nice game for only 5€, one of my favourite indie games!
3434	1	a	Great platformer, recommended to everyone.
3436	1	a	Very Fun platformer. IT HAS A GRAV GUN. 20/10
3438	1	a	This is a fun and cute platformer where you play as the robot BEEP. You are trying to find out why the other robots... are fighting you? To be honest, I payed little to no attention to the story, but the gameplay was very fun! Good music and you can kill robots using other robots dead bodies! I would recommend this game, For $1 you can't go wrong! (Also, it's usaully on sale for 25 cents so just buy it then if you're super cheap) Creative, tough and worth it!
3440	1	a	I have some problems with my desktop(even if i have the right resolution it stilll syasy that it cant this display in this res,but this happens to me to other games too,so..),but my m8 that does have a steam account(wont share cuz he doesnt wnat to ,and we arents friends on steam XD)let me play it when i visited him and it was fun AF
3442	1	a	Me an' my homies got dis game. It's gucci homies.
3444	1	a	  Absolute masterpiece. One of the single greatest games i have ever had the joy of being able to play. Its portal mixed with mario on a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ flash engine with awful graphics and puzzles an autistic person could solve blindfolded. 10/10
3446	1	a	Such an interesting game.
3448	1	a	I like this game. It has a Maria Galaxy kind of vibe, but of course that isnt a bad thing. If you are into that kind of gaming i recommend BEEP to YOU yes YOU. Another point it is dirt cheap! I got this game on sale for $0.19! I was amazed at how cheap it was for such an awesome game I totatally recommend.
3450	1	a	Spent 44 mins playing and I sure as hell enjoyed them.
3452	1	a	it is really fun get it
3454	1	a	Bloody Excellent indiE Platformer! Cute graphics and story, okay music, great level design. Difficulty: Easy-Medium. I really enjoyed playing this physics style platformer. The levels get progressively trickier with more strategy and logic puzzles, with well placed checkpoints to stop them getting frustrating and annoying.There is a nice variation in level designs with different environments and tools changing up how you control and use your robot. The game felt about the right length but I would have happily played more levels or perhaps a game+.
3456	1	a	It has cussing robots in the game and random anime in the arkwork section  11/10
3458	1	a	very simple game!
3460	1	a	good game fun to play from time to time
3462	1	a	This game was surprisingly awesome! I got it free cause it was on sale for .19 and gave cards for .21. Still, I thought it would be another freebie game to get cards from but this game was really fun. A bit on the short side, but totally worth it. It basically is Mario mixed with WALL E. Its a great mixture of platforming and puzzling. I like how its challenging enough to keep me engaged but not too hard to make me pull my hair out. The puzzles were a bit straightforward but took thinking to complete. Plus the environment, music and ambiance were very soothing. Totally worth the 2 cents I earned to play it and I think you should play it too. I hope they make a sequel. They should be proud of what they accomplished.
3464	1	a	Cute little lovely cool game and i like the grafichs ther colorful and defently recomand this game
396	0	a	Game crashes upon running. No fix found.
3466	1	a	BEEP is the best game in the world would have paid $20 for it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3468	1	a	11/10 would buy for 21 cents again
397	0	a	Boring, repetitive, waste of money
398	0	a	Poorly put together puzzle game. Enemies are much more annoying then hard.
399	0	a	Just play a free puzzle game online, and you will have more fun!
400	0	a	This stupid application does not have a tutorial or even a menu with settings to disable the stupid music. This is enough for me to write a negative review without even trying it.
401	0	a	Any game that you cannot adjust the volumeof is a fail in my book. Glad I got this in a bundle and didn't buy it outright.
402	0	a	Not a lot of fun.
403	0	a	Game is okay puzzle platformer, but BEEP crashing my machine on start up half of the time means I can' recommend it. This has been a problem for a good while, judging by the forums, and nothing appears to have been done :(
404	0	a	Had a huge horrible glitch where it was 32 bit, could not play at all, and lucky me, it was before the refund system came out.
405	0	a	THIS ♥♥♥♥♥ GAME CRASH EVERY TIME I START IT CMOON WTFFF FIX IT PLZ
406	0	a	I got stuck on pressing the 'New Game' button. Not even worth it if you go it for free.
407	0	a	Nicely polished game, but gets boring quite soon.  Buy it only at a high discount (&gt;90%) and only for collectible cards.  ^_^
408	0	a	Not bad for the price but poor control.
409	0	a	why is this game even exist? 
410	0	a	Same sh*t with flash games you can play completely free on internet. Dont even bother, waste of time.
411	0	a	Pros: - Makes you want to do speedruns. - Has the platform feel you look for. - Grabbing thing and throwing them around is fun!  Cons: - Gets you easily bored because of too many repeated objectives. - Aim-lock sometimes may end up aim-locking you away from your target. (Considered moving around) - Doesn't have a speed option for doing speed runs. - Graphics could really use an upgrade.  There's room for improvement for this game. But overall it didn't appeal me as much to keep me going with playing (Played until 4th level).
412	0	a	Mario-like platformer and I hate Mario.
413	0	a	pleased as punch with this gr8 game, i wish i got to play it since the cursor can't reach the right side of the screen.
414	0	a	Boring, repetitive, waste of money
415	0	a	Mario-like platformer and I hate Mario.
416	0	a	pleased as punch with this gr8 game, i wish i got to play it since the cursor can't reach the right side of the screen.
417	0	a	It's like one of those browser games everyone played when they were younger.
418	0	a	My friend gave me this. I had no idea what it was ,and he set me up for an amazing adventure. Needless to say I will be dead soon.
419	0	a	i do not like this game i want a refund please
420	0	a	IT was okay for a while, got it in a bundle. I mean i Wouldnt pay money for it alone
421	0	a	interesting world map if not impractical. its a basic platformer which i would expect to be on newgrounds or kongregate not worth its normal price
422	0	a	How to enjoy this game -Leave it on like 3-4 hour while your busy -Get and sell the cards  -Delete and never play this game again :D
423	0	a	Don't like games without the option to control the sound. This is poor develop crafting
424	0	a	The only positive for me was that I made more on trading cards than I paid for the game. I expected a cute but difficult platformer from the reviews, but what I got was bland and boring.
425	0	a	Nope even though i bought it under 1 Euro, it was not worth it..... Even if it would be free, it would not be worth it....
3470	1	a	great game, if you buy for 19€ you get more money from trading card ;) xD    sorry for bad english   
432	0	a	Very simply side scroller. No better than the typical free mobil app.
3472	1	a	hardcore
3474	1	a	I left it running by accident.
3476	1	a	I just want card drops.
433	0	a	Poorly optimized side scroller. FPS drops to 20-30 fairly often on a decent computer that runs much more complex 3D titles. However, good trading cards if you get this on a sale.
434	0	a	Can't play because the game loads in a resolution too big to play or even see more than 1/4 of the game, changing screen resolution does nothing  0/10 would not buy again
435	0	a	Bought for my friend. We aren't friends anymore
436	0	a	Meh. Glad it was 19c. Lackluster art, mechanics and overall game. If you're awake at 4AM for some unknow reason you might spend half an hour on it.
437	0	a	  Although cheap at the price of $1.00, this game gives very little even for the small price tag. The game has nothing to offer, it's bland and holds no real cards, and if it does it doesn't play them when it should (I.E to grab my intrest). It's 'My first game' should go on newgrounds not on steam. Don't buy, not worth your time.
438	0	a	It's like one of those browser games everyone played when they were younger.
439	0	a	My friend gave me this. I had no idea what it was ,and he set me up for an amazing adventure. Needless to say I will be dead soon.
3478	1	a	Worth Playing damn Enjoyable Game .
3480	1	a	Cheap game, trading cards, pretty fun. Reccomended!
3482	1	a	Bought it on sale. Paid itself back in card drops. Decent game too.
3484	1	a	This game is awesome and fun! I reccomend it!
440	0	a	  A friend gifted this to me last christmas. I'm rethinking our friendship
441	0	a	Lacks a lot of things, it was very mediocre. Bought it for 19 cents, and yet I still think this might be a little too much. Luckily I can get these 19 cents from the trading cards! Positive!
442	0	a	Fun little game that would have defenitely got a positive review from me had it been free. It's simply not worth to pay for, certain free browser flash games provide you with more entertainment. I guess it is worth to spend like 20 cents on this game.
443	0	a	Unpolished platformer
444	0	a	How many times can one game crash?  If the game is Beep, let's just say my playtime may read 8 minutes, but I've been at it for 20.  At $0.19 I feel I got a bad deal.  MY THRILLING INDIE EXPERIENCE: - Launch game - Reach main menu - Set it to windowed - It crashes immediately - Relaunch game - Set it to windowed at splash screen - It works. Amazing! What a time to be alive. - Game proceeds to crash at any provocation from dying to hitting the escape key to just because it feels like it - Have to re-window the game every launch because it never remembers - Decide it's just not worth the hassle to try to wring $0.19 cents worth of fun out of this basic ♥♥♥ flash game  Just go on the marketplace and buy a baller emote instead like a mouse with a hat or a sleeping goat.
445	0	a	I wish I could write a review about what the game was like, but It wouldn't work so its impossible. Im disappointed that I wasted my emoticons to buy this game for 19 cents.
3486	1	a	I made profit from selling trading cards I got from this game.
446	0	a	Crashed, and wouldn't let me close steam because it thought it was still running. 0/10 Awful.
447	0	a	I have owned this on steam for several years now before early access was even a thing, I'm confused how something I bought in 2012 is now a new release.
448	0	a	Its crap it was given to me as a gift, but is still a rip off.
449	0	a	Boring spinoff of super mario, glad I only payed 19 cents
450	0	a	how to get past the story? it wont let me click anything.
451	0	a	Release Date: 1 Apr, 2016  My ♥♥♥!!!! Liers mOFOS!
3488	1	a	Not as good as Bernards but still pretty nice game.
452	0	a	Game I could only recommend for people starting their adventure with platform games and if they are under 10. Quite borring and not surprising in any way.
453	0	a	This game is very annoying in that it does not allow a windowed mode with reduced graphical settings and is a resources hog otherwise for what it does.
454	0	a	No windowed mode option, no video settings!
3490	1	a	I would recommend this game to a younger crowd, it works out and is kinda fun, but it would probally be more fun for a 8 year old instead of a 20 year old. My bad impulsive steam-purchase.
3492	1	a	yo this game's gay
3494	1	a	BEEP is very good game because it's very fun and easy.
3496	1	a	This Game Is Awesomeness:    I payed 20 cents for this, after playing it I feel this game  deserves at least 10-15 bucks.
466	0	a	Crap game with boring level design and ♥♥♥♥ performance on a pretty decent laptop. Didn't enjoy having to search every inch of every level to progress.
3498	1	a	Great game i love how when you order pizza and they deliver you frosted flakes ceral, its just well made game, you guys took your time in fixing my car and making me cookies, you're such a doll, this beats mw2 and csgo put together and a dash of mtn dew. thanks and have a wonderful doritos
3500	1	a	Really fun game with lots of gameplay and amazing for the price!
479	0	a	Crap game with boring level design and ♥♥♥♥ performance on a pretty decent laptop. Didn't enjoy having to search every inch of every level to progress.
480	0	a	this game instantly reminds me of a low budget, robot mario kind of game. You get what you expect for the price you pay.
3502	1	a	it only cost 2 quarters on a sale 2 ♥♥♥♥ING QUARTERS
3504	1	a	if it is on a offer, buy it.
485	0	a	cant play the game!!
486	0	a	This game is very simple but the levels arn't the same but the objectives are very much the same.
487	0	a	i can't start the game when i got to run it i can't click to start a new game

489	0	a	naahh I buy this game only for badge
3506	1	a	Nice and simple look, great physics engine, what's not to like.
490	0	a	got for trading cards lol
491	0	a	extremely annoying that this game does not have a windowed mode with lower resolution and graphics (for better alt + tab experience)
492	0	a	This game is not fun, unless you are a young kid then maybe it would be fun. It is a nice indie game but for steam, not the best publisher. IT IS A GOOD GAME it doesnt interest me though and to people on, because most people on steam are 13+ so it put this game it steam not a smart move.
3508	1	a	I just bought this game on sale to get some profit. (Y)
3510	1	a	BEEP is a game where the title was such a horrible swear word that the devs had to censor it in order for the game to still be legal.
3512	1	a	Great! Finished collecting the cards and you have made me the happiest hamster that has ever lived :SaddenedRobot:
3514	1	a	Fun physics platformer, probably not worth $5, but well worth $0.19.

3520	1	a	This game was on sale for so much that I actually made a profit selling the trading cards it drops.  10/10 even better than Free2Play!
520	0	a	Bought for my friend. We aren't friends anymore
521	0	a	ONE BIG ISSUE: Kind of wish I could recommend this game, cute, simple, light, but there's an issue, an issue that only hits me now. You see, I bought this game a while back, I had one monitor, the game worked fine, come back some time later with two monitors. if you have not caught on, the multi-monitor support is bad, the game stretches out the game across displays, I tried many things in effort to fix this, turn off second monitor, disconnect second monitor, restart computer, look around the files. Now with no luck and with the same results, I gave up and I can't recommend this game while this is an issue.
522	0	a	Wasting money simulator 2015
523	0	a	I saw this and thought it looked cool kindof but it sucks
524	0	a	This Game gets repetitive.
3522	1	a	Good game, but so hard to reload
3524	1	a	A cute little platformer made by a super small team of people. Actually a lot of fun especially for the price point. A few glitches here and there, but overall it's a decent game. Fair warning though it's a bit older of a game.
3526	1	a	Lovely 2D action platformer with physic puzzle elements.
3528	1	a	A pleasant suprise...what else is there to say? 
3530	1	a	.20 cents buy this now
3532	1	a	5/5
3534	1	a	Great game for 18 cents
3536	1	a	Really FUN!!!!!!!! I recomend it to everyone! 
3538	1	a	I had a lot of fun with this game. The controls can be a little challenging at times, but that makes the victories all the sweeter. You could probably beat this game in a day if you wanted, but it's still worth it.
529	0	a	I bought this game as part of a bundle, a very bad bundle. this is the best game in the bundle but thats not saying much since the other three games in the bundle are abysmal. This is basically a cutesy casual platformer that gives you the gravity gun from HL2 but suffers from bad level design, an uninspiring barely existant story, no boss battles, and a few bugs. There are better platformer games out there to buy.
530	0	a	Well I am not sure about this game. First off can't even play the game starts up black screen then never opens. I read the forums of it saying it might be a sound card thing. But wtf. No prob with any other games. Don't recommend unless you wanna take a chance of wasting your money
3540	1	a	What a load of *BEEP
531	0	a	A flash game worthy of newgrounds but worth paying for.
3542	1	a	Kinda like Wall-E looking robot, quite fun little game.  Why is it fun? Well you fly to a planet with the mothership, get to drive the robot (probe) on the planet. Get the gold, sometimes through physics puzzles.. then you have to shoot enemies as well. Later stages you can fly as well. Oh you can throw around your dead enemies with your little tractorbeam, stack them and use it to jump on higher platforms.  Recommend? YES!
3544	1	a	Pretty puzzle game !!! its Recommended!
3546	1	a	This game is literally the definition of weird. You play as a robot, fight other robots, can partially fly, and as a little side-note it is a platformer. This game has only one shortcoming, one that every platformer has... every time you fall off the damn edge.
3548	1	a	Pretty good for a game i got for 30 cents
3550	1	a	Beep is a great game, and definitely lives up to the claims it makes of being like yoshi island with gravity guns.  Following a ship of robots [beeps], you aim to travel a solar system and collect anti-matter. The levels are your classic platformer side-scrolling style, but there is a lot of variety in landscapes, from levels that require a jetpack, to those in underground flooded caves. There are also enemies that you can either shoot or avoid.   The majority of the gameplay is pretty casual, for example there is no limit on your ammo, you can reload an infinite amount of times. Some of the enemies require a bit of experimenting to find the best way to deal with them, which provides a challenge. That said, most of the enemies have a very simple AI.  The gravity gun provides for some very interesting gameplay. You can pick up many objects, including enemies, which can lead to finding some interesting solutions [not always the intended ones] to progressing through levels. This coupled with the gravity reversal in the final zone definitely makes this a great gameplay object, rather than just a gimmick.  The art in this game is very nice, and aside from a few [what i suspect are] spritesheet glitches when a certain enemy explodes, it is consistent throughout the game. On top of that, the music in this game is great.  This game is also short. The main level selection screen shows you have essentially 6 'zones', each with 4 levels. If you are a veteran player of platformers like this, you will probably breeze through it in no time. Regardless, if you like platformers, you will also enjoy it very much.
532	0	a	nothing special
3552	1	a	'what have i been doing the past few hours?'- says anyone who buys this game  9 out of 11
3554	1	a	Cute, kind of frustrating controls but otherwise a great casual game.
3556	1	a	A fun and casual physics puzzle platformer with a good variety of game mechanics to learn. Very fair up until the last level of the last world, that can burn in hell.
3558	1	a	It's Great! It's a lot of fun playing and I really do enjoy the game play experience, as well as the story line. Travelling the universe, exploring and discovering new planets, as well as creatures. The fighting is fairly straight forward and I always dispose of my enemies by using the gravity gun and whack them around a bit before I throw them into a pit of despair! Overall, a fun and adventurous game.  Great job! :D
3560	1	a	Really 10/10 game pretty difficult throughout and free profit from sale
3562	1	a	This game is 15p! BEEP!
3564	1	a	I like the art, despite cartoonish but isn't childish. And I like the game mechanic.
3566	1	a	It was good in the 5 minutes I played of it. I got it on sale for 19 cents. the first levels awesme, same with the world map. thx for reading. 999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999/10
3568	1	a	For a game that costs 21 cents CDN, it was definitely worth the price! I haven't played much, but from what I've explored it is incredibly fun. It runs smoothly and I enjoyed the level design. The graphics aren't the best feature to be honest, but it looks good for its price. Not only that, but you could just sell the cards to get your money back so you're technically getting a free game!
3570	1	a	I bought this game during the sale in which it was 96% off. Generally, these type of platformers make me nervous, but for 19 cents I couldn't let it down. If you love platformer games, you will LOVE this game. It's a mix of adventure, puzzle solving, and strategy.
3572	1	a	*BEEP*in' good time for the couple of days is lasted me. *BEEP*in' good value for the 19 cents they asked for it too. ♥♥♥♥♥ing ugly though.
3574	1	a	got it for 19 cents , made it back and a profit from trading cards , it is also a really enjoyable game , with some puzzle features to it , I do recommend this as it is just a generally fun game and is a great time passer
3576	1	a	Played through the first 3 levels, was fantastic fun, better than most platformers and more enjoyable too. 15 pence most definitely well spent.
3578	1	a	Wow this game is so good. Platformers have been under represented, this is not like that though!
3580	1	a	the use of both w,a,s,d and the mouse is awesome   really fun game
3582	1	a	Lovely 2D platformer with beautiful artstyle.One thing that annoyed me was that the game looked so good in 2D but the checkpoints,nuggets,anti-matter etc. were kind of 3D and I felt that wasn't really fitting in.8/10
3584	1	a	Pretty fun its the best 15p i spent in along time
3586	1	a	its an ok game and i got it on special and made 2 cents
3588	1	a	really fun, there are more levels to complete every time.
3590	1	a	Pretty awesome so far! One bug i have noticed that is a little annoying, is when youre in windowed mode and not full screen if you click escape to enter the pause menu, the game crashes. Well it does on my laptop anyway- which is not that much of a potato. Lol. But anyway! new game! low cost! I'm sure it'll get fixed and improved. In the mean time, i'm having a lot of fun just playing in full screen, but it is handy to play in windowed mode when multitasking etc. THANKS! :D
3592	1	a	Enjoyed this little game.
3594	1	a	awesome game,really like the trine style of playing and its not easy for 19 cents it is a must have
3596	1	a	:)
3598	1	a	I really liked this game. Nice design and a perfect structure. You should check it out.
3600	1	a	I like the game alot, it's fun to play. And it's always a time killer. This is the kind of game that you play when you're bored or when you are live streaming and you're not in for any serious action games.
3602	1	a	Just started the game and i already like it. The levels are fun and well made. The use of physics with the enemies and objects is awsome. The caves are great too it's dark and makes it a bit harder and that's fun. I recommand this game for anyone that likes platform games it worth every penny.
3604	1	a	Awesome Sauce!!!! .19 cents best price ever!
3606	1	a	I should buy this for my sweet sister Not a bad game 8/10
3608	1	a	This game is *BEEP* awesome!
3610	1	a	I didn't think it looked fun when I was gifted it for a friend.  In fact, I only installed it for laughs  Now, No matter how childish and simple the game LOOKS,  There is actually a challenge to the game  Some things are fun, too  Such as beating an enemy to death, with a dead enemy.  Even the unkillable beetle thingies with a powerful deathray,  Just bash it with the corpse of an enemy  10/10 would play challenging childs games and bash enemies with their fallen counterparts
3612	1	a	I got this gem of a game for just 15p and it is worth EVERY penny.  A super fun little platform/puzzler with great gameplay &amp; graphics that starts off very easy then requires a LOT more thought!  Excellent value for such a great game...a 'must-have' title if ever there was!!! 
3614	1	a	This is an awesome game! It somewhat compares to Super Mario Bros. 3, but way more awesome! It has a cool soundtrack, awesome mechanics, and cool level design. But recently it keeps crashing, which is a shame... Great game though!
3616	1	a	A pretty solid little game. I enjoyed it enough for the price.
3618	1	a	The game is just a little something to do when your other games don't appeal to you at the moment. Its a nice little game, nice graphics, a cool little ship you can fly around and smash into asteroids and space rocks. The dark areas add a whole new aspect to it as well.
3620	1	a	its a cheap little game its very fun doe
3622	1	a	Thanks for the 96% off sale! :D &lt;3
3624	1	a	So cute and amazing.
3626	1	a	I got this for 19 cents and made 20 cents from trading cards... good times  
3628	1	a	This game is *BEEP* Awesome
3630	1	a	great game 
3632	1	a	Easy to play and I like Its simple graphics.
3634	1	a	Bought this for .17 cents during summer sale. Played first few levels nice indie title for the price. Play it with family 10/10
3636	1	a	10/10
3638	1	a	It's as if someone took Winona's Gym from Pokemon Ruby, put in a shooter element, and extended the puzzles.
3640	1	a	no need to buy ammo. better than csgo
3642	1	a	Yoshi's Island + Half-Life + 21 cents on sale = fun.
3644	1	a	Game didn't beep.  0/10 Game of the Year
3646	1	a	Although I haven't played too much of this game (around two and a half hours), I can say it's deftinately worth it's cheap price (96% off)    PROS   -Great Graphics -Loads of levels -Nice mechanics -Brilliant Gameplay    CONS   -Somewhat poorly optimised: I have quite a good machine - an intel i5 4440 and a GTX 660. It runs pretty good however I can tell it sometimes drops for no reason. -Repetitive music  Overall, it's a good game if you can get it on deal but I wouldn't pay the full £3.99
3648	1	a	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hhrySCbTdU&amp;feature=youtu.be   BEEP is charming action plaftormer with not-so-complicated puzzels and great physics engine.  The story is almost non-existent. In the distant future, people created BEEP-ships that create BEEP-bots and send them to explore the universe. One of the ship find something and goes to see what it is. That's it.  The game have two problems. First one: lack of any kind of options. The game graphically won't blow your mind, music and sound fx are fine, but still it would be nice to have some options. The second problem: you jump with W. It's just not intuitive at first. But those two problems are not a big deal.  I like art style. It's simple, but so charming, vibrant and colorful, especially the locations you visit. Swamps, volcano, ice and desert places, forests and caves. They are diverse and full of obstacles to shoot and puzzles to tease your brain. There is one strange bug. When you kill a little flying kamikadze robot , a black square appear for a few seconds and then disappear. It's bizzare, but other than that I didn't notice any other bugs.  The main star here is the gameplay. It consist of platforming, puzzle solving and shooting. Even the level selection screen is great. With the mouse you move the rocket and after hitting enough asteroids it's time to deploy the BEEP-bot. The next level unlocks after beating the previous one. The BEEP-bot have three things available for handling the dangers – a single weapon, anti-gravity ray or Anti-Grav and he can float for a breif period of time, that way he can jump larger distances. The first thing I notice is the physics engine. It's great. A lot of thing can be move, stacked and even used as a weapon. Physics are the core of the game and anti-grav will be your best friend. At some places you have to rotate platform to step on it or put few stones on top of each other to reach higher place and so on. For a few levels, you will even get jet pack, which keeps the gameplay fresh.  Through the hole game you will search, if you want, for antimatter and when you find it, most times puzzle awaits you. Some require just to move out something, others test your reflexes and so on. Anti-grav is required for the puzzels. Level after level they get little bit complicated, but not too much. Some of them have to be solved to continue the game, others, like those for the antimater, are not. But if you not look for her, you are missing half the fun here. It's satisfying to solve puzzle, that seems at first glance difficult. They are not too easy or too hard, they are just right, fun and diverse.  For all the things I said about the gameplay, you need perfect controls. They are. When you die, it's entirely the players fault. But like I said in the beginning, W is kind of not intuitive. It took me few level to get use to it. I think Space bar is more appropriate. There is even counter for the deaths.   Enemy design is okay, they won't blow your mind. Several types of robots with various attack and movement patterns. But few enemies require different approach, like one that first you need to remove his helmet-thingy from his head and then shoot. They may look mean, but at the same time they are cute.  Sound design is good. The music is great, not too loud, diffrerent tracks for every world you visit and they fits really well . Few levels don't have music and I wonder if this is deliberate or the game bug out. Sound fx are nice. When you kill enemies they make cute noise and I kinda feel guilty for shooting them.  I was quite surprise by BEEP. I didn't expect to have so much fun. I bought it impulsively on sale. It took me little more than 7 h to beat it and i was never bored. Great and cute world, lengthy, nice mechanics, great soundtrack, but lack any kind of options. The game ended with open door for sequel and I hope some day to see the light of day. I highly recommened it.
3650	1	a	Beep Beep Beep!  + : simple, cute robots  - : classic platformer, nothing new really  6/10 would beep again
3652	1	a	worth it for 21 cents i sold the cards and got a booster pack so its basiically prphit from buying a game 
3654	1	a	FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO GET CARD DROPS : I got my drops in 9.1 hours of gameplay - drops are not fast for this game. FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BUY THIS GAME : Steam, please. Beep beep and money goes for a super cool strategy game. I recommend buying this if you have too much time on your hands and have some money to waste. Go ahead, buy it. 
3656	1	a	This game is quite simple and I don't have to write a complicated review for this. In BEEP, robots discover new planets and you have to get all asteroids in the map to get a good score on the level, while shooting and manipulating objects in the map to get through your way to the end. For $0.19 cents, it was worth a buy.  8/10
3658	1	a	Pretty good game
3660	1	a	Good platformer. 7/10
3662	1	a	Very cool, arcade game where you have to think a little before you do that, a lot of levels, the game hardly contain and priced very low. :)
3664	1	a	It's awesome, and its not a gun game its like Rated E For everyone.
3666	1	a	A fun and difficult platformer, I'd definately recomment this! Of course, sometimes using the enemies as platforms is sometimes frustrating. My only real gripe is that there is no sequel. Not because of how fun it is, but because of how the game ended. The ending suggested a sequel to the game, where we go to the Creeps home planet. The game was released in 2011, and there is no sequel. Big Fat Alien, you get to work with that. For what it is though, it's a pretty fun game, and it's only $2.
3668	1	a	Loved this game. I've apparently played 233.8 hrs of it in the last two weeks!
3670	1	a	Play as bloodthirsty robots sent to invade planets, steal natural resources, and murder locals.
3672	1	a	decent game for its price when its on 96%, some levels are quite challenging if u wanna get all the antimatter things ofc, decent platformer to pass some time
3674	1	a	great game! deffinatly worth 18 cents! im not a singleplayer nor platformer fan, but this game is challengeing and fun. many puzzles within the game and lots of action... im still not finished with the game but im almost done with the first world and i plan on finishing the game.
3676	1	a	This game is awesome!!!!!
3678	1	a	If you are bored and have nothing to play , try this , a child game but fun lol
3680	1	a	It's like a downloadable flash game you have to pay for. Still, really good.
3682	1	a	Pretty good physics platformer. You control a robot on wheels that can shoot enemies and move things around with its gravity gun. The goal is to get to the end of each level while collecting enough pieces of antimatter to unlock the next one. The puzzles are very easy, but stacking blocks (and dead enemies) to get to a high place requires some patience. You have infinitely many robots (lives) and you keep your progress within the level when you die, which is pretty good.  The game never gets very hard. Still took me 8 hours and 100 robots though.
3684	1	a	Fun to mess around in. It has a nice overworld and fun gameplay with nice-looking levels.
537	0	a	As much as I'd like to give this game a recommendation, I just can't. I had a blast in the first hour or so of the game, but the fuel mechainc really threw me off as I feel like it made the levels too big and it got easy to miss stuff. The music, while being very fitting, became way too repetative and boring after a while. But the biggest issue I had with this game was a bug that sometimes made the remains of enemies appear as black boxes. It would often make it hard to see the platforms and sometimes result in my death.  It's a good thing it's cheap, but I feel like it could be free. 4/10
3686	1	a	Lovely little game. After playing only 40 minutes of it and beating just one half of a planet I can already tell that it's great fun not only for kids. I'm very excited for difficulties and puzzles to come! Also the fact that BEEP says 'Beam me up Scotty!' from time to time at the end of a level helps a lot and with a final grade and I didn't even watch Star Trek.
3688	1	a	10/10, you will never be as cool as the makers of this game...
3690	1	a	BEEP is a cool game. Would be cool if we could use controller but oh well.
3692	1	a	There are alot of cheap platformers out there that I have to get a refund for, and theres alot that I look at are rubbish, but this one stands out as a GOOD cheap game it runs well and the gameplay is good for its price I highly reccomend if you are looking for a cheap puzzle platformer!
3694	1	a	If you're looking for a review you've come to the wrong place, if you're here to cook a pie then read on ! Napoleon from the final puff pastry  You will need:  Ready flaky pastry - 1.5 kg five eggs Flour - 150 g&gt; Sugar - 400 grams Milk - 1200 ml Vanilla sugar - 1 n. Cognac - 1 tbsp. l. Shelled walnuts - glass sequence of preparation: dough defrost naturally at room temperature (defrost time indicated on the package). Cook the custard: grind the egg yolks with a mixer or a whisk to a conventional incandescent and vanilla sugar, flour and brandy to enter the mix. The mixture pour a trickle of milk, stir and cook, stirring constantly. Divide the dough into the desired number of pieces that will later Korzh. Roll out each piece on a board sprinkled with flour. Bake in the oven for about 10 minutes until golden color on a dry baking temperature of 200 degrees. Fluff the cooled cream cakes. If desired, each layer sprinkled with chopped nuts. On top of the cake lightly press smeared with cream and sprinkle all sides crumbs. Add layer cake in a cool place overnight.
3696	1	a	Very fun game. Good physics
3698	1	a	It's nice.
3700	1	a	Although it's cheap tag, it's surprisingly well made from the fluidness, game mechanic, level design, control, and even the dinamic music. It's worth the full price, very recomended (y)
3702	1	a	(BEEP) ! This (BEEP)ing flying robot keeps killing me and i can`t pass him, i swear i`ll (BEEP)ing destroy it. The (BEEP)ing piece of (BEEP) !  8/10
3704	1	a	Much better than I thought, worth buying, even if not on sale.
3706	1	a	very fun platformer! easily worth the 49 cents it cost me :)
538	0	a	This review is base on the game not on the card.  Platformer/Puzzler who get really boring just after 2 level. No fun with this game. So I decided to land on the sun!  If you look for excitement, play at mario galaxy, Yoshi will be in it at least!...  I said it so. NEXT!
3708	1	a	The robot from Sealab 2021 has to kill other robots and collect gold nuggets.   Delightful game.
539	0	a	There's nothing particularly wrong with  BEEP , but I think that's at least partly because the developers weren't innovating or taking risks with it, and ultimately, it just feels too generic and simple to hook me. The gravity gun, touted as a unique mechanic and the game's main attraction, really isn't unique at all: it's functionally identical to, and used for puzzle-solving in exactly the same way as the wizard's telekinesis in  Trine , which is a much more highly recommended game.
3710	1	a	BEEP is a cute little exploration platformer game. You have to explore three planets and collect golden nuggets. There is enemies, annoying platforming, jetpacks and more. Definetely something you need to have in your library
3712	1	a	Platformers, by and large come in two varieties: Cute and Cuddly, and mentally difficult. While things like SuperMeatBoy fall into the latter, this very firmly falls into the former.   Beep is, essentially, a keyboard/mouse physics puzzler/platformer crossover. You take control of a little robot, exploring a solar system of three planets, 'beaming down' into level after level, looking for 'antimatter', and then beaming back up.  The game features all the usual favourites of platformers - you'll be teetering on edges, jumping over enemies, sliding blocks, running on rotating drums, solving machine puzzles, shooting bullets, and my absolute #1 favourite: dying a lot.  That's the thing about platformers: They're set up to kill you. Some are fierce and you're expected to die every 10 seconds, while others involve tactics, long run-ups, and really spectacular jumps (e.g. Sonic). This falls midway between the two: It never presents a level which is ridiculously hard, usually giving you a relatively safe place you can 'fall' to, but although there are some really nice long jumps, and great swings, it doesn't have the majesty of AAA platformers like Sonic.  This feels like an indie Flash game that outgrew the technology and needed to visit the big leagues. It's cute, cuddly, easy to pick up, has good music, fun sound effects, and is nicely balanced. There were very few occasions where I got truly narked with the level design, but generally, I found a better way to do it than I had been trying.  The game rewards mild exploration. Unlike some games that cheat with invisible doors, off-screen specials, or collapsing platforms, this game is pretty straight-up, and says 'There's a special up here. Come get it if you can work out how.'. I finished the game collecting every single last piece of antimatter, and didn't spend ages banging my fists in frustration either.  So, yeah, this is a really really fun little game. I don't recommend playing on a touchpad. It REALLY benefits from a mouse. Similarly, if your mouse skills aren't great, I'd pass on this, cos you have to be a bit good on the point-and-click.   For the price, this gave a lot of entertainment, although not a lot of story per se. The game hints to a sequel, which I'd consider playing if the price was as low as I got this one for. Pick it up if you have a few hours to kill: Each level takes about 10 to 30 minutes to master and complete, so you can play it in short bursts.  Great fun.
3714	1	a	For puzzle-platformer lovers, it is worth giving a try. Besides, It's quite cheap.
541	0	a	I wanted to like Beep. The music and art style is charming and some of the level design is good, but the difficulty is very uneven. Worse, the difficulty arises not from a solution being hard to think of, but because the controls are too loose to precisely perform what you've thought of.  Tighter controls would have turned this game from a no to a yes.
542	0	a	The game has nice graphics, but overall is pretty boring.  BEEP makes annoying sounds; Sharacter design is not to be found; Soundtrack is chilled, but ignorable; BEEP makes a scared face whenever it jumps (WTF, this is a platformer, you're SUPPOSED to jump); The telekinesis system is kinda broken;
3716	1	a	I really like this game and it is worth it. Its just another one of those really fun indie games
3718	1	a	I don't play free flash games in my browser anymore, I pay $0.50 and download them on steam now.
3720	1	a	Great little game, I bought it on sale, but even for $1 equivalent it is well worth buying. It is a really great combination of platforming with strategic and creative use of a gun for shooting/manipulating items in the world.  Just buy it!
3722	1	a	The best game ever made 
3724	1	a	So, I bought this for €0,24 when it was in a sale. And there are trading cards, so it is even cheaper than that. This game is a cartoonish-like puzzle platformer. It felt pretty easy, but there was quite a lot of music and many levels. Even some storyline! And all that for a few cent. Buy it already! (at least when its at sale)
3726	1	a	im not sure about this game, the mechanics are cool and the whole physics engine behind it works really well i would suggest it for a little local flash game fun if you know what i mean.  the game runs smoothly and probably has the worst story line in history ( still better than twilight) but for a flash game it really is fun to play around with  I rate it 6/10
3728	1	a	10/10 Would Platform Again  
3730	1	a	This is by far one of the most value packed games I have played. For such a small price why not just grab it and try it?  It was gifted to me by a viewer and so I thought I'd give it a try and I was impressed. For an indie game there are some challenging puzzles, hours of playtime(~10 if 100% completion) and tons of infuriating moments. I can only hope that with the sale that recently featured the game that the developer will make a sequel.
543	0	a	Just so people are aware, this game's name use to be Orion Dino Beat Down, and they changed the name and re released it multiple times as a new game just to keep people from seeing all of the negative feedback it was getting. This is the same game that utilizes stolen assets and the head of Trek Industries, formerly spiral game studios fired the real team working on it just before release without paying them. I'm writing this review now because they are attempting to get out of a DMCA and possible suit of their new game 'Orion' where they are literally doing the same exact thing and trying to play the victim. I bought this game before even knowing all of this, and felt so dirty for doing so, and im hoping and urging people away from buying into this mistake and scum of a company.
3732	1	a	'Well its only a dollar, how good can it be?' 16 hours later... 'HOW IS THIS ONLY A DOLLAR?'
3734	1	a	If this game was priced at $30+ I would say avoid it like the plague.  If this game was priced at $20 I would say don't bother waiting for a sale.  If this game was priced at $10 I would say just buy anything else.  If this game was priced at $5 I would say you could buy lunch instead.  If this game was priced at $1 I would say you have no reason not to own this.  So what I'm saying is you have no reason not to own this. If you even get one hour of entertainment out of it from soley looking at some nice graphics and laughing at some bugs and glitches that was a dollar well spent. It beats the hell out of paying $70 for a AAA-title for the same effect. The devs know this is not the greatest game ever made, but they have made leaps and bounds in progress from the days when this was considered 'one of the worst games on Steam.' And for precisely this reason they have dropped the price so much. They want to redeem themselves. They want people to play their game and give it a chance. What are you waiting for, you heartless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥? It's only a dollar. Play their game.
3736	1	a	99 cents.  It cost me 99 cents to shoot at dinosaurs for nearly 40 hours.  Yes.
3738	1	a	 UPDATE : ORION PRELUDE   There simply aren't enough games with dinosaurs &amp; even fewer of these that are actually worth playing! For me, Orion: Prelude (O:P) is that rare exception. Although not much in way of a story in the game  (no single player after all) , there is quite a tale on how Orion came to be the game it is today...  The short version is, that O:P is an evolution of previous Orion titles, Dino Horde &amp; Dino Beatdown originally dating back to a successful 2011 Kickstarter campaign. Although recieving early criticism  (that would normally kill a game ..dead.. disappearing into obscurity) , the game continued to evolve with constant updates (big &amp; small) over the years from the developers. Spiral stuck with it! This dedication &amp; gradual refinement of the game has resulted in an excellent first-person co-op experience, with a well rounded collection of modes, weapons, enviromental effects, vehicles &amp; more to enjoy.   PvP isn't forgotten; it's also selectable. PvP feels more alike to a retro deathmatches, than a modern PvP  (in a good way!) , but I mainly enjoy the co-op modes. In co-op, you essentially have to defend your power core against waves of bloodthursty dinosaurs. Dinosaur kills will reward you credits, which you can use to buy perks &amp; weapon upgrades, in-turn helping you survive the later, harder waves. Some waves also have you securing objectives. Co-op doesn't feel ultra competitive, most of the time you don't watch your credits/kills, rather finding yourself just having fun surviving &amp; helping your teammates! I've found the community to generally be helpful &amp; friendly in-game too.  One of the real stand-out features in O:P has to be the enviromental effects randomly cycling on the alien world. From the day/night cycles to the extreme variety of climates &amp; types of weather. Adds so much to the atmosphere. Couple this with excellent lighting effects through what seems to be a thicker atmosphere and the results can sometimes be spectacular! Even overwhelming! You definitely get that  feeling  when your final wave gets a night cycle with heavy rain .. you know you are gonna see an epic close quarter battle!  Along with the awesome effects, there are 3 distinct classes to mix-up the gameplay. Each has unique strengths &amp; each you can progress/level-up in online play to unlock starting weapons, power-ups &amp; perks. Initial learning curve isn't steep, so once you get the hang of the basic flow it becomes very easy to sink multiple hours killing dinos! O:P rarely feels like a grind; even at lower levels  (without a lot of perks)  you competently kill dinos &amp; gain good XP. Plenty of dinos to go around too :)  If you can't find a friend to play with, there is also bot-support added in O:P to fill the ranks. This can be helpful to get playing quickly if server populations are low (which regrettably does happen).  The trilogy of classes are well balanced (no need for any other classes), as is the gameplay in general. Difficulty is super scalable. Weapons are mainly shared between classes so quickly become familiar, and vehicles are easy to use &amp; offer a good range of practical &amp; destructive uses. Repetitive? Sure, to a degree, it is the same thing over &amp; over and despite there being a lot of 'accessories' to the spice up the character classes &amp; tactics, modes etc, there are not a huge number of maps for each mode. I expect this will change soon with Steam Workshop support being added.  The A.I. generally employed by the dinosaurs is a fairly basic 'rush' tactic, which can feel pretty predictable  (there are a few surprises though) , but I find the larger dino numbers to counteract this limitation to a degree anyway. There are also the occasional technical glitches like querky physics (flying Stegosaurus anyone?) or clipping inside a dinosaur. Nothing game-breaking that I have experienced, but sure does make for some funny moments! Just like my many failed attempts at some of the more creative 'Ride a Dino for 10secs' &amp; 'Slap T-Rex 100 times' achievements :)  O:P reminds me a bit of those classic, simple shooters like a Serious Sam or Left 4 Dead, but with a bit of high-tech sci-fi flavor. This future-tech feel across the game contradicts the jurassic era dinosaurs &amp; remote wilderness landscapes nicely! O:P is not as complex mechanically or technically when compared to a top end AAA FPS, but its simplicity is also its underlying strength. It is great value ($1!), has strong replayability and the focused, balanced gameplay  (some bonus ..ahem.. querks)  offers a truely fun &amp; intense, dino killin' co-operative survival experience!     Too much to read?    Yeah ok then (fair call lol)..   I'll let Dave Chappelle quickly summarise what O:P is really all about:   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=269015668   (original artwork uploaded by  Grayscars !)

3740	1	a	The Metacritic score is misleading. That was for Dino Beatdown, not for Horde. The game has been changed a lot since the days of Beatdown. From the original 3, it has been updated to 10 different dinosaurs. 4 of which are playable in a game mode. Balancing patches, as well as optimization patches have been implemented and the game now runs like butter on my computer. There's a combonation of 50+ weapons and gear, customization of armor color and hats and other cosmetics. The Developers have been working their asses off making this game as fun as possible and it paid off.  So, what is this game like? Halo + Turok + Killing Floor. You've got your standard pistols, machineguns and shotguns and then you get your rocket launchers, laser guns and heavy weapons. Each class has their own special abilities like Jetpacks, cloaking and healing beams, all which can be augmented to be more effective. You can also level your classes for better performance like in Killing Floor which lifts the burden of having to buy certain augments and use that money for other things. You've got player vs dinosaurs, player vs player dinosaurs, player vs player, player vs harder dinosaur waves and Conquest which is coming up soon.  My only gripes right now with it are the animations being a little rough, dinosaurs can be a little derpy and the music is the same in EVERY map. I know that old music from Beatdown will be implemented once Conquest rolls out, but not sure if that's just for the Conquest maps or for all the maps.  But other than that, it's a pretty great game that has my full love.
3742	1	a	Let's be brutally honest here.  How many other games can you drive a tank off a cliff, smash into a T-Rex, jump out, noscope T-rex with a bow and then club it to death with a lightsaber?  Exactly.
3744	1	a	 Dinosaurs, jetpacks, lightsabers, teleporters, invisibility, high-tech vehicles, extreme weather effects... omg this game is everything! And epic victory music is playing in the background all the time. Seriously I have really good time playing this game.
3746	1	a	The community is very strong. Guys with jetpacks hide on cliffs, laughing while everyone else gets smashed on the ground. Not bitter.
3748	1	a	But sh*t, it was 99 cents.
3750	1	a	It's bad... In the best way possible. Will Dinohorde go down in history as an innovative piece of gaming? Not in any sense of the phrase. Will it be remembered for its cutting edge graphics, intuitive gameplay or captivating story? Negative. What you will remember about Dinohorde is the unreasonable amount of fun you will have playing it with a few of your best gaming buddies. Its difficult to describe why, and it might just be how ridiculous the whole thing is, but Dinohorde is one of the most fun games I've played in 2014. The quality isn't quite there but you won't regret dropping a couple dollars on this inexplicable gem.
3752	1	a	OPEN THE DOOR GET ON THE FLOOR EVERYBODY WALK THE DINOSAUR
3754	1	a	Some advice:  1) Kill the flying jerks first. The larger ones can pick you up and drop you out of the sky. Very disconcerting.  2) If you get picked up by a large flying jerk, melee it. It will drop you.  3) T-Rex's can 360 no-scope you with rocks. Keep your rear end in motion.  4) Save up your dough and buy the greedy perk first. Then buy stopping power. Life gets easier after that.  5) When you buy this game - and you should buy this game - remember that stealing your teammate's speeder bike is a big no-no.  6) Keep the generators up and running. Because reasons. Also because the game will end if it stays offline too long.  7) The vampire perk is gross but cool.  8) T-Rex's that 360 no-scope you with rock throws... Did I mention that? Pretty sure I mentioned that...
3756	1	a	Its like Cod Zombies without Zombies or Cod and theres Dinosaurs
3758	1	a	$0.99 to shoot a triceratops right in the face. Thanks, Obama.
3760	1	a	I really love this game and i would like to ask anyone reading to just give it a try even if its just a free weekend.  Spiral has done an amazing job of post release support with tons of new maps, modes and improved graphics all free.  If your looking for something co-op thats a blast to play with friends and quite playable solo (your characters go up in levels offering perks and better starting gear) this game is a diamond in the rough.   Dont let the metacritic score turn you away and come play a game where the developers care about thier product.    
3762	1	a	Great game, tons of not-too-serious fun. I actually felt bad only giving the dev's 99c for this ... so I bought 2 :D  PS. msg me if you'd like that extra copy. I've only got 1 for now!
3764	1	a	Orion: Prelude is the revised version of Orion: Dino Horde, which itself, is a revised version of Orion: Dino Beatdown. Confusing, isn't it?  Orion: Dino Beatdown; the original, was a terrible game that launched as an alpha, with terrible netcode, and justly received a Metacritic rating of 36. Ironically, if you check the Metacritic rating, it'll be for Orion: Dino Horde. Apparently Metacritic hasn't received word from the developer that they've changed the name yet again.  But enough about how Spiral Game Studios keeps trying to reinvent the game by renaming it and patching problems that should have been fixed at release; what is the game like? Orion: Prelude is a team-based, cooperative, sci-fi, wave-based, FPS where your goal is to kill dinosaurs and complete objectives. The game is essentially what you'd get if you took Killing Floor and Halo and mixed them together. It's borrows Killing Floor's wave-based combat, where every kill gives you money to better arm yourself, and every wave gets progressively harder; and it borrows from Halo in the Shield mechanic, the vehicular combat, (although this could be atributable to other games as well) and the overall look of the game.  Up to five players can play together on a single server. Within the game, there are three classes which further distinguish your role from the role of the other four players. The classes are Assault, Support, and Recon. While I'd normally explain in depth the differences between these classes, I can't because there really isn't much of a reason. If you're playing this game, you're playing it in either Survival or Conquest. Sure, there are other gamemodes to choose from, but they're all variations of standard PvP gamemodes that exist in better incarnations in other games, so you'd be better served playing them there. If you bought this game, you bought it for the dinosaurs, which means it's Survival or Conquest for you. In that case, pick Assault if you want to kill things, and pick Support if you want to keep teammates alive. There's no reason to pick Rogue in these gamemodes. It seems as though the developers made it for PvP only, as in Survival and Conquest, it suffers greatly.  The differences between the classes really come down to the single class skill you get at spawn. The Assault class gets a jetpack ability which can be improved by purchasing augments. (more on this later) The Support class gets access to a medigun which can heal a player, and with the proper augment, replenish their ammo supply. The Rogue class can turn invisible which can act as an effective temporary invulnerability, as all Dinosaurs will immediately de-aggro from you and never attack you while stealthed. Those are the differences. There's also some weapon differences, but all weapons can be bought by purchasing an augment that allows you to purchase class restricted weapons.  What are these augments I keep referring to? Just like in Killing Floor, at the end of a wave which is usually around 20-30 dinosaurs, you have a minute to buy weapons or augments at their respective shops. Weapons are divided into four categories: primary weapons, secondary weapons, pistols, and Adrenaline weapons. Primary weapons are your standard rifles, LMG's, and Sniper Rifles. Secondary Weapons are SMG's and shotguns. Pistols are pistols, and Adrenaline weapons are class-specific weapons.  Augments provide boosts to your character's fighting ability; from double jumping to boost jumping, to additional armor. There's even an augment which allows you to feast upon dinosaur corpses for health which sounds neat, but is utterly worthless. While Augments are important, there's really a select few which are far and away better than the rest which you'll find yourself buying in the same order every game, irrespective of what class you are. There are a few class-specfic augments which I alluded to earlier, but most of the desired ones are shared amongst the classes.  Onto the dinosaurs. There are tiny dinosaurs like Compies, medium sized dinosaurs like Raptors and some larger spitting dinosaur, then there are large Dinosaurs like Triceratops, Stegosaurus, and of course, the T-Rex. Instead of being smart and making the large dinosaurs the primary objective of the game, the entire game focuses around killing the small dinosaurs, because the waves are determined by a specific number of dinosaurs that spawn, not the type of dinosaur. A dinosaur killed is a dinosaur killed no matter what type it is. So your best bet is to just kill all of the easy-to-kill dinosaurs, and leave the large ones alive to clean up after the wave has ended, assuming you don't have anything pressing to buy. This is the main gripe I have with the game. The main pull of the game, fighting giant dinosaurs, has been relegated to a mere distraction and nothing more. If you stop and spend time killing the large dinosaurs, you're opening yourself up to a whole lot more damage by the smaller raptors.  When I refer to the large dinosaurs as distractions, I really mean annoyances. They'll hone in on one particular player, then constantly harass that player until one of the two dies. The T-Rex is especially annoying because it has this weird snare effect when it's damaging you which prevents you from getting away from it, so you just get caught and repeatedly bitten until you go down.  When you lose all of your health, the game borrows the downed system from Left 4 Dead, where you can be helped up. I say they borrowed it because it seems to be a combination of the system from Left 4 Dead and Payday. Your character can fall three times. If it falls a fourth time, you're dead and can only respawn next wave. Killing a dinosaur while downed gives you a second wind, or you can be helped up by another player.  The graphics are shockingly mediocre. It seriously looks like Halo 2 on Xbox circa 2004. The Source Engine has never looked as dated as this in a long time. The character models are all low poly count, and the environments are all bland and uninspired. They are large, so there's plenty of blandness to go around.  Overall, Orion: Prelude is exactly what you'd expect it to be; a bland cooperative shooter which has no identity of its own. The developers apparently tried to ride off of the novelty of players fighting dinosaurs in a sci-fi setting, but the game requires more than that. On top of that, there's something rather deceptive about trying to hide your failure by re-releasing the game under a different name, as if to try and avoid that ugly metacritic rating.  The game is nothing more than Orion: Dino Beatdown, just patched to be a working copy of it, rather than a buggy, laggy mess that shouldn't have been released. All these complaints aside, the game will provide you with a few hours of entertainment before the repitition and realization that all of these gameplay choices have been pulled from more successfull games. Considering that at the time of this review, the game is being sold on Steam for $1, with a 4-pack of it costing a grand total of $3, I struggle to think of another Steam title which you can get several hours of entertainment for four people, for just $3. Perhaps in that regard, Orion: Dino Beatdown/Dino Horde/Prelude succeeds.

3774	1	a	What can I say about ORION: Prelude? Let's start with what it's  not ...  It's not a perfect game. It's not 100% bug-free. It's not a contender for Game Of The Year.  But more importantly, let's go on to what it  is ...  It's extremely fun. It's very well supported. It's extremely fun. It's got a great community. It's extremely fun. It's amazing value for money. Did I mention that it's extremely fun?  For the price, you wouldn't believe that this is a fully-fledged multiplayer FPS with solid progression, numerous weapons and power-ups, a decent array of vehicles and goddam  dinosaurs  to gun down! But that's exactly what it is. You probably won't put hundreds of hours into it but it certainly doesn't feel like a £0.79p / $0.99c game. In fact, I reckon this is the single best value for money of any game in my entire collection. I've certainly got my 79p worth and then some - and I still keep coming back for more!  If you like multiplayer FPS and you're not literally penniless, why are you still reading this review? At this price, just buy it already!
3776	1	a	Fun game. Was skeptical when saw it for a dollar. But it is a hidden gem. Definately worth at least 5.
3778	1	a	Over the years this game has been bashed as one of the worst games to be released on steam, however now I'd say get it.  For £0.79 game the graphics look like they are from a game costing £30, and the weather effects you get on your helmet is a nice addtion too, the main enemys in this game are dinosaurs and there are 7 of them and 2 flying reptiles and a giant Crocodile, all 10 of them feel unquie and fun to fight against.  You can get vechicles in this game, theres the average jeep with turret, a jet and a tank, but best of all theres a MECH! YES A MECH YOU CAN FIGHT A TREX WITH A MECH! All of the vechicles are great to drive and are really helpful overall.  Game breaking glitches like map glitches or crashes are very rare in this game, the only one I can think of is where you can leave a map by playing as a flying reptile or playing Assault with the jetpack and fly above the boundires, luckly this is only on one map and it's unplayed often.  However this game does have a few downsides....  1. A lot of weapon clipping, sound glitches and firing glitches, most noticeable with the default pistol, duo pistols and using reload speed upgrade. 2. Ragdolls are really glitchy at times, however more tame then any from the Source engine. 3. Playing as Dinosaurs is nearly impossible with the terrible camara angle and controls. 4. Soundtrack is really stock. 5. Small, but very friendly commuinty  Overall the game is much more better then it orignally was, a fun CO-OP horde game to play with your friends!
3780	1	a	Broken in all the right ways
3782	1	a	You can fight t-rexes in helicopter gunships, enough said.
3784	1	a	WTF ?! Why its Free ? give my 0.49$ back I want my csgo skins back
3786	1	a	This game is really freaking awesome. The metascore is bull!! This game has been remade from the start. Great Survival Action against dino's. Great weapons ,upgrades and vehicles. Ill do a larger review later, get it basically for free now!! 99 cents is more than a steal!!
3788	1	a	i got my 99 cents of fun from this game, better then buying a soda.   9/10  
3790	1	a	Yes, buy this game. Its Killing floor + Halo + Turok.  It has its flaws, but the devs seem devoted and are present on the steam forums. If you played this game in beta and not again(like me) give it another shot, it is now playable(LoL) and quite awesome. The difference is uncanny. I reinstalled it yesterday and I'm already level 11. It never felt like grinding. Buy a four pack, get some friends who will play installed and have a blast together.   For me the biggest con is the limited players. That easy to solve though, buy and play this WAY under priced game.
3792	1	a	Best 99 cents wasted of my life...
3794	1	a	You pay for what you get. The FPS mechanics are awful, seriously awful, but - in the end - is a fun budget sandbox game about shooting dinosaurs together.  Do not expect much more.  P.S. I'm gonna say Yes only thanks to its cost (0,99€) and the addition of a Steam Workshop.
3796	1	a	I enjoyed it since the dino horde update. It's like a mixture of killing floor, halo and dinosaurs, sounds silly but it's a really fun game to play with your friends. Good graphics, no story mode(single player), 5 different difficulties, pvp and co-op mods, three classes and many equipments to choose from, vehicles, simple serverlists, simple level system that rewards you boosts, ''starting weapons'' and more. This game is worth more than the price says, grab it and share with your friends! :)
3798	1	a	From what i see this game changed a lot... +1 for developers that delivered what they promesed and that is a rare thing this days
3800	1	a	Me and my friends were playing for 2 hours, but when we were almost done with the map, my friend drove us into a rock and we got stuck and we exploded.  11/10
3802	1	a	Q:Do I like it?Why? A:I cant decide.5 minutes into the games and im noclipping though the dinosaur while reloading.  Q:Overall? A:stuck on level 1  Q:Any useful tips? A:nope  DA SENTENCEEE  help.
3804	1	a	My friends call this game 'The good game because it's so bad'. A bare mininum shooter game with surprisingly good varity of weaponry. Expect glitches and bugs because it's not a triple A game.
3806	1	a	How much fun can you have for 60p?  Chased by a T-Rex Picked up by a Ptera Thrown onto a tank Proceed to blow up everything  Better than a bag of Walkers 10/10 would scream hysterically again
3808	1	a	   Basic Information
550	0	a	  It's A Trap!
3810	1	a	Have this weird need to drive all of my friends into things and get blown up. Drove a vehicle full of my buddies into a triceratops. Blew up. Killed all my friends. Got an achievement: Teammate From Hell. Pleased. 10/10 Would drive buddies to their deaths again.
3812	1	a	This game? This game is awesome. It costs only 0.79$. Thats pretty cheap for a game like that.  Lots of features, funny gameplays, multiplayer matchmaking super fast and lots more. Verry nice co-op with friends. Totally worth the money. Buy it!
3814	1	a	Ever punch a velociraptor in the face so hard it does a backflip as its head turns into a fine paste? Well now you can do so for a price worth paying to see it.
551	0	a	English (US) Look, the game is not bad ok, but the multiplayer community is pretty much dead, so... for a multiplayer only game, like battlefield, you won't have much to do, only buy if your friends are going to play with you...   Protugues (Brasil) Olha o jogo não é ruim mas a comunidade morreu, poucos ainda jogam, e como é um jogo exclusivamente multiplayer não há o que fazer mais, por isso não recomendo... Somente compre se voce tiver amigos que querem jogar com voce e vão voltar...  Nota: 7/10
3816	1	a	This game is like Dino D-Day, only better.
3818	1	a	As much as I absolutely despise games that try to be Halo, Doom and Dead Space all shifted into one blobby, stinking mess, I have to admit, this game caught me by surprise. When I saw the game on the Steam Store, and the big, hunky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with some sort of shiny, LED space suit caught my eye as he stood rather awkwardly next to the title, I thought 'Oh, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, not this ♥♥♥♥♥ again.' However, then I began playing the game and, over the span of about four hours, I realized what it was all about.  Most games pride themselves on intriguing characters, amazing, scripted scenes and all-out fantastic storylines. But, nope. Orion Prelude isn't about any of those things. Now, I know what you're going to say. 'Hold on there one second, Contorted. If it's not awesome, intriguing or fantastic, how is it a good game' Well, let me tell you. Usually when playing Call of Duty, Far Cry, Halo, you name it. I sometimes find myself thinking. 'Isn't this practically another one of those stories but just happening a different way? I mean, you start the game out not knowing what the ♥♥♥♥'s going on, a villian is introduced. Somewhere down the line he does something terrible and probably kills off one of your mates and then you ♥♥♥♥ him up for it and the game ends with you walking cockily into the distance?' With Orion, that kind of every-day ♥♥♥♥ doesn't happen. It's the simplicity and almost childlike logic on which the game prides itself on that makes it somewhat charming. It's one of the only games I've ever played that actually exists simply for fun and, somehow, the lack of anything huge or emotionally powerful happening actually works towards aplifying that charming simplicity. It literally exists for FUN.  However, the game isn't perfect. The lack of logic may work towards the game's advantage and atmosphere, but in some places it does get a little annoying. The slightest nudge from a T-Rex can send you flying to the other side of the map screaming 'To infity and ♥♥♥♥ you' in the opposite direction. Also, the idea that a flying Dinosaur that's about the size of a large Human can push away an air-based vehicle that's about five times its' size never fails to floppify my action boner. But, once again, these annoying little pockets of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t is what makes it all the more satisfying when you unload enough bullets into the Dinosaurs that are coming at you to kill them and they flop dead to the ground. Watching a flying Dino fall about five hundred feet and splat on a rock never fails to make me giggle. Also, one of the most, and I can't find another word to describe it, 'epic' game mechanics ever is the fact that, when a teammate dies, or you kill a T-Rex or Spinosaurus, the screen flops into slow-motion. Why? Because it makes killing a Dinosaur all the more awesome when its' body falls limp in slow motion.  Overall, Orion: Prelude is a fun little game, which is very childlike, but also quite charming and adorable to play. It's like you're one of the Spartans from Halo, stuck into a game of Primal Carnage, but you have a jetpack, medigun or a massive, armoured vehicle to help you out.
3820	1	a	Enjoy this game for what it is, a buggy piece of ♥♥♥♥ with horrific controls for Dinosaurs.  But ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ it's great.   Plus it's cheaper than a tap water from Starbucks.
3822	1	a	I shot a T-Rex in the face with a revolver, killed it, and then got eaten by it's mate. 8/10, would recommend.
3824	1	a	Is it a great game? No. Is it worth the price? Yes. Can you get some absurd fun out of it? Yes.
552	0	a	ORION: Prelude. Previously known as Orion: Dino Horde, and previously known before that as Dino Beatdown. It's a nifty little FPS about...well, the mass killing of dinosaurs. The name changes, despite what the developers will claim on their forums, are repeated attempts to avoid their perpetually low metacritic scores. Each iteration of this dino slaughter game is merely just a shameless repackaging, in an attempt to shed it's horrible metagamer score. Perhaps neither here nor there, but it does give you an idea of how dishonest this publisher is willing to be to ensure the game continues to sell.  The game has a glaring lack of polish, tends to run at very low framerates, even on powerful machines, and has the nasty habit of crashing...repeatedly, for no apparent reason. Notably, some people only rarely experience these crashes, but for many people, the game is rendered unplayable. And of course, when you're not crashing, your friends are disconnecting. Playing through a single match of any appreciable length becomes rather difficult.  Pair that with the repetitive music and downright embarrasing voices the humans feature, you get the distinct feeling that there was a notable lack of love going into the visuals and sound in this game. Seriously, though. The voices are reminiscent of an athsmatic in a bathroom with seasonal allergies and a horrible headcold. (Looking at you, support class! If you call me 'homey' one more time...)  Notably, the lag and the crashes and the disconnects are issues that have persisted for me and my friends over a year, since the game was called ORION: Dino Horde. If you are among the lucky people who can play this game without crashing non-stop, then I suggest you immediately stop to thank your lucky stars.   The game features a variety of modes, but most modes involve slaughtering dinos. (There are a few that allow you to play as dinos.) The game contains 3 classses of humans you can play as, support, assault, and recon. (Think of a clunkier version of Tom Clancy.) While assault is fun to play as with his jetpack, and the recon is nifty with her invisibility, the support class wins hands down, with his ability to heal himself and others....to an extreme degree. He can tank just about anything with his healing gun.  Even though the support class is massively overpowered, playing the game as any other class is quite difficult. Between massive dinos that create unavoidable earthquakes, or even bigger dinos that merely swallow you whole, ORION exists on a strange difficulty spectrum.  So long as one uses the support class, and uses the turrets on the backs of the vehicles you can ride, the game seems relatively easy. If you, like me, decide to explore what else the game has to offer, you'll run back to your support class/turret combo relatively quickly, as you find that the world of dino horde is quite a cruel one indeed.  In short, Orion: Prelude, under any name, is a glitchy, laggy, poorly thought out PVP shooter/dino killing game/dinos vs humans, that attempts to excuse its mediocrity with a low price point. Considering the legions of pvp shooters out there, you're probably better off picking up any one of those and leaving this one be.
3826	1	a	A 6 year olds wet dream
553	0	a	Game is ok. Devs are shady little children who can't handle negative feedback or make original content. 3/10 needs new dog models
3828	1	a	Guess what? It's actually fun. And guess what again? It doesn't look that bad. MY GOD WHAT SORCERY IS THIS
3830	1	a	7.5/10  $1 thats pretty good for dis game.
3832	1	a	Dude, it's cheap, it's worth it. Shooting dinos with your friends just for a dollar, cmon man. I see nothing bad here, good graphics and great fun with friends. Ok, it obviously could get boring after a while, but it's worth the price. I would say, it's even little bit too cheap for that kind of game, but whatever. Lol, believe me, you won't regret it.
554	0	a	Stop looking at the negative reviews this game is amazing and for $1 it's an absolute steal. 9/10
3834	1	a	Call of duty. For 50 cents. With dinosaurs. 10/10- IGN
3836	1	a	they should have made it free 2 play, the minute they put that money harvesting store in the game.  trek industries a.k.a. spiral studios a.k.a. Dave Prassell, isn't doing anybody any favors.  the game however, is still pretty good. i recommend it, begrudgingly. at least, now, you can't beat the price.  still, the company that made it is just as shady as any other video game company because they are ALL shady. it's an inherently shady industry, so you can't show me a game publisher who is not shady because there aren't any of those.
3838	1	a	I spent over 5 dollars on this game for other people...  I say money well spent, I enjoyed this game.
3840	1	a	1 dollar? Worth its price
557	0	a	Terrible game. Fun for first five minutes. After that it's problems show. Firstly, the dinos are all very static. Static in the sense that all the dinos ever do is just run at you with the same animations straight at you to attack. No lurking, no ai intelligence. The dinos are like tracking missiles just running directly at you. Next the vehicles feel very basic. The game's mech is a clunky mech which you click to fire a turret which is pretty much the same turret on every vehicle with a turret. The vehicles feel slow and not fun to drive. It is just endless waves repeating after each wave of dinos increasing in number and doing the same thing until you die.   The game's mechanics could do a little better at some things also, like when a ptero picks you up and flies if u kill it while it is flying it drops u and u die from fall dmg(wth?). Weapons in this game don't feel powerful at all. Imagine just firing at this dino and the dino does not even flinch or stumble. There is just the same blood splatter backwards and you grind him down until he dies. The music is loud and makes it feel like some arcade shootout. Even without the music, the dinos sound even louder than your guns.   This game is actually just Dino:Beatdown but re-released to try to get more players to buy after dino beatdown got bad reviews.  Now don't get me wrong the game is supposed to be co-op fun, but even with friends after awhile it will be just the whole team split up running in circles around the rocks shooting dinosaurs which are herded behind them.  What's good about this game though is that it had a nice concept and could be fun sometimes, but either buy it now at $1 or don't buy at all.
3842	1	a	I killed 5 Dinosaurs with a pistol  11/10
3844	1	a	That game can make the time you spend playing it fun and pretty interesting. The game has a fine graphic and good gameplay, the soundtrack is cool. That was a unique experience playing that game, I liked it a lot.
3846	1	a	One of the worst games, I have ever played. It's pretty fun.
3848	1	a	Never have I had so much fun insulting a t-rex's mother while doing my best impersonation of Duke Nukem.  10/10 would shoot dinos again  and again  and again.
3850	1	a	kinda like if halo and turok had a baby and that baby was thrown continusly off a building 10/10
558	0	a	Even for 99 cents, this game is a waste of your money. It's funny at first but the glitches and bad gameplay take their toll on that fun. After playing this for a while I just couldn't take it anymore. Still, it was 99 cents, not the worst waste of money.  EDIT: I will have a new look at this game soon, people have told me that these bugs have been fixed and the game is a lot better now. Until then you can pretty much disregard this review.  EDIT NUMBER TWO: I played the game some more, and honestly not much has changed. My review remains the same.
3852	1	a	For it's price, it's great. Had fun playing with friends.
3854	1	a	+ Environmental visuals were very well presented + Maps are extremely large, and you'll find yourself traversing them on your way to capture objectives + You get to shoot dinosaurs in the face; I really cannot stress enough how ridiculous and awesome this concept is + Weapon selection is not extensive, but the developers did a good job making sure that EVERY weapon is fun to use + Weapons also felt balanced, in that there weren't one or two that seemed to stand out as the best; if you rely on skill in this game, you'll be able to get away with using pistols and a knife and that's it + You can play a game mode that makes you a dinosaur + Very fun and numerous character customization options that further serve to show you this game does not take itself seriously + Vehicles were very fun to use, and had a contorl scheme reminiscient of the Halo franchise + Still frequently updated; you can tell that the developers just adore their own game  - Sound effects for the weapons were disappointing - The maps can be TOO big, turning a trip to capture an objective into a walking simulator - Needs more game modes; it has multiple game modes, currently, but they're all variations of a wave shooter
561	0	a	These developers are frauds.  As much as I hate Activision, these guys are just frauds.
3856	1	a	This game is very unique and one of its kind, in more ways than one. If you read the reviews of others who had been following this game since its beta/early access stages, you'll quickly notice that every one of them says that this game was practically a piece of garbage back then, and any games that get labelled as such will seldom get the opportunity to see the light of day years later.  Enter a group of stubborn developers who refuse to back down and watch their work go down the drain, they salvaged whatever's left from the wreck of the cruiser and built a collosal aircraft carrier out of it. The story basically sums up the history of ORION: Prelude.  With so many shooters involving zombies or aliens these days, this game's theme is very refreshing to say the least. It is a FPS where you get to shoot the long extinct reptile inhabitants of the universe that are dinosaurs. But that doesn't mean you're going to do that with makeshift bows crafted out of wood and stone-headed arrows. No no no no no, far from that. You'll be doing that with state-of-the-art futuristic gadgets and weaponries.  Combine that with cooperative team action and you have yourself a top of the notch game that is teamplay-worthy. The audio is also impressive, sporting above average voice-acting comparable to some high-end games out there. For its price, this game is good. There aren't many other games quite like it.  10 out of 10.  I am aware of the recent, what could I call it, “scandal that Spiral Game and TREK are involved in with the other game that is the spiritual successor of ORION: Prelude. However, I am only 2 things: a customer and a gamer. I purchased this game as a customer, and I play this game as a gamer. I’m not a game designer or a politician. Whether or not the game contains assets from games by other developers, stolen or otherwise unintentionally imitated, does not concern me as long as I get my money’s worth from the product I paid for. Even if the developers did mess up, it is up to the higher ups to settle the dispute. As gamers, you have the right to demand a refund or just boycott the product, but expressing your opinions on the developer’s actions is irrelevant because it is not going to change anything, and if you’re not an attorney who is going to represent either TREK or Activision in court, I’d advise you not to at all because it just makes you highly suspicious of being an employee of a competitor organization attempting to sabotage.  Because let’s face it, having all the negative reviews arise  after  the incident is like having “this game now sucks because of that written all over your review. If that is the case, it is funny how you still support games like   Payday 2 by Overkill, Killing Floor 2 by Tripwire Interactive or Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide by Fatshark,   because those developers are easily at the top of the   ♥♥♥♥   tier list. See, your duty as a reviewer is to determine if the game is good, and if the developer did a good job. If the developer didn’t implement anything that are detrimental to your gameplay, you need not whine about it. In which case I’m fairly certain that implementing assets from some other games does not affect your gameplay at all. I’m not saying I support the idea of stealing assets from other developers, but I’m just a gamer trying to enjoy a game I paid for.
3858	1	a	It does worth playing, is fun. I'm addicted.
3860	1	a	  It is a good game especially for Dino lovers it was the first game I play on PC and I loved it it is just such a good game I hope you also have a good time with it.
562	0	a	Do not buy or touch this game - it is run by filth. See below.  I recently read about all the evil, lying, deceitful shenanigans the company has been up to. A great summary here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4q6xo5/activisions_dmca_claim_on_orion_is_legit_orions/   2 of many of their stunts...  1. People on forums, discussing how the company is lying about various things to get good PR - get threatened with legal action and possible jailtime (nice try).  2. Gives their game to a YouTube channel, with permission to even to give negative feedback, on assumption it would give good PR - doubles back on decision, and issues DCMA takedown request to remove the video.  I believe an accurate description of David Prassel (of Trek Industries, developer of Orion) is that he is the filthy scum found in a gutter that can't be cleaned out.
563	0	a	The game is honestly not THAT terrible, but the developers are absolute scumbags. Don't give them your money.  For those unaware, in a nutshell, they took assets from other games (notably Call of Duty) and when they got taken off Steam because of stealing copyrighted content, they made a big fuss and told everyone big bad activision was unjustly attacking them.  And upon people discovering the claims were not Activision being evil, the developers tried to censor everything they could as the tide turned against them.  ♥♥♥♥ you TREK/Spiral. The Internet isn't your personal attack army.

3862	1	a	In just a little over 3 years, this decade of gaming will be coming to a close. Eventually, when we're all just a bunch of nostalgiac old folks looking back at this era, what are we going to remember most? In a discouraging period of unfinished games and broken promises, which productions will truly stand above the rest, leaving their mark on videogame history? I've been a gamer as long as I can remember. I've been waiting for that 'perfect game', the one that grabs you by the shoulders and doesn't let go until you've experienced every little ounce of detail the developers so masterfully placed within its frame. Today, I'm ecstatic to announce that my wait is over. All the years of sifting through garbage have finally paid off. ORION: Prelude is the game that I'm taking with me to my deathbed. Even at surface level, ORION: Prelude is a beautifully crafted masterpiece. Never before have we encountered such extensive level design that truly leaves the player breathless. The first time I stomped into the world of ORION: Prelude as the bold, massive Spinosaurus, I was nearly brought to tears. ORION: Prelude does not care that this decade still has a few years left. It's fully prepared to present itself in all its prehistoric glory as the best game in recent history. The intricately crafted but comfortable controls, gorgeous level design, and gripping story leave me yearning for nothing more. It's all I've ever wanted in a game.
565	0	a	I gave this game a chance, thinking it couldn't be as bad as people said it was; I was wrong.  Let me put it this way: there are Source mods that have higher production value than this game, and that's not saying much when you consider that those very same Source mods have funding from their own pockets and not some Kickstarter. This game might be running on Unreal, but it looks and feels like a bad Half-Life 2: Deathmatch mod.  Some could say that I can't compare this to AAA games, but I believe it's appropriate to add that I had more fulfillment out of both Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City and Aliens: Colonial Marines than I had with this.  It's worth the $1 they're charging as of this review, but no more than that.
3864	1	a	This is really, really good for a $1 game.   For a $1 game. 
3866	1	a	&gt;I get the game &gt;I join a server, the map is called 'Hell' &gt;It's ok i guess. &gt;Suddenly the map gets smaller &gt;A pumpkin appears out of ♥♥♥♥ing no where &gt;Kills my team &gt;We restart the map &gt;Pumpkin King again &gt;Fight him &gt;Trip &gt;Get on the floor &gt;Everybody walk the dinosaur
3868	1	a	Turn off in game music. Play Jurassic Park theme in background. WIN
3870	1	a	AMAZING. Now,I haven't been here since the beginning of this game but I can tell you one thing . . . it's AWESOME. It's entertaining and fun,I can never seem to leave the computer. ORION: Prelude is the best $1 game I've seen.
3872	1	a	Bought a four pack and gave it to some friends. We're not friends anymore.  10/purple.
3874	1	a	Fun game to do for a while  Their they come wave after wave. Just try to survive its awesome :D
3876	1	a	Today I've played it for a first time with my friends (thanks for the 4pack) and we had much fun with this game. :-) And for sure we're goin to play tomorrow again! 
3878	1	a	Since the original release (which I never played), the game has been completely remade. So the old scores aren't valid.  It's a little rough at the start when you're figuring out how to play it, as there's no tutorial. But it's easy to pick up.  Then you kill a stegosaurus with a bow to the face, mow down a pack of raptors with a supercharged laser beam, and shoot a t-rex in the face with a tank.  Extremely fun, very frantic gameplay.  'Run or shoot. RUN OR SHOOT?' 'BOTH.'
3880	1	a	This game is worth only with friends.
3882	1	a	7 hours for a quarter... beats an arcade any day
3884	1	a	lot of people say this game is crap or weird, but everyone has different opinions, and everyone is entitled to their opinion. This game has more positive features than cons. I'd say that the only real problems with this game are that it's not well-optimized, it's somewhat repetitive, the animations kinda' suck, the graphics aren't impressive, not all the game-modes are good as horde, the dinosaur AI is extremely basic, some of the sounds are basic, and the dinosaurs aren't like their real-life counterparts. I also don't like the new name and logo, they should have just kept 'Orion: Dino Horde.' Looking past that, this is the best dollar I've ever spent. Dinosaurs, Jet-packs, guns, robots, vehicles, LIghtSaber, explosions?. And the soundtrack is freakin' amazing! Overall, I give this a 9/10. (Cheap But Way Better Than you Thinks) 
3886	1	a	One of the only games I know that lets you fight dinosaurs     and I love it :D
3888	1	a	i've bought items in team fortress 2 that were more expensive than this game
3890	1	a	This game is seriously the most fun I have had in a long time, it may not be as polished as some other triple A titles but cmon, Mechwarriors, Vtols, Dinos, etc! This game is like a bizzare yet awesome fusion of Jurrassic Park, Halo, and Killing Floor. Its not at all a serious game but I love that fact about it and playing with other people you are sure to have a good time and laugh at some of the bugs in the game which were never breaking the game or experience but only enhanced it with hilarity! As they come out with more updates the few bugs in it that did kind of bother me will be fixed. If you are looking for a cheap game to play with friends that isnt all serious its WELL worth your time to try this one out!
3892	1	a	Best Cheapo on Steam and a must own!   again. good thing they realized, that F2P was a crappy Idea)  
3894	1	a	Incredibly buggy, yet somehow really fun. Although the game is pretty broken I can't help but have fun killing dinos. Think kind of like Left 4 Dead survival mode, but like 100x dumber.
3896	1	a	I've only spent 99 minutes in this game as of writing this review, and already I have been; Blown up by my teammates. Swallowed whole by three different large dinosaurs. Picked up and smashed on a rock by a pterodactyl. Swarmed and devoured by chickens with scales. Forgotten to buy ammo and then murdered by a horde of everything. Bullrushed by a triceratops. Had the time of my life.  Buy it. Now.
3898	1	a	I ran into a dead T-Rex's body and it moved like it didn't weigh a ♥♥♥♥ ton. Dino/10.
3900	1	a	I recommend this game if you love dinosaurs or things with dinosaurs on them, like blankets, towels, little baggies. Dinosaurs fo'eva.
3902	1	a	Orion: Dino Horde is a big improvement on Orion: Dino Beatdown and is great to play. Many people buy games like this to play with their friends and such, but this game is great with and without friends. There is a diverse range of gamemodes and maps with a large selection of weapons and vehicles. Zoom around in your jetpack or revive your teammates or go incognito and tactically take out some dinosaurs or enemies. Customise your player model with hats and armour types. Who wouldnt want to do that? This game has great visuals and fantastic gameplay. Like seriously? Who doesnt have fun running dinosaurs over in jeeps and taking a t-rex down in a mech suit? Who doesnt love burning little raptors to a crisp? This game overall is fantastic and I highly recommend it.
3904	1	a	Great game for sure. It is worth your money, so you should definitly decide to buy this game. After the update, it is very replayable and there is so many game modes to explore! Do not wait! Concept 8\10 Graphic 8\10 Gameplay 8\10 Replayability 9\10 
3906	1	a	Do you like killing dinosaurs and are on a budget?! Then grab your high powered bow cause its killing time.  A simple arcane like defense came where you gain credits after every round to buy new skills and perks along with weapons depending on your class (and some neutral ones that everyone can buy) to help you survive the increasing hordes of small an large dinosaurs.  Featuring a couple game types, you defend a generator from waves of enemies with vehicles and weapons. They perks allow certain feats to be obtained, like jumping high, being able to heal machines (as a medic) and many many more.  Several different types of dinosaurs are present in this game, like pterodactyls, raptors, t-rex and spinosaurus. Depending on the round and which objective is present, certain dinos will spawn. These large giants are considered the bosses of the game, having very high health pools and insanely high damage.  While the game isn't hard to master, and very easy to understand, I found it got boring playing by yourself or with random people online. I would recommend playing with a friend or two if you can.  Its really cheap when its not on sale and a steal when it is. Give it a try, you will get atleast a couple hours out of it at the very least. 
3908	1	a	This game is so ♥♥♥♥, good and fun at the same time. Totally worth it.
575	0	a	Stolen Content, Bad Company that will sue you to cell if you say something bad about them
3910	1	a	Though lacking in polish, it's a  fun  game,  for $1 or $4  you can have a fun afternoon playing around with your friends for  free .   The  UI  is pretty bad as is the quality of many of the interactables and markers, but it's functional.  Some of the modes like the (Player)Dinos VS Marines(Player) require lots of players since they can't be played with bots.  The netcode could use some work, PVP between 2 computers in the same network was pretty laggy, so LAN play would be a nice addition.  It's a pretty basic game and on the lowest settings practically any PC can run it.   Overall, I'd recommend it if you are looking for some  fun  co-op if you know you can get past the game's lack of polish, and no there's no barrier to entry.
3912	1	a	Every time this game was on sale, the low metacritic score made me keep my distance. I was still skeptical when the developers offered it at 90% off, but it's hard to not try something for a dollar. And that was a good decision. Burnt out on Killing Floor? Give Dino Horde a shot. There's lots of different game modes, plenty of weapons and augmentations, a few vehicles, three classes of characters with different abilities, 50 levels of character unlocks, several levels of difficulty, and even Borderlands style second wind. I've had an enormous amount of fun so far with this game. Ignore the useless metacritic score and check it out--a welcome addition to the coop club.
3914	1	a	This game cost me £0.39. Its the best £0.39, I have ever spent. Simple game. You get cars, you buy guns, you defend points and shoot dinos. What more could you want?  10/10 would buy again
577	0	a	This game is a scam. The publisher didn't pay the developers and they are using assets they stole from Black Ops 3. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!
3916	1	a	It's fun.
3918	1	a	This game has a lot of bad press about it, and it doesn't deserve it as much as it did in the past. Things have gotten a lot better since ORION: Dino Beatdown, and even from the original release of ORION: Dino Horde (which people got for free if they already had O:DB, so check if you already have it from the previous name), and the amount of fun you have with the game is linked to your disposition to it.   If you go in thinking it's going to be a terrible game, you're not going to have fun with it. If you think it could be good, then you'll probably give it more of a chance. There's been a lot of updates and additions that probably fixed something you didn't like about it before. (I'm looking at you, TotalBiscuit, and everyone that follows him blindly about his first impressions.)  With that said, this can be a lot of fun with friends, playing by yourself is okay, but it really shines with more people. If you get on Skype/TeamSpeak with some pals (because who uses in-game voice chats anymore, really?), you can coordinate and assist each other in your fight against waves of dinosaurs who apparently find the noise/smell of your energy generators really annoying/tasty. I've found it to be an enjoyable alternative to Killing Floor or especially any of the modes in the CoD games (save for MW1 or BO2).  Sure, it's had a past behind it, and there's some concepts borrowed from other games, but if you wait for a sale (namely right now, it's free to play for the week of Feb 20-27, and you can have it forever if you pay a single dollar), then maybe you can justify the purchase. Personally, I don't think that it's worth it at full price, but once it goes under 50% discount, that should ease the hesitation. Now go ahead and try it on a sale (maybe get a 4-pack to share), bring some friends along, don't be a filthy public match joiner.
580	0	a	This game is simply bad. Based on a weak engine (Unreal 3 - outdated, doesnt support ms antialiasing just the terrible fxaa etc.) Awful animations, boring gamemodes and maps... Dont believe to those who tell you dont believe to metascore.  If you want to try out an interesting multiplayer fps with asymmetric teams I can recommend Natural Selection 2. That is a well made game. This is not.  Oh and I mostly forgot to mention the ingame shop where you have to buy extra skins, equipment and animations for real money - but fortunately that wont be a big temptation.
3920	1	a	 Great value for money
3922	1	a	Orion: Prelude A dinosaur survival/TDM/CTF/etc game that has you shooting dinosaurs wave after wave, upgrading your character and buying yourself better weapons. This game is incredibly fun and never gets old, I have been playing this game for quite some time now, and now that I persuaded my friends to buy the game, I play even more. I strongly recommend you buy this game if you have not already.
3924	1	a	I love Orion Dino Horde. Don't listen to lowell he doesn't know ♥♥♥♥.
581	0	a	Every time this game gets too many bad steam reviews, the developers re-release it under a different name. I think this is like, the 3rd or 4th time?
3926	1	a	I got to say it's a lot better than I expected.  However, play it with friends, alone it isn't quite that fun :/
3928	1	a	Yes, it is worth $.99, almost all games are.
3930	1	a	It is halo and dinosaurs. I repeat: halo and dinosaurs. Why would you want to be killing stupid zombies when you could be killing all of your favorite prehistoric beasts? Don't think about it. It's true, it's good, and it gets better everyday. Have you ever killed a t-rex with a bow? No? Then get the game. I recommend.
3932	1	a	Shooting T-Rex and driving crazy cars for 0,79€
3934	1	a	I know that the first version of Dino Horde didn't get very good reviews, and many people pass this game up because of that. The game has had a revival since then, and has gotten much better as a game. Having not actually played the earlier version, I personally find it hard to believe that a game so creative and well made could ever deserve the terrible metascore and overall hate that Dino Horde has recieved. This really is a great game, it probably won't be on a top five FPS list any time soon, but for people that love science fiction shooter games with simple objectives and a gun purchase system like in CS:GO, then this is the game for you. It also has dinosaurs in it, so that's a plus.  Edit: This review is for dino horde. Prelude is a terrible game; the creators messed up big time.
3936	1	a	This is a real interesting game, and I don't understand why people give such awful reviews about it. It has a fun twist with survival, and should recieve more fans.
3938	1	a	Well..   its a good game just need more server and people to play this game
3940	1	a	The port is kinda poor for low end rigs even 6 years later ahaha, but honestly, one of my favorite games, grab a couple buddies and hop on and youll have a blast!
3942	1	a	  You can't go wrong with that tag.
3944	1	a	One of my friends let me drive a mech onto the back of a jet, then we went around and murdered a ton of T-rex's. Then I got hit with a rock and fell 75 feet to the ground. Got out of the mech, and started flying around in a jetpack with a minigun and a rocket launcher.  Play this game, its only a 1.00$
582	0	a	This game give you some amount of ♥♥♥♥ in ur ♥♥♥ cuz you eat large D while shootin dinos. BAd game Like 3/11teen
3946	1	a	Kiwi spent 2 hours punching a grand total of 2136 dinosaurs.
3948	1	a	THIS IS THE SEQUEL TO BAD RATS, ITS CALLED: BAD DINOZ. ITS A REALLY COOL GAME THAT KICKS A LOT OF BUTT AND IS CRAZY WACKY GOOFY FUN FOR ALL THOSE NUTTY DINO ENTHUSIASTS ACROSS ALL OF PANGEA AND BEYOND!
3950	1	a	I thoroughly enjoyed this.    11/10 Have never played would review again.
3952	1	a	Greatest game ever.
3954	1	a	If u liek Primal Carnage, or at least shooting dinos, ur probably gunna liek this
3956	1	a	I like this game because you can try out wepones and meet new friends
3958	1	a	Awesome game , really it is well done guys
3960	1	a	The game is a s#!t show. But a glorious, messy gooey dino s#!t show, a s#!t show that for a price of one dollar will give you a jetpack and rocket launcher, mechas, warplanes, massive maps and ptaradctyls. That is quite a lot for a s#!t show. Would you like to come to the s#!t show? I think you should. Now excuse me, as I go kill a triceratops.
3962	1	a	Got in tank to shoot T-rex, T-rex flipped and blew up my tank 10/10
3964	1	a	This is a really good game. You kill dinosawrs and they die. Worth buying. 11/10 Would play again. - Warning! - (Needs real friends to play with for this to be really fun)  By the time I'm writing this it costs only 0,79€ ... I bought it for 10€ or some ♥♥♥♥ like that. So this game is REALLY worth 0,79€. Recommended. Play dis nao.
3966	1	a	Truth be told, I am not a big fan of the 'standard' multiplayer. But the open world missions are entierly different. You must protect your base, explore and fight off hordes of dinos. The most fun I've had since Minecraft alpha.
3968	1	a	good game for the price of a biscuit from popeyes  biscuit/10
3970	1	a	Ignore the Metacritic reviews, this game is a lot of fun. Survival game mode with friends is very fun and challenging. Gain money to buy new weapons an perks, choose a class, level up. A+ game.
3972	1	a	So everyone on the web apparently dislikes this game a lot. I don't see it.  Dino Horde is a delightfully fun Horde shooter with various modes including pvp that pits friends up against waves of dinosaurs. Similar to Dino-D-Day, there is pvp modes where one team are the dinos, and the other are humans. It's pretty fun and works about as much as dino d day does.  The survival mode is where the game shines. You fight increasingly hard waves of dinos as you try to defend yourselves and various generators around the map. The maps are huge and the graphics are really nice to the eye.  Right off the bat, the HUD looks like it was straight from Halo. The gameplay is a mix of Borderlands, Left 4 Dead, Serious Sam, and even TF2. When you go down, you have to either revive your teammate, or kill a dino to get back up, similar to Borderlands. The game is highly customizable, and is insanely fun.  The Metacritic score can go ♥♥♥♥ itself. This game is great.
3974	1	a	Dino horde brings back my childhood dreams of paleontology. Rather than digging them up, you put them in the ground. An absolute blast.
3976	1	a	After many game updates from the old title ORION: DinoHunt, they gave the game a new title called ORION: Prelude.  The game is a lot of fun since they fixed it and I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who is casual on the FPS genre. Although a bit taxing on old computer hardware, it's really cheap and feels like a cross between Unreal Tournament and Jurassic Park.  With many game modes to choose from, how the dinosaur action is played is up to you and able to play with other people as well. Go nuts!
3978	1	a	it is a nice game, i hope they add more into it and best 1$ i ever spent, i recomend that everybody buy this game!
3980	1	a	The game is pretty fun, I would classify this game to be that type where u mess around and stuff. Unless you want to take it serously and go on the HARDCORE mode. Mostly all the 'bad' reviews are all the players that paid for the game and when it became free to play, players raged. Pretty good game. I would rate it 7/10
3982	1	a	it is a nice game, i hope they add more into it and best 1$ i ever spent, i recomend that everybody buy this game!
3984	1	a	this game is about jeff goldblum in space
3986	1	a	There was a dinosaur I got a laser rifle There was no more dinosaur  10/10 - Would murder dinosaur again
586	0	a	Badly done, boring and low quality
3988	1	a	OK i played in short time but I really recommend this game for all people who like killing each other or killing dinosaur.Overall,graphic are really damn nice and perfomance of this game is work well for me (I got steady 40-50 fps) which is good sign.Also its just 1 dollar guy,so come buy and support the developer~!!  Will look foward of what Spiral can do next...Goodluck
3990	1	a	Bought for $0.99....should of bought a 7/11 taquito to enjoy the inferno ♥♥♥♥ cleaning.
3992	1	a	WORTH BUYING!! 10/10  Highly recommend this game, I simple love playing it! - Reminds me of playing UT - Reminds me of playing Halo  - Reminds me of playing Killing Floor. - But most importantly it reminds me of playing Turok back in the days on the N64 &lt;3  This game is very underrated, metascore 90/100, easy..   Way better then the high priced games in my list, so why are you still reading instead of buying? HURRY UP AND BUY!
3994	1	a	Steam just downloaded an update for this game, which reminded me of it. Funny, I thought I reviewed this game before. Nevermind.   The first big problem with this game was that people expected too much from it, even when it was selling for $0.99 (or €0.99, or £0.99, whatever...). It looks tired, outdated and it's got glitches left, right and center, but for that kind of money, who cares? It's a nice, casual little dino shooter to play either solo or coop with friends and/or foes, that's all. And honestly, Orion is way better than most of the indie crap which is sold on Steam for way more than that, also not to mention that the devs are still updating it, surprisingly...  Up until when I last played (a year ago or so), the second biggest problem was the lack of players (and servers, as a consequence). Because most people who bought it wouldn't take it seriously -- and I'm not sure if even the devs took their own product seriously, first selling it for that price, now giving it away for free --, it was always the same little community playing and a few newcomers in between. Hopefully now that it's gone F2P, things will change, and if so, I may be back playing it.  Well, it's free now, so no excuse for anyone not to try it at least...
3996	1	a	I had no idea what to expect going into this game. Had it gifted from a friend since IT'S $0.99 RIGHT NOW!!! Turned out to be a riot. You could take it seriously if you wanted to, but it's more fun to treat it like halo with dinosaurs in it. I mean, come on. I can't think of a reason not to buy this game, especially for a buck.
587	0	a	Even though I bought for discount nowadays I feel like an idiot for still having about 4 copies in my inventory that was supposed to gift for friends to play with, but felt embarrassed of doing so because the game was so unfinished. And the other issues with the company itself won't help its popularity. Still kinda fun to play if you take in consideration that it is buggyish.
588	0	a	It's just a bad game tbh.
3998	1	a	This game is unoriginal in the sense of the weapons, vehicles, gameplay, and layout. But don't think i disliked the game, it is phenominal. The action and co op make the game perfect for multipalyer. At the heart of it, this game is plain fun to play.
589	0	a	really ♥♥♥♥ game but worth the 99c price tag
4000	1	a	Great fun Game to play with your friends
590	0	a	With 160++ hours on this game over the course of almost 1 years seeing this game in steam. Good game with high potential, sadly the devs take this game lightly.   the game stopped developed after the 1$ promotion and later the F2P status. and lead to other kind of problems.  I tell you with my honest point of view  - no or too little guide for newcomers (in-game help) - bugs, frequent crashing problems and poorly optimized game mechanic. - time consuming steam achievements. - lags or high ping problems (if unlucky, mostly unlucky) - inactive community in forum  - repetitive and easily get bored. nothing much to explore. - unforgiving for newcomers, you need to level up to get advantages on your characters. - too much game mode with each of them have under the mediocre optimization. (too little players play the game) - servers mostly empty. rarely seeing others game mode in play. - very bad radar display - glitched map. - bad optimization on rampage mode especially for dino part.  the good things are:  + a lot of species of dino. flying one, small one compy, big one t-rex raptor, etc + has fps style mixed with survival elements againts dino. + vehicles. a lot of vehicles + 3 classes to be played. + it went F2P, so no harm if you regret playing this game.  conclusion - no harm to try this game. sorry to say, due to its state i cannot recommend this game to you until the devs perform any responsible action to fix the current issues.
4002	1	a	I really love this game. The graphics, atmosphere, weapons, tactics, co-op, multiplayer, dinosaurs, and every other things are really awesome. This game reminds of Crysis sometime and other games too because this game is almost like it, halo, KF and others but having dinosaurs! You cannot only kill dinosaurs, you can also become a dinosaurs (rampage mode) which makes this game great fun to play with your friend. I started off with the DM mode which was quite good and after that I was basically playing survival mode with my friends, it was fun chasing the small dinosaurs, flying dinos, huge dinos, and others. I really recommend this game - the developers put alot of effort into this game. Really this game is not really worth $0.99, I should've spend more money on this!
591	0	a	Absolutely terrible, do not waste any money on this whatsoever. Complete trash.
592	0	a	Just don't buy this game.  Why? Not because of the CoD weapon copy situation that is happening. But because this game is just boring. The enemies run straight up to you and do the attack move thing, and this game doesn't add anything new that makes me enjoy this game.  I've played it once, and the next day the game just doesn't want to start up. What the ♥♥♥♥...   I wish I didn't buy this game.
593	0	a	Unfortunately shady devs.
594	0	a	Ooo he stealin'!
4004	1	a	Pros  Great graphics and high framerate addicting multiplayer, singleplayer and lets not forget co-op You get to kill Dinosaurs WHO DOESN'T WANT TO DO THAT? Nice players Awesome vehicles Awesome Guns Smart bot AI  Cons Not many servers vehicles lag if the server is to far away and you have high ping  Raptors will kill you to fast if you dont melee them like instantly because they swarm you you have to pay for skins there are no loot boxes for the skins (I totally didn't buy one because im addicted)  Overall Ratings Score in Graphics 7.9/10 Score in Framerate 8.0/10 Score in AI 8.9/10 Overall Score is 8.7! (avarage for me being 7-8) Do I love this game and will I keep playing it? yes and yes! At the time of posting this review this is my favourite game and I bought this for my friend to play with me I love it so much!
4006	1	a	Can't...Stop...Playing... Vehicles with weapons, plenty of guns, different play styles, and teamwork! Dino Horde gets a 9.5/10 because, unlike other dev teams, here development and new content never ceases. The community of players are great and you quickly meet veterans ready to help you out, share credits, and help you level. Not to mention there are a variety of game modes, the most exciting (for me) being survival mode, where increasingly large waves of dinosaurs arrive in game to munch on you. On harder game levels the battles are so intense you find yourself narrowly escaping with your life by killing a t-rex just before he chomps down on you, or getting ground stomped by a stegosaur that sends your vehicle flying through the air...but it is okay because you got a jet-pack!  
4008	1	a	What you pay is what you get bro. A $0.99 game and expecting to be a great game? nono. But it's lots of fun playing with friends. Rating 5/10
4010	1	a	Wow I'm suprized this game kick's A$$ 2 friends and I played co-op and it's really addictve All diff kinds of vehicles like bf4 and hordes of dinosaurs almost like left for dead but dinosaurs and A lil like sanctum 2 with the tower deffense of protecting the generators.Great amount of cool futuristic guns and jet packs if u want. What more can u ask for $0.99 I Love It
4012	1	a	This game is like a combination of Starwars, Unreal Tournament, and Jurrasic park, by far 3 very popular things together couldnt turn out better than ORION. The dinosaurs will actually use pack strategy on you, and instead of being high and mighty in vehicles, larger dinos can put you in your place quite easily. By far an epic game experience thats never the same twice.
596	0	a	You know its bad when they use Steam reviews in there trailers
4014	1	a	Pew pew pew pew You get to kill dinosaurs What more do you want  11/10 will pew
4016	1	a	YOU ARE NOT IL-2 BOS.  CONGRATULATIONS ON SAVING YOUR 0,50 EU
600	0	a	I never enjoyed this game anyways because it always seemed choppy and unfinished. Now that there's controversy about the dev stealing assets (and trying to blame Activision for stealing THEIR assets) it just adds fuel to the fire. Bad game and bad devs.
4018	1	a	 &gt;&gt;_Summer-Rain_ has joined the game &gt;&gt;C0LDH4RT has joined the game &gt;&gt;R4V3Z3R0 has joined the game &gt;&gt;NOVA-FALL has joined the game   So here you are again. Except this time, you're with your friends,  Ravemeister  and his brother  The Fatman , in a game looking very Halo-esque. Everyone spawns in a bunker with serviceable graphics, before all of you run to yet another bunker, buying your weapons.   'Come on, let's go!'  Ravemeister yells, stepping out before suddenly getting mauled by Velociraptors.  'RUN!'  You scream, as Compsognathus and a huge, gigantic Stegosaurus lumbers toward the base, spawning Compsognathus.   ORION: PRELUDE.   Panicking, The Fatman fires wildly at Velociraptors and Compsognathus, cutting a bloody swath in their ranks  as Summer-Rain concentrates her fire on the Stegosaurus. You clamber about on a vehicle and spin the mounted gun towards the large boss dinosaur, logic and biology be damned. The mounted cannon spins up and empties a volley of lead into the Stegosaurus, sending it to Reptile Heaven.  The announcer yells that the wave is defeated, and now a cooldown period is in effect to stock up on weapons, ammo and upgrades. You attempt to buy something with real world money, but the button in-game seems broken, and you shrug it off. Summer-Rain then checks up on you, her wizard hat the color of purple with yellow stars, bought from a time before you were with her.   'You ok? How's the game turning out for you?'  Summer-Rain asks, checking on her scoped rifle.  'It's cool I guess.'  you begin, before Velociraptors saunter into view from the horizon and a T-Rex lumbers towards all of you, spawning (you guessed it) Compsognathus again.   'We got trouble! AIYAIYAIYAIYAIAYAI!'  Ravemeister shrieks, wearing an astronaut's helmet on top of his space ranger suit which looks like a sleeker version of Master Chief's SPARTAN armor, while firing away with his rifle. You shake your head with a smile as Summer-Rain and The Fatman cover you. The T-Rex goes down when The Fatman and Summer-Rain commandeer a vehicle and use the mounted cannon, proving once more that anything that is mounted and spits lead at a rate of 600 rounds per minute is more than enough to send any dinosaur to Reptile Heaven.   'That was good...!'  The Fatman sings, his armored, anti-bomb-like form shuddering as he exits the Warthog- lookalike.  'Yeah! This game isn't so boring now with you guys, and in a  far better shape than it was in as compared to when it was first  released!'  Summer-Rain sighs, exiting the mounted weapon from the Warthog-lookalike's rear. Ravemeister fist-bumps you while buying ammo and a health upgrade when suddenly, the player prompt flashes across all your displays.   &gt;&gt;HOODED ANGST has joined the game &gt;&gt;KILLER'S CONSCIENCE has joined the game &gt;&gt;SHADOW OF DOUBT has joined the game &gt;&gt;MR. HOLLYWOOD has joined the game &gt;&gt;RA'S AL GOON has joined the game &gt;&gt;MRS. NOVOCAINE has joined the game    'Oh boyyy...'  Ravemeister anticipates.  'Oh damn...'  The Fatman shivers.  'Oh no...'  you breathe.  'Oh great.'  Summer-Rain rolls her eyes.   'STARBOY COLDHEART!'  All of them shout, seemingly in unison. Ravemeister locks and loads his weapon, while The Fatman hops into a randomly-spawned VTOL. Summer-Rain leaps behind the Warthog-lookalike's mounted gatling gun and gives you a curt nod which means  'everything will be ok, baby.'  You hold your rifle as much as you can attempt to be confident.   '...you got married...'  you state in an almost deadpan manner, your chest tight at the sight of the former Ms. Novocaine, along with the person  whom you thought was your good friend, the low-IQ  Ra's Al Goon . In between them is the devious villain  Mr. Hollywood , an inane director out for the blood of innocents.  'Yes, Starboy! Your girlfriend is now my wife!'  Mr. Hollywood gloats, as your previous 'friend' Ra's Al Goon hunches over and tries to fire at you like the deformed arab that he is.  Dodging, Summer-Rain fires the gatling cannon into the air as a warning shot.  'We're supposed to be on the same side if none of us spawn as dinosaurs!'  She says with annoyance, shooting dirty looks at Ms. Novocaine. As if she knew what Summer-Rain was thinking, she fires at Summer-Rain's shoulder, making her shout in pain and fall from the warthog lookalike's platform.   'SUMMER!'  you shout, rushing to her side. Ms. Novocaine squints her eyes evilly as the countdown timer ends and dinosaurs return, spawning.   'It's  'Mrs.'  Novocaine now, dear.'  Mrs. Novocaine sneers, before the dinosaurs approach and the battle becomes an intense free-for-all.  '...and Starboy?'  You glare at Mrs. Novocaine amid the chaos and draw your rifle on your ex-girlfriend, her head dead center in your sights.  'You were never good enough.'  Mrs. Novocaine sneers again.   'DAMN YOU!'  You fire, but a running Velociraptor gets hit between you and Mrs. Novocaine before the dust kicks up and dinosaurs and blaster fire rain about everywhere around the both of you.  'Summer?! Hang on, ok?!'  You motion for her again, and she clasps at your arm desperately. You see that Mrs. Novocaine's shot cut clean through Summer-Rain's shoulder and neck, tears in her eyes as she bleeds profusely.   'H-help... help, Starboy-'  She collapses, and you quickly dispatch a Velociraptor closing in on the both of you, with the Spinosaurus of this wave charging to your location.  'RAVE! SUMMER'S HURT!'  You bundle Summer-Rain close to you and run to the game's exit.  'I'll cover you, Coldheart! The Fatman, get over here bro! Starboy must get back to his room with Summer if it's the last thing we do!'   As you enter your home from the heavy rain pouring outside, Summer-Rain in  your arms, you lay her on the couch in the living room and stay by her side. You've applied a makeshift tourniquet with your hoodie as the immersion from the game you've been playing together with everyone vanishes, and her wound is somewhat stable. The blood soaks to the couch and the floor, but all you can think of doing is whispering sweet words and telling her that you are here, that  you attended to her wound as much as you can, and honored her wishes for no call to the hospital.   'Let... let me die. Please Starboy. Let m-me die.'  Summer-Rain whispers to you through ragged breaths.  'No!'  You exclaim.  'Never! Summer, I love you!'  You hold her hand gingerly, and she returns your grasp tightly.  'I know. That's... that's the problem, isn't it.'  Summer-Rain mutters, her breathing heavy.  'What do you mean? If it's about killing the dinosaurs in Prelude, you did a great job with all of us-'    'No Starboy.'  Summer-Rain heaves a heavy sigh.  'She's right you know.'  Your eyes go wide as Summer-Rain talks to you.  'I'm not good enough, not for myself and certainly not for you.'  She looks at you through tired eyes.  'I love you so much, Starboy Coldheart.'  she whispers.  'Don't ever think that you weren't good enough for me, because that's what I was all this time for you. I love you Starboy Coldheart. Don't you ever forget that.'  Summer-Rain closes her eyes.  'Summer?'  you whisper.   'SUMMER!'  You shout. Summer-Rain scrunches her face in annoyance.  'Starboy, I wanna rest.'  she responds.   ORION: PRELUDE.   
4020	1	a	oh my god, this game is exactly what i wanted. at so many points i felt like the biggest badass ever. much love to the devs
4022	1	a	♥♥♥♥ YES, THIS GAME IS AWESOME (Must play with friends that know how to have fun though.)
4024	1	a	oh buddy, you know whats up
4026	1	a	this game has fun, intuitive controls and the people are great! I love Orion:DinoHorde to my hearts content. I wish i could play all day :)
4028	1	a	this game is so ♥♥♥♥♥ shit i cry whever i play this embarassing display of a first person shiiter honestly this game is a lie 2 say it is entertainment becaus ther is like 1 game mode and its the sam thing over and over again so it gets supr ♥♥♥♥♥ boring rely fast and there are like 2 guns that actually dont suk in the game and the scooter is op as ♥♥♥♥ but the devs suk so they dont patch this ♥♥♥♥ the graffics lack compared to iother leading fps es like batelfeld and cal of duty probs because this game was made by 1 doude in an underground bunkr in nigeria in 3 days 1/10 would ihghely not recomaend d not buy this game
4030	1	a	First game, survived a few rounds, bought the 'worse' guns and got eaten by a T-Rex. 10/10
4032	1	a	Sound like a good game despite of the note in many site, it is a real pleasure to play with friends! Alone it is a harder but you cannot dispatch the defense position but it stays completly playable.  However I regret a training mode, with many health (maybe god mode) and so on to discover the ability of weapon and so on... I see somewhere on the forum that developers are creating admin command then try do not forget 'funny' command (or cheaty command as you wish :p)  
4034	1	a	I paid $1.09 for this game not knowing what it was all about but the screenshots looked pleasing, it's very easy to learn how to play. I find this game really fun, so simple, yet very good.
4036	1	a	Worth It
4038	1	a	Killing dinosaurs in a futuristic environment sounds fun... and it is. Especially if you play it with some friends. Grab your guns, upgrade yourself with some augments and kick some a$$. Leveling up gives you some bonuses.  You can choose between three different classes (Assault, Support, Recon) which only vary slightly. What makes every player different is how they customize their augments. This is by no means a bad thing. You are not stuck to a special weapon set depending on your class. You want to be a jetpacking shotgun maniac or a sniping medic? No problem. It's all up to you.I have to admit the weapon balance isn't that great. There is no effective automatic gun. To do good damage you have to pick either a shotgun or sniper rifle.  The maps are huge and it can take a few minutes to arrive on the other side without a vehicle. That's great but therefore they havent many maps available. For each map there is a day and a night variation but this makes nearly no difference to the actual gameplay. Map objectives seem to appear on random locations every time so it's at least not exactly the same experience every time.  Vehicles variety is awesome. There aren't many different vehicles available but they are all different from each other. Steering a minigun welding mech or fly around in a harrier... It's fun. Navigating left or right by using the mouse is something you have to get used to. Other controls are easy to go.  So the overall gameplay is pretty solid but at some points it's a little bit glitchy when it comes to player positioning. In some cases you can get stuck in walls and the hitboxes of the tiny dinosaurs are a little bit weird.  What drives me mad somehow is the 'Spiral Store' where you can buy Hats and colors for real money. This would be perfectly O.K. for me in a free to play game but not in a full priced game. It doesn't affect gameplay but getting them as rewards for achievements would be way more appreciated. It can get boring after a while since it's the same again and again. It offers some different gamemodes but in the end it is PvP or survival... Since player positioning sucks it's only surivival for me. This is why I would recommend to get this game only if you have some friends to play this game together in Co-Op since this makes it a lot more enjoyable.  This is my opinion about the game and may differ from yours...   TL;DR  Personal rating: 6 Fair | out of 10  The good: + Alot of different perks/augments + Vehicles + Huge maps + Plenty of gamemodes + Simple controls  The bad: - Weapon balance - Glitchy hitboxes - Low amount of maps - Fancy hats from the trailer only for real money - Gets boring if you play it alone
4040	1	a	-Opened Game -Joined Match -Immediately Killed by T-Rex -Immediately Love game. In all seriousness though, I absolutely LOVE this game. It's got the gameplay mechanics of Advanced Warfare, the charm and uniqueness of an indie game (despite not being one.) and the amazing graphics of Half Life. It's an amazing game, and it's only $1!
4042	1	a	I realize this game has gotten a bad reputation from it's alpha stages, and people don't like how they changed the name to avoid ridicule. But WOW! It's improved a TON! I don't see why anyone could complain about such a well done FPS Dinosaur game- Freaking Dinosaurs man!!!! I love the game mechanics, and the multiplayer is surprisingly solid. By far the best game I've played seen on steam. So many weapons, vehicles, upgrades, perks and maps make this game a HUGE online experience that everyone should have the opportunity to play. Almost flawless, and still coming out with updates, I think Spiral developers are some of the greatest developers out there! Keep doing what you're doing guys!
4044	1	a	It has its problems, but is lots of fun. lol
4046	1	a	If you like goudging out your own eyeballs and setting them on fire while partying with knifed in your feet you will LOVE THIS GAME.
4048	1	a	this game is very fun if play you with your friend
4050	1	a	Well. it's definitely your money's worth. Otherwise ugly and broken but mildly entertaining, and not (as) terrible (as you'd expect) for $1.
4052	1	a	Experience true combat gameplay in a massive military sandbox. Deploying a wide variety of single- and multiplayer content, over 20 vehicles and 40 weapons, and limitless opportunities for content creation, this is the PC’s premier military game. Authentic, diverse, open - ORION : Prelude sends you to war.
4054	1	a	Top notch banter, with added dinosaurs. Hours of entertainment, though is better with friends. gr8 m8 8/8.
4056	1	a	Had tons of fun playing this game! 10/10
4058	1	a	It's fun, game has some depth and progression...all for $0.50!
4060	1	a	Cool game there bro, needs more d... Oh wait.  10dinos/10mothatruckindinos  P.S. This game needs to be renamed Halo: Dino Edition (screw the rights to the name Halo the truth must be known) 
4062	1	a	There are a lot of reasons to play this game, but none more important than being able to answer the question of why the dinosaurs went extinct with 'because of me'.
4064	1	a	Jet packs and Dinosaurs. What else do you need?
4066	1	a	This game is pretty good for the price you have to pay, it is basically COD:ZOMBIES but with dinosaurs on a huge map. You can have Lightsabers, Bow and Arrows, Hoverbikes and much more. I R8 this game 8/10  'Game of the Year'-Orion: Prelude Developer 'Why Dinosaurs'-My Mom 'I have a dream'-Martin Luther King jr 'potato'-me
4068	1	a	Dino's / Halo Like Weapons and vehicle's / LOTS OF GAMEMODES / CO-OP / hillarious  What do you want more? better graphics? go play another game~!  i say 11/10! #ToFabForYou
4070	1	a	This game has come a long way since it was initially released upon the public and made quite an impact for being a terrible game. At the time of it's release this game was clearly a half-♥♥♥♥♥ and unfinished game with uncountable amounts of bugs, only 2 or 3 maps and about 3 types of dinosaurs. This is all the past now, and though this may not be a perfect game it is a fun arcade style shooter to play with your friends.  The game now sports about a dozen different game modes and maps, a nice selection of weapons and powerups, a working progression system with 3 class types, over 200 Steam achievements and most bugs have been fixed. If you have a couple of friends with you and you just want to mess around and have a fun time on a game with a silly premise and don't mind mediocre graphics and audio then this is absolutely for you, if on the otherhand you like to play a serious survival game then this might not be for you.  This game as I mentioned is no where near perfect, the graphics are pretty mediocre as are the visual effects. The audio quality is quite good especially with the Dinosaur sound effects like the T-Rex's roar (you might want ear defenders for that), the voice acting however isn't the best but that's to be somewhat expected of this type of game. The game runs very smoothly for the most part with a couple of graphical artifacts here and there but nothing I've found gamebreaking yet, and there are lag spikes when waves end on survival. Taking a little step away from the technical problems of this game and looking into the gameplay though is where this game is great, it's perfectly fun to play for an hour or two every now and then prefferably with friends and just have a blast shooting dinosaurs with handcannons, shotguns, gatling guns, sniper rifles, lasers, flamethrowers, rocket launchers and so much more. It's great fun to try taking some risk with your friends and making bets like who can ride the T-rex without getting eaten or who can kill the spinosaurus with a knife and whatever else you can think of doing at the time. Theres plenty of objectives to keep you occupied in game and well paced time intervals between rounds and the large dinosaurs each have their own unique traits.  Overall I'd give this game a solid 7/10 for being a great improvement on it's initial release and a stupid but fun arcade style shooter. I mean it's got jetpacks, dinosaurs and tanks! What more could you possibly ask for?
4072	1	a	This is the greatest game I have ever played. I just love going around not being able to see anything except for the inside of my dinosaurs body. The graphical technology seems to have been developed in 2005 however this only makes sense as since the game is set in the prehistoric era. All in all, I can not see a reason why someone wouldn't immediately purchase this phenomenal title.
4074	1	a	i like this updated verion
4076	1	a	Many Good. Buy for monies.
4078	1	a	Decent game if you can overlook its flaws.
4080	1	a	If you want to Kill Waves of Dinos just Buy this game and you can be a dino. i give it 1/1
4082	1	a	Pretty good solid game, however having to traverse for minutes at a time from spawn point to where you're needed can be a hassle.
4084	1	a	bugs and glitches galore but it has promise. its basically what halo combat evolved was supposed to be and doesn't hide the fact it pretty much ripped it off. but in a good way, hopefully it'll get better over time
4086	1	a	This game promises shooting dinos with guns and vehicles. It delivers. It's a wonderful game for just booting up and killing some time, and it's generally pretty easy to find an open match. I'd say it's a bit like Killing floor, but with dinosaurs and the occasional jet pack. Grab it while it's on sale, or wait for it to be a free weekend, though, because I can't in good conscience say it's worth $15.
4088	1	a	this game like jurrasic park and mister chef is there and killing dinos because the covenant did some ♥♥♥♥ so he needs kill them all in all 8/10
4090	1	a	AMAZING GAME!  KILLED A T-REX BY HEADSHOT WITH A ROCKET LAUNCHER, BLEW UP 17 RAPTORS WITH A GRENADE, 360 NO SCOPE A DILOPHOSAURUS DOWN THE THROAT WITH A SNIPER RIFLE AND PUNCHED A PTERDACTYL IN THE FACE IN LESS THEN 5 SECONDS WHILE USING JETPACK WHILE IN SLOW MOTION!!!!!   420/69 IGN
4092	1	a	Great fun. I love skyping with friends and playing a few hours of this game. But, to us? It will always be Dino-Horde! 
4094	1	a	i love this game :D
4096	1	a	I loved this game even before it got good.
4098	1	a	8/10 would play again
4100	1	a	Games crashes when I connect to servers. I didn't get to play. Not buying sorry :l
4102	1	a	This is a game. You can play this game. I like playing games. Do you like playing games? I do like playing games! I wanna build a snowman now and stuff a dinosaur's kidney inside it! Yay!
4104	1	a	I would strongly recommend this game, it is a mix of Halo and Boderlands. If you like any of those I would spend the 1$ and get the game!
4106	1	a	IT GIVE'S ME SO MUCH PLEASURE! 
4108	1	a	Im really happy to see this game in its current state...It used to suck, now its a Fun game!
4110	1	a	if you bought this game before last month and thought it was ♥♥♥♥, you're right. play it again and it just gets better every match
4112	1	a	Add this to MAC!
4114	1	a	SOOOOO BAD ITS GOOD  Like super fun. for 1$ on the 4 pack you cant go wrong.
4116	1	a	Its Halo if the main objective was to survive/eliminate The Flood. More or less.  Only fun when you play multiplayer, so be sure you have friends willing to try it and get the 4-pack!  
4118	1	a	If you hate dinosaurs, then this is your golden opportunity.  Jokes aside, it's no doubt worth the money. It provides exciting and sometimes terrifying (spinosaurus, deinosuchus, t-rex) combat against various kinds of dinosaurs. You get to use many types of weapons and other tools of destruction such as VTOLs and tanks.   Pros: - Surprising amounts of depth and customization via classes, their weapons and augments that let you play the way you want - Unreal engine means it runs smoothly and provides great visuals - Voice commands and taunts to help you communicate and annoy easily - Gigantic (and smaller) dinosaurs with very impressive animations and diverse approaches to combat - A leveling system to give you a feel of progression and achievement - An open-world game mode which I've not yet tried but sounds very interesting - The developers seem committed and appear to release updates frequently - Many large and beautiful maps to fight on  Cons: - It still needs some work, certain things such as player characters (and the mech) have lackluster animations - While it doesn't really hold any merit in deciding if a game is good or not, its 'Metascore' is low (*) - I'm unsure of this, but it doesn't seem like you're able to earn any in-game cosmetics    * = It depends on the person whether or not they think Metacritic provides an accurate review of the product. Dino Beatdown (the game's former name) didn't go too well and this most likely means that certain people will be discouraged from buying ORION: Dino Horde. There are rumors swirling around Metacritic, saying that the reviewers are paid off by larger corporations to make their product seem better. Besides, reviews are essentially opinions.
4120	1	a	I played this game on a 3-day weekend in 2013, I can't tell you how much I absolutely loved the game.  Recently I've been thinking back to it and wondering 'What am I doing with my life to not have baught this yet?'  Then it hit me, I NEED to buy it, so I did and it was the best choice I ever made, the game is amazing, and insanely fun to play.  For anyone who loves epic battles and insane weapons, I reccomend you buy this game immediatly.
4122	1	a	Best game youll ever have for $0.99 Its nazi zombies+halo+dinos This game is very addicting and has the best intense co-op experience i have ever had in a long time
4124	1	a	This is Hands down the best Dino indie game out there, first of all its only 99cents, and second of all it is just a brilliant and a magnificent piece of game, The graphics are gorgeous, and the gameplay is impresseive. If you thinking of buying this game i definatley recommend it.
4126	1	a	One of the best games I've playe in a while
4128	1	a	Best game that costs 50 cents you will ever play..... its very fun... multiplayer co-op.... aaaand you get to kill waves of Dinos using all sorts of hi-tech weaponry.
4130	1	a	When I saw this game for only a dollar I thought what the hell lets try it. Shortly after that I grabbed the 4 pack and brought some friends in and have had nothing but fun and good times. The $15 price tag might be a little much for some people but I have had more fun in this game than I have had with a lot of the recent AAA games.
4132	1	a	AMAZING! I would recommend it to EVERYBODY i know, keep up the good work, there is a bit of lag with a spawning dinosaur boss however, so there are of course still a few bugs, but can't wait to get my friends together and play this for real.
4134	1	a	its an awesome game 
4136	1	a	A cooperative, wave survival, class based FPS that forgoes pomp and circumstance for a more pick-up-and-play kind of experience. Similar to games like Killing floor, but with dinos instead of zambos. You fight little dinos, get better weapons, upgrades and perks, collect xp to strengthen 1 of 3 classes, fight big dinos, get killed, rage quit, drink heavily, rinse and repeat.  The game is a little clunky at times, but it's solid fun with frands for just a buck.
4138	1	a	Like killing floor but with guns! 11/10
4140	1	a	This Is Better than Primal Carnage 100/100
4142	1	a	good side:  cheap dino killing  bad side:  lack of people
4144	1	a	WORDS CANNOT DESCRIBE THIS GAME.
4146	1	a	The Metacritic score is misleading
4148	1	a	So i got ORION: Dino Horde for 1$ when it was on sale, and im so happy i did that !! this game is a great combination of borderlands and left 4 dead, when me and my friends played it we had so much fun !! ill try get my girlfriend to play it with me.  the positives: +big open world +lots of vehicles +diffrent type of enemies +great graphics +good time with your firends  +easy controls  the negetives: -not newbie friendly -some dino's have strange attack animations -usless ironsights  my score: 9\10 sorry for bad english &lt;3
4150	1	a	Pretty fun game i really like the open world part! It is a hassle to buy a 4 pack if you own the game already or just a normal copy to gift when you are playing it on the free days.... But all in all it is fun to play with a couple friends has some good content. :)
4152	1	a	IF I COULD FIND THE WORDS TO DESCRIBE HOW ♥♥♥♥ AND HOW BUGGY THIS GAME IS, ID GLADLY DO SO... ♥♥♥ U SPIRAL U DIRTY ♥♥♥♥ FUKS. I HONESTLY HOPE A METEORITE SMASHES WHATEVER ♥♥♥♥ BOX U CREATE GAMES IN AND YOU DIE IN A ROCKY FIRE BLAZE. ♥♥♥♥
4154	1	a	Such a good game 10/10  1. Jetpack 2. Bow and arrow 3. Amazing 
4156	1	a	At first, this is a game you'll hate a lot, but as I found out, it quickly gets to be more fun as you invest time into it. Animations are, pretty sub par, and there are some questionable bugs in the game that break it, and, it's soundtrack is forgettable. But ignoring those features to the basic bits, you've got a game built around co-op that has a competitive feature. The co-op includes the 3 classes where each one contributes to the game in a major way. Recons eliminate dinos and do stealthy revives/repairs on the generator. Supports are the only class that can heal anyone on the team, as well as tanking with their beefy life. Assault, well, it's pretty basic, he goes places fast and kills things fast. Competitive allows the player to play as the dinosaurs too, which is actually kind of fun, though I must say I haven't had much experince in that department.  Overall, all I can say is, you get a pretty good laugh and great feeling after you punch a T-rex in the face and either A. Kill it, or B. It eats you and regains life.  7.5-8/10 It does need work, but hell, it makes you laugh and it has a good core.
4158	1	a	Fun game! Found it way easier to go stealth as the recon class with a knife and melee ^-^'   Haven't experienced any problems with the game.
4160	1	a	Review of Orion : Prelude! This game may seem dull at the first hour, but when you play enough of it, you can't stop. The graphics might not be very good, but it makes up for its gameplay, it has several vehicules, giant maps, Adjustable NPC difficulty, 10+ game modes ( only 2 are Singleplayer sadly ). Orion is basically Humans V.S Dinos, Don't see that much often eh? Anyways, Humans have 3 Classes, Each class with it's upgrades and special Skills! 7 or 8 Vehicules! 12+ Guns and taunts!  = Fair Graphics  + Good singleplayer - Microtransactions ( i really hate that! where's the time where skins would be unlocked by a special challenge/ mission?) + Different gameplays + Several modes + Workshop + Several maps  = Taunts ( depends on your view of Taunts i personally hate them ) + Good XP system + Cheap price ( well in my time at least! I heard it's going to be $20 in the next few months ) So get it on sale or not, it is worth the money!
4162	1	a	you can kill dino with an egg 1000/10
4164	1	a	Its like halo but with dinosaurs - IGN
4166	1	a	Would have spent $40 To get this game.  Legit. Amazing multiplayer game.  11/10
4168	1	a	37/100
4170	1	a	Groovy, hip and radical.
4172	1	a	I don't know what's so satisfying about an FPS with temporary and permanent upgrades that's all about killing dinosaurs but I love it. The music is repetative as hell but catchy, it'll be the only thing you might not like and will probably turn off or at least lower it, it's pretty much most the sound. If you haven't seen this game, it has a Kickstater called the Orion project and they plan on making this game an entire precedural universe with story and such. I can't wait for that, I bought this on a Steam sale way before I heard about that and I'm glad I did. I can only run this beasty in 720p or my 440GT takes a duece but that just shows that it wants to have more graphical power. The game runs gorgeously with dynamic lighting and has amazing textures. I wish I had a better videocard.
4174	1	a	This game is fantastic for people who...  1. Play Killing floor and enjoy it.   2. Are looking for a realistic dinosaur roadkill simulator.   10/10 in the name of ragdoll physics
4176	1	a	SO I WAS RUNNIN ROUND WITH A 3 ROUND BURST LMG...WTF RIGHT....ANYWAY IM SHOOTING A TRICERETOPS IN THE FACE WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN IM FLYING HIGH IN THE SKY WITH A BIRD. DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON. THEN I FALL DOWN TO THE GROUND AND A COMPY KILLS ME. SO I UNINSTALLED. WOULD RECOMMEND THOUGH.
4178	1	a	The only way to interact with dinosaurs, is to shoot them in the head, while smaller dinosaurs gnaw on your BALLS. 10/10
4180	1	a	You may expect a cheap ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game (as I did), but you are wrong - this is one of the best co-op shooters for a unreasonably low price.   Futuristic soilders fighting dinosaurs is a weird combo, but it turns out great. Well-balanced classes, weapons and enemies is the most important part of a shooter, and this game has it. It's a little bit confusing at the beggining, but when you get used to it it's a easy to play.  The only thing I dislike is the heavy GPU usage. It maxes out my 760 and only gives about 70fps, which is about the same as I get in BF4. The graphics are not something amazing, but good enough to not ruin the experience.  Overall, this is an amazing game, well worth the 80 cents it costs. The developers are great people, pricing this game at such a low price, while it is surely worth at least 5x more and I respect that very much. Will be buying more copies for friends!
4182	1	a	  Orion....
4184	1	a	Really fun to play with friends, funny as and atually more fun than you probably think it would be. :) I recommend buying it and play with friends.
4186	1	a	This is an amazing game, no doubt about it. I don't know what has happened with the metacritic score, but this game has been judged misleadingly, and unfairly.
4188	1	a	since its under a dollar i think its fun as hell.
4190	1	a	10/10! Have played with my mates (bought the 4 pack)! Super fun MetaCritic deff. goofed up? I wonder how much the big companies have to pay to get 97's (looking at you Valve). -Note I did not help develope the game!
4192	1	a	Definitely the most fun I have had in ages. Sure, it's buggy, but the gameplay is solid and there's shenanigans aplenty to be had. Not to mention that playing as a dinosaur is a rolicking good time. That feeling when I let loose a spine-chilling roar that sends people scampering in the opposite direction never gets old for me. If you like to be huge and stompy, I higly recommend giving Rampage mode a try.  All in all, I think that anybody who is a dinosaur fan should play this game. And really, who isn't a dinosaur fan at heart?
4194	1	a	was worth $0.99
4196	1	a	I LOVE THIS GAME SHOOOOOOOOO MUCH. I AM NOT BUY BUT THE PICTURES ARE LOOK MANY GOODS
4198	1	a	I had this game in my library for a while. I recently picked up Trek Industries newest game, which is in early access and I was impressed by what I saw so I thought I'd delve into ORION: Prelude to see what I could expect from them in the development of that game.  When you know about the history of ORION: Prelude the state it's in now is pretty impressive. The developer clearly worked hard to turn something that was unplayable into a game that is actually really fun. There's no real depth to it but it's a slightly different take on your average horde mode game, the mechanics are solid and there's a nice variety of maps.   It is only 79p so you can't really go wrong if you want to sink a few hours into a decent game that has a small but fairly active multiplayer community. It's definitely worth more than it's asking price.
4200	1	a	Only paying a $1.49 it was money well spent. I have never had so much fun shooting dinos and playing as dinos. I would get this game if you dont have it already.
4202	1	a	Well, i really didn't have high expectations when i first bought this game for 0,99€, which i consider pretty much 'free'. But this game turned out to be great, and not just great - I prefer it over 60€ games such as GTA V, which means something. This game is NO.1 on the 'Fun for the money' List in my opinion. I don't know any other game where you can use your jetpack to power-punch a flying dinosaur, or blow up floating heads with a grenade launcher (Gamemode called 'Silly mode'. Well the graphics are... are... Well, not so good, but that makes the game easier to run on low-end systems. For anyone out there with a low-end pc (laptop?) who does not want to spend much money on expensive 60€ games they cant run, this is the perfect game for you to buy. Its extra fun when playing co-op with your friends, even tho the game maybe doesn't feel 'complete'.  So, fun for the money rating:  7/10 -IGN  KILL DEM DINOS!
4204	1	a	I shot a guy in the ♥♥♥♥ with a bolt action in rust to get this game.......so i guess its good............
4206	1	a	I had the raptor in my sights, but before I could press the trigger I was suddenly picked up by some dino bird and lifted very high. I punched it! I then began to fall to my death, but my trusty jet pack saved me from a nasty fall. I landed safely, reloaded, turned around, and saw the T-rex jaws coming down, and then I think I was in its belly dying. Punching didn't help, and neither did the jet pack. I am now poo.  Game play is tight, not a single crash. Me and the bros were playing survival for 10 hours, then we realized there was even more game play type! We were having so much fun we didn't even check if there was a way to change or alter the game!  No real story that I can see, but if killing hordes of dinos with halo-type weapons appeals to you, who needs it? I grabbed it on a steam sale and it is unbelievable value for my money.
4208	1	a	Actually really fun, get a few mates and it's brilliant, I'd get it in the sale mind!
4210	1	a	Pretty cool game. My friend bought the 4-pack when it was on sale for super cheap and gifted me a copy.  It's a fun FPS game and it was definitely worth the 75 cents. I'm not 100% sure it would be worth 15 dollars though. If this game goes on sale for like 8 dollars, go ahead and snag it. I don't think it's great enough that you would want to buy it at the normal 15 dollar price.  It's still a really cool game, especially with friends.  Edit: Now that it's 99 cents, you really can't go wrong with this especially if you're new to steam and don't have many games.
4212	1	a	Tremendously spartan shooter arcade game. Easy to get into, games can last for as short or as long as you desire. Plenty of weapons, vehicles and user custimisations. Several game modes, from TDM, FFA, 1v1, Survival and Conquest. Survival are matches consisting of several waves of dinosaurs attacking you and your base for you to fend off with you and your mates. Inexpensive, fun and easy to get into for video game novices and experts alike.
4214	1	a	The Metacritic score of 36 / 100 is way off base...I'm thinking that the game was released a little early with too many bugs, but the Developers have fixed that and added a ton of content. This game is a lot of fun. There are many different weapons, dinos, vehicles to drive, game modes, upgrades, etc.
4216	1	a	Great game with great graphics, especially for its price :)
4218	1	a	This game, oh my my...   Beyond the initial metacritic score for the earlier version of this game; it is worth giving a chance. I picked it up on sale; after seeing the game on sale for 99 cents; I was like: The hell with it, I am buying this. No I am not rich and no it is not disposable income; you can be unemployed and living on welfare checks and still understand the whole idea of impulse buying a 99 cent game.. It's like going to a restaurant and ordering a cup of soda, which adds 1 extra dollar to your bill..   So the game itself is actually pretty fun. Don't play this game for 'intense lore'. it is simply such a derp game in terms of atmosphere (storyline and background); simply because it is minimalistic.   How about instead of writing a 7 paragraph review like I always do, I will give you this:  Imagine being in the US Marine Corps, and you are in a Supercobra attack slick; and you are swooping over the marshlands in georgia bored to ♥♥♥♥ because you are bringing the chopper to a new base. Lets say you spot several crocodiles in the marshes; and you decide 'F**K it', and start shooting them to millions of pieces.  Now take this image and turn it into sci-fi, where space-dinosaurs are on some random planet; and you bloodthristy bored-as hell soldiers stationed on some remote planet want to have some action.. Well pick up em guns boys! We have freaking space raptors to murder!  In a nutshell, the game is simply amusing. It is funny, and I think the developers have strong wit they intentionally put into this game. It is fun, jetpacking around the maps with guns and slaughtering dinosaurs with friends has never been so fun of a pastime before!  Now.. Someone bring me a pizza!
4220	1	a	Great game with great graphics, especially for its price :)
4222	1	a	Tremendously spartan shooter arcade game. Easy to get into, games can last for as short or as long as you desire. Plenty of weapons, vehicles and user custimisations.

4224	1	a	Despite the multiple unpolished aspects of the game, for some reason it is addictively fun. Dunno what to say... something about shooting endless waves of dinos in the face that is theraputic... and FUN! I think this game is definitely underrated. I wish there were more flying options. The one 'plane' thing is a bit cumbersome.
4226	1	a	this is a great game a mashup of halo jpark a little bit of ctf &amp; survivle
4228	1	a	Pretty much freaked! This game was so Awesome! SO FREAKIN' AWESOME! I love it, but you should make it faster (mean that this game would work on an i3 laptop like mine :) actually it is working but not in a high res) So hope you fixed this!  Anyway, still, you guys are a good developer! I liked the way you survived through bad comments! I always support y'all!
4230	1	a	Just like the trailer says, the game went from zero to hero :D
4232	1	a	I was on the final wave and a T-Rex ate me whole. 10/10
4234	1	a	It was $0.50 on sale for the best 2 hours of my life
4236	1	a	Pretty much the greatest thing I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing.
4238	1	a	Just keeps getting better with all these updates i love it :)! And for $.99 permanately thats just a bonus :)!
603	0	a	Nope
4240	1	a	I don't see any reason to not buy this for under a dollar. It's fun.
4242	1	a	Best dollar I spent in my life!
4244	1	a	Good, Dinosaurs are in it.
4246	1	a	So i bought this game when it was 1 dollar,so you may be thinking,everone who actually BOUGHT the game is mad that it just went F2P,well when there over game, The Orion Project,goes F2P,everone who bought the game at a premiuem cost gets 6 diffrent helmets FOR Orion. Which is pretty cool and this isnt P2W,as most stuff in the store is just cosmetic. So i would recommend you try this game out,as its a pretty good game to play on.
4248	1	a	What a nice game! -Good points: -Nice graphics; -Good gameplay; -3 different classes, each one with it's gameplay and different; -Lots of vehicles; -Lots of weapons; Bad points: -My pc is a potato, so i cannot play this game over 40 fps; -When a T-rex appears, he throws a rock down into your face; ;-;  I reccomend everyone to play, cheap and always welcome to a shopper account!
4250	1	a	10/10 The most graceful thing I have ever experienced.
4252	1	a	Take Vehicles from Halo, And weapons from every fps in the world and add Dinosaurs.  What do you get?  A Metascore of 36   ORION: Dino Horde.  But seriously.. I shot down a stegosaurus in a tank and everything went slow motion and a voice said Dino Down 36/10 best game ever.
4254	1	a	I can't stop playing it.
606	0	a	I found out the hard way that I really don't like being savaged by raptors that have 3 frames of animation to their name while my buddy kills a T-Rex who got stuck in a rock in the background and a very enthusiastic announcer yells 'Bring me some pizza!' at the top of his lungs. No sir, I don't like it.
4256	1	a	Game's nice, but not worth the regular $15 price. It has gameplay affecting bugs up the wazoo, and devs who seem to care more about sales than informing their playerbase (unless I can find more up-to-date info.) The levelling system is nice, if a bit tedious due to how fast the exp requirements go, and the specific upgrades are off a level every once in a while. But despite the game's professional appearance, on the inside, it's a far more amateurish game than it looks, which may or may not actually be a bad thing, depending on what you like. However, if it's on sale for $1 (which is more often than it should be) just buy the damn game and enjoy the time you can spend with it for only a dollar.
607	0	a	I think the metacriti score of 36/100 is correct kinda lifeless and dumb to be honest. i had 0 health but lived ?!?!?!?!?
608	0	a	I ventured into this game excited by the void in my heart which could be filled with dinosaurs. However I came out of this game with half my brain missing. It is very poor. Furthermore this game along with Chivalry Medieval Warfare have been getting rather jealous recently as I havn't played them for a while. They have started to attack and pillage my internet connection. As a result i have rung up BT and they are sending me a new home hub. All because this game is garbage and gets jealous of other, better games on the market. Avoid if you enjoy your sanity/internet connection.
609	0	a	So. The Dino bit is...ok. Not that good overall. Then you open up a new ugly can of worms with actual PVP. Oh, good god is that horrible. The guns all feel the same. Bad. It's clunky and rough. accidenally alt-tabbed out and everything froze. I mean my computer on a whole. It was weird and easily fixed but still didn't bode well when the Voice button is ALT. yeah. No thanks. I'm done and good. I'll stick to my other mindless FPS games.
610	0	a	This is such a bad game I cannot put it down. It has the crappiest programming, the weirdest glitches, the ♥♥♥♥♥iest bugs, and the worst possible sound. With that said, it is addicting to watch giant alligaitors with painted on eyes crawl around you in circles.
611	0	a	This game is horrendous. It's built like a free-to-play game with microtransactions, but this game has the audacity to ask for $15, but the only reason why I purchased this game is because it was 99 cents. I want my 99 cents back. This game is terrible and deserves to be taken off of Steam.
612	0	a	So bad, that is fun....but is a very bad game XD
4258	1	a	Fricking Awesome!SO MUCH FUN!I THINK I'M HAVING AN ♥♥♥♥♥♥!This game has good graphics,A variety of Dinosaurs,Lots of guns and weapons,different and fun gamemodes,Cool Maps,enough server slots and just DAMN FUN! It's worth the $14.00 and on sale it goes for only $1.00!Honestly,if you bought it and didn't like it comment down below(Be truthfull please).WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? GO BUY IT AND GET IN ON THE FUN! My Rating For ORION:Dino Horde: 10/10 (THE METASCORE IS SO DAMN MISLEADING!!!!)
4260	1	a	Great Game!... for a dollar. I got it during a sale for only 99 cents so it was definitly worth buying it then! 15 bucks is a little iffy
614	0	a	Graphics are great, but the gameplay is just tedious and boring. It is like Gears of War Horde mode but more crap thrown in. Weapon cost is extremely high, and the 'defend points' are never near any actual defensible position. If you have 4 or more people playing it can be good, but it still seems very lackluster. In my opinion not worth $1.
615	0	a	this game is awfull at the end of every round you fix your generator and buy new guns you cant get new guns unless you fix the generator up abd you end up fight hordes of dinos with a teir 1 pistol! its garbage dont install or buy
616	0	a	game is very laggy and graffics are bad, if you are looking for an fps that will make you poop your pants this is it though. the game has such lag that the dinos come out of no where and kill you.
617	0	a	Don't buy this blanatant rip-off of halo 1 with dinosaurs. On top of the horrible framerate, graphics, and gamplay you are given very little direction once you start so IF you decide to buy this be sure a friend is able to hold your hand for the first few minutes.
618	0	a	its a really bad game dont even think about buying it even if it is on sale
4262	1	a	Got rammed by a Triceratops while I was in a tank and shot halfway across the map.  10/10 Would fly again
4264	1	a	M8, DINOSAURS! DINOSAURS ARE UP IN YOUR GRILL AND YOU NEED TO SORT THEM OUT! 10/10
4266	1	a	Awesome as hell.But very laggy ;c
4268	1	a	I believe this game has been unfairly critisized. I can't believe the bargin I purchased it for. This is like Halo only a hell of a lot better, though the controls do take some getting used to and not everything is intuitive, but once you got all that down and play with some friends or strangers it'll be a blast!
4270	1	a	Played a bit. Great game (Y)
4272	1	a	cool game 
4274	1	a	Great if you like your dinosaurs to be able to phase through walls. 11/10
4276	1	a	Best 99 cents I've ever spent. End of story.
4278	1	a	I bought it at $0.62. Why haven't you?  Didn't expect much from a $0.62 game initially but after playing i loved the horde based gameplay.Wave after wave will try to attack your generator which you have to defend or repair with occasional objectives you have to accomplish. The map has vehicles scattered all around and each map is different and the effect that comes with it makes it more appealing.   'Peak' is a winter map and your visor can get frozen while playing and this forces you to search for a warm place to melt the ice off. The light reflecting off the snow also makes it harder to spot smaller dinos. 'Raupi' is a tropical map where rain starts to pour in mid game. Really gotta love the rain droplet effect on your visor and the weather makes it hard to spot the pterodactyls flying overhead. During each round you'll get to access upgrades and different weapons while they throw at you different types of dinos that range from velociraptors to T-Rexs.  However, if you're playing in Asia, you might find the servers lacking in number. You can still host listen servers or play singleplayer with bots.   I'd say i got my money's worth from this game at that flash sale price ^_^
4280	1	a	Hey it’s pretty fun!  The game is actually pretty fun. By now it’s really damn straight worth one dollar. I like the sun lighting in the game as well as the ability to upgrade your character and use weapons like sentry guns and rocket launchers to mow down waves of enemies. The game does have some downsides as it's still kinda buggy.  Now the “conquest game mode is something to have a lot of fun about. Try beating that before you leave the game. The game gets even more fun when you level up your character and start spawning with weapons that you would normally have to buy. I also like the fact that you can customize your armor style and give yourself a hat and a cape so that you can look like a badass when fighting dinos. It gets pretty fun in high level games.  The only downside to this game is that it's still kinda buggy. They aren't too much of a bother to me.
4282	1	a	- Killed a T-Rex - Got a free ride on a Petarodactil - Got gangbanged with Velociraptors   Best Jurrasic Park Simulator 2013
623	0	a	This game can be fun at times. Playing survival whilst flying in helicopters and blowing the ♥♥♥♥ out of dinosaurs is pretty fun, but this doesn't make up for the downsides.  The graphics in this game is meh, just meh. The lens flares can literally be blinding on some maps and the textures for the dinosaurs make them look like Jurassic Park CGI (the first one). For some reason, this game is EXTREMELY laggy. Even with my GTX 650 and 8 GB of ram, this game can only run around 30 frames per second. Not only this, but it looks made for the Wii.   The gameplay mechanics are much like Left for Dead 2, except worse. You survive wave after wave of dinosaurs trying to destroy your generator (sidebar, why the heck do they go for the generator?). Then you need to go 'hold points,' after which you are awarded with different vehicles (ranged from jeeps with miniguns, jeeps with no point, a tank, a mech, and yes, helicopters). These vehicles have the absolute WORST driving mechanics...you control your vehicles...with your mouse. It's SOO HARD! You're constantly crashing into things which damges your vehicles quite a lot. You also are able to purchase weapons, upgrades for your weapons, and upgrade your character, which overall is not that bad of a system. Other than lacking a good variety of weapons.   So there is one last problem with this game...the dinosaur AI. Literally the flying dinosaurs (my friends and I call them poops) are the most irritating mob in this game. They randomly divebomb you and have a possiblity of picking you up and dropping you from great hights. They for some reason put dinosaurs that we all reconize (ect triceratops) as bosses that try to kill you. But wait, aren't triceratops herbivores? APPARENTLY NOT!  Overall this is a good game if you get it on sale. It's hilarous to play with your friends and get a good laugh at for it's attempt at being good. DO NOT BUY IT FOR FULL PRICE, NOT WORTH IT.

624	0	a	ONION: Dino Horde is da most thugged-out ♥♥♥♥♥♥ vizzle game I've eva played. Y'all KNOW dat ♥♥♥♥, mutha♥♥♥♥a! I KNOW dat it is unfinished n' buggy yo, but still, why release a game when up in fact it is literally, metaphorically, geographically, ironically, n' biologically da most thugged-out ♥♥♥♥♥♥ thang eva n' ♥♥♥♥. Right back up in yo mutha♥♥♥♥in ♥♥♥. Seriously, why even release it, dawg?
4284	1	a	Apparently the meta critic score is for the original of this game entitled Orion: Dino Beatdown. I'm going to presume that's true because there is no way this game is only a 36 out of 100! It's fun as hell, nice graphics, loads of weapons, different classes and perks, cool vehicles, AND FREAKING DINOSAURS  WHO DOESN'T LOVE KILLING DINOSAURS WITH LASER RIFLES WHILST FLYING IN A JETPACK?! 
4286	1	a	this is a fun game especially if your a person that enjoyed something like killing floor.
625	0	a	Glitchy online play, if you can even get into a matchmaking game. You're forced to start out with a crappy pistol and the dinosaurs aren't as exciting as the trailer made them seem. Don't waste your money.
626	0	a	Even though this review says its not recommended its really not all that bad if you are wanting to play a game about dinosaurs, if you can get past the flaws. Said flaws include average gameplay, bad dinosaur AI, terrible animations, poor sounding, poorly excecuted ingame features and the list goes on. Its like primal carnage or Dino D-day just more terrible and with crack down skin over it just with all the good elements ripped out. Overall its a bad game, but it isn't terrible as its fun at some points as its a basic shooter and can be thrilling when you are taking on the big dinosaurs like Spinosaurus, Tyrannosaurus, Triceratops, Stegosaurus and Deinosuchus to name all the boss dinosaurs. For the causal gamer this is an ok pick up. For £1 its a steal so I would suggest picking it up when its on discount. Overall its a bad game but its not terrible.
4288	1	a	Actually wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.
627	0	a	On modern standards the game feels and looks like a work in progress. It does provide for some fun with friends, and there seem to be larger updates down the line. I don't particularly regret my purchase, but this is not something I would suggest buying.
4290	1	a	I love to play this game with friends, got it for all my mods on twitch so we can play with the whole mod team on stream!
629	0	a	 Onion Prelube
4292	1	a	a bit hard to get in the swing of thing but when you do it is very fun game. lots of achivments and ZI like to try and get them all I like Conquest the best then the slopes I dont care for the free fo all or one v one better to kill if you get the right team on conquest it will keep you going for an hour or so .try and stay alive is the point of the game .MOOSE
4294	1	a	If you want to shoot the dinosaur, this is the gaem 2 play to shoo tthe dinsaaur
4296	1	a	I love this game
4298	1	a	I love this game
4300	1	a	Really fun dinosaur shooting fps, the characters say funny **** when they shoot dinos XD, definitely worth buying and playing with friends.
4302	1	a	this game is the worst game you can have fun playing
4304	1	a	Holy cow. This game is awesome! And for 0.99c it doesn't get any better! I love this game. The graphics is.. Im speechless.. THEY ARE AMAZING. Even on lowest !! Really liked the first couple of rounds I played and will be playing more.
631	0	a	they have made a lot of changes and whatnot over the years but i still think it was much better back when it was Dino Beatdown with just three giant conquest maps. i wish it was still like that.
4306	1	a	Pushed a T-Rex off a cliff 10/10
4308	1	a	While this might not be a title for everyone, it is hard to go wrong for a dollar.
4310	1	a	0.99$ um who wouldnt wanna have the thrill of a fps and kill dinos and dont have to worry bout lil kids saying you hack.
4312	1	a	you can taunt on people that you lick ♥♥♥♥♥ !
632	0	a	Terrible buggy mess of a game, and even worse developer (a whole lot worse than EA or Activision), there's not much else to say about it...
4314	1	a	Lol. Orion is a hilarious game. Worth the 99c. Get the 4-pack, and play with your buddies. You will not regret it. Graphics: 5/10 Combat: 7/10 Running around killing T-Rex and laughing your ♥♥♥ off when your buddy gets wrecked by a baby compy: 12/10.
4316	1	a	I love this game for what it is meant to be. Gotta get that out there first.   If you are looking for a mature, story driven game with deep tactical combat, intelligent AI, and characters of any sort, you will be sorely dissapointed.   This game is stupid fun, comically bad AI, silly unrealistic physics, oversimplified PVP, and less in depth than several of the games you might be used to. It tries to do many things at once (it has PVP, PVE, open world, not open world, leveling systems, vehicle combat, augments like jetpacks and invisibility), and only does them all about half as well as it could.   That said... The game is fully aware of what kind of game it is, and the developers know exactly what you wanted out of this kind of game, and boy do they deliver. The pvp is mostly laughable, but when you have been playing co-op with a group of friends it is perfect to switch to and just start murdering each other for a change. The game will make you laugh as you discover its secrets (you can surf dinosaurs and helicopters, and there are achievements for that too).   The game is best when played with friends, but you do not have to bring any. I got the game alone and played random games without friends, but easily found a regular group of people to play with. People are helpful if you ask for help, and people WANT to be your friend. Be a little social in games and you will be rewarded. There are plenty of people that play this game, it has only gotten more popular with time, so you will never be in a situation where you cannot find an open game (or at least I have yet to ever be in that situation).   Finally, the developers are active. They introduce new things all the time (like the open world Conquest mode) and apparently are going to upgrade everyone's game for free very soon (just like they did with their previous game). This game is easily worth the $15 price tag in my opinion, but goes on sale for less than a dollar all the time so you can just wait for when that happens.   So all in all, 9/10 for the kind of game that it is and tries to be. Buy this game if you ever enjoy playing games for fun. You are sure to find many new friends in the game as you madly laugh like a wildman when you create a firey tornado of death with your flamethrower as you ride the back of a T-rex and hundreds of raptors flee before you in sheer terror.
4318	1	a	This game is good. It's not like Primal Carnage, or Primal Carnage: Extinction but still it's a nice game. If you can't buy these two, get this game. It's really cool if you like dinosaurs or shooters. There are many gamemodes, much classes with their unique abilities and you can customize your character.
4320	1	a	Game of the year.
4322	1	a	This is one of the best games i played
4324	1	a	I've wanted to fly around in a jetpack and shoot a tyrannosaurus in the face since I was five years old.
642	0	a	Very good game for $1 it needs more hats and less dinos
643	0	a	This is a very misleading game its makes you think these Awesome epic encounters and Amazing Gameplay in the trailer it says things like 'Paid $3.99 for this game and is better than some of $60 games' and things like that so then I try the 5 day Trial and what do I get A game that crashes contsantly and has tons of bugs and glitches and SO MUCH LAG and you may be saying you may just need a better computer and no I payed $800+ dollars for this computer and it is one of the fastes computers out there so no i had to lower my resolution disable most everything that i could and still tons of lag and its the same raptor over and over and when you try to actually play the game its way to hard even on the lowest difficulty and no I dont suck at the fps genre its the game the Allasaurus that spits acid its way to hard to kill so the only possitive think i can say about this game is that it has a massive potential and can be very very addictive with the proper updates and fixes to the bugs than I would highly recommend this but sadly no I have to hate this game and i try to not hate games heck I actually Enjoy the game Sonic the Hedgehog 2006 so I am an open Minded person. Please feel free to leave a comment and like this review
4326	1	a	10/10 the game was a dollar Not just once. BUT TWO TIMES. 93% OFF. AND ITS ONLY A DOLLAR NOW
4328	1	a	ORION: Dino Horde had started off on the wrong foot. It was like dino beatdown, and nothing else. Dino Horde, after lots of updates, is now one hell of a game! The game is truly amazing and is fun with friends too. If anything I would defintely recommend buying it now on the sale. Its a bargain for a game with this much potential (y).
4330	1	a	I know this has a horrible Metacritic score and lots of bad reviews here on Steam. But for the price (which is currently $0.99), it is worth it. At a dollar BUY THIS GAME. It's sort of like Killing Floor with better graphics but not as good of a trader system. The maps are large and vast. The dinosuars, especially the freaking flying ones do give a challenge.   If you like Co-op games and can get the 4-pack for $3 and have friends who will play with you, it's fun. You'll enjoy it when you kill that large croc with a barrage of missles and gunfire from the flying croc killer (sorry don't know what that flying thing is called but it's fun).   There is a community of players and that should tell you that the game is at least worth $1 or checking out.
4332	1	a	I shot a dinosaur or something it was pretty cool I guess
4334	1	a	Absolutely worth the money while its on offer 99p or 75p is such a bargain for this game, and has a fantastic multiplayer element to it, and its easy to set up your own servers and start playing right away! Definately buy if you want a fun multiplayer game to play with your friends :)
4336	1	a	As a kid, I've always loved dinosaurs. I've wanted to live with them and love them. Thanks to this game, I now know that dinosaurs are a big ♥♥♥♥ing pain in the ♥♥♥. And ♥♥♥♥ having them as a pet, imagine the ♥♥♥♥♥ they take. Reuplsive, huh?  Well anyways, I love this game. It's very fun to kill dinos with random strangers and friends. No complaints really, just a fun survival dino thing :I
4338	1	a	I'm calling my lawyer because i spent 59 cents... now is free to play. I could buy 3 slices of watermelon :(
645	0	a	Do not buy this game. I installed it since it's free for a limited time. The only remotely unique thing about this game is that it has dinosaurs so I was like heck yeah I can play as my favorite dinosaurs. But they're slow and clunky and if a human player jumps up on a rock, or even stands next to a rock, there's no way to reach them. The attacks have absolutely no range and seem to do nothing even if the human player should be within range. The only good thing about this game is that you can see some dinosaur models that have animations. Beyond that, it's not even worth a dollar.
4340	1	a	Like Halo But with Dinosuars,  I like it. :D Nuff Said~
646	0	a	Let me start by saying this is by FAR the most poorly optimized game I've ever played. For the first hour or so of playing, the game would tab out every 5-10 minutes for windows to tell me that the game was a memory leak (though this did eventually stop for god knows what reason). Upon closing the game, the windows UI was glitched beyond recognition (probably due to all the window switching while in game) and I had to restart my computer to fix it.  Regarding the gameplay, Original it is not. The art assets are ripped from Halo (except for the dinosaur models/skins, which are just plain hilariously bad), the sound clips are ripped from Left 4 Dead and the gameplay is a simplified Killing Floor. There are 3 classes to choose from, but it becomes immediately apparent that Assault is the only viable one because without a jetpack you WILL die. The enemy AI is godawful, so the game compensates by throwing EVERY DINOSAUR IN EXISTENCE at you. Orion: Dino Horde is just a mess of things thrown together. To its credit though, it does have its moments of enjoyability, and I'm sure this game would be EXTREMELY fun to play while under the influence. Though I'm not sure what I was expecting when even the trailer for the game is trying to tell me 'please don't listen to the metacritic reviews'.
4342	1	a	All you need to know is its a ♥♥♥♥ing amazing concept with an alright execution. Imagine Halo, mixed with killing floor plus DINOS!! The game does get a bit buggy and really it still seems like its in beta version but overall the dinosaur-reking adventure is tops. Theres no campaign but its best feature is survival which is a classic earn credits, buy better ♥♥♥♥, kill more dinos; repeat- although its not like L4D infinite wave survivals so its fun cause it can be completed.  Perfect game to pleh with m8s in 6 difficulties (but just as good by yourself- no AI standing around touching themselves) and the some 278 acheivements make it really competitive and keeps you interested. If you get a chance to pick this up discounted, its well worth its 99c.   10/10 would bang
4344	1	a	graphics arent the best but its fun so thats all that counts better then duty of call  ITS .99 CENTS WHAT ELSE ARE YOU ASKING FOR
4346	1	a	This is quite possibly the best cheap thrill you can pick up on Steam.  It's everything and more than I could have ever wanted in a game this inexpensive: dinosaurs, guns, more dinosaurs, flying around shooting dinosaurs, destroying Robot Santa with a rocket launcher, music that you could swear carries a bit of the Mr. Clean jingle in it, and much, much more.   The best things in life are apparently just about nearly free; snag this if you're looking to blow things up with friends and marvel at the masterpiece that is ORION: Prelude.
4348	1	a	I love it the game never gets old always finding fun ways to play this :P i love da game
4350	1	a	I would recommend this game, for sure. But it has it's up and downs, and I'll go through both.  Positives:    -There's nothing that compares to battling a T-Rex one-on-one with only a pistol and a medigun that can recharge yourself.  -Team-play is quite fun, too. The gameplay is simple enough that you can slaughter dinos without doing much thinking, which is exactly what it says on the tin.  -It is pretty stable, I didn't see any gamebreaking bugs and it works just as it's supposed to.  -The Killing Floor styled gameplay works really well with dinosaurs.  -The vehicles are varied and quite fun.   -The Adrenaline weapons are a nice touch.  -Do I really have to explain how fun it is to fight hordes of raptors while using a Jetpack? Steam, you should know this.  -None of the weapons felt 'Useless' in the sense that I could do decent damage with almost anything.   Negatives:  -The Support Class has VERY racist dialogue, I don't appreciate the fact that he calls his teammates 'Homies' and 'Dawg' just because he's of African decent. It's not even well-done voice acting so the point of including it at all is mediocre at best and it kind of detracts from the experience. Why couldn't they have race-neutral dialogue? I am kind of disappointed as it lessens the experience of an otherwise solid game.  -The price is way too high, however I bought it while it was on sale for only one dollar so I can't complain of this personally. If whoever is reading this doesn't own the game already, pick it up while it's on sale.  -There aren't many maps to choose from. It's not that big of an issue, but I could do with a change of scenery. To address this issue, allowing custom maps would be preferable.  -The game is very unbalanced, Supports are almost invincible if they have the Iron Pecs perk and the upgrades that make it so you can't die from heights or chomping. On the other hand Recon is nearly useless in all situations. However, this doesn't bug me very much considering I bought this game to casually slaughter lizards, not to engage the finer philosophical and strategic aspects of warfare in a futuristic society. The unbalance is entirely made up for by the fact there's a minigun.  Overview:  For a Unreal Mod, it has a high production quality, and it definitely deserves a higher metascore than it has in my honest opinion. It deserves at least a 65. If you wish to buy this game, do so while it's on sale, and have fun with it. It's not meant to be a realistic fighting simulator like Counter-Strike, so I don't see why people would complain of the unrealistic setting of a game where you're a space marine fighting dinosaurs on some alien planet. It lost it's realness at 'Dino Horde', and that's okay.   Games are just meant to be played, and I enjoyed every minute of playing this one.
4352	1	a	It's now a dollar, or 79p. Permanently. Definately worth a flutter. And it's come a long way since it's much maligned launch. Whilst not as polished as say, Killing Floor you can tell that the devs have been trying hard to be. And the game improved a lot thanks to their efforts. Hit detection occasionally has a silly moment but for the most part its fine and the game runs pretty smooth. I can even host games with everyong pinging under 100. And its fun. Good assortment of vehicles and weapons, power ups, plenty of maps. So if you like co-op shooters and have had your fill of zombies give it a spin!
4354	1	a	Still a better love story than twillight ^^
4356	1	a	its a fun game. Just get it and you wont regret it ^.^
651	0	a	The company responsible for this game stole many asset from Activision for their new game called ORION, more precisely Black Ops 3 and Advanced warfare.   At first you might think that this is just some Big Guy is bullying a little company, but even if ACTIVISION is not a respectable company, theft is theft. Also, David Prassel of Trek Industries threatened many people on reddit to sue them if they didn't delete their thread calling out their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ behavior.  For more information on their dirty deeds.   https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4q6xo5/activisions_dmca_claim_on_orion_is_legit_orions/   Anyway, this game sucked harder than my vacuum cleaner (Repetetive, filled with microtransaction, physic was ridiculous, etc etc). This game didn't need this obvious theft to get a negative review.  ♥♥♥♥ you anyway David, sue me all you want, I don't own ♥♥♥♥.
652	0	a	ORION: Dino Horde is a painfully average game and still feels like a Unreal Tournament 2004 mod, even with all the updates it received so far. There's nothing that makes it stand out from similar games and it has a long way to Killing Floor levels of greatness. However, if you think that aforementioned KF really need vehicles, dinosaurs and jetpacks, or you're really tired of zombies – wait for ORION to go on a sale and grab it. Everyone else, save yourselves some time. I've made a longer version of the review, available here -  http://www.coffeebreakgaming.co.uk/pc-game-reviews/review-orion-dino-horde/ 
4358	1	a	Futuristic weapons killing dinosaurs? This game is the most fun that YOU'RE not having! Many different game types to suit varied tastes; Hilarious achievements to unlock -including 'Dude on the Toilet,' which Jurassic Park fans will instantly recognize; I'm telling you... I haven't had this much fun since I was blowing up stuff on the demo range. -kniF taR
656	0	a	This game does more than charge you 1 buck, it sucks the life out of you, if forces you to play this buggy ♥♥♥♥ and charge you for it, and for those who played this on the free week, my harddrive is offended and tried suiciding after first launch. 10/10
4360	1	a	Totally LOVE it! I'm already addicted, tho they need more .... female stuff in the game, like accessories and such.
4362	1	a	the beatles of games
4364	1	a	Great Game actually. I see a lot of reviews sayin how the publisher is a piece of crap and all that stuff, I have to say that the game itself is pretty nice.  The idea of the game is simple but hey, if you are a casual gamer like me who just need to wind down a bit after work, this game is perfect. It is an easy goin' dino shootin' fps with nice graphics and a very friendly game community. There is no fancy campaign or complicated mechanics in the game, no scheming no grand strategy, just some good old fashioned brainless action packed shooting. And that is good enough for me.  Of course, if you are a hardcore gamer looking for a challege, this game is not for you. But if all you want is sometime away from it all, this game is the perfect choice. 9/10
4366	1	a	Great game, co-op is really nice :) Some weapons are to OP :( but it's fun to play, especially with friends :) Try it on every free weeked and then buy 4-pack :) it's worth every penny :)
661	0	a	I dug a bit deeper to find out why I haven't had the will to play this game for more than three measly hours. Found DMCA claims, multiple titles with the same gameplay, money-whoring Kickstarter tactics, etc.  I wonder if Steam will still accept my refund.
662	0	a	For the love of god avoid this game in its entirety. It's god some decent ideas but the execution is the absolute worst of perhaps any game ever made. Avoid. Avoid. Avoid.
4368	1	a	The MetaScore for this game does not do it justice. - If you only read the first line of reviews, then this one speaks volumes.  Essentially a wave-based first person shooter (in the same mold as Tripwire's Killing Floor and Valve's Left 4 Dead), this game has a man vs dinosaurs theme set in mulitple locations.  Graphics are smooth and surprisingly good. The developers have thrown a lot of work into making this game not only playable, but challenging and enjoyable as well - and it shows. Not the most immersive game out there, but that fades into insignificance when the bullets start flying.  A worthy addition to any game library - especially when on sale.
664	0	a	I dug a bit deeper to find out why I haven't had the will to play this game for more than three measly hours. Found DMCA claims, multiple titles with the same gameplay, money-whoring Kickstarter tactics, etc.  I wonder if Steam will still accept my refund.
665	0	a	-5/10 would not get ♥♥♥♥♥ by tricerotops. Worst $1.50 I've ever spent.
4370	1	a	This game is a lot of fun no doubt.Highly under-rated.Love the scenary/evironment.And the dinosaurs are wonderful i really enjoy killing them .Fun weapons and vehicles to use. Only downfall is its bugs .Hopefully it all gets resolved in the future to make the game perfect.
667	0	a	This game is just horrible. Metacritic has the right score. this game is so bad that they had to make a fake community apprecitation video to spread lies on how 'good' it is. DON'T BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! There is no replayability, The dinosaurs feel so robotic and unreal. It's way to repetitive because all you do is shoot dinosaurs or shoot other people and you pretty much get the same experience ALL THE TIME. Did i mention that the boss dinosaurs are so freakin bad. they're unepic, they can get stuck in walls and get glitched so you can just fire away, they also feel unreal. The animations are pretty bad especially for the stupid sword. it just looks like you're love tapping those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and not freakin slicing the ♥♥♥♥ out of those dinos. I really dont want to explain anymore of the horrid features of this HORRIBLE game because there are many. I don't know why there are so many Thumbs up it's just making the developers big headed causing them to make a stupid ♥♥♥ video spreading their lies to the world. DON'T BUY THiS GAME.
668	0	a	The graphics are low texture, the AI is buggy as crap and there are a bunch of features that don't work properly. It's fun with friends but you'd be better off playing killing floor for an evening.
4372	1	a	I found the game to be quite good, it makes good use of the Unreal Engine too. To see my gameplay the link is attached:  https://youtu.be/zEILzMO12lk  
669	0	a	I hope you know what weapons to get; because those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that want you to defend that base LOCK YOU OUT IN ONLY ONE MINUTE. The sound seems to work intermittently but one thing is for sure; that stereotypical black guy voice is coool under fire! These dinosaurs are ninjas.  Sometimes the miniguns on the vehicles work. Sometimes they don't. Your friends will swear that they are overheating and take over but you know the spin-up animation isn't happening but now you want to kick your dog. Thank Glob you don't have a dog.  I played my first game and my friend was so happy to be done with our mission that I couldn't even get to see my stats. Frankly, I don't really care anymore.  This game is sooo close to being decent. There are too many niggling issues (it's not racist - look it up) for me to recommend it, however. I can only imagine what it was like to play at launch.  When I bought Audiosurf for 99 cents, I was ecstatic. There should be a 'Meh' button, but...
670	0	a	Do not get this game. It has horrible graphics and very bad fps, even though tipicaly running 120fps on any other game. The consept is ok, but nothing great: you have to survive waves of dinos who come and try to kill you and your generator. get sanctum if you want a game like this but better.
671	0	a	That game is Bad. And i doesn't mean idea, idea is pretty present. I mean the way it realized. Game is Raw, controls feels Clumsy, game is Glitchy, Models looking like axe-crafted wood ... it feels like - game was coded by feets, not by hands. It's looking like school-project created by something like 'build-your-game' tool, it doesn't even looks like Game. It's Awful, Uncomfortable, Embarrassing and Stupid. It's not just doesn't cost fixed price, it shouldn't have any price. I swear, i seen indie Games that has Much better Quality than That.
672	0	a	Worst ♥♥♥♥ing gave i ever played in my life.  The trailer looks really amazing and all, i was really hype when i noticed the new content would be F2P this week but once i started playing i was really not happy.  INSTAGIB, was my first game, your gun take more then half the screen and it take like 2 sec to charge it to shoot, and you can't hold it and shoot at your will, it shoot after the charge.  Second game was in some kind of Power Generator defense map.. no idea what the ♥♥♥♥ was going on... killing dinos for credits and XP, bought a Magnum which aim like potato gun...  Again, this ♥♥♥♥ing gamemode.. follow a random dude... walk 3 km, like 10 min walk (THE MAP IS REALLY HUGE) don't see anyone or any dinos on the way... get seperate from that guy, meet 2 enemies... one of them already had a shotgun, we get really close to each others.. i shoot at him at least 50 times (i'm not an idiot i was totally aiming at him) and like 2 bullets it him for 24 dmg which is not even close to 5% health.. he shoot me 3 times at like 50 feets and i'm dead. I respawn and there's 3-4 guys in our base with vehicules murdering everyone.  The graphics are a mix of 80's games graphics mixed with CryEngine 2. Sounds is terribad... Map is huge for no reason... more ressources to load in your RAM for absolutely no reasons. Peoples won't explain you the game and tell you ♥♥♥♥ like 'I bet you play CoD', well at least CoD is a decent game, even the hitboxes are better in Black Ops then this game.  The fact i wasn't hitting anyone might be due to high ping servers but for me this game doesn't do it. I wouldn't even pay 50 cents for this.  Enough words. I don't recommend it.. if you like old school graphics game like Unreal Tournament 2004 but with some randoms ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ts CryEngine2-like and you like killing ♥♥♥♥♥ randomly for no reason to get own by RANDOM enemies. This might be your game..  
673	0	a	This is becoming quite laughable. This useless and totally anonymous 'game' just keeps popping up as free trial for days. The reason? Uh... let's guess.  The positive reviews in the trailer are those written in the 'store page', paste/copy. Not even good at cheating
4374	1	a	Oh what a mess. Looking through this game's history is quite the nightmare, and makes me glad I have nothing to do with Spiral's PR team (if one even exists). I think the most important thing for anyone looking at this game to note is that it is not at all what it used to be. Over the past couple of years this game has been nurtured and cared for with an obvious love and dedication that I don't often see these days from developers. While the original ORION: Dino Beatdown was a buggy mess, Dino Horde has grown out of that messy goo into something I think plenty of people will enjoy for hours on end.  I recently acquired this game while it was on sale for ~$1.00 thinking I would have a good time playing it with my friends, not expecting a whole lot based on steam reviews and such. My goodness was I pleasantly surprised.   The first thing that grabbed my attention when I loaded up the game was the depth of the options menu. The sheer amount of UI customization and graphical tweaking available is phenomenal. And they scored major points for allowing me to turn off bloom and motion blur. However I will note that I have not yet found a way to change the controller look sensitivity, which is quite the downside if you prefer to play this with a controller, and stands in stark contrast to the quality of the rest of the options menu.  After tweaking controls and graphics options to my heart’s content, my friend and I jumped into a game of survival. Honestly, this is where I think the game suffers the most. We had absolutely no idea what we were doing, and there is very little help to be found online in the forms of wikis or guides. What we did know, was to follow the on screen prompts to turn on our generator. After we managed that, enough help popped up to lead us back to our base to buy weapons and augments (purchasable buffs that last until you die). With the starting money we grabbed a few SMGs and headed outside to kill us some dinos. Once they finally spawned we started frantically murderizing every giant reptile in sight, and they in turn began chewing on our faces. Seems dinosaurs don't appreciate bullets being hurled at them. We quickly discovered that setting the difficulty to medium for your first go might not be the best idea, and we were promptly turned into dino-chow. So we went back to the lobby, turned the difficulty down to easy and tried again. This time we were able to hold our own against the horde of angry reptiles bent on human consumption. Well, at least until wave 7.   After we finished playing a few games of survival I found that I craved more, and dino horde was happy to oblige, allowing for an 'open world' mode they dubbed conquest. In this game mode you can choose from one of two huge maps to play on. One in the arctic and one in the recently added plains. When you load this mode up you are presented with a vehicle or two for traversing the world, and a couple generators you can head towards. When you go to one of the generators and turn it on, you begin a very similar wave driven experience as survival mode, however, if you manage to last the ten waves and secure that outpost, you are rewarded with a load of cash, and the opportunity to go work on securing another outpost. I will admit that I do not know what happens if you secure more than one outpost (I saw three, but didn't have the time to play 30+ rounds).   The biggest thing that stands out to me about this game is the fact that the more I play it, the more I discover about it and enjoy it. I have only played two of the twelve (yes, twelve) game modes and already I feel that this game is worth the money they are asking for it. Admittedly it has its share of issues such as no FoV slider, a lack of pertinent help documentation (took us forever to find out how to get more ammo) and a slightly overwhelming number of game modes that have no description. However, even with these things in mind, nothing beats the thrill of fighting a horde of raptors, a t-rex, a stegosaurus, two triceratops, and a deinosuchus all at once in the middle of a rainy night while trying to capture an outpost. I felt like a kid again, and there are so few games these days that give me that thrill and excitement. Definitely give this game a try.
676	0	a	Graphics 4 out of 10 In-game sounds 3 out of 10 Gameplay 6 out of 10 Story N/A Multiplayer 6 out of 10 Price-quality 8 out of 10  Summary-The game is really worth 1$ but don't expect anything fancy.It's poorly optimised and has bugs.It only has multiplayer function.
677	0	a	It's poorly optimized and doesn't look like the screenshots.
4376	1	a	This is what happens if you cross HALO with Jurassic Park. The game is very enjoyable, but farily repetitive. When it went on sale it was 1 dollar, and thats the best dollar I have ever spent on a game. So get out there and strat powning T-Rexes with mechs and tanks!
4378	1	a	A friend just got me this game with the 4 pack, and we hopped right into it.  While this game might be really goofy, its LOADS of fun!  It really does feel alot like halo when you get jeeps, its already like turock because ... Dinos  Highly reccomend 10/10 would buy 4 pack
680	0	a	Single Player: PVE review. For PVP look for another review.  in this, hopefully final, incarnation the game moves into the world of microtransactions. the game is still unplayable in single player (its just multiplayer mode w/o other players, no bots). best if experienced w/ friends for a laugh, the game has no fun factor asside from dying with style.   i bought the 4 pack for 4.99 and i feel ripped off. if your going to support your product w/ microtransactions you need to make it free. i know it was done to avoid login but do the microtransactions come right out of steam wallet? (honest question. i did not have the endurance to explore the store after discovering it)  basically this is the same terrible game it has always been. good for a laugh if in the dollar bin.  i am The Evil Dr. F and i DO NOT recommend this game. (unless you and your hordemates can get it for about a buck)  URGENT UPDATE 7JUN14: Game still has no realistic Single Player even though it boasts of it on catalog page. Game still requires friends and a sense of humor to play. To some extent a willingness to die with style instead of winning is recommended. It STILL has a store.   Updates have made the game more easy to look at (when crippled, or abducted by a pteranodon). Still cannot run and jump at same time (so no bunny hopping).
4380	1	a	Good exiting game where you have to work together with your team mates a lot to survive. Almost like CS but you fight dinos instead of terrorists.
681	0	a	I can't play this game! I had to put myself into it to play just 1 match, frequent crashes, losing connection from hosts, the servers list doesn't load... there are just too many bugs in this game. When I finally got to play... god... The gameplay is messed up! When you shoot a dinosaur they don't feel anything, they don't stop running. They will only when you kill them. The audio of the guns is a mess. If you shoot with an automatic rifle 40% of the shots will be silent because they are too fast... If you enjoy this game is ok! It's just 0.99 cents right now, but don't buy it if you haven't tried it yet. I had enough after 2 games, there are too many bugs and glitches.
4382	1	a	The Metacritic score is a lie!
682	0	a	Are you looking for fun, excitement, adventure, and a one way trip to cool visuals?? Well then go and stare at a ♥♥♥♥ing wall. Better yet go and try to moon a King Kobra while 3 feet from it and stare at the ceiling in a hospital because atleast you'll get a nice view as you are in agonizing pain. Seriously, this game is like what would happen if Halo and Killing Floor made love and decided they had better things to do so they chucked the thing off a cliff. But then it was adopted by the brilliant minds that brought you Ride to Hell: Retribution.
683	0	a	This game is bad
684	0	a	Pros: Uninstalled really quickly  Cons: DOESN'T SUPPORT MY SCREEN RES feels like shooting a water gun Dinos are Op Boring 3gb of waste   Conclusion- Dont buy
685	0	a	I had this phase where i would buy most anything if it was on sale under 5$ on steam, that Phase ended with Orion dino horde, a very poor game that has mediocre visuals, gunplay, and creativity, its no more than a buggy mess that only pumps out enough entertainment to distract you for a few minutes while waitng for your favorite TV show to come on, and once it does, there's no hesitation to turning it off and getting on with your life. The cummulative money system for weapons is a probably the best idea in the game, and it wasn't ever their's, Counter strike had them beat by at least 10 years, and if you like that system, you should go get Counter strike: GO which is a much better game and i highly recommend it. It doesnt hurt to give them this rating what so ever, 3/10
4384	1	a	For the money, you simply can't beat this game. It does come with different game modes, which in my opinion are all awful except for survival, which is a round based game mode where you buy (not with real money) weapons, perks, and go on missions to acquire vehicles that not only increase travel speed, but also come equipped with guns, rockets, and turrets.  Like I said earlier, this is not BF4, or COD Ghosts, but for the money especially when this is on sale, you can't beat it.  *Update* System Specs have increased due to the new arctic update, you can no longer play this with dedicated graphics, you need some sort of GPU. This degrades my opinion of the game slightly, just because the range of viable players has decreased (i.e. I can no longer play this on my laptop, I have to play it on my desktop with my fx 6300 and r9 270x). This does not affect my overall impresssion of the game, this comment is simply in the 'Other Thoughts' section of the review if you are familiar with newegg.
689	0	a	As someone who loves dinosaurs and violence this game is the saddest creation on Steam. Not worth the .99 nor the time to install a free trial.  The game has horrible matchmaking connectivity, match sizes are too small, and invites from friends don't work reliably. The lobby menus are bloated with an obvious cash grab shop and 'look at me' achievements. After finally getting into the game the environments are so empty. Sad textures on bland geometry. The objectives are agonizingly simple, go here, push button, await dinosaurs.  The AI has simple charge maneuvers with little variance. Other game modes offer different playstyles, but those are just as droll. Playing as a dinosaur should be an exciting encounter with you as a 'boss' monster, instead you get mown down in seconds by standard weaponry and vehicles. The bigger dinosaurs available are sluggish and their hit detection leaves you wondering if you're playing on the same map. How did the developers attempt to balance smaller dinosaurs against their totally-not-spartan soldiers? They've strapped 'dino-mite' (oh god this is probably what they called it) onto the back of Compy and Pterodactyls. Orion: Dino Horde is supposed to be a dinosaur game, or at least about dinosaurs, but there are only two decent selections in the multiplayer. It is more rewarding to be a faceless marine than the game's namesake. I would call that a failure. Speaking of 'original' protagonists. Models, animations, and even the physics feel so similar to Halo titles it is like the budget was spent paying Bungie's royalties, as if they could afford them. The guns are such obvious plagiarisms they appear to have been stripped from Halo 2 and altered in the simplest ways. Round a barrel here, recolor there, different gun! The worst example is the tank. It is the Scorpion from Halo shamelessly reused. Orion: Dino Horde is a decent concept, horribly executed. The developer must be trying some last ditch effort to squeeze money out of the dying player-base. I've found out there is another game in the works, an open world dino warfare game. I can only hope that they've learned from their mistakes and attempt to make something different from Dino Horde.   Despite all that I've said I did play this game, I did laugh at it with friends, but I still feel shorted. I spent .99 on this game and I wish I could have it back. It is that bad.  TL:DR = One of the worst things you could play.
4386	1	a	Damn Good to Play this game
692	0	a	One of the worst games I have played
693	0	a	A game I bought because it was at such a low price, (Like a pound or something) I knew I couldn't of been getting anything great, but I excpected to get some enjoyment out of it.  Where to start?  First off, the entire game is a horde mode, so the game is essentially a side feature of most games trying to be a full game.  The controls are okay, I can figure out how to move and use weapons.  The graphics quality is alright, it's nothing at all special.  The dinosaur models/textures are kind of out-of-place looking, they look a bit cartoony.  Whenever you headshot a raptor, it's head explodes, and it looks awful.  The game's lighting is overall very bland and reminds me of when my ENB for Fallout: New Vegas broke.  I went down, it told me 'Fight to survive', there were no dinosaurs around me, so I died.  Gunplay is fairly weak.  The weapons don't feel real, they still sound like a gentleman coughing on an operahouse.  Voice acting is okay I guess.  A wide variety of three classes, wow, so many classes to choose from, so hard to decide.  Overall this doesn't live up to the reviews shown in the trailer at all, but then again, did you really excpect that?  So what are terms for buying it on?  If you're really really into dinosaur games, this might be for you, if you're not, well then why are you even here?  Overall, boring game, nothing to keep me in it.
694	0	a	Same game, different name. Would not recommend if you're looking for something different from ORION.
4388	1	a	It's a good game. You have the Asault clas there you ee jatpack on. The suport clas, reco class each class has more weapons and contain some wapeons can you buy for each class.Thit is a nice game, Its so cheap for it.  i give it an 8/10.
4390	1	a	This game is so much ♥♥♥♥ing fun, I would recommend any one to buy it, especially now it's only .99€ Driving in a buggy being chased by a ♥♥♥♥ing T-Rex is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing epic.  9/10
4392	1	a	Some insane, crazy fun! Just a little bit unpolished but still fantastic!
4394	1	a	holy ♥♥♥♥ are you kidding me this is the best ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game i ever i did play
4396	1	a	dont wana make a review for this now ima go play it
696	0	a	It trys so hard to be a good game but fails so bad
4398	1	a	Halo meets cod:zombies meets Jurassic Park. would play again!
4400	1	a	This game isn't anywhere near as awful as I expected given reviews. It's not really good either, but it's a great way to kill an hour or two with friends. Like Killing Floor but with dinosaurs and vehicles.
4402	1	a	When I first played this game it was nothing special. The gameplay was average, but fairly fun with friends. Today the game was updated which added a various number of things. The added rain and day and night cycle allows for more depth and realism to the point where i feel like i am actually in the arctic fighting dinosaurs in real life. This game now makes games such as Battlefield 4 and Crysis 3 look like arcade shooters. 9/11 would bang and buy again.
4404	1	a	That first gameplay video that got me wanting to get a single copy of the game, but it was the hats that got me to get the 4 pack, well that and the price was just about 1 free game lol. Well at $0.99 it had me sold at Hats.  Edit: The game is now free. There is no reason for you to not just play it for however long you want. The game is a lot of fun but just not polished at all.
4406	1	a	Halo style (and vehicles) + Open World levels + Dinosaurs + Killing Floor gameplay...  it's not perfect by any means, but for those who don't take things too seriously, it's a fun time killer with friends.
4408	1	a	Guns, Vehicals, and Dinos. Awsome!
697	0	a	This game would be good if it didn't suck so much.
4410	1	a	Jet-packs, dinosaurs and sci fi ♥♥♥♥? literally my favorite wave-style fps.
4412	1	a	Remember playing with those plastic dinosaur figures as a kid? Apparently the Devs of this game did. If you want to relive your childhood this game is for you. Grab a shotgun and blast some dinosaurs till you’ve had your fill of prehistoric carnage. Solid mechanics make this game easy to pick up for anyone who is familiar with FPS games. Various game modes and a variety of dinosaurs and guns make for some fun game play that keeps you engaged. Add some friends and it’s even better. Some of the upgrades and HUD elements can be confusing at first and currently there isn’t a large player base. Overall I'd recommend it, especially if you can get some friends to play as well.
699	0	a	I could recommend it, if something was done about the dinosaurs. Seriously, I'm higly doubting they did any modelling. It looks like a gif placed on your screen and they run very... weird? I can't explain, try if you want it, they did a good job on all the rest! I just can't get over the fact how crappy and ugly those dinosaurs are.
700	0	a	I had a nice day today. I had a above average day at school today, and I came home to see that there was a free game on steam. Me and my buddy were very excited to see that the game was about dinosaurs, as there are very few of those today. So my friend and I said, 'why not?', and dove in.  After an hour of downloading, our hearts were racing. Thoughts of running wild as a gigantic dinosaur, eating anything in our path, running the jungle so to speak. We click 'play', and off we are into the world of ORION: Dino Horde.  Never in my life have I wanted to kill myself. I am one of the most postive people I know, and this game made me the most depressed, dark, and angry person on the planet. My blood was boiling at the sight of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dinosaur animations, and terrible gameplay. I am writing this with my neck in a noose, and plan on hanging myself after I post this review.   God speed.
4414	1	a	The metascore is misleading, it's from the old build This game is awesome and frenetic Recommended
702	0	a	Not necessarily bad, just not really amazing. It seemed like after you've played one wave you've played them all.
4416	1	a	A split between Halo &amp; Primal Carnage. Great Game!!
4418	1	a	Epic and fun! dirt cheap!
4420	1	a	This is orion dino horde a game where you have to fend off several waves of dinosaurs that want to eat you. Ok so the game has some bugs and glitches but every game has them and ♥♥♥♥ the haters at metacritic. This game has changed alot since it came out. Oh and did i tell you that you can shoot dinosaurs with tanks and jets. Anyways i give this game an 8/10
706	0	a	The developer was banned from the Steam forums if that tells you anything.
4422	1	a	Awesome game, recommend getting it. still a few problems but overal great
4424	1	a	Hi there i want to start by saying this game is great. Its a survival game that you shoot dinos in and is unplayable i would recommend this to all who like to waste money.
708	0	a	Trash.
4426	1	a	This is the best game ever it has 4 pvp modes and 1 pve mode and there will be free title updates (dlc packs) in artic dlc (dlc pack 3) conquest is returning! Man i missed that mode and i played it since orion dino beatdown
4428	1	a	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=428IyxSfsls     10/10
711	0	a	Toxic Community:  I thought hey, it's only $.99 so I'll check it out. The gameplay is great, graphics are okay. But it's the people you play with that make the game what it is. Within my first five games. I was consistently told to gtfo. If you're wondering why the recent reviews are 'mixed.' Then you might be part of the problem. Not the experience I was expecting out of a dollar purchase.
712	0	a	The metacritic score is misleading? Really developers? REALLY? How hard are you trying to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t yourselves now? This game is an unfinished pile of horse ♥♥♥♥. If anything the metacritic score is spot on. The servers don't work, the solo game is impossible to play, and the game does little to nothing to tell you how to play. The key mappings aren't the best and in all honesty the game itself just isnt finished. You put too much time into how pretty the game looks and not enough time into the gameplay. And I just love how all those 'Quotes' in the trailer give credit to no one. Who are they from? The developers. The funniset thing is I played this for free! Not only did they sell it at 93% off but I still have 4 days left to try out this utter garbage! This game is awful and I cannot recommend it.
4430	1	a	Ate dinosaur egg and died pregnant with them 20/10
713	0	a	This is an abomination of a video game worse than the holocaust wouldnt download it again if it became permently free.
4432	1	a	Killing Floor meets Halo meets Primal Carnage. Waved based defense vs dinos with veichles! If it sounds awesome it's because it is. It's a pretty solid game and fun with friends and an abosulte steal at $.99 which is a price it tends to sell at from time to time.
4434	1	a	u kill dinos      thats cool
718	0	a	Everything about this game is terrible, down to the real money customization store. If there has really been so much improvement since Dino Beatdown, I don't want to think about how awful THAT was. But really, renaming the game was just a cheap ploy to escape the awful reviews it had deserved upon its original release.  A generous 2/10
719	0	a	Fans of Jurassic Park and Gamers alike have been waiting for years to find a halfway decent Dinosaur video game! To see all of their favorite dinosaurs from when they were children to come to life in a dynamic world with beautiful visuals and emmersive gameplay! Now, after all this time...  THEY'RE! STILL! WAITING!  Instead, play a terrible game with badly rendered character models, horrible animations and ridiculously flawed, generic combat!   Witness a game experience like no other! The development crew spent Days! Hours! Minutes! Seconds making this game! Making sure it was absolutly perf- *laughter* Sorry, oh man, I couldn't do that one with a straight face. But seriously, F**k this game. xD   Experience all of the gamemodes that you've played a million times in every other first person shooter on the planet, but this time, with maybe 6 dinosaurs that you could kill with one shot!   You're going to buy this because you can play dinosaurs? WELL WE'VE GOT ONE GAMEMODE FOR YOU.     Thats it. One Gamemode.    Starring:  Discount Multiplayer Announcer voice from Halo.  Awkward Running.  Lag.  More lag!  Bugs!  Clipping through walls!  Clipping through other walls!  Mediocre soundtracks!  Square rocks.  Invisivble bullets!  Invisible bullets!  INVISIBLE GOSH-DANG BULLETS.           Dayum, and we thought Hunter Blade was bad!
720	0	a	This game is the worst catastrophe since Chernobyl.
721	0	a	This game is a turd. A giant, messy Dino-turd. Even my kids hate it, and they LOVE dinosaurs. Nothing else to say.
722	0	a	Why is this game getting good reviews?
723	0	a	Terrible game. Mosters attacking you in between waves, no time to do anything in between waves, not even close to a smooth game.  1/10 would definately ask for my £1 refund
4436	1	a	THIS GAME IS SUPER FUN. I NEED MORE PEOPLE TO PLAY WITH IT. BEST $2.99 SPENT.
725	0	a	&gt;DO NOT BUY &lt; even when it hits 0,99 DONT BUY STEAM SHOULD HAVE A DEL BUTTON FOR THIS ONE
726	0	a	I cant believe people paid money for this
727	0	a	Not even worth a dollar. Leave it to die.
728	0	a	Dinosaurs that walk on air. 10/10
4438	1	a	This Game Is Amzing !!!! A True Testament Of What Hard Work And Dedication Can Accomplish !!!!!
4440	1	a	Its like jurassic park without electrical fences and space guns.
4442	1	a	Guns+Jetpacks+Armored Mechabots+Dinosaurs= A ♥♥♥♥ load of fun! :) havent even tried co-op yet cause my 'friends' have yet to accept their cheap ♥♥♥ gifts but this game is totally recommended if you are looking for the above. And the graphics are pretty damn impressive for such a little game :)
4444	1	a	From my personal experience this game is awesome and provides lot of fun, especially if u play it with friends, To be honest game needs improvements and fixes but that dosen't mean that u cant have great experience of fun. I recommend this game to everyone. Just lover a bar of perfection for games. I've played this game for 23h and I love it.
729	0	a	This game is pretty repetive. I can not see anyone enjoying this unless they are playing with friends. And only enjoy it for a day at the most.
4446	1	a	Really great game to play with friends
4448	1	a	Used a Lightsaber to kill a dinosaur 10/10
4450	1	a	I was taunting my friends and a dinosaur picked me up and dropped me from the sky to kill me
4452	1	a	You shoot a f*ckload of dinosaurs. That is the game.
4454	1	a	This game is a hillariously buggy mess yet I wouldn't change a thing about it. Best $.99 I spent in a long time.
4456	1	a	This game is so freaking fun! There's an eight year old deep inside me that's jumping for joy after playing this game! 
4458	1	a	too many orions 8/10
4460	1	a	Really fun game. Especially if you find a couple of friends to play it with. For a low price, this game will give you a couple of hours of fun :D
4462	1	a	This game is full of Bexes that just walk around you and derp. Some of them also gets stuck under tanks and makes stupid Bex noises! It's focking derp as hell.  Otherwise, pretty good co-op experience
4464	1	a	T-rex ran at me and flipped my car off the map, gotta get a new one.  3/10 no more cars left rip car 2014
4466	1	a	This game is the best worst game I have ever played. It has such a bad starting menu and no tutorial and it runs like ♥♥♥♥ for average PCs and who ever did the sounds makes me wana laugh my ♥♥♥ off. A T-Rex is ear deffaning from miles away on the lowest volume possible, while a 44 magnum in your hand being shot sounds like a silnced bb gun to a def old man. But for some reason this is just to fun. The first hour or so of actual gameplay and not trying to figure out how to join a friend is proboly the most fun ive had in a multiplayer experince in a long time.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0h-af9TT75A  Buy this game, its by no means a 15 dollar game, but its 1 dollar, and if someone can play it with you, you will have a great time.
4468	1	a	I got eaten by a T-rex and got a achievement for it.  10/10
4470	1	a	Definately worth it, especially since it is on sale. Ton's of game types, great graphics. Don't listen to the meta score.
4472	1	a	fighting ♥♥♥♥ing dinosaurs. awesome!
4474	1	a	♥♥♥♥♥ies game ever made just buy it
4476	1	a	ORION:Dino Horde. this game has a great potential in the future and right now is still a good game. The dinosaurs are not to overpowerd nor are the guns. The vheicals all have thier weaknesses and strengths. and also the classes have been well thought out and put together well so that when all three work together it is a good team. But one of the main things this game has to offer is the community it contains. The community is one of the nicest you can find, they help each other and most of them are playing to survive as well. So make sure you get this game, come join in and have alot of fun 
4478	1	a	This is the best cheap game on steam.
4480	1	a	Not bad worth the 53 cents
4482	1	a	First of all, if you are looking for a AAA blockbuster title, better start clicking the 'back' arrow. Go into this game, just like the TV show 'Pretty Little Liars,' with a lack of expectations. This game is FUN! If you have a few friends, you might want to take out a loan and purchase the 4 pack for only a few bucks. I got it for around a dollar and have played both online and solo. Other than a can of petroleum jelly, what else could you buy that is this much fun for the price? Not a whole lot. Now beware, there are some bugs here and there but that is only part of the experience! If you would like to see some gameplay, here's a video!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reVhVGjRubI 
4484	1	a	I like it.  8/10  Cheap fun, buy it!
4486	1	a	I haven't even played it, and I like it
4488	1	a	If you like ♥♥♥♥ things like me, you will love this game.  Totally worth it for 79p  Great with friends  Loads of free content added all the time  Buy it, even if you dont enjoy it all you wasted was the cost of a mars bar. If you would rather have a mars bar than this game you are a fat ♥♥♥♥.
4490	1	a	this is an amazing game to play with friends its funny for a laugh and not to be taken to seriously. I am completely hooked
4492	1	a	If you are playing with your friends it's good but ıf you are playing with your friends.
4494	1	a	buy it its only $0.99 and insanly fun!
4496	1	a	Modern Human Technology vs Colossal Primitive Lizard was a best war ever!!! But I more like old name: 'Orion: Dino Beatdown'
4498	1	a	Make sure your FOV doesn't get set to something less than 90 as mine did, and the game feels great. For some reason it defaulted to a low FOV on my widescreen monitor and looked like crap until I changed it to 100.   Other than the FOV setting being off, this game is tons of fun for a price that is unbelievable.
4500	1	a	A sci-fi, dinosaur, fps for only 79p; what's not to like? But seriously, this game has everything from character customization to tanks vs t-rex's, I love it!
4502	1	a	Fun little dinosaur game that can be a ton of fun with friends. Would reccomend it if you love accomplishing insane feats such as killing a T-rex with a rocket launcher. Satisfaction garenteed!
4504	1	a	I have had a lot of fun playing this game. I sometimes get the COD zombies feel when facing off against countless waves with numerous hordes of dinos but it takes me back to the closest thing i'd ever like to see to a combination between jurassic park and cod zombies. Heaps of guns, augments, perks and achievements to mess around with, game is worth its weight in gameplay despite lacking much singleplayer function
4506	1	a	Fun game for a 4 people lobby,i played it with couple of friends and we had a good laugh and a nice game,killin the dinosaurs is funny,basically it is all same like l4d but with much lower graphics!
4508	1	a	nice mashup of a lot of familiar weapons. Good coop
4510	1	a	This game is great except the controls make me feel like i might be having a stroke
4512	1	a	Needed more Dinosaurs using Jetpacks.
4514	1	a	this game is alot of fun if you like team fortress 2 but also wanna shoot some dinosaurs instead of other people!!!!!!! who doesn't want to play an FPS that kills dinosaurs!!! the only down side is that there seems to be lots of bug problems. so get this game and kill some dinosaurs cuz well its dinosaurs!
4516	1	a	Best game ever 11/10 played it for days
4518	1	a	OMFG! This game is better than I thought. Got it for $4 in the summer sale and just love it :D
4520	1	a	This game is hours and hours of fun! With a group of friends of even by yourself! How many dinos have you killed lately?
4522	1	a	If Microsoft will not bring Halo back to the PC, Im glad we have ORION:Dino Horde  Halo + Dinosaurs = 10/10  Hours of fun for tha whole family :-)
4524	1	a	Its got decent graphics, fun time killer especially if you get it on sale.
4526	1	a	It's silly, it's weird, it's fun.   I killed a T-Rex in a mech, then got picked up by a pterodactyl only to shoot myself free and jetpack away.   For a dollar, how can you beat this game.
4528	1	a	if nothing else it is just fun times....
4530	1	a	Hold on to ya butts!
4532	1	a	A poor mans Free 2 Play.
4534	1	a	Good game Though i did buy it of Dino horde that was like 15 Bucks?
4536	1	a	This game is woth 0,50 cents, wich is what I payed for it.
4538	1	a	This game is very fun and entertaining. I enjoy the battle of the T-Rex
4540	1	a	The graphics remind me of Borderlands. Very fun, and is better than some of my other games that cost way more. Def a game everyone should pick up and try.
4542	1	a	Who can make a game with dinosaurs and jet packs lame? Spiral games studios thats who. You can get more value from you money by lighting it on fire 
4544	1	a	This game has its bugs and the KI is ultra stupid. Anyway, it makes a lot of fun to fly around and kill badass dinos!
4546	1	a	Good game, Worth it for $1.49. (On sale). Very fun multiplayer
4548	1	a	yes :D its good
732	0	a	This is the worst game since I played Apocalyptica back in 2003. I don't understand how it is worth more than 10 cents. It should be free, or the developers should pay me money to compensate for my suffering.
4550	1	a	Great for Dino lovers
4552	1	a	9/11 Ran into a base as Compy shouting JIHAD!
4554	1	a	this is a great game when it comes to survival mode and could expand greatly i find its like a killing floor halo mix i bought the cryo blade which is like a katna and sliced at the t rex and just rampaged whiile my teamates distracted it and it was all slow mow it was amazing
733	0	a	God awful game. Visuals are worse than the original Halo CE. No working servers. No instructions or comprehendible tutorial. The shooting feels like a trackball arcade shooter with ♥♥♥♥ stuck in buttons.  Do not buy this game. It's not even worth 99 cents.
4556	1	a	Fun game to play with good friends when you just want to screw around and have a bit of fun. Other than that its not that great of a game if you're playing by yourself.
4558	1	a	Hours of fun ,Buy a four pack for yourself and your mates
4560	1	a	For $1 this first-person shooter is certainly fun to play with friends. It truly shines in its Survival game mode which involves you and your team protecting your base's generator from dinosaurs as well as protecting each other from them. You can play as dinosaurs in other game modes as well. You have different abilities, weapons and vehicles. The vehicle combat is okay, but I would recommend sticking with the Assault class and its jetpack instead. Sure the servers' latency may drop at times, but it is still fun to play. My favorite feature is how in arctic levels your visor actually slowly freezes from the cold. THAT is neat. I just love shooting dinosaurs and for $1 that is an experience I'd pay for.
4562	1	a	it a dollar and its functional
4564	1	a	10/10 BEST GRAPHics best grameplay best dinosaur shoot 9/10 GraphicS AND GAMEPLAY PRETTY good 9/9 game game gAME GAME GAME GAme 10/10 worst game ive ever played remove it from earth before i shoot myself in my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ eye
4566	1	a	I got thrown by a giant Spinosaurus, into a rock, then I died. My friend became Rambo and went on a murder spree to bring me back to life in the next wave.   Best co-op on steam.   10/10
4568	1	a	NEWS FLASH! This game is DINO BEATDOWN...yes, the overpriced, broken, glitchy piece of software that was released almost 2 YEARS AGO. For those that bought the game back then, you've probably noticed it has a new name...and that it actually works now! This game finally offers what they promised at the point of sale. Is it perfect? Nope. Is it worth trying out again? Absolutely. And...for .99 cents, you can invite some friends to try it out with you, too.
4570	1	a	hey game creators, can you put in a new dino? carnotaurus please? its in primal carnage anyway it was medium size and would charge things with its horns. and maybe could you put in ankylosaurus and allosaurus? if you can put in one of these i would really be pleased. thanks!  -icerunner
4572	1	a	I got 4 hours game play out of it so far and im planning to play more so I would say it's definitely worth $1
4574	1	a	This game is great but not for the $14.99 it costs. If you were to buy this you should wait till it gets crazy cheap like how I did and got it for around .99 cents.
4576	1	a	This game is a LOT of fun. If you like fast paced run and gun this is the game for you. I mean come on its .99 Cents, what are you waiting for?
4578	1	a	For .99 cents you really can't beat this game. I've payed $60 for games that were less fun and less complete.
4580	1	a	Good game despite the look of it at first
4582	1	a	i bought this game when it was $20 dollars im not gonna lie i was upset but now it has improved greatly
4584	1	a	Kudos to the developers. When I bought it game 2 years ago, I felt that it was meh, and left it alone after playing for an hour. Today, I thought, 'might as well try it again' and played it once more. It has improved vastly and is way more fun the way it is now. It's one of the best games FPS I've ever played so far and I had more fun in it than many other AAA titles. Definitely worth the $0.99 I spent on it. You should definitely give it a go!
4586	1	a	I don't know about this game in the past, but right now in 2015 it is a blast. Seriously, it is some of the most fun I have had with gaming in a long time. IT IS A GAME WHERE I CAN JET PACK INTO THE SKY AND ROCKET LAUNCH A T-REX! FUN! This game is all about fun, and it damn sure is. Highly reccomended.
4588	1	a	such a funny dinosaur game  and its only a dollar...  NICE!  10/10
4590	1	a	This game is really entertaining when playing conquest mode with a couple of friends. I like the way classes are able to cooperate and bring down everything that swarms around. Especially T-Rex, lol!
4592	1	a	Fun game to play with friends.
4594	1	a	Seems like an alright game if you want to relax and shoot things, I dont see why people are saying it is so bad, because I think it is just an average online fps really.
4596	1	a	Cheap game with great EXP :)
4598	1	a	A philosphy of gaming for all you poor souls. $1 should means at least 1 hour of gameplay. I spent $0.99 and got some little bit of time over 13. #worth? Not really. But kinda.
4600	1	a	Orion Prelude is a good cheap game to have fun with friends and if you like achievements then don't worry. You will get an achievement for everything , even for just pausing the game.
4602	1	a	It's 99 cents for what would be the equivalent of a 15$+ game. (though I probably wouldn't have bought it or tried it out then.) I didn't expect much at first, but fact of the matter is the game is pretty damn good.  There are many servers in the lobby, and if needed you can start your own. The game itself has enough enemies to keep it interesting, and graphics-wise is just good enough. The gameplay is such that teamwork is more or less encouraged, though there's still competition at times over the various vehicles and machines that can be found across the map.  The game is just fun overall. I have a minor complaint (which is probably noobish) about the player GUI and being unsure where the healthbar is, but apart from that I think it's a pretty solid package for 0.99$, and more than worth the price. Additionally, the community seems nice. That's always an added bonus.
4604	1	a	Even though it runs like garbage on my computer It's still fun
4606	1	a	Many hours after playing this...untill, YOU notice THAT IT IS ONL'Y 1$ WITH SO MANY REVIEWS AND YOUR SO AMAZED. 
4608	1	a	This game is really good for .99 cents.
4610	1	a	Fun to play with friends but gets repetative fast.
4612	1	a	This game is amazing!
4614	1	a	This game is quite the bomb digity and I enjoy playing it all dayyyyy
4616	1	a	Not the best graphics, but quick and fun to play - if you like shooting small, big and huge dinos! :-)
4618	1	a	I've been holding off on writing a review for this game for quite a long time. I played it a few months ago, and, admittedly, it was less than stellar. If you were to ask me about the game at that point in time, I would have said it was garbage.  However, I don't know what happened, but this game is suddenly incredibly fun. Sure, the dinosaurs are kind of janky, and it's definitely too challenging to play on your own (bring some friends!), but there's something charming about it. It's just a loveable game. Quite fun, too!  I definitely recommend that anybody considering getting this game should get it. (At the time that I'm writing this, it's on sale for $0.99 for like the 5th time, so I doubt this will happen again, but it may.)
4620	1	a	Would never have thought id enjoy this game, but it was free to play so i thought id give it a try. 12 hours of gameplay later and i guess you can say im addicted! Definitely a must play. Worth way more than $14.00
4622	1	a	Best FPS game i have played in sooo long. Don't let the price decieve you, this game is probably better than half the 60$ games being released
4624	1	a	The best pew pew for your bucks.
4626	1	a	Personally I thought it wasn't going to be the best game for a dollar, but I read some other reviews and DID NOT go by the meta game score because thats dumb as hell, I mean why not try it out eh? its only a dollar lol. But I really enjoy it, its fun, challenging, entertaining, a lot of customization. Fun game all around IMO. 8/10
4628	1	a	this is a fun game. def worth the 3 dollars i paid for it. like another post say's in some cases it better than most high dollar games out there. its a fun little run and gun shooter. dont expect anything more than that. get it to just mindlessly kill dinos with your friends.
4630	1	a	This game while receiving many bad reviews over the interwebs, has proven to be quite enjoyable and i plan on spending many hours with friends slaying dinos with high powered weaponry.
4632	1	a	10/10 MLG AS F**K!  Only played 20 minutes.
4634	1	a	bought this game a year ago got aids  played this game today didn't get aids  7.8/10- needs more water
4636	1	a	ya buy if u want good and low priced game
4638	1	a	A lot of fun, recomend for co-op fans and all FPS / Dino Lovers!
4640	1	a	worth the money.
4642	1	a	Pretty fun and big game and it was only 0.39 $  I think its totally worth a buy!!!
4644	1	a	Stabbed a friend in the ♥♥♥ when he was playing as a tricerotops.   10/10 IGN GOTY
4646	1	a	This game is what Jurassic park would have been if the main cast were replaced by soldiers with futuristic weapons. Part FPS, part tower defence, part dinosaur massacre!
4648	1	a	ORION: Prelude is a FPS that, at first sight, reminds one of Halo. It is class-based, with each class leveling up separately. Classes only dictate the special ability your character has, and you can switch them at any time between games. Assault has a jetpack, Recon can jump higher and has cloaking abilities, Support can heal and revive easier. You can further customize your experience by buying weapons in the match (there are some two-three dozen weapons) with credits earned from killing dinosaurs, and leveling up a certain class allows you to set some of those as starting weapons, removing the need to buy them. The weapons are pretty diverse; pistols, SMGs, different kinds of assault rifles, snipers, shotguns, there's even a lightsaber and a plasma bow. You can also use up your credits to buy Perks, improving your ability to fly (increase duration, speed, cut fuel recovery time in half etc.), walk faster, even give you lifesteal. There is also an abundance of game modes, around 7 if I recall correctly, and a variety of maps. Pros: +statisfying graphics with a range of weather effects +a lot of drastically different, big maps +vehicles and mechs +sound +a vast number of weapons +nicely done perks +a good number of achievements +a lightsaber-only free-for-all +the dev team actually listens to its fans +really worth it for 0.99€ Cons: -the classes kinda lack balance (in Survival, Assault is the only class worth using) -in need of a good tutorial -prone to exploits (set the Prehistoric difficulty to the max, so you get the most XP, pick Assault and fly on a rock, it's enough that you kill 4-5 dinosaurs and die to get insta level 15)  All in all, the game isn't perfect, but it's a lot of fun. If you intend on buying it, get a 4-pack and gift it to your friends and then play together. For 0.99€, I'd recommend this game to anyone.
4650	1	a	soooo much fun, controller support is great game works for low end pc's. its also only a dollar so i highly recommend
4652	1	a	This game's reviews are all over the place. Let's just get something straight. Other than having not enough maps this game runs smoothly, looks decent (on ultra) and doesn't crash (if your pc is good xD) I'd easily give this game an 8/10 for just general enjoyment. Anyone who has done survival and gotten bored just do conquest. Even though I have replayed conquest it still is fun each time.  :)
4654	1	a	dollar game dollar fun  unexpectedly fun (with friends)
4656	1	a	Its not the money worth!!!!!!
4658	1	a	I think that it is interesting, and brought something a little different to the table, and I TOTALLY love dinosaurs, but its graphics aren't very good. Hell, that could be my computer. I would still recommend playing it though. Maybe it'll be a better experience for you!
4660	1	a	This game is really funny to play with friends. nothing you need to take serious :D
4662	1	a	An okay game for 99 cents, though it doesnt feel anywhere near complete
4664	1	a	FUN!! EXCITING! I can play a dino or have a good choice of weapons and vehicles to hunt and kill them :) Oh and the best part is I can play with a jet pack!!! :D Wooo Hooo!!
4666	1	a	cool game for u thats want survival game
4668	1	a	The game is good. Not absolutely perfect but also Its only just 1$. And I think for that price this game is Amazing.  Its one of the most fun Fps I have played.  The game is a little buggy but thats another problem.
4670	1	a	Pretty sweet simplistic game. Excellent for low powered computers n min game resources. Also its history is hilarious for using the steam system like an iTunes top trending chart. 5/7 perfect game. Would play again
4672	1	a	No i do not recommend this game, but yolo its ♥♥♥♥ing awsome
4674	1	a	this game is great! its a mix of Halo, black ops (zombie;deathmatch) and a little bit of Nosgoth. if you are hestitating to buy it, its like someone offers you a diamond for 1$: just take it. its not worth the money, this game is worth even more!!!! ps: if you realyy dont like it you can still refund it.  its the bestgame
4676	1	a	(Me): Goes with the recon class becasue of it's stealth ability on survival to repair the generator. (Friends): Goes every class apart from recon. Generator goes down, i stealth past all the dinos and repair it, stealth runs out.........get mauled by dinosaurs.....dies.......generator goes down again.......loses survival.........11/10 would go recon again.
4678	1	a	It has its problems,.. You can't grumble at £0.79... Good banter.... 11/10 would get eaten by a T-Rex again.
4680	1	a	Fantastic! I play this more than most games in my library.
4682	1	a	Really good game, worth playing co-op with friends, steam puts up the server for you so no need to use your own local network. Really funm, good graphics and on and on, recommended (:
4684	1	a	I have played this for a few hours and I am willing to say that I want to play more.  For this picetag, it was way more fun then I expected.  Don't get me wrong, there is still a lot of work to be done on this game, but you can not beat the 1 euro price tag.  PROS: -Tons of people online. -It's a game about shooting dinosaurs. -Vehicles are very cool. -Controls are intuitive and easy to understand. This is one of those games that doesn't need a tutorial. -1 euro. Cheap enough to try out without feeling ripped off if you don't like it.  CONS: -Menus feel unfinished / buggy. -Vehicles are incredibly overpowered. Especially the flying ones, as dinosaurs have little to no anti-air. -Not enough feedback to see if you hit or not, you notice this especially when you play as the dinosaurs. -Weapons could need more 'umph'.  I would not recommend you buy this at full price, but with a discount you can't go wrong with Dino Horde.
4686	1	a	It cured my cancer
4688	1	a	Orion Prelude is a FPS shooter with both online and singleplayer. There is no story just pure action. So if you are sick and tired of zombies? Want to hunt dionsaurs? This is the game for you.   Slaughter  mode is a survival mode with no base generator to protect. For every 25 kills you get a reward to unlock further weapons to help you killing further dinos. There is no shop in this mode. There is a leaderboard to compare your results. You will as in all gamemode in this game level up your characters to unlock perks, weapons, cosmetic skins and more.  My personal favourite is  Survival  mode wich is a bit different. You have to protect your base generator from being destroyed. Dinosaurs will come in waves and for each kill you will earn money that you can use to buy weapons, perks that will make your life alot easier. Each wave gets harder and harder with bigger dinos attacking. You will also unlock objectives that will give you veichles.  This game includes so many gamemodes and maps that probarly any player will find their personal favourite. The game is quite grindy. It will take alot of hours to unlock character levels.  If you have some friends to play with, this game can be really fun for a game on weekends. So grab a few copies to them as well. Note that you will still level up when playing singleplayer modes. Big plus for that!...    Some thoughts for the devs:     I wish you did what others do and make it more rewarding to play for each turn. I know this is no Call of Duty but rewarding on screen and with unlockables will encourage more gametime.   Please make it more rewarding.    A cosmetic rewards page showing badges what you have unlcoked. I prefer badges/medals instead of just statistics page as it will encourage me to continue playing further to unlock further badges.   Look on competive games why they keep getting players comming back.     End words:    Still I have loads of fun in the new Prelude version. And frankly i have been playing more alone than online. Its a game i can play in short bursts or longer with friends. I keep comming back but as said some thing to reward us would defo benefit this game alot. Adding some human bots to the TDM or FFA maps to kill would defo keep me comming back even more. Sometimes you just wanna kill something else than a dino. ;)    Review Score:     GFx 8,5 SFx 6,5  (Music gets repeative after a while, some more tracks wouldnt hurt)  Gameplay 8-10   I have played both the old and new version and i must say it has grown into me. Prelude is alot better in any aspect. GFx is nice, SFx is spot on, Gameplay is easy and fun. I will gladly recommend it.  BUY IT!.. 
4690	1	a	It boots up :)
4692	1	a	Good with friends but needs more depth.
4694	1	a	Addictive gameplay!!!!!!!!!!!
4696	1	a	The best game you can get for only 1€.
4698	1	a	Great game but I think the devs could have just kept on improving this game (like optimization) instead of making a new sequel. However, I got to hand it to them for making such an impressive comeback of this game. Especially fun with friends.
4700	1	a	I think it's a fun game. Most of the problems with this were upon release and not long after but now it seems there is not much wrong with it. I've played 12hrs so far and recommend this for people who's ears tingle at the idea of using jet-packs whilst killing dinosaurs or stomping 'round nomming on humans as a dinosaur.  The early reviews of this are now oudated as this has gone through a few years of updates and adding content. I feel that people should re-consider their bad reviews at it's release. I see this as a cheaper alternative of primal carnage (and could be cheaper). It's generally a fun game but people just seem to over-anylize and focus on the bad which is a terrible shame. I hope to see more games like this (without the controversy would be nice).
737	0	a	This game İs not fun it looks fun but its not you just cant do anything fun. The dinos are pretty crappy and the classes are not interesting. I would have never bought this game if it wasnt on a steam sale.
4702	1	a	Really good for the price. And it has dinosaurs.
4704	1	a	I bought this game when it first came out and everyone hated it. I've always like it but that being said I've always enjoyed wave survival games. I think for a dollar this game is a steal for a dollar and definitely worth a play with a couple friends. I bouth it for twenty way back then and I've definitely got my money's worth out of it. Great developer too, they've been updating and refining it for years since release at no cost.
4706	1	a	BEST Game.
4708	1	a	It's rough. It's buggy. It runs like crap. The resolution is grainy, the music is repetitive, an you always, ALWAYS lose connection at the most horrible times. But you know what? It's only ONE freaking dollar. And for that one dollar, you will get some of the rootinest, tootinest, dino-blasting fun ever seen in a video game.  There are only a handful of different game modes, most of which I honestly haven't tried. The tiny bit I've experienced of the PVP was terrible. Unfun, frustrating, and faaaaaar outclassed by pretty much every other multiplayer FPS ever made. But really, who plays this game for the PVP? It's all about those dinos, mayn. And wow, are the dinos fun.  The two game modes I play the most often, Conquest and Survival, pit you and of team of up to 5 other players/bots as you fight to defend your power generator from hordes of ravenous prehistoric monstrosities. There's no story. There's no explanation for why the herbivores and carnivores are working together and not eating each other. But, honestly, this game doesn't NEED a story. Just don't think too hard and shoot dinos. It's awesome.   The gunplay is quite smooth and incredibly satisfying. Blast a raptor's head with a shotgun and it freakin' EXPLODES, splattering bits of brain all over your stylish uniform. Drive a tank up to a T-rex's butt and fire a super-high powered explosive round directly into its crotch, obliterating it mere moments before it's about to devour your teammate. So awesome!   The best parts of this game are the moments you experience while playing, these little things that stick with you long after you turn off your computer. That time I leaped out of my helicopter to revive my fallen teammate, getting him to his feet and out of the way of a Spinosaurus before flying away and unleashing a barrage of missiles into its side. That time I used my flamethrower to keep an entire swarm of raptors away from the generator while my team respawned. That time I cleared an entire group of dinos using only a knife. It's these things that make you feel like an unstoppable lizard-slayin' hero.  TL;DR, this game has a lot of issues, but it's only one dollar and you could easily get at least 20 hours out of it at the minimum. Really, really good fun.  8/10    As a unrepentant dinosaur nerd, there are a few things I have problems with in this game's portrayal of its prehistoric creatures. First of all, they put two pterosaurs into the game, a rhamphorhynchus and a pteranodon. They called the rhamphorhynchus a rhamphorhyncus (which I have much respect for), but then they went and called the pteranodon a pterodactyl? What?? They also refer to them as dinosaurs, which they are not, they're actually flying reptiles that are barely related to dinosaurs. It also refers to a Deinosuchus as a dinosaur, and, well, its not a dino, just a big crocodile.  Its portrayal of the Dilophosaurus is more accurate than most other peoples, but the thing still spits acid. Guys. There is absolutely zero eveidence that in real life these things spit acid. STOP MAKING THEM SPIT ACID!  And that's it. Great game. Good game. Go play, now. Trust me, it's worth all 99 of the pennies you pay for it. 
4710	1	a	I liked the christmas special.
4712	1	a	Awesome Co-Op game. Don't rely on Metacritic only. The game rocks!
738	0	a	lags whit intel celeron 6/10
4714	1	a	probably the worst game that I have ever played  i give it an 11/10
4716	1	a	Good game with amazing graphics, i usually come back to this game a lot, really recommend because cheap. the bugs tho 8/10
4718	1	a	Orion is a fun fps vs dinosaurs game. It's like halo meets jurassic park! With multiple play modes, lots of levels, perks, guns, 3 classes to choose from and a good community its always my go to game when I'm not sure what to play.  pros -take on dinos or even play as dinos -lots of game modes -good community -lots of maps -really fun game  cons -could use some more dinos, endless raptor waves get dull -more classes would be cool -some game modes feel repetitive
4720	1	a	Good for approximately 3 hours of fun before getting tired of killing the same few dinosaurs over and over again. 10/10.
4722	1	a	this game is soo buggy it should be free to play
4724	1	a	Its essentiallly just like Call out duty Zombies but with dinosaurs. There are upgrades and the ability to buy guns but unfortunately onlt between waves. Its worth it when you see it on sale and is fun with a group of friends!
4726	1	a	Driving a buggy with a friend off a cliff and into a horde of Raptors, T-rex and Triceratop. The buggy flipped over and we both died. Best 50 cents ever spent!  10/10 would drive without license again.
4728	1	a	Finally added 32bit support &amp; fixed a lot of game breaking bugs; but all a little too late. There seems to be no one playing, empty servers all around; although still a great game to play a couple of hours with friends on the weekends. =)
4730	1	a	i played this all the time before CSGO and it was the bomb 
4732	1	a	RECOMMEND BY ALOT This Is A Good Game For $0.99 9/10
4734	1	a	This is a epic multiplayer first person shooter and i love to play this with my friends 
4736	1	a	Joined a game, bought a good ol 6 shooter, killed some dinos, got muched to death by tiny ones, figured out the melee attack button, bought a shotgun, took down a stegosaurus, ran out of ammo, bought an ammo refill gun, got owned by a t-rex, bought an LMG, upgraded everything, won the fight, back to step 1. 10/10!
4738	1	a	I liked it even if others don't!
4740	1	a	Its a good game just try it!
4742	1	a	THIS IS THE ♥♥♥♥♥EST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAY, UNINSTALLED AFTER 8 MINUTES OF PLAY WASTE OF 99c, NEVER BUY THIS AS LONG AS YOU LIVE!!!!!!! 'BUT ♥♥♥♥, IT WAS 99C.......' MACKLEMORE 2012
4744	1	a	I loved the game! It is so much fun, I'm a newbie though and there was a person that insulted me. I'm a girl and I'm sensitive but that always happens when you play with anyone randomly. Anyways, had lots of fun !! :D I totally recommend it to others! Can't wait to play as a dinosaur the little ones are cute xD
4746	1	a	Jurassic Park meets Starship Troopers, WITH elevator music; what more can a man ask for? Oh, did I forget to mention, I am the only person playing this game on planet Earth.
4748	1	a	This game is AWESOME! never experienced any bugs or any glitches, the game runs so smoothly.
4750	1	a	M8 this game, whew it really blew my expectations. I was ROARING to play another round. Though the textures are a little... PRIMATIVE
4752	1	a	I'd buy that for a dollar.
4754	1	a	Good game for when you want to kill an hour... or 100... I'm HOOKED... Ah well, at least this addiction only costed me 49 cents....lol
4756	1	a	this games price is 1€ and its even going into a sale.... its not worth 1€.  Its worth 10 € So theres nothing to complain about a good game for only 1 ♥♥♥♥ing euro so just grab it and ignore the negative reviews. It has many modes from PvP (Dinos vs Humans; Humans vs Humans) to PvE (Survival). It has even vehicles like tanks, cars, hover-bikes and even Aircrafts. You can choose between diffrent classes with diffrent abilities, buy weapons, buy perks (even perks that allows you to buy other class weapons) There are diffrent types of Dino's, Bosse's.  It's definitly not the best dinosaure game you can get... but its definitly a game you shouldnt miss and its worth more then the price ure paying for this.
4758	1	a	Can't go wrong only 59 cents for 4 copies!!!!!! Totally worth it graphics are pretty good for an indie game, lots and lots of fun, coop is good (big community,not laggy and supports 5 players), third person or first person, huge levels and well designed game! 9/10
4760	1	a	Shooting T-rexes is fun. letting yar anger flow on thouse poor dinasours. TL;DR: -Pew Pew works -Hillerious bugs -Dead Multiplayer.  this game is buckets of fun, and if your going for 'Value for money' then this 0.99$ will surely provide its worth but a word of warning tho, if u expect to install this game and jump into a multiplayer with abunch of random people then dont, the multiplayer is dead at best, bring your own friend (Hey, its only 0.99 and it will provide hours of entertaiment)
4762	1	a	Fighting dinasaurs with a lightsabre in a halo suit with ♥♥♥♥ animations, 10/10 ign would never play again
4764	1	a	I'D BUY THAT FOR A DOLLAR.
4766	1	a	I bought this game just to see what is was and now this game is just great i had some fun but i ragged sometimes when i get killed by a t-rex so i recommend this game to anyone who likes fps dino shooting game.
4768	1	a	This game cured my naked molrat from ebola! It's amazing!
4770	1	a	friend drives into a horde of dinosaurs: - --Double kill ---Triple kill ----Mega kill -----Ultra kill ------Armageddon -------Bring me some pizza
4772	1	a	For the price 10/10 Gameplay 9/10 Sound 8/10 Overall i give this game 9.5/10  Fun to Play!
4774	1	a	I shot the dinasour. Ran out of bullets. Dinasour see me. I out of bullets. Teammates out of bullets. I die gg 4/10 reccomend would buy twicw
4776	1	a	MLG aproooved ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
4778	1	a	I swear I thought my friends were messing with me when they told me to buy this game, but I never regret the moment when I bought this. Since I was so forced to get this game, I needed it ASAP. I couldn't sell any skins on the market because I met my max, so I gave the skin to my friend and he gifted me the game because he could sell it. He then continued to give me a note with the gift. So poetic that I first thought he copied and pasted it off a Shakespeare sonnet. The message read:   Dear Zaque,  Please kill yourself, drink bleach, overdose, etc.   XOXOXO  -♥♥♥♥♥♥    This stunned me because he has never written something so poetic in our english classes. I then downloaded the game after multiple thoughts of suicide and right when I opened the game, I knew I made a great decision. Orion Prelude was written next to multiple dinosaurs of all shapes and sizes that I wish I knew wtf they were. Should've payed more attention in the third grade. I then changed all the settings to be fully optimized to run on the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of the PC I have. I was then invited by my friends and a few other ♥♥♥♥♥ to play some co-op. I joined the game and a stegosaurus had one of its multiple stages of her menstual cycle on me. I had no clue what to do, I was lost, just like in real life, So I knew I was screwed. I instantly panicked and I ended up getting puked on by a so called 'Spitter'. This motha♥♥♥♥a's puke looked like it drank 3 gallons of AMP before this battle. Puked like it just had its night out on Las Dino. I learned some of the mechanics of the game, and got the hang of it, but I pressed one button that ruined my dignity, V. I pressed V and I was introduced by a melee that looked like my guy was a 9 year old child trying to kill a butterfly. You're telling me they are trained to fight dinosaurs and robot santas, but yet swing like Ronda Rousey. Jesus H christ. Besides the hideous so called 'melee' animation was horrific, there wasn't too much else. Other than me getting stuck in a rock for 10 hours while my buddies kicked some prehistoric ♥♥♥. I got stuck in a rock because a wolf gave me a bruce lee kick to the back and sent me off a mountain into a pile of rocks. Also of course, I was a support or medic so I couldn't jetpack myself out. I sat there for a good hour taking a roast session. My friends called me a poon and said I should kill myself. BUT, this game is actually very nice for the money. This game passes time easily and is super addicting with friends. Graphics are very similar to Borderlands, and I like it.
4780	1	a	Played for 5 minutes. Drove into a t-rex. Flew 70 feet into the air and into my doom. 10/10 would fly again.
4782	1	a	you can kill a dinosaur with a lightsaber 10000000000000000000000/10 Prehistoric Reviews
4784	1	a	ORION: Prelue manages to take the best parts of some of the greatest games of all time. From the overall aesthetic of Halo, to the scale and sense of wonder of Shadow of the Colossus. O:P takes these, and mixes them with the surreal pleasure of shooting DINOSAURS. ORION: Prelude is, simply put, the greatest game of all time, and the fact that it is only $1 means it is accessible to the general population. If you don't own this game, you owe it to yourself, your fellow man, and even the concept of artwork in general to play this game.
4786	1	a	Best Gmae ever full on legit graphics and stuff also the dino's ai is very good i suppose and the gema is not ever boring and the game is very very very unlike halo and or destiny. i can currently also say that austin is a poo head and such. that is all.
4788	1	a	funny game to play with friends 
4790	1	a	Put that Coke down and pick this up!
4792	1	a	Me: 'Might as well buy it for the price'  1 HOUR LATER  Me: 'Okay so up to now i've killed loads of dinosaurs in mech suits and NOW im playing a christmas map shooting Santa as he holds a minigun'   11/10
4794	1	a	Awesome game with a 90's feel.

4798	1	a	this game is actually really ♥♥♥♥ing fun
4800	1	a	This game is cheaper than EA's marketing tactics 10/10 would buy again !
4802	1	a	Take Halo and combine that with zombies from cod and replace the the zombies with dinosaurs and u get the best game ever
4804	1	a	I was in a jeep with a buddy and we tried to run into a stegasaurus. The stegasourus sent me and my buddy 300 meters into the air and i flew past my buddy in a VTOL Helicopter. 10/10 would try to run over stegasaurus again. (Seriously though this game is amazing like holy crap)
4806	1	a	Orion: Prelude provides at least $0.74 worth of entertainment.
4808	1	a	If you like shooting BIG ♥♥♥ dinosaurs in the MOTHER♥♥♥♥ING face with BIG ♥♥♥ guns FOR ONE DOLLAR then this game is for YOU. 'In 2012 we released one of the worst games of all time.' the devs are rad af too. get this game.
4810	1	a	Buy this game, it's a dollar. What more do you have to lose? Unless you're homeless... wait how'd you get a computer?
4812	1	a	Halo mixed with Jurrasic Park. Thats all i have to say.
4814	1	a	Killed Raptors Punched a t-rex in the face Attempted riding a triceratops Nearly breaking my 'v' key clearing waves of raptors Crashing helicopters into dinosaurs Having a lightsaber battle with a gaint crocodile AND MUCH MORE! All for 99 cents...
4816	1	a	This game is way to fun to be $1.
4818	1	a	I cant even explain this game... ITS THAT GOOD!!!
4820	1	a	Killed a T-Rex with an over powered knife, while jumping over it. 10/10 would stab again.  
4822	1	a	Not gonna lie. I bought this game entirely because of the trailer music and because the the developer honesty. Was it worth it? 0.99€ for a game that fits perfectly for those who enjoy fps survival games. 10/10 would buy again.
4824	1	a	LOVE IT :D best game of 2015  dinos skins hats gunz jetpacks everything i dreamed of is in here 'just not world of warcraft'
4826	1	a	this game is so good it makes my nipples          happy
4828	1	a	REALLY Fun game 10/10 from here
739	0	a	It;s and alright game, however I wouldn't recomend wasting your moeny on it, it's not a game that is worth moeny, also it crashes whenever you move on to a new map after finishing a mission.
4830	1	a	Defenitely worth 1$. Imagine Halo and Jurassic Park mashed together and you get ORION: Prelude.  Pros: -Awesome gameplay -Only 1$!!?? -It has dinos and guns Cons: Needs a GOOD computer to run properly
4832	1	a	This game. Oh this game. It might be silly or bad looking but to tell you the truth if you and a few frinds want a game to play i would recomend this because its fun.
740	0	a	This was so bad, it made my balls hurt..
4834	1	a	Got in multiplayer game for the first time. Saw a pterodactyl flying sideways. Decided to shoot it. Pterodactyl kept on flying even after death. Flew off map.       10/10 would shoot a haunted pterodactyl again.
4836	1	a	♥♥♥♥ Nuggets with a ♥♥♥♥-Cola an a Mc♥♥♥♥♥! :)
4838	1	a	Its fun; a little dated nowdays but still fun.
4840	1	a	Absolutely love this game! Even though I haven't played it as much as other people but the gameplay is awesome, graphics aren't complete ♥♥♥♥ but the ambience of the game is just amazing. The music, don't even get me started on the music. The music on this game is brilliant and is just so catchy. As some people would say, 'Damn yo. This mixtape is fire' 10/10 -IGN  
4842	1	a	Hilarious Co-Op shooter , with dinosaurs, shotguns, bows and bugs (THE BUGS!) Cheaper then a can of coke? i dont even like Coke, so i chose this instead, and didnt regret it. However no matter what spec your pc/laptop is prepare for some bad fps at a few times, but it is 50p so who cares?
4844	1	a	dinos spitting green ♥♥♥♥ and giving electric shock with their teeth  would do LSD again 7/10
4846	1	a	-T-REX does flips -Best Graphics I have ever seen Fun for the whole family! 11/10 IGN 
4848	1	a	What i did, Buy this game say to myself dinosaurs interesting, creates survival lobby on easy on solo...........  INSANITY DINOSAURS EVERYWHERE me on the other hand Jetpack Master Rpg master Flying through the air killing dinos and prelude bots alike having the old grandest of times... until i took a list of boss dinos to the knee and they killed me dead, i could fight to survive and round 10 is where i lie here today 
4850	1	a	Jumped off of a rock on top of a Stegosaurus and stabbed it to death with a laser knife  10/10
4852	1	a	Best part of the game:  'Bring me some pizza.' - announcer  10/10 would pepperoni again, all for 99 cents
4854	1	a	'The only thing worse than a zombie running at you, is a zombie on fire running at you'. This is not the case with dinosaurs, especially when you wield a flamethrower with infinite ammo, and you have a T-Rex running straight at you. Slow roasted goodness.
4856	1	a	first two game... got ♥♥♥♥♥ by T-Rex and his little arms :D  very fun and fast pace
4858	1	a	1 dollar game,.... most entertainment Ive had for a buck, thank you
4860	1	a	THIS IS THE BETA VERSION OF FAR CRY PRIMAL !!1!!!1!!111!!
4862	1	a	Very Nice Game :D
4864	1	a	Hi Billy Mays here!  Well what can I say about this piece of art. it's like Planetsides classes and vehicles made a baby with Killing Floors fight 10 waves of baddies.   But wait there is more! Dinosaurs, that throw rocks at ya! Jetpacks! And also loads of weapons to pew pew the *beep* out of dinos!  Billy Mays approved!
4866	1	a	it's a fun game and it's even more fun with friends     (TIP Play with a friend)
4868	1	a	The game looks beautiful. There is a good selection of weapons and a huge open world to explore online, plus the game is incredibly cheap! The dinosaur animations could use some work but this is still a very good wave based game. Also, the game can be played offline in singleplayer, which is good because I don't really like online-only games. All of this for 0.49p on sale? Recommended. ▀▀ㅤ █ ㅤ █ㅤ █ㅤ █ㅤ▀▀█▀▀ㅤㅤ█ㅤ █ㅤ █▀▀▄ 　  ▀▀█ㅤ█▀▀█ㅤ █ㅤ █ㅤ ㅤ █ㅤㅤㅤ █ ㅤ █ㅤ █ ㅤ █ 　  ▀▀▀ㅤ▀ ㅤ▀ㅤ ▀▀▀▀ㅤㅤ ▀ㅤㅤ ㅤ ▀▀▀▀ㅤ █▀▀ 　  ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ▄▀▀▄ㅤ█▀▀▄ㅤ █▀▀▄  ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ█▄▄█ㅤ█ ㅤ █ㅤ█ ㅤ █  ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ█ㅤ █ㅤ█ ㅤ █ㅤ█▄▄▀  ─────███────██ ──────████───███ ────────████──███ ─────────████─█████ ████████──█████████ ████████████████████ ████████████████████ █████████████████████ █████████████████████ █████████████████████ ██─────██████████████ ███────────█████████ █──█───────────████ █──────────────██ ██──────────────█────────▄███████▄ ██───███▄▄──▄▄███──────▄██$█████$██▄ ██──█▀───▀███────█───▄██$█████████$██▄ ██──█───█──██───█─█──█$█████████████$█ ██──█──────██─────█──█████████████████ ██──██────██▀█───█─────██████████████ ─█───██████──▀████───────███████████ ──────────────────█───────█████████ ─────────────▀▀████──────███████████ ────────────────█▀──────██───████▀─▀█ ────────────────▀█──────█─────▀█▀───█ ──▄▄▄▄▄▄▄────────██────█───████▀───██ ─█████████████────▀█──█───███▀──▄▄██ ─█▀██▀██▀████▀█████▀──█───██████▀─▀█ ─█────────█▄─────────██───████▀───██ ─██▄████▄──██────────██───██──▄▄▄██ ──██▄▄▄▄▄██▀─────────██──█████▀───█ ─────────███────────███████▄────███ ────────███████─────█████████████ ───────▄██████████████████████ ████████─██████████████████ ─────────██████████████ ────────███████████ ───────█████ ──────████ ─────████  ㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ▀▀█▀▀ㅤ█▀▀█ㅤ█ㅤ▄█ㅤ█▀▀  ㅤㅤ ㅤㅤ ㅤ ㅤㅤ█ ㅤㅤ█▄▄█ㅤ█▀▀▄ ㅤ█▀▀  ㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ▀ㅤ ㅤ▀ㅤ ▀ㅤ▀ㅤㅤ▀ㅤ▀▀▀   █▀▄▀█ㅤ█ ㅤ █ㅤ ㅤ█▀▄▀█ ▄▀▀▄ █▀▀▄ █▀▀ █ ㅤ █ㅤ█  █─▀─█ㅤ█▄▄█ㅤㅤ █─▀─█ █ ㅤ █ █ ㅤ █ █▀▀ █▄▄█ㅤ█ █ㅤㅤ █ㅤ▄▄▄█ㅤ ㅤ█ㅤㅤ█ ─▀▀ ─ ▀ ㅤ ▀ ▀▀▀ ▄▄▄█ㅤ▄
4870	1	a	It's so bad, so awful, so tremendously terrible, that each and every time that I try to Steam crashes   No lie...  Plz halp  10/10
4872	1	a	There are multiple reasons why this game is only a dollar, but damn it  it's only a dollar
4874	1	a	9/10  bought it for the slomo
4876	1	a	This game ruined two of my best friendships. 10/10 best $ .74 I've ever spent.
4878	1	a	You can run small dinosaurs over with a car.
4880	1	a	This game has potential. WIth some major graphical updates, bug fixes, improvements to gamemodes, and a larger player base, this game could be really good. But because it has none of those things, I give the game a solid 7.5/10. It is kind of hard to criticize the game too badly, though, because of how cheap it is.
4882	1	a	The game is amazing and sure repeated swarms of the same thing seems boring,but keep in-mind that the game is still in development and will change often.
4884	1	a	Is quite fun. Sort of like TF2 (upgrade stations, classes, etc) but with Dinosaurs and vehicles.  The Metacritic score is incorrect, it is for the first (and terrible) version of the game. The updated game that you would purchace now is much better, is probably a 70 or 80.  Graphics are good, it isn't the best use of Unreal Engine I have seen, but it isn't the worst. Be prepared for this game to have performance issues on lower (embedded) graphics.  I tend to stay away from the Player v Player game modes, as the co-op 'kill all the dinosaurs' is much more fun.   Its good to see the developers paying attention to the game, and to get the 'Prelude' upgrade and other DLC for free. Worth buying in the Summer Sale.
4886	1	a	Apart from some issues here and there, the game is great and fun and very cheap.
4888	1	a	Cheap, unfinished and sometimes buggy as all hell but even with these downsides it just feels like playing a B movie that's soo bad it somehow becomes really good and this game does have some damn good moments.
4890	1	a	Heavy Game , Need High Spec for play this game . cheap game but great , and need faster inet :(
4892	1	a	this game is awesome!!  #ihatethisgame
4894	1	a	This is the most fun Ive had since kicking my litte brother around a co op HALO map. This game has certainly taken the spotlight in my gaming time.  10/10 Would shoot dinosaurs again
4896	1	a	this game stopped me from cutting 10\10 
4898	1	a	i bought it for 99 cents now its on sale for 49 cents i feel ripped off     just kidding get this game! ITS WELL WORTH IT
4900	1	a	I got chased by a T-rex 10 times bigger than me. 10/10 would wet my pants again.
4902	1	a	FIVE DINOSAURS KILLOSAUR BRING ME A PIZZA  Fun times for good price.
4904	1	a	I had a splendid time playing this with my pals and with random people. It's definitely worth the 99 cents.
4906	1	a	WOW THIS GAME IS SO SIQ. GETS ME REAL HORNY. OH THE DINASOURS ARE REALLY REALISTIC AND IT IS SO MUCH FUN. IM NOT BEING FORCED AT GUNPOINT TO WRITE THIS, I SWEAR. THE GUNPLAY IS NEX GEN. THE QUICKSCOPING IS ♥♥♥♥ING 1337. BUY THIS MOTHER ♥♥♥♥ER RIGHT NOW.
4908	1	a	I bought this for the story
4910	1	a	You could buy a soda or you could buy this funky combination of every multiplayer shooter of the last decade and dinosaurs. Blaze or slash away in more game modes than that Atari 2600 cartridge you found at a flea market for the EXACT SAME PRICE in 1987.  At the current list price - $0.99 in April of 2015 - there's just no reason not to own this game. Unless you REALLY want that soda.
4912	1	a	Its an ok game but it was an awesome buy because it was 0.99c 0.99c??????? damn dat is cheap and also if you want fun outof this game make sure atleast 2 other friends own it too  because almost everything is more fun with friends.
4914	1	a	Despite what many people have said, this is an incredibly fun game, especially to play with friends. Albeit, it isn't a huge AAA $60, and it wouldn't be worth too much money. But this is honestly one of the best gaming experiences ive had with my friends playing games. With up to 5 people in a game, and games that can last from 20 minutes to 3 hours, it is truly a fun and unqiue experience.  Try riding on the helicopter wings with a sniper while someone else drives. 10/10
4916	1	a	Good game, Its cheap but very good, you gotta learn somee things but it is very interesting
4918	1	a	So, just think of it like this. Christmas morning you open up a present to reveal it's BO2, so you excitedly pop it in your PS3. However, while it's disapointing, it's basically the zombie mode with CS-GO and Halo elements. Oh, and dinosaurs. While the graphics look pretty descent, it's doesn't feel like a complete game. There is no story mode to speak of, and too many stages are one of two things. A.) An uninspired rocky jungle level or B.) IT'S TOO DARK TO SEE ANYTHING WHERE AM I GOING level. There are a few mechanics that can be annoying as well. For example, a boss dinosaur can spawn at random depending on the round. But that's not to say how many and what type. What's worse is you have to track it down, and at night, where you can barely see anything, this is going to be a problem. And the icing on the cake no one wanted is the fact they can spawn even more dinosaurs! So if you can't kill it and it turns to night, you have to wait 'till it's morning, hope to God you got a good team, or get killed! Besides that everything is generic. Wow, cool robo-suits guys, it's not like I've seen them everywhere! A couple of stages are a nightmare to win too. Hell itself is a map, and you must fight the pumpkin king! And while this is a nice switch up from the norm, EVERYTHING IS ALWAYS BLACK AND RED DOWN THERE. I FEEL LIKE I'M DROWNING IN SOME SUMMERTIME SADNESS. But teaming up with your buddies is a blast, and for only 99 cents this game is a blast. So, overall Orion is a blast for it's price, but don't expect a masterpiece.  Pros: A blast with friends +  A bargain for 99 cents +  Decent Graphics +  A couple of really fun guns and items. +  A good amount of levels.. +  Cons: ..But a lot of them feel the same. -  Nightime is the absolute worst in this game. -  The Boss dino respawn BS. -  Generic Design. -  FINAL VERDICT: 7/10 RECOMMEND: YES.   
4920	1	a	Hi. I'm going to review my thoughts on this game.  Overall thoughts: This game is epic overall. It really sells the picture of a game you can enjoy. It's like buying a can of coffee, only this game keeps you awake for much longer. I wouldn't say this is like the greatest game ever, God knows this game is far from perfect. But this is the kind of game that makes you want to get ready to whatever you have to do later, like studying for a test, for example.  Review: [ Note: Not just my opinion. Also using a critical standpoint right now. ]  Pros:  1: It's free to play. 2: It keeps you awake, more than just coffee. 3: It takes you to a place you've never been before. 4: It has some really good customizable ♥♥♥♥ in the main menu.  Cons:  1: The game is full of glitches. 2: No one really plays it anymore.  Ratings and final review: I would say this game is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing good. I reccomend it to ANYONE. It is far from perfect, but that doesn't make it a bad game. Nothing is perfect. And that's part of the fun, right?  My personal rating: 8.2/10.
4922	1	a	I absolutely recomend this game. It's a ton of fun, nice gameplay and mechanics. Briliant
4924	1	a	Most fun i had in a long time, Thnx Spiral
4926	1	a	Dinosaurs and Lightsabers. $1. I have no regrets.  11.5/10
4928	1	a	Metacritic score is misleading  this game is totally JURASSIC
4930	1	a	I beat the heck out of a raptor with my elbow, blasted the crap out of a T-rex with a tank, and used a bow and arrow to kill a giant alligator. Best game evur 11/10
4932	1	a	Best idea for a game ever dinosaurs and jetpacks am I right?
4934	1	a	There are flying dinosuares.. i love it.. so much. yeah..
4936	1	a	All it's missing is the brute shot.
4938	1	a	Wouldn't pay £12 but have had days of fun on Orion after purchasing it on the £1 deal. If it comes on sale again jump on it because ♥♥♥♥ where else can you shoot dinosaurs in the face with a shotgun and jetpack off into the sunset?
4940	1	a	BUT ♥♥♥♥ IT WAS 99 CENT!!!
4942	1	a	Fight a spitter from Jurassic Park with a Warthog from Halo.
4944	1	a	The only thing this game is missing is a random weapon generator!
4946	1	a	A friend of mine said that the rocks in this game didn't actually look that bad.  He was right, they're pretty good.
4948	1	a	GREAT game fun with friends! :)) dont listen to the year old reviews, its really changed for the better :)!
4950	1	a	Okay, this game has been getting tons of negative feedback, but I don't see what's wrong with it. The previous games were pretty bad because they were filled to the brim with bugs. this game, not so much. It was a bit unprofessionally done, but you have to expect that from this level of a dev team. Obviously, the game didn't and also wasn't meant to have much depth, or a storyline, it was just meant to be fun. I mean, come on, its about killing dinosaurs. The game has a HUGE amount of content for a dollar right now, as well. I never ran into any bugs, there were alot of cool weapons and vehicles, and tons of content. The game ran and looked pretty good, and the controls are exactly as one would expect. Again, its biggest feature is that its simply alot of fun and there is alot to see, but not for you if you want a game with alot of depth. Its incredibly under-rated and the metascore is broken, would reccommend.
4952	1	a	Man, this game is pure fun, plain and simple.
4954	1	a	So much fun, so worth it, 5 man co-op is the best. Buy now
4956	1	a	certainly a lot better than the reviews give it credit for, still rough around the edges though.  in terms of fun, the more the merrier. multiplayer is pretty sweet
4958	1	a	First of all I have to say.... I love this game! Not just for the dinosaurs(which honestly was the main thing that pulled me toward it), but for.... well, all of it! Apart from a few glitches and bugs here and there, it's not that bad. There's lovely areas for you to explore as you fight off the hordes of dinos, with nice music to help with immersion. Also, I really like the credit system that allows you to buy character upgrades, weapons, items and more. It's also fairly easy to pick up and play as it didn't take me long before I was doing well(and I usually take quite a while to pick up stuff in games X3).  So if you can ignore the small amount of glitches and such, and you love dinos and/or FPSs, then I reccommend this to be added to your library.
4960	1	a	This game is ♥♥♥♥.
4962	1	a	Picked the game up for $0.99 - can't go wrong there. I usually play the survival mode. It's like a wave mode with the occasional objective. Its a fun casual game.  My one gripe - the lobby hosts sometimes dont pay attention and dont start the game up. Just try a few lobbies or start your own, people will come.
4964	1	a	Really buggy and lacks a lot of things. BUT IT IS SO DAMN FUN TO PLAY!
4966	1	a	I really don't understand why the game has such a low rating, it's super fun! Playing with friends is fun and I would recommend it to anyone looking to have some casual fun
4968	1	a	DINOS AND MECHS AND GUNS! Whats there not to love about this game.
4970	1	a	Unreal Engine vehicles/10
4972	1	a	i have it and its fun but a few problems are the ocasinal glichyness andhow annoying compys are also needs a back story but overall its fun with lots of guns explosions and killing
4974	1	a	I don't agree with metascore.. You can play as DINO! And you can beat T-Rex in MECH! Oh god
4976	1	a	It is great fun with Friends!
4978	1	a	WARNING ! DINO-HAZARD DETECTED ! GRAB YOUR GEAR AND BE EATEN !  Awesome, Co-op actions !
4980	1	a	This game, Name one other game where a FU@#$ING t-rex throws rocks with it's mouth while you shoot at it! Turok has nothing on this ♥♥♥♥. Fully recomend.
4982	1	a	Don't let the metascore fool you. It may not be a very well-known game but I absolutely love this game for its bare qualities. A shooter that mixes marines, futuristic guns with dinosaurs? Jetpacks, medi-guns, stealthing, and ♥♥♥♥♥in' weapons? Not to mention some pretty fun vehicles. I got this game for a dollar on the Steam sale. I would happily had paid the full 15 dollars since I have over 30 hours so far on this game.  Great to play solo, with strangers, and DEFINITELY with friends! Create your own lobby easily and play with friends. If only I had friends.  Each game you earn credits for kills and you spend said credits on weapons and perks for the current game. You also earn experience as you play with the classes and you earn passive perks (and can even unlock weapons to start out with instead of just a boring pistol) or unlock perks that you normally would buy. Saves you some credits.  More people need to buy this game and give Orion a GOOD name. I know Orion: Dino Beatdown had a sullied name for what the developers did and the bad metascore, but since its release it has been updated lots and is now a very fun game! And in NO WAY are any of the additional fees required. If you WANT new armors or a new blade color, go ahead and spend 5 or 10 extra dollars. I spent an extra 10 and bought a new blade color, TWO new armor colors (applies to your weapon too) AND a taunt pack for only 5 dollars.
4984	1	a	Good game, and the developer still updating the game. it's fun, awesome plane, tanks, and robot. Kill the T-rex
4986	1	a	Really ♥♥♥♥.
4988	1	a	Fun game to play with friends more than it is to play alone. A little hard to get used to at first but gameplay isn't too bad. Obviously with any game there are downsides, and this has very few. Get it if you like playing online shooters with friends.
4990	1	a	Awesome Game! And totally underrated.   Spiral Studios care about consumers, free dlcs, regular updates.  Dinos are way better then zombies.  If you can, Buy it!
4992	1	a	The metascore is very misleading. Words cannot describe the fun I have had with this, I was very surprised with how good the game is.
4994	1	a	this game is funking terrible but fun
4996	1	a	Hello, I am a T-Rex. I will throw ♥♥♥♥ing boulders at your unsuspecting face. Come to play with me so you can rage. You can level up your character and shoot all my tasty friends. Bring all your tasty friends too so we have full course meal. Don't use metal friends or flying bags or ninja skills to fight me. Just run a-way and shoot. Or I will take giant Dino™ dumps in front of spawn. GG tasty n00bs.
4998	1	a	not even worth the time to instal.... no wait not even worth the time to click on to see what the game is on steam.... wait wait hold on... not even worth the time to read the name. thats how bad this was. dont get jiped into this game. majority of reviews are bad and all the things said in the promo video up top is complete BS made up by them.
5000	1	a	Awesome game. Could use some more feedback/news from the developer. What was that patch that just downloaded? What did it fix? What's new? What's coming? The 'news' section as it is kinda feels like BonziBuddy.
5002	1	a	I don't think it's very good but I have to admit IT'S FUN AND GLITCHY AS HELL 
5004	1	a	I only paid 99 cents for this and the graphics are pretty good..I kinda suck at killing dino's but I am having fun with this game :]
5006	1	a	This game makes me think of Halo but with dinosaurs. It is really fun and has a great community.
5008	1	a	In all honesty, I am incredibly hard to hook as far as video games are concerned. There are plenty of games that I will play once, but for me to enjoy any kind of longevity with a single title is rare indeed. I can say without a shadow of a doubt that this will be one of the few awesome games I end up spending a whole lot of awesome time with. Crazy awesome dino A.I., powerful weapons, an addictive counter-strikeesque upgrade system, 5 player co-op, vehicles crazier than anything you've seen in Halo. And that's just one game type! This is an awesome game for awesome people. Any one who can remember being a child watching jurassic park and having halo welcome you into adolescence will absolutely adore this game.
5010	1	a	Dinosaurs.. Not that bad!
5012	1	a	Yes, yes, yes, yes. Seriously it's $1. I dare you to have more fun for a dollar.
5014	1	a	This game is really worth getting it on sale, its only 1 euro/dollar ! The multiplayer has many game modes to select from. You can play versus dinosaurs or deathmatch with real people (wich i play most. It has nice graphics , and enjoyable gameplay . This game is pretty fun , one of the Best 1$ game on sale ! Really worth getting it !!
5016	1	a	This game is amazing. Combination of Halo and dinosaurs I think. Super fun worth your money
5018	1	a	Its not that bad.
5020	1	a	The most fun you will have with friends. This game provides exactly what I would want in a single package. The ability to fly around with a jetpack and rocket launcher and blow off a T-Rex's face. The 3 class system gives the game depth and variaty, and the level progression, although slow, is very rewarding.  Normal survival modes are good for 15-30min stints into the realm of Dino hord, but its the survival mode tundra maps that take the cake. 1-2 hour journys to defend outposts from incoming attacks, this is the mode where you will be pulling out the big guns. Loads of time to earn the big moneys, loads of time to fly around exploding face.  9/10 for pure fun. Recommended
5022	1	a	This is a very fun action game, it is similar to Black Ops Zombies, but with dinosoars. I definitely recommend it. :)
5024	1	a	BEST GAME EVER CANT WAIT FOR THE BIG UPDATE
5026	1	a	I highly recommend this game if you're into ♥♥♥♥ eating.
5028	1	a	its cool very hard in ways like the lag and such but yeah thumbs up 
5030	1	a	This game's PVP feature is extremely limited. However, I found the cooperation of the survival mode quite challenging and enjoyable for hours making it a worthwhile purchase. If you want a shooter that is unique while still familiar, this is definately worth trying.
5032	1	a	This is an awesome game lol, not everyday you can play an FPS game and shoot dinos! As for graphics, they are decent, reminds me of halo based layout. I bought the 4-pack on sale at 96% off for $3 lol it was worth it for sure to have 4 people play for just $3.   If you got friends who play and want to join in its worth the non sale price but if your alone might want to try and get some others to get it with you, much better with friends.
5034	1	a	I have lots of fun with this game. BUT it crashes when I do voice chat with some of my mates. But still great. 9.5 dead dinos! :D
5036	1	a	The only Dinosaur I'll be killing is my computer. Then I can hopefully run this game
5038	1	a	Killy de dino :)
5040	1	a	A free-roaming FPS with very good,enjoyable gameplay,multiple weapons/perks/vehicles,character customisation. Totally worth your money! Plus,you get to shoot AND play as a dinosaur!!  10/10
5042	1	a	such an amazing game! love it, best dino game ever. Right now in my 'Never delete' folder. Tundra map music is so beautiful  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U15YpjIMRjE) 
5044	1	a	This is probably the greatest, and most terrible game on Steam. But really its not a very good game. I would only recommend it for its 99 cent price tag and if you have friends to enjoy the terribleness together. Its bad, in the right way.
5046	1	a	Killing Dino's is fun :D
5048	1	a	I backed Dino Beatdown on Kickstarter...I guess this is a remake of that game. I was really disappointed with Dino Beatdown...but recently played Dino Horde with some friends and can honestly say I havent had that much fun playing a game with some friends in a long time. Sure it doesn't really have a story but who cares...survival mode for me it the most fun. But Hey its .99 so you can't beat the price...play it with a 2-3 friends and I promise you'll be hooked. I plan alot of Dayz which is a slow and patient type of game...so its nice to take a break from Dayz and play something crazy like this and just have fun.
5050	1	a	I love this game. Minor glitch where you can get stuck on top of rocks, but only happened a few times. This game will keep you up all night if you are playing with friends.
5052	1	a	Cool game..... Be open minded Jurrasic brothers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5054	1	a	Great graphics, lightsabers and dinos...
5056	1	a	spennt a long time just fighting off giant pink dinosaurs with a lightsaber and a friend in the snow 11/10 would reccomend
5058	1	a	Love It; Got A Demo And It Was Awesome
5060	1	a	Message me if you want this game I,ve got a gift key that I will give to you guys for a 5€ worth steam item or paysafecard or also a steam gift card
5062	1	a	Been playing this game for 8 hours now, i recommend this game to all killing floor fans. It is a never ending cycle of crazy dino shooting.  I admit the graphics quality of this game is not that good  but who cares about graphics? Real gamers judge a game by its gameplay.   If you are into survival and nonstop shooting of dinosaurs in all sizes (small/medium/large), then this game is for you. We have different preferences, for me this is a game worth buying.   Updated review as of August 17,2014. Game is still awesome as it was before, but i hope there would be more changes during the full release of prelude.   My present gameplay footage:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3rb-04O2qM 
5064	1	a	lemme start with ..puting my socks back on ..cuz this game knockd um rite the ♥♥♥ off....i know a dino game every one does one ..well they do but not like this at all this is like lost planet and halo had sex and out fell tis beautiful bay .....and i love it .ull love it too if u like anything thats close to cool cuz this shiz is top shelf and well worth the .99cents
5066	1	a	Hands down, best .99 Cent purchase ever. a little buggy, but easily forgiven for how great it is, Minus the fact it doesnt have Voice yet.
5068	1	a	Pretty fun, it reminds me of Sanctum and CoD: Zombies. With dinosaurs, of course.
5070	1	a	hit and run, but teamwork is better :)
5072	1	a	The metacritic score is lying to you.  Yes, I totally recommend this game, its a lt of fun with friends, and the funnythings that can happen when your being chased by large bypedal lizards makes for entertaining gameplay.  Great fun and a number of different maps and play styles.
5074	1	a	Dispite the bad reviews, I have heard about this game, I feel that this game is tons of dino fun.
5076	1	a	Its fun but theres alot of room to expand on this, maybe after a few addons or updates, i might get the game!
5078	1	a	The most fun you can have while killing dinosaurs. Very friendly community, challenging game modes, and addictive play. My favorite action co-op shooter by far.
5080	1	a	this game is fun i like the servivel mode 
5082	1	a	cool
5084	1	a	Its a good game just would be better if there was an option to turn off blood for the younger people like little brothers
5086	1	a	This game is awful, the server never work. I recommend you buy a hammer and beat your skull in instead of buying this ♥♥♥♥ ass game
5088	1	a	Great game, reminds me of Halo but with Dinos.
5090	1	a	I think that how the 'remade' the game in a way that it deserves a new rating for its metascore. This game is seriously improved.
5092	1	a	This game is poorly put together, somewhat unoptimized and pretty much looks like a game out of 2003... BUT I ♥♥♥♥ing love it, it is truely a turd of a game but it is a shiny turd. I really wouldn't be able to convince you to play this game if it was full price but when ever it goes on sale ever its so worth the pick up because I'm sure a few hours of mindless fun with friends isn't worth like $3 then what is?!  0/10 WOULD PLAY AGAIN
5094	1	a	It was good
5096	1	a	For £1 this is amazing! The game i have imagined creating as a kid is finaly a reality now i am an old man.  Tempted a few mates to get this in the £2.99 bundle, and everyone one is now loving it.  Does not deserve that low MetaScore! Co-op, Jet packs, Invis, turrets, tanks, mech and Dinos... what more could you ask for. Having alot of fun.  I would love to get in contact with the team though for some improvements. Animation has improved but could go further.  Optimisation is a given. I have a uber rig, and while it isnt taxing at full more than 30%, the system is running soo hot, even with water cooling. Even WatchDogs at max doesnt make it that hot.  Cant wait to see how improves in Aug 14 
5098	1	a	Constantly fought the urge to yell 'SHOOOOOOOOT 'ER'. Enjoyed blasting tiny Compys with a magnum. Screamed in pain as my best friend was eaten by a Spinosaurus in slow motion. Got on Steam Sale for ~$1.49. 9/10
5100	1	a	Surprisingly FUN!!! Great for Co-Op LAN
5102	1	a	In my opinion , in this game , we need to run very more. We have a huge map and the checkpoints can be to 2000 m , and when you don't find a vehicle you need to run , and this run can take more than 5 minutes ...  But it's a nice game.
5104	1	a	Well, this was quite a bit of fun. Imagine Turok meets Halo and you've pretty much got this game.  Fantastic! I would highly recommend getting this game while it's on sale. In fact, I'd probably even recommend it if it weren't on sale. Just play this game!
5106	1	a	The metascore isn't wrong, this game is a steaming bag of **** but for 1$ it's not terrible. 90% of the guns are useless due to crap dps and the dino's are idiots so there are some downsides. With that said if you have some friends that want to play a game where you kill dino's with purple guns then go nuts, it's the game for you! Oh and the controls are the worst thing possible!!!! Worth a buck, no more.
5108	1	a	ORION: Dino Horde -the game has bugs -the game is laggy -the graphics is not so good but they are okay +fun in singleplayer and multiplayer +fun with friends +good price  it gets a 6.5/10
5110	1	a	This game had a lot of problems when it launched and it still has quite a few such as a few things not being balanced correctly (versus mode, for example), there are a lot of things that not well explained by the game (like what you're supposed to be doing and how basic mechanics like teleporting back to base work) and a few sloppy or not well designed menus. However, all these things considered, it is not longer the laughably bad game that it once was before. I used to consider this game my greatest shame as a person who buys video games and the epitome of shallow, impulsive buying on Steam. Now, I consider this game to be a functional game that can be enjoyed with friends.
5112	1	a	Fun as ♥♥♥♥, ignore the metacritic ♥♥♥♥. If you like horde mode games, this is the ♥♥♥♥
5114	1	a	I've played 0.6 hours of this game. That is 0.6 hours too long. why do i get this gaem? i dunno. it no gud and i cant tell if it are a game.
5116	1	a	Very cheap and fun
5118	1	a	This game is hilariously fun with a group of friends. Playing on survival mode and blasting wave after wave of dinosaurs is pure gold. Ignore any older reviews (2012, 2013), they are for a different (and much crappier) version of this game. This new version is much improved, with a ton of game modes and weapon upgrades. The graphics and UI are still a bit rough around the edges, but the gameplay more than make up for it.
5120	1	a	It's a good multyplayer fps game,and I realy like the fact that you are fighting the dinosaurs
5122	1	a	Not bad for the price. Really get a solid group of friends to play, so much fun.
5124	1	a	A really fun game just to unwind. Simple and straightforward.   And what's not fun abt shooting dinosaurs??
5126	1	a	Yes, you need a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t game like this to ♥♥♥♥ of your friends. Great present for your soon ex girlfriend.
5128	1	a	i so recommend dis game when dinos heads get shot off the blood looks like gum its weird and funny at the same time 
5130	1	a	ORION is one of the best co-operative games to play...
5132	1	a	An amazing game to play with friends, Dino Horde is sure to bring about some good laughs and fun times.  - Easy to set up a multiplayer game - A wide array of game modes (PvP, PvE, Co-Op) - Feels like an old school shoot'em up - Stress-less team play, no need to stick to roles and such - Passionate developers - In-game store is mostly for cosmetic items, no pay to win - Just plain fun  Overall Score: 8/10. The game still has some minor issues, but nothing game breaking, and when it comes to having a good time gaming with a couple of friends, Dino Horde is at the top of my list.
5134	1	a	IGN: 10/10 - 'They paid us'
5136	1	a	Still a better love story than twilight!
5138	1	a	T-REX did a backflip 10/10
5140	1	a	Amazing game. We must to work together for battle the Dino (y). I love it !
5142	1	a	I bought this game when it was ridiculously discounted (I paid $.94). Me and a couple of friends tried it out later that night and we were having so much fun poppin' a cap in a T-rex's ♥♥♥. Not perfect, but great for playing with friends. Oh, and there's an achievement for getting eaten by the T-rex called 'Man on the Toilet'. If you don't get this reference you have live a sad, unfulfilled life.
5144	1	a	So much fun with a group of mates... especially when so cheap
5146	1	a	Its a fun game, with or without friends. Now on sale for only for a dollar. Whats not to like?
5148	1	a	This game is actually really fun :P It has definitely changed for the better in the last year. I'd recommend it, and consider everyone lucky because its so cheap!!
5150	1	a	yes its pretty and fun 
5152	1	a	It's sorta like Killing Floor. But with Dinosaurs... I've just been informed that Science has developed an equation. Killing Floor + Dinosaurs = Awesome    ...and for $0.99 it was hard to beat
5154	1	a	Good Game. Didn't play for long, but thats because I was tired and couldn't be bothered learning thigns :P But definately cans ee how this would provide hours of fun.
5156	1	a	My friend crashes into a t rex on purpose and we died.10/10 would play again later when he's offline
5158	1	a	Review:   When I first saw this game, I saw many bad reviews. I thought about buying it, but left it alone when I saw a review video of the game a while back. I got really bored today, and was like, 'Are there any discounted games that are good?', and thought of this game again. This time, I just looked at the reviews, all positives, and it looked much better. I yolo'd it and got this game. I messed around with the options, than hopped onto an 'Easy' game. I was having trouble, not very much fun. Than I went on to a Prehistoric server, kinda hard at first. Than I started getting better after 10 minutes. I started having a lot of fun. This is a GREAT game, considering is only 99c. 11/10, would T-Rex again.
5160	1	a	I remember when this game was Orion: Dino Horde. It was interesting to say the least, but with the new name came what felt like a new game with better optimization, gameplay, everything really. If you're looking for a good quality, cheap game, then this is it. I'd recomend it even if it were $15.  10/10
5162	1	a	Orion Prelude is Fun to play, I like running around and killing Dino's. It has Good Graghics, Sound and Music. I'm just not a first person shooter kind of guy but I do recommend this game and you can get it like for a Buck. Now down to business I would give it a 7 out of 10
5164	1	a	Really fun and good gameplay 
5166	1	a	This game is Titanfall, Advanced Warfare, Halo 4, Crisis 3, Far Cry 4, and GTA V combined. As a matter of fact, all of those game copied this one game. This game is the best game i've ever played in my 15 year experience of playing video games. Even better than half life 2. Who needs Half Life 3, when you have Orion: Prelude. Best game, hands down.
5168	1	a	i honestly didnt know what to expect when i got this because it was lik 1.00$ but when i played it... sure the graphics arent all good, but they arent terrible either the real reason i like this is there is litteraly SO MUCH CARNAGE my pc can't handel it and if you want to customize you charecter well... you gotta pay IRL but you dont see your person at all so there really isn't a point. With amazing vehicles that may be slightly OP the dino carnage is at its max! most carnage i ever whitnessed... ever pretty much
5170	1	a	Better than COD Ghosts
5172	1	a	Dino Horde Is A Game About Dinos And You Kill Them 
5174	1	a	Turn's out heavily armed soldiers riding vehicles caused the mass extiction of dinosaurs. Super entertaining for competetive or casual gamers alike.
5176	1	a	Buggy game but ♥♥♥♥, it was 99 cents.
5178	1	a	Though this game may not have cutting edge graphics, the best voiceovers and some dodgy controls here and there. It is a beautiful piece of work that has adapted greatly from it's release. This game is proof that if you work hard at a game, it will come out great. The Dev team could of left it how it was. A heaping mess. But they looked at their mistakes and improved on them. Making one of the greatest PvD game i've seen. You can play solo, solo with bots, or with friends and either one it is great fun. All for a super cheap price of $1/79p. It's worth way more then that. Best part is that there is not a single pay to win feature on this game. No '$10 for 10000cr' I highly recommend this game to anybody that loves shooters and/or dinosaurs.
5180	1	a	Super fun. You can be a T-Rex. Or get eaten by one. 9001/10 would get my face eaten again.
5182	1	a	Very fun game for a good price, not a 50 dollar game.
5184	1	a	You can play as a dino-suicide bomber.  11/10. Game of the year. 100% recommended.
5186	1	a	cheap, fun, easy to get into and play with friends
5188	1	a	if you want to fight dinosaurs and look swag then this is the game for you
5190	1	a	A fun game to play with a group of friends.
5192	1	a	A T-Rex threw a rock at me and made me fight to survive. My friend being the great comrade he is raced towards me only to get picked up by a Pteradactyl thus plunging to his death. 10/10 would play. For all dinosaur enthusiasts.
5194	1	a	Great game.
5196	1	a	What more can be said, it's a horde style game involving dinosaurs, and don't let the metacritic score fool you, this game deserves much better, great to play with some friends and grab some achievements. 7/10
5198	1	a	I recommend beacouse it's cheap :)
5200	1	a	Great game but could use some updates and detication, Great for helping teamwork and some good laughs!
5202	1	a	Killed a Raptor with a T-REX egg. Would whack again. 10/10 
5204	1	a	Dino !! Dino !! T- Rex RUN !!!!  Tecnologly = Win
5206	1	a	very good game such dino wow
5208	1	a	Great game for a stupid concept. Over all this game is very entertaining providing a unique survival mode where other players take on the role of dinosaurs and destroy new players that don't know what their doing. Through a simple playthrough I beleive team games or free-for-all game modes are the best. The free-for-all duel is wildly entertaining providing huge jumps, great swordplay, camo and awesome side moves.
5210	1	a	Quite fun. It has an intresting gameplay design and is addictive.
5212	1	a	Grab some friends, and have the experience of your life.
5214	1	a	I love this game for many reasons 1. I love first person shooters that are also action packed and just fun to play, 2.I love love love this game because of the dinosaurs just really DINOSAURS I have only once seen a game like this I especially love to be dinosaurs in one of the gamemodes and 3. Its multiplayer for the whole world to enjoy and its a strategy game or if you play on the gamemode where your a dino and your a dino by yourself just eat people overall this is one of the best games so far and i cant wait for its future peace out 
5216	1	a	Awesome game! It's like Jurassic Park meets Halo! I would recommend this game for people who just love killing hordes of monsters!
5218	1	a	This is a great game. It has hours of fun, replayablity, huge maps, weapon upgrades, wonderfull graphics, and great multiplayer. What else can you ask for? This game could cost 10x what it does and still be worth it. Everyone should own it. Great for mini LAN's!!!
5220	1	a	Great fun especially in a group with friends. Excellent game for the price well worth it!
5222	1	a	this game is stupid fun shooting dinos and gets better with a few friends. Just don't expect more than a few hours of fun for the gameplay gets very repedtitve but that first time you 1v1 a T-rex with a lightsaber and win feels amazing. So buy it if you have money to waste and want some dumb game to play with friends for a few hours.
5224	1	a	guys... this is literally the best 99 cents/65 ruble you will ever spend. get it.
5226	1	a	Probably one of the best games you can get for a dollar
5228	1	a	I really don't understand why this game got only 36/100 from metascore. I bought this because it was -93% so it costed me only 0.99€ . It's really fun to play with friends and won't get boring too quickly, I know this because we played this 3 hours straight with my friend. People are saying that the singleplayer sucks, I really can't say anything to that because I haven't tried it yet and won't keep my hope too up because the bad rewiews..  8/10 I do recommend this game if you have somebody to play this with :)
5230	1	a	If you like Shooters i would definatly recommend this game
5232	1	a	Well, I paid $1.49 during the winter sale for the 4 pack and I think it was worth that. It's not bad for the price if you want some mindless stupid fun. Just remember, this game costs 99 cents.
752	0	a	Pros: It doesn't crash and seems relatively bug free  Cons: I had to pay a dollar to play this crap  Might be worth it if you're me aka you have a morbid fascination with design failure   
5234	1	a	 SLG's First 10-hrs. Review
5236	1	a	Dinosaurs = good As long as u have friends that wanna play then great game, Even better when u get 2 be T-rex. 
5238	1	a	First things first, before I go into detail about my experience with the game there are a few things that you need to know:    This is a niche FPS/TPS game    While it has PvP options, the focus is PvE    There are enough glitches and bugs in the game that it feels more like an Early Access title   With that here is a bit of information about this game.    Pros:
5240	1	a	Surprisngly fun! Think of it as if Planetside 2, Turok and Halo had a baby
5242	1	a	Very Enjoyable. Has a lot of potential.
5244	1	a	This is a pretty interesting game.  I got it while it was about a dollar or so, I got a 4-pack, actually, as I'm still hoping to sometime play with people on a kind of lan party. This would be the perfect game for it, and make sure to order pizza.  This game is fun... it can get repetitive quickly, but if you learn a few tricks you can keep things quite interesting. This is the kind of comical game that, well, the way I played at first that I survived by doing? - I was running around knifing raptors - Yes, knifing them.  There's your sign.  Everything about Dino Horde feels like an arcade game. The item/upgrade stores, and so on.. which is neat.   For the sake of repeated play getting boring, and a lot of low appeals other than the comical... bugs -  7/10
5246	1	a	A very fun and intense horde mode, the pvp is not as good as i expected but surely worth the money. Very fun and very addicting. 7/10
5248	1	a	For $.99 it's actually really fun. I played for almost an hour last night after purchasing and I kept thinking 'If I were at an arcade, i'd spend $1 for 1 round' So I like to think I spent $1 for an infinite ammount of rounds and in that respect it's definitely worth the price.  Aside from the great price, there were a few hiccups. I noticed a bit of lag, even though my connection was good. Hit detection seems slightly off, maybe this was because of the lag, but at times I had to aim a the ground in order to hit the little dinos that bite at the feet.  But still, nothing feels better than mowing down a stegosaurus and a t-rex from raining down rockets with an aircraft up above.  Get it, it's worth it, you'll probably like it.
5250	1	a	earrape
5252	1	a	Takes some balls to make fun of your own game.
5254	1	a	This game was terrible as Dino Beatdown, but the recent update to Horde is MUCH better, and was actually fun to play. I reccomend it!
5256	1	a	An odd little gem of a game thats amazing for the price. Theres no reason to not buy it.
5258	1	a	I fully recommend it, gives you more fun than pricier games. Rawrrrr.. rrr.
5260	1	a	So i played enaught of the game to review. Its a fun survival,pvp shooter i liked the survival game the most got 6 trading card i am happy person for 0.79cents
5262	1	a	it's a really fun game! 10/10 BUY IT! 
5264	1	a	This is a great game for a 0.99$ Game.  -The graphics are nice. -The gameplay is so much fun. -Great weapons   Keep up the good work, Developer :)
5266	1	a	It's stupid, all the assets look and feel like they were ripped straight from planetside 2, and playing alone is boring as ♥♥♥♥ after a few minutes.  But I will be damned if this game isn't a party with friends. When it's on sale for $.50 you can round up a group of bored people and have a great night. This game isn't something you play to be good and competitive or to challenge yourself, you play this to have a stupid, wonderful time with other people, and it excels at being just that.
5268	1	a	I really love this game, The graphics are awesome. 1000000 dinosaurs, Aircrafts, Vehicles, And awesome weapons and upgrades! Don't believe the metascore, The game has been updated so much and got so great. The only downside seems to be a bit low on game servers. However achievements are fun too! (I did notice a ingame-store that was a bit of a turnoff, But doesn't seem to make it pay-to-win)
754	0	a	Do not ever ever ever buy this... the fact it is in the flash sale proves the incompetency of steam in gettting rid of decietful, horrible games.... next game is going to claim to cure cancer
5270	1	a	This game is hours of fun, looks good (dat weather) and come on - killing dinosaurs! The only problem I've had is bad ping 'but ♥♥♥♥, it was 99 cents'
5272	1	a	I am not sure why this game gets such a bad reputation. I have been having a blast killing dinosaurs with friends. Its not perfect... but it is a lot of fun.
5274	1	a	Ok to start off this review i going to be honest with you this game isn't the most fun you will ever have or the best game with the best graphics ever its more of a game if your bored and have nothing better to do with your friends. Now i have over with lets get on with the review. p.s. if your do not want me to blaber on go to the summary --- Story: There is none it is just your some peeps who saw a dinosaur and said OH dinosaurs wtf *pew pew* thats it soo yeah so. Score- n/a --- gameplay: The gameplay is very medicore and its not very hard since of the crappy A.I. teammates and dinosaurs. There are three classes medic who can heal peple and heal the power objection, Assault who has a motherf*cking jetpack and recon who can turn invisable. With singleplayer but playing co op is ennoyable with the crazyiness happening with all the dinosaurs but if your stuck with the A.I. because you have no friends then you should not get this game but if you have friends get it and try it. When your bored of just surivial you can mess around with the setting you can make your own fun like starting off with 20000 creidts or pirate dinosaurs. There are a varity of gamemodes such as a gamemode which ripped off quake and some more so more i talk more about them more in the review. gameplay-6.5 --- graphics: Now to the graphics, The graphics are ok-good to the most some maps look pretty good while other to me personally just look ugly which is quite strange but there are things on the screen i hate about it which it the rain and a couple of these snow maps just cover your screen so you can't see has well but i just it make sense because its the rain and stuff but i am stilled annoyed by them but other thet to the most part its good the graphics. graphics-6.5 --- replay vaule: Well there are a varity of gamemodes other then survival which focus on pvp but to be honest no one plays them so its just survial and dinosurvial for the most part so i couldn't try the other gamemodes out. replay vaule-6 --- music + sound effects: There is nothing special about this music its just you stero type action music but the sound effect are pretty good but there is one thing i love and that is that you can change you voice and you can change your voice to a stero type black guy so it get boosted the score music + sound effects -6.5 --- summary: Its not the best game and its not the most fun like i said in the start but its really cheap so gift it to a couple of friends and just have fun becuase for the most part you have to make the fun by yourself but if your ok with that then go it. score overall-6.5
5276	1	a	for half the price of a pack of gum this game is very good. cmon guys i bought thid game for less then a PACK OF GUM
5278	1	a	best 0,39 ill evr spend in my life 
5280	1	a	Metacritic lied to me   10/10
5282	1	a	one of the best game i ever played (that cost 1 dolar:-)
5284	1	a	the most badest game in the world i had fifty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s whan i play the game much sexual very ♥♥♥♥♥
5286	1	a	I paid a dollar for 7 hours of killing T-rexs with a lightsaber. 10/10
5288	1	a	It has dinosaurs.
5290	1	a	had much fun in this tower-defense-FPS while Hunting down Dinosaurs with a wide variety of weapons    9,5 of 10 would slash T-Rex with an overpowered katana-sword 
5292	1	a	This game was great, I definatley recommend it to everyone else. Can't wait until my copy evolves into Orion:Prelude
5294	1	a	Better than Ark
5296	1	a	People say they will dream dreams, dinosaurs are no dreams they're are here, among us in the shrubbery what will you do when they attack? probably die but this game defies everything humans have ever said, ever. this is no review this a witnessed revolution, a game to end all games with a higher metascore than ingame weapons these dinosaurs arent just messing around they're here for the ketchup and brown sauce and it doesn't seem like they're going to leave the mayo with out it. I think im done here, ironic isn't it..? this is the end and yet its only just begun.
5298	1	a	This game is very cheap and its not a bad game the only problem is the graphics.
5300	1	a	a good game. rather interesting concept! i quite enjoyed the fact that i can kill those who walk the earth before me! XD
5302	1	a	Not a bad pick for $1.25. Very similar to the first 2 Halos (guns, vehicle that looks lke the warthog). If you play with friends it's fun, and having cards is a plus also. $10 or more isn't worth it however.
5304	1	a	Very fun game. It has a bunch of different modes that you can play online, with friends, or alone! From survival of survivng waves of dinosaurs, to a mode where you do PVPVE. Its a really fun game! Also, its $0.99, so won't hurt to try!
5306	1	a	Sup. The name's Vuki. I am a game reviewer for the time being to get some cash but after my mixtape drops, im set. I only play Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and if you dont like it... well lets just say the big Vukster is comin for ya. Anyway... this is Vuki, im Out!
5308	1	a	  This is a good, fun game.
5310	1	a	ORION: Prelude. Worst game of 2013? Pfft... maybe 2013, but one of the best of 2015. Okay, that's a little much. I just really enjoy it. It's a fun, fast-paced dinosaur FPS heavily based on the Jurassic Park franchise (don't try to deny the inspiration). It's constant alter egos (ORION: Dino Horde, ORION: Dino Beatdown) can be a little bit annoying if one more comes along. Guardians of ORION seems like an okay game. If I were the people behind the game, swimming in pennies I would be cautious about releasing the full game yet. Even in early access. The trailer (  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3DSl9WmnWU  ) was okay, and seemed like pretty solid gameplay, with decent grapics. I would get it for under $5.00. Maybe at a discount for owning ORION: Prelude? I do kind of dislike the aspect of turning a dinosaur game into a team deathmatch. Maybe if the players could be dinosaurs in the deathmatches, but at this point, it's not the best part of the game. Should you buy this game? Yes. Buy the 4-Pack so you can give it to everyone you know. What's that? You know more than four other people? Well, buy more than one 4-Packs! Well, that's all I have. Thanks for actually reading this. You just read through a run-on paragraph created by a kid that games.
5312	1	a	This is one of the best dinosaur/fighting games, I've ever played! Other than Primal Carnage, I don't know of very many dinosaur games that have both options to play as humans and dinosaurs. Also, the graphics, animations, models, textures, and sound effects are extremely awesome! I also really love the weapons in this game, especially the pump-action shotgun, since that's always been my favorite firearm in general. This game is also like a combination of franchises I love, such as Team Fortress 2, Halo, and Jurassic Park, which I definitely think is one of the most kickass combinations of all time! I completely recommend this game for anyone who loves dinosaurs and first-person shooters!
5314	1	a	STILL better than the 2nd one      u go gurl
5316	1	a	ORION: Dino Horde my first impression Ignore that metacritic, this isn't bad game. Play with friends for more fun  Vehicle, human, weapon are great, many maps and game modes!  some dinos and vehicle still slightly buggy, boring music background But anyway you paid peanut you got monkey, dont expect too much for this game
5318	1	a	this game is rocks this is halo star wars jurrasic park weird game and this game is only 1 dollar sometime I forgot my 1 tl and I don t care but this game need some update still like some bugs and I still need something this game have sooo much pay in thing it is bad and dino has some bug and you can only be a dino in rampage and it is bad I hope devs are read this I love this game devs are relly fuuny and this game has slowmotion ooowww yeaah :D  and if I need to give point 7.5/10 for this game if you ask devs 11/10
5320	1	a	if its less than 5 or 6 dollars than get it. otherwise just get primal carnage if you want to play a better version of this game.
5322	1	a	For a $1 game this is actually surprisingly enjoyable
5324	1	a	You run around, shoot dinos, buy new weapons and drive mechs and choppers, whilst playing with other (usually) good peeps... What else do you need? It also runs quite good. Only problem is, it is kinda badly optimised, though it doesn't mean that the game will run like absolute dogsh**.
5326	1	a	Ill just say this is much better than it was at launch, and i`d give it 7 out of 10
5328	1	a	went on a driving cruise with boosters  11/10
5330	1	a	Maxiumum Immersion Game for max points  Immersion/10 would Immersion again.
5332	1	a	It's like Halo with dinosauars.  A pretty fun game particularly in co-op modes. The game still needs balancing in order to be fully enjoyable in the long run. Overall, it is worth the price of a buck.  EDIT: Now the game is going to be free to play? Everyone, this game is worth your attention. Even when it was a dollar, it is still worth having some fun!
5334	1	a	For one Euro, this game is a steal. Pick it up ASAP! Can recommend to play with friends.
758	0	a	Good game, now return my money.
5336	1	a	Team left me to fight a T-Rex all alone? 10/10 - will be abandoned again.
5338	1	a	its very fun to play with friends not alone.lol. sorry if my review is bland. I just tell it like it is.
5340	1	a	I'm not gonna lie. This game is terrible by all definitions. Animations are hilarious, perks are almost irrelevant, but it's so much fun that you'll overlook it's flaws and enjoy. Definitely at it's best with friends.
5342	1	a	awesome game works well on computers 2010 and up... 10/10 mix of halo, dinosaurs and first person shooter. top game must have
5344	1	a	Very cool game to play with friends. Nice graphics. Dont stop the good work!
5346	1	a	Good game for good price :  Graphic 8/10  Gameplay 7/10  Price 9/10
5348	1	a	Addicting and fun! Exciting and always an adventure with friends! Blasting dinos or competing in Gun Game, this game has it all and is simple enough that it is relaxing and enjoyable!
5350	1	a	A medium dino game. You team up with players and have to survive as long as possible ( i think you win by reaching wave 10). Graphics are medium and gameplay is full of bugs. That doesn't make the game less enjoyable, but it gets boring easily and some times it might even crash. For it's price, I don't see a reason not to buy this game. NOTE: It doesn't have any kind of story mode! It is 100% co-op,multiplayer! Online matches only. Overall 6/10, recommended for it's low price (got it on 0.10$ winter sales deal)
5352	1	a	This is by far the best 1 dollar game i have ever played. You go through different levels of killing dinosaurs while levelling up. This is a very fun game that can keep you captured while playing it. +1
761	0	a	This game is weird, the camera is odd, the controls are bad
5354	1	a	This game is probably the best you can buy for a buck. I love this game. it's not too hard and the graphics are amazing. it's not super easy either and that's what makes it great. I see it as a mix of casual and action because its not too far on either side of the scale. I love this game and although everyone sais there are a lot of bugs, the only thing i found bugged was i got disconnected to the internet everytime i opened the game. this meant i couldn't play online with friends. although that sucks, i still had a lot of fun playing and for a dollar, i say it's a great game. Heck i like it so much, I would have payed $15 for it. Maybe more. So i definately recommend it. Pick it up as soon as possible!
5356	1	a	As soon as I bought this game, I've non-stopped played it for alsomt 6 hours. It is so much fun and so addicting. I recommend this to everyone who loves first person shooter games. This game is better than most of my $50 games and I got it for $15!
5358	1	a	I mean it's only 99 cents so, why not get it.
5360	1	a	Awesome Game!  Believe it or not this is a great game to invest in if you enjoy first person shooter, or shooter games. I know the price of the game is a bit misleading on its value, but I assure you its more then worth it. There are many difficulties in this game, and you can earn your achievements pretty easy on all difficulties. I generally only play Survival as I am more of a co-op type person then PVP. In survival mode you basically have to defend you the generator from the on coming Dinosaurs mobs. As you get kills or team mates get kills you earn credits &amp; experience. The credits can be used to buy better weapons, upgrades, mods, etc at the end of each level. Out of the three classes I enjoy playing assault the most, and I like the special skill of assault which is a jetpack that allows you to get on top of rocks &amp; other places to get away from harms way.  What do you have to loose? Its only $0.99 &amp; if you like it awesome, if not get a refund?
5362	1	a	I admit that I didn't even know why Orion: Prelude was in my steam library and couldn't even remember how I aquired the game. Assuming it was a compulsion perchase, I angerly installed it so as to get at least a little time out of one of the many regretful purchases in my library.   Twenty minutes later the only thing that was real was the jungle, pitch black in the midst of a typhoon. The only light to see by were the bolts of lightning in the sky and the fire that spread accross the countryside. I'm standing on a hill fending off a living tide of velociraptors. My LMG running dry as a T-Rex charges, up my right flank. As I'm about to be eaten, my team mate broadsides the T-Rex with the APC, killing it. two of my teammates jump out of the back and start engaging the next wave, led by a prehistoric giant crocodile. I equip my shotgun and lept back into the fray.  Orion: Prelude is super fun and has some solid mechanics. It is fortunate that the action packed dinostorm never stops because there are some issues. One of the most glaring issues is that the high paced action can immediatly screech to a halt if you die. Depending on the scenario you may be able to only spawn at the begining of the round. There is no telling how long a round can be as there could be as few as 30 dinosaurs to as many as 300, and the earlier you die the longer you will wait. This applies to joining games as well and you can only drop in at the begining of rounds. The objective kept switching every round also, which was confusing. There is only one level with varying weather conditions, the graphics are ♥♥♥♥, the sound is ♥♥♥♥, nothing is clearly labled or explained, the default button mapping for the controller is unintuitive but the game is always on multiplayer so pausing to fix it is suboptimal but exiting the game to deal with it is even worse because you'll have to wait five minutes to get back into the game. on and on I could go with issues.  But in spite of a lot of glaring issues the game rocks. For doing a lot of things wrong it does a lot right. Again the shooter mechanics are solid but need to be polished. the game prevents being overwhelming by having shooting dinosaurs be the central focus and you'll be doing that from the word 'go.' upgrading yourself is easy once you try it the first time and it doesn't take long to get a loadout that works for you. Once you actually do change the controller mapping the gameplay will feel like putting on a glove. As it tuned out I had been given the game as a gift by one of my friends that bought a 4-pack and never picked it up. At the end of the day, the game needs work but is still wildly entertaining especially for its price.
5364	1	a	This game is ridiculous. While I certainly wouldn't have gotten it if it wasn't on sale, this game is still worthwile if you like killing dinosaurs.
5366	1	a	Look it was 99c for a co-op dino slaying FPS. How can you beat that? I experienced no bugs, and the UI is pretty easy to figure out, maybe with a few checks into the options for key commands in game.  So far every server I joined has had great players on it, so spend a buck and have a few hours of fun ;)  trog_79 in game, level 3 when I posted.
5368	1	a	i definly recomed this game Amaziing 
5370	1	a	It's alot of fun with friends. That being said, I need more friends.
5372	1	a	It's a little silly, a little janky and borderline broken in spots, but damn if it isn't fun. :) Worth $15 and a no-brainer if it goes on sale. Also, the recently re-worked Conquest mode (Dec. 2013 Arctic Update) is a blast if you've got a few hours to play through it and a few friends to play it with.
5374	1	a	It's ok i guess.
5376	1	a	This is a very fun game to play with friends. You can play a variety of different game mode on different maps. These game modes range from PvP to Co-Op. One fun game mode is Conquest where you have to defend a generator against dinosaurs in a CoD Zombie style.( more dinosaurs and more difficult dinosaurs appear as time goes on) overall very fun
762	0	a	it may look aowsome .. but it's not it's REALLY NOT ... :) if it's 0.99$ get it .. if it's not don't waste ur money :)
763	0	a	its a rubish game isnt it 
5378	1	a	Cuddly baby dinosaurs rampaging around to chaw your d!ck off. Would recommend.
5380	1	a	Glorious game, nothing more needs to be said.
5382	1	a	GET IT. PLAY IT. LIVE IT.
5384	1	a	It's a mediocre game. I'd recommend a mediocre game for 1$, however. I got this game for the same price as I would have a can of Arizona tea, and this managed to last a little longer. Definitely a concept that needs work, but again, not bad for 1$.
764	0	a	This game is funny for about 10 minutes and then you realize that it's awful and don't ever play it again. It's like trying to watch a movie that you think is funny-bad and just realize that it's bad-bad.
5386	1	a	Holy ♥♥♥♥ what a game for $0.99. I no ♥♥♥♥ punched a T-rex in da face.
5388	1	a	Quite unusual shooter. Fell in love within the first 10 minutes. Well done!
5390	1	a	Probably the best game on the steam market   10/10
5392	1	a	its bad
5394	1	a	This is really fun o.o The art style is a little incoherent/has the looks of a mobile game sometimes but It... It's fun! Like the video quotes say, it's like halo with dino horde mode.  And for 99 cents? Get it!   
5396	1	a	The game is all fun and good, but I feel its no fun without friends. You should mee around in it and have fun. The only thing that sets me off is the graphics of the trailer it does not have those graphics unless the current free week is diffrent or im doing something wrong, but the graphics in the trailer show something like Halo 5 the graphics I see in game are practically Halo 3 and its not my computer I can run WoW on the highest setting besides shadow render to the max and the quality of shadow. So it isnt my Pc I even checked settings for the graphics didnt see much change.
5398	1	a	I used to hate dis game. Now I liek dis gaem. I'd buy that for a dollar.
5400	1	a	Orion Prelude is an cheap FPS game.   Before the review, I would like to preface something, Orion Prelude is not the best FPS game. In regards to FPS, a gamer could boot up the classic TF2 for casual gameplay or CS:GO for a competitive, skill-based game. Orion Prelude is an FPS to play with a group of friends.  The player will usually play as a human (excluding game modes which allow the player to be a dinosaur). Playing a classic game against the AI is fun, until you realize the difficulty curve does not scale. The developers did not make the dinosaurs harder with each incoming wave, they only programmed more dinosaurs to spawn. Therefore, in games with more than two people it's simplistic to defeat the mission.  Playing with friends makes the game more fun. Doing 1v1 gun games can occasionally take 2 hours, while a deathmatch is full of paranoia and adrenaline. Every weapon in the game is more or less creaetive to a certain degree, whether it be light swords, arc guns, or giant robot mounts. The game can provide you and your friends many laughs in regards to dinosaur physics.  Should you buy Orion Prelude? Yes
5402	1	a	Most fun I have had for a dollar...except that time in Thiland
5404	1	a	Good game. Like Nazi Zombies but with dinosaurs and jetpacks.
5406	1	a	It got the ''feel'' of a good game, can't explain. GET IT
5408	1	a	umm... my pc is super crappy only about 5 fps but i still play this awsome game i recomend dis game 10/10 would play again. dont mind how long i playd its my pc freezzzzzzzzzzinggg alot =)
5410	1	a	The game in it's current state is already awesome - can't wait for all the coming updates/upgrades!  You get to play in a team with 5 against a hell of a lot of dinosaurs! Coop-mode is great, and I really enjoy it. Also you can play many different game modes (1v1, Team Duel, FFA Duels and so on...) and you can even play dinosaurs! So, didn't you always want to play as a T-Rex and feast on your enemies? Come on, you know you wanted to! Now you can do it!  Players seem to be very friendly, and helpful towards beginners - at least that's my experience so far.  And since you create your own servers to play with friends (or find servers created by other players) ping is not an issue at all. And if there is no server with the game mode you want to play - just create your own.  The game is fun, and the graphics are nice. WASD-controlled and just like the other FPS-shooters you know, so I was able to hop in and start killing some mean dinosaurs right away. You also earn credits by killing dinosaurs, which you can spend to upgrade your weapons and/or abilities during the match. NOTE: Those changes are not permanent, and credits are earned over and over again every match.  About the metascore: That's total nonsense. The game is far better, maybe around 76 to 81. So just don't give a hoot about that.
5412	1	a	I FREAKING LOVE THIS GAME. Orion: Dino Horde is not only good-looking but it combines two things i love, dinosaurs and guns. This game is a must play for any dino fan or any fps fan.
5414	1	a	its fun, still has some glossing that needs to be done, but definately worth the play
5416	1	a	Much Fun. Many Impress. Such value. Wow.
5418	1	a	LITERALLY THE BEST GAME ANYONE COULD EVER PLAY       EVER      BUY THIS GAME
5420	1	a	Pretty cool game and also the option of getting Steam trading cards from it is awesome! Thanks VALVE!
5422	1	a	This is absolutely THE BEST game you can EVER get for 50 cents.  IM NOT KIDDING, BUY IT
765	0	a	Basic Review: Interesting, but is a short lived game Purchase: I guess so...if you've really got nothing else to do. As this is a neutral review, I can not give this a thumb up.  This game imploys creative new approaches to the basic defense game. Dinosaurs attack your facilities and your team. You goal is to survive each way while upgrading to stay on top of it all.  This game is very fun, if you play it in small volumes. It can get old very fast though, it's very repetitive.
5424	1	a	Awesome game just a little bit laggy and not sure if it's my computer but it has bad motions like running and walking which made me a little bit dizzy when playing :P
5426	1	a	Recommended with a catch:   For the full $15 price? Of course not, that's absurdly high for the quality of the game.  For the $1 when it was on sale? Can't beat it for even a few laughs with some buddies. Pick it up (ON SALE ONLY, mind you) if you're bored and want something decidedly mediocre but oddly enjoyable...for a time. It's clunky, unpolished in places, and rather uninspired at times but is good for some stupid, brainless fun.  --I also can't believe that they get away with the editing and visual tweaking of the screenshots--the game DOES NOT look that good even on highest settings at full resolution. :\
5428	1	a	'1/10 there was no FOV slider' -TB
5430	1	a	7 hours play time and i have already slaughtered 11492 Dinos. I am a one man dino apocalypse!  Definitely worth the price, £0.59p at the time i bought it. Even playing it solo is fun.  Good bits: AI is fairly competent Dinos AI is too Real money shop actually IS cosmetic only for a change Plenty of weapons to choose from Map are big Custom difficulty (Prehistoric mode)  Mutators Community maps etc  Bad bits: Dinos tend to glitch into terrain, especially the big ones Could do with more armor variations Minor lag when achievements/lvl up notifications appear Cheating type user made maps  Over all it is a good game and at the price it is, there isnt much reason not to if you like FPS/Team based shooters or just like the idea of shooting dinos because Turok.
5432	1	a	Probably one of the dumbest most unrealistic games I have ever seen.  Also one of the most fun.  This game doesn't try to be real and gritty like so many games now days. It just tries to be fun and whats not to love? Dinosaurs, helicopters, tanks, mech suits, multiple unreal - like pvp modes, play as a dinosaur.  Using a laser sword to kill a triceratops? 420/69 GOTY - IGN
5434	1	a	'I bought this so I could 360 no scope a Tyranosauras Rex. I was not disappointed.'  At the time, being a 74 cents purchase, it was definitely worth it.
766	0	a	Edit: Auguest 29 2014  This is the second time this game has changed names after giving itself an update. Kinda fradulent since when does having an update give you the ability to change the name of your game from the original version, to Orion: Dino Horde, and now to Orion: Preulde? Short story sweet, the game is fun for the first day but then gets really boring. Not worth $1 imo. If you want to know more, you can read the rest of my review below or look up TotalBiscuit on youtube for gameplay and developement of this game.  Date: March 12 2013 Lots of reviews of this game says 'This game isn't as bad as the metacritic score says it is' or 'This game has improved a lot since the original.' Sorry to say, but if this game improved a lot, it wasn't much of a game to begin with. There's no tutorial at all so you're forced to jump into one of th five or so game modes all of which pales in comparison to survival. There's versus and capture the flag, but it's no Left 4 Dead--that is, the balance is totally off. All the dinosaurs suck except for the T-rex who can toss instadowning rocks (OP) and who can instakill any person close enough to them by swallowing them whole (Super OP). There's other dinosaurs who all boil down to Dinosaurs who all suck and the T-rex. There's tiny dinos who die in like 3 seconds of getting shot or the big ones who can survive getting shot, but who have problems getting kited all day. The marines don't have much variation in viable choices either. There's the assault, the support, the scout, and the assassin--all of whom gets their asses ran over by the hordes of dinosaurs except for the assault who has a jetpack that lets him sits in the mountains on the edge of the map and allows him to pick off the dinosaurs one-by-one while being untouchable to them.  Sure this game (or any game) is a steal at $1 but after about 2 hours of playing I had enough as I got bored of sitting up in a mountain peak and shooting down at the dinosaurs, running around to random checkpoints for unexplained goals throughout the map for up to at least 5 minutes, and playing games where people were only OP T-rexes or OP Assaults. The most fun I had in this game was driving around in a car and running over dinos while I was spamming #Orion:Driving Hit &amp; Run Simulator but that and the game gets old very fast as you soon realize every map is just an excuse to get to random waypoints for no reason which just slow down gameplay just to shoot more dinosaurs.
5436	1	a	a great game. the style of the game is like no other! i got this on a sale for 75p ($1) and it was a STEAL! the only bad thing about this game is that when i reload the gun is out of sync with my hand... i think its just my bad pc though... 8/10
5438	1	a	It's a great game to play with friends but usually this is how it goes  friend- Hey where are you  Me- Oh ya about that  friend- Come on help me out I'm surrounded by raptors  Me- Ya well I kinda got digested by a T-Rex friend- That's it I'm done I can't kill dinosaurs when ur busy being a piece of crap  Me- but..... friend- that's it I'm just going to get a rocket laucher and a helicopter and BLOW SOME DINOS UP!  WELCOME TO PRELUDE
5440	1	a	better than any ♥♥♥♥♥♥ i've ever had or ever will have
5442	1	a	This is one of the best mothertrucking, motherpooping and motherpeeing games I ever played! Its like Call Of Duty zombies but with dinosaurs and tons more guns, perks and gamemodes. Plus i got this game for 99 cents casue it was on the sale so its a very very extremely very good gameboy advanced game for only 99 cents know what I'm sayin G? They should put this game on Steam since it so good yo. Before i bought this game my D was like 2 inches, after I bought this game my D was still 2 inches but thats beside the point. Buy this game its amazing. This is my favorite Rockstar game GTA V step aside for this game. This is also the best Halo game ever made!
5444	1	a	i killed a tyrannosaurus rex. no team, no bombs, me and a rifle. i killed a trex with only a rifle. im the only person i know of in history to do this. remember me.
5446	1	a	This game is the best! It mixes a epic co-op experience with hard core gameplay and strategy! Your either fighting dinosaurs with epic looking futuristic weapons or battling each other!   I give this game 10/10 stars!  Even when i first got the game and played i knew it was gonna be one of my most favorite games!  Here's any example of my daily happy fun times in this game....  Step 1-Walk around the map and enjoy the peace  Step 2-Turn on the generator  Step 3-Get your butt to the weapons depot and get a machine gun you idiot!  Step 4-Take your freaken gun and kill some Dinos!!!!  Step 5-Get to any round i feel like because i love this game!  Step 6-Kill myself then end the game  Step 7-REPEAT!!
5448	1	a	10/10 would play again Has Dinosaurs
5450	1	a	Jetpack +100 136/100
5452	1	a	Great game! For 99 cents this game is a must buy! It has a great storyline, wonderful graphics, and is always a great time with friends or by yourself. this game is possibly one of the best on steam! 11/10 Would participate in the greatest dino beatdown of the century.
5454	1	a	Yanno... I didn't have any expectations to be blown, but, ended up quite pleased and rather surprised with this game. Excelente time waster, very fun to play, good dynamic, and a ♥♥♥♥ton of different game modes to last quite a while. If you didn't grab it yet, do it. Filthy cheap for the no attachments fun provided.
5456	1	a	I can not express the greatness of this creation
5458	1	a	TAKE GUN. SHOOT DINO.
5460	1	a	You don't need friends to have fun in this game, best 99 cents i ever spent
5462	1	a	I wonder why i got this game. i was probably tripping on my own shoes.
5464	1	a	such a funny games, playable games, and enjoyable games when you play it on solo player or multiplayer.
5466	1	a	Broke my computer 10/10
5468	1	a	Have you ever thought, what would happen if you add dinosaurs to halo? Neither have I but it works!
5470	1	a	For the price of a drink from Mc'Donalds, its a pretty solid game, still needs work but just buy it.   6/10
5472	1	a	The game is fun with friends but if you play it alone it is pretty boring.
5474	1	a	36 metascore rate? What they were thinking. This game is just fabulous. Besides that it have some minor bugs, it gives you hours of fun and teamplay. Very recommended for the ones that love big guns, ships, cars and dinosaurs.
5476	1	a	The game feels raw and cheap all over, yet it can be fun with friends and in spite of all the flaws, YES I can recommend this game... for 99 cents.
5478	1	a	I was first skeptical cause of the metascore. But like the other reviewers say, Orion: Dino Horde is actually pretty fun even though it still has its kinks. First time playing it I crapped my pants trying to escape a T-Rex. The game offers tons of customization and weapons, like Killing Floor. But in this case, substitute mutant freaks with flesh eating dinosaurs. I wasn't expecting to be carried off by a Pteranodon either. In all, great game, great updates so far. keep em coming!
5480	1	a	99 cents, shoot dinos with yor friends, bring me some pizza.
5482	1	a	Great game to play with friends.
5484	1	a	Dinosaurs? Check. Jetpacks? Check. More firepower than a National Guard battalion? CHECK. Grab your buddies and go harvest T-Rex Steaks.
5486	1	a	Hillariously bad mechanics make this game a MUST for groups. You can vehicle surf on tires, or the car istelf, making turrents usless compared to rediculously overpowered guns. I and my 2 friends laugh and have a great time. The game mechanics suck horrendus ♥♥♥, but it's still fun.
5488	1	a	Best game for the price, doesnt have the players it deserves, recommended if u have a group of friends u wanna play with from 5-10 friends
5490	1	a	I am a simple guyuy I liek memes I like games i like dinosaur this game is no memes but very fun ♥♥♥♥♥d dinosaur game If i want meme i play undertale, if i want fun i play ORION: Prelubed
5492	1	a	What can I say about this game?  Well.  Prelude sounds better than 'Dino Horde.'
5494	1	a	Shot Velocoraptor while flying on my jetpack. Got chased by giant crocodile 10/10
5496	1	a	The Greatest Game of All Time
5498	1	a	Sucks so hard that it's good again
5500	1	a	It's pretty good for an 80 cent game, I reckon it's worth more. It can be quite fun if you get it for your friends, and for just 2 euros, it's a bargain. dinosaurs / 10
5502	1	a	This game has almost replaced COD and battlefield for me – and for $1 as well! It’s definitely a great purchase even if it only entertains you for a week or two. Play solo or with people online and has Australian servers. Brilliant work.  Dont forget to increase the difficulty after the first 2 or 3 hours though.
5504	1	a	This game is sooo awesome! and cheap... It's sooo worth to buy it! its fun to play and it is really enjoyable! Buy it and play it with your friends!
5506	1	a	But ♥♥♥♥, it was 99 cents!
5508	1	a	Good Game. it is like Halo+Jurrassic Park+Killingfloor=Orion Dino Horde
5510	1	a	This game can be very fun and entertaining if you play with friends and get the teamwork aspect involved. It is very good for a game that costs $1.00//0.50.
767	0	a	I think this could have been a real hit had they just made a few simple changes to the gameplay, but as it stands it's a miserable game that really just doesn't make any sense. The problem is that the plot is just ridiculous and it’s badly executed too. I have to confess that when I played the game it was riddled with bugs, so it may have improved by the time you read this, but I am afraid I just can't recommend it at all.
5512	1	a	sever of this game really hard to connect and have some lag when play. But it is a good game to try and play with price 0.99$
5514	1	a	...Holy HELL! If anyone decides to play this game, make sure you have very quick reaction times or know how to run around screaming with good reaction times. This game is VERY HARD and glitchy to the core. If it ever gets fixed up in the future, I am pretty sure it would be a bit decent for a shooter up game. Otherwise, if anyone plays this, stick inside the buildings always............That's my only advice.
5516	1	a	no matter what all the reviews say, this game is fun as hell. especially when you have a good friend or a couple to play with. i recommend to anyone who has a mic and likes playing as a team.
5518	1	a	Best $0.49 Lost simulator ever. 7/10  Seriously... its less than half a dollar. If it entertains you for 15 minutes, then you got your money's worth...
5520	1	a	Everyone should get this game, it is absolutely amazing, i showed my friends and we all love it :D
5522	1	a	Fired a minigun on a jeep at a charging triceratops, was flipped and thrown through the air while still manning the minigun, took out a few dinos while flying, and landed 30 feet up on a small mountain.   I was able to maintain a stable firing position from there. 11/10 would fly again.
5524	1	a	cant even start, game of the year 10/10
5526	1	a	For a dollar (and my first Steam online purchase) this game is amazing for what it is (except the little bugs). Good amount of dino's, plenty of weapons and perks and stuff, badass murderizing. It's great for $1
5528	1	a	ORION: Prelude has a lot of issues, but it's a lot of fun and it's really cheap, especially right now that it's on sale for 74 cents. Even the full price of 99 cents is probably less than the developers deserve for this game, even considering all of its flaws. The game plays like a budget mixture of Halo: CE, Borderlands, and Killing Floor: After selecting your class (One of three) you and your teammates get a short period of time to buy weapons, upgrades, and vehicles, after which a wave of various kinds of dinosaurs attack you and your power generator, which you must protect. If your whole team is killed or your generator is knocked offline for too long, you lose. Players respawn between waves, when you have the opportunity to buy more stuff with the money you earn from killing dinosaurs. Every so often, your team needs to travel to another area of the map and kill one or more large dinosaurs, which are often stupidly hard to beat, and cause smaller dinosaurs to spawn as long as they are alive. Once that wave is completed, various vehicles spawn, depending on the wave - many of which are quite reminiscent of those from Halo, including one very obvious Warthog shout-out.  ORION: Prelude isn't a pretty game by any means, but it's a lot of fun, and definitely worth the price. Pick it up.
5530	1	a	ORION: Dino Horde is an awesome game to play with friends. It combines everything you love about wave based multiplayer with the exciting concept of facing herd after herd of bloodthirsty Dinosaurs. This game is constantly being updated and developer Spiral has quite outdone themselves on the latest. Adding vehicals and open world maps has drastically changed the games function and flow, but it's all for the better.  The game's price point is average for a multiplayer-only game in my opinion, but Spiral has kept the in-game purchases limited to cosmetic items and their pricing isn't too hard on the wallet. This combined with how hard Spiral is working on the game and the limitless content that cound come in the future makes Dino Horde one of the best values in co-op today.
5532	1	a	Well its like the best of Halo with the best of your childhood dino toys. Its like everything you ever wanted in a game. Because its purple dinosaurs and explosions
5534	1	a	But hell it was 99 cents!
5536	1	a	Very nice game for 0.99ct man 420 blaze it every day and every night
5538	1	a	It will be better this game use COD's engine.
5540	1	a	this game is bad really its not that good at all but when i baught it for a dollor it was amazing its just one of those games you have to play with friends a bunch of people killing dinos thats what u get it would also help if you turned of your brain a bit theres numerous issues that pop up but all in all for a dallor it was 100% worth it
5542	1	a	Great fun, would recomend for all fps fans.
5544	1	a	worth $1, for the weirdly addictive fun that is Halo: Dinosaurs.
5546	1	a	For the price this really is sick.  If you are a (studious) student or someone with a stressful job, this is the game that will kill all that stress, if you combine it with a group voice call of friends.  Stabbing raptors while invisible may seem like a gimmicy sentence, but it is truly fun.  The weapons you can get are also pretty fun!
5548	1	a	Shooting dinosaurs AND getting high tech weapons? This game is awesome!
5550	1	a	Best game ever made! buy it now its awsome :)
5552	1	a	This game is great with a friend or two. Controls are a little hard to get used to but once you do the gameplay is awesome! Satisfying as all hell. If you're considering buying it, BUY IT!
5554	1	a	This game is good. It is basicly like COD zombies with dinosaurs and Halo guns.
5556	1	a	I picked up this game, and I was like, k. Dinosaurs. Then I started playing and proceeded to Katniss T-Rexes left and right. I discovered my inner Katniss with this game, and had **** tons of fun while doing it. We are Katniss. We are one.  All seriousness, fricken awesome game. Definitely deserves a 10/10.
5558	1	a	This game has a great idea and the core gameplay is super fun. It's really fun to play with friends and is well worth the price.  I just have one problem with this game: It runs like ♥♥♥♥ on my computer and desperatly needs to be optimized.  Other than that, 10/10.
5560	1	a	Dinosaurs and lightsabers. What more can you ask for?
5562	1	a	Give it a second try, I hated it at first but it turns out to be not all bad.
5564	1	a	Killed T-Rex with lighting sword 10/10 would kill again
5566	1	a	Hey yo, it used to suck. but now it doesn't. It's pretty average and that's not a bad thing, the gunplay is average, the graphics are average, the gameplay in general is average. You're paying a dollar for a 20 dollar game. Just buy it. You can get a lot of enjoyment.  Then again there are safe spots and the jetpack needs to be removed from assault or something because it completely breaks the game. But still, worth the price.
5568	1	a	Great CO-OP Game. For less than $3 it's a must have! Buy the four pack and you have a night full of fun with friends. Like COD:Zombies? Then Get This Game!
5570	1	a	Defintely woth the 49 cents
5572	1	a	Cool game, nice weapon and vehicles, as you can see playing it the programmer worked so hard! Recomned!
5574	1	a	this game is hella fun!!  lots of customization, MANY gamemodes, its weird hows not everytone playing it atm! for .99c its a surebuy
5576	1	a	Really fun game. Got really bad reviews at release and it deserved them as far as I've heard. they really improved the game and I bought it on the 1 euro sale, played with a friend today and we had a ton of fun. Can only recommend it, especially if it goes on sale again!
5578	1	a	It's pretty damn awesome. I haven't learned the strengths to win much yet, but I am still enjoying losing to these ridiculous monsters!
769	0	a	First of all....this is a bad game! Don't get fooled like I did. I thought: well it can't be THAT bad,but it is. To be fair, I bought it for 99 cents so I guess it's a good deal,but it's not worth like 5 $ or something.
5580	1	a	Great game!
5582	1	a	Short Review: Improved since Orion Horde, but largely remains to be seen. There's still plenty of room for improvement.  Full Review: - Gameplay The game concept is simple. For campaign, you have to survive a group of invading dinosaurs that will only invade you after you start your first generator and after which, you have to drive/walk/fly a long distance to activate your inappropriately-marked second base. The 'Capturing Base' message only appeared after I was some distance away from move the marker and the base itself.  For survival, it's self-explanatory. For PvP, it's self-explanatory. For sudden death, it's self-explanatory (if you've played other games that have this). Every other mode other than campaign revolves around these 3 modes, only difference lies in whether it's a team or one man army or which weapons you get to use.  - Changes in Gameplay The last time I played this game was close to a year ago. I played only Singleplayer and gameplay was at best average. You go around capturing bases, shooting dinosaurs, and perhaps exploiting the map to your advantage. Everything else was left to yourself. There are 3 markers indicating where to get weapons, skills and vehicles. That was about it. Even after the transition from Orion Horde to Prelude, I found it rather boring. Along with a non-existent support team, I decided to abandon the game.  Many months later, I saw their latest video advertisement showcasing 'how much their game has improved'. Reluctantly, I decided to give it a try. (To my surprise,) they had actually improved on Singleplayer mode. You no longer fight alone and have four (relatively dumb) teammates which will help you when you go down, without desperately trying to get a last wind. Campaign-wise, I haven't managed to get pass the first few bases because the AI wouldn't follow and I ended up getting plummeted by two triceratops. That wasn't fun (to die and lose), but nonetheless interesting.  - Graphics/Visual Appeal Despite the 'massive overhaul' from Orion Horde to Prelude, there was not much change in the menu layout and character design. Pretty much every customisation requires you to buy for real money (or earned by unlocking numerous achievements), and the graphics are rather dated (pixelated with its bad geometrical shapes). The only thing that impressed me was the main menu background and that's about it.  In the game itself the developers have noticeably added the weather effect. Your screen will occasionally blur due to the snow and there is a consistent (but annoying) white border around your screen because of snow blowing on your face (at least that's what I interpreted it as). The added weather effects are appreciated and helps you to 'focus' on the game. However, other than that first glance, every other models such as the vehicles, weapons, et cetera are pretty much mediocre. The text do not scale well with the resolution and exceeds the screen (so the skill name and description is cut off for me) and the border between the background and the text is not consistent. Skill icons are also exactly the same as when the game costed USD15.00 before the overhaul to Prelude, which would have been fine if the icon were not extremely visually unappealing. Think of the icons as having secondary school or fresh college students (not graduates) drawing them. It's not simple enough to be 'simple' or complex enough to be 'complex'. It's just... Well, the trailers don't show you the skill icons, do they?  - Bugs (?) There are some noticeable features that I can't really describe it as bug or glitch or whatsoever, because I have no idea if they were meant to be a feature or a bug. For example, you are able to buy the same skill as many times as you want, so long you have the credits from killing dinosaurs. I have no idea whether buying the same skill again have any upgrades (because the skill description remains exactly the same and there is no indication of current level) or it's just bugged and wasting my credits (because even the skill icon colour, everything else remains the same). Sometimes I am also spawned way, way, too far away from the base when I just started the campaign and have to activate the generator to start the game. Again, I have no idea whether being spawned 400 metres away from your main and first base is a feature or a bug.  - Verdict By now, you'd probably wonder why the hell am I recommending this game after such negative experience and I have only 3 hours on record. I'd say the game is actually worth that $1.00 if you have friends to play with. It's fun for a while, and you could probably find some easter eggs here and there and explore the terrain. The terrain is rather big, but there's no sandbox option for me to explore so I can't rate the maps very accurately and I'll leave it out from the gameplay part. After all, with dumb AI, you can't do much (albeit more than without AI). However, if you got no friends who will play this with you (or can't seem to find one) and/or the game reverts to its original Orion Horde price of USD15.00, I'd say skip it. It's seriously not fun playing alone. I would have given this a mixed review if possible, or else a bad review. But for its price, it's hard to argue.
5584	1	a	DEFEND THE HARVESTER! 5/5 Would repair Harvester more.  _______  Nice game, might be little bit repetive since all the gearing and stuff. You get higher gear for higher difficultie ofc. Gameplay is simple, you can play top down or in third person mode. Some say this is pretty much Destiny clone so expect that kind of game. I dont know myself about it since I havent play Destiny. There is bunch of diffrent Gamemodes, Survival and defend the objective (Harvester) Bunch of diffrent Guardians to choose from, personaly I like pyro(shotgun primary and shotgun is the best :D) Diffrent guardians have diffrent special abilities. Little bit optimization after that game is great! I really enjoyed it, and I suggest you to pick up this if you like shooting dinos, topdown- or third person shooters,co-op games or just grinding and gearing.
5586	1	a	Vastly improved since release, originally titled ORION: Dino Beatdown. Don't let the Metacritic score fool you, this game is now a shadow of it's former terrible self. The constant updates and bugfixes have transformed this game from being a very bland and broken basic shooter, to a very fun co-op survival game. The amount of equipment, customization, and vehicles; combined with many months of simplifing the games UI, game mechanics, and constant bug fixes make the entire package a very fun way to play.  The sheer scale of battles, and the fast-paced combat make it fun. If you get a bunch of friends in on it, you'll be coordinating air strikes, tank movement, and infantry battles all in one wave. It's really something just to see two VTOL's fly above you and reign down missle fire, as two tanks flank from both sides... with troops pouring from either side, engaging a T-Rex which is more then enough to take out everything around it.  The AI has been vastly improved, as well. When the game first came out, you would have raptors blindly rush you in a straight line... and pterodactyls swooping in predictiable patterns. Now, the enemies juke and run around, the pterodactyls are hard to shoot and become the bane of any VTOL pilot. Granted, don't expect any amazing AI here, it's still a horde game and horde AI still crowns... but the game is challanging, even if you have the credits and augments to last. Underestimate a triceritops, and it'll destroy your tank in two hits with its charge attack.  In fact, the best way to describe the feeling while playing this game is like living the movie 'Avatar', but instead of Navi... you have face-ripping dinosaurs.  The game has vastly improved on bug fixes, graphics, and optimization since it came out, as well. No longer do you have memory leaks crashing your game, or textures failing to load. No longer does the game lag on high-end systems, and the graphics looking akin to a grainy mess on your screen, hidden by lens flare. The style, while still basic, has been vastly improved; comparable to the style of Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon. Lots of high bloom space colors, lasers, and heavy weaponary... with vechicles that look as much retro as they do futuristic; this game feels right at home... combining a 'Rad' vibe, high-tech space, and a cheesy 'B' movie feeling. The environments are lush, and the maps are large and immersive. A day-time/night-time cycle affects your visibilty and shifts your gameplay. For example, while playing on a tundra map the cold air at night will cause your visor to freeze if you stay outside in the dark for too long, requiring you to find someplace warm. Rainstorms and snowstorms can also hamper your vision, giving the dinos a leg up to ambushes.  The games three classes (assault, support, and infiltrator) have gotten a major upgrade since launch. No longer is the medic gun useless on the support toon... and no longer does the assault dominate maps. The classes seem very balanced, having their own weapons and play styles. An augment system is also in place, which allows you to purchase in-game upgrades with in-game credits you earn per round... allowing you to gain class specific upgrades like double jetpack energy for the assault, or that the support's medic gun can heal structures and vechicles. Later augments will even allow you to purchase and use other class specific weapons, like being a 'boost-sniper' assault... or being a cloaked minigun assassin; as well as having the ability to canabalize raptors for health, earn more credits, or even cause the enemy who kills you to die as well. However, augments arn't permanent... and during rounds you have a finite amount of lives. Not only does dying during a wave cost you a life, but you loose all your augments that you've purchased; giving a larger penalty to death then most games do.  This game has the standard assortament of game modes like deathmatch, team deathmatch, king of the hill; along with having duel modes for both 1v1 and team. The standard horde mode exists as well, called 'survival'... but the meat and potatoes of this game is in it's conquest system, which will allow you to experience those large battles that you see on the screenshots. Players have to fight through waves of enemies, generating credits and protecting their power generator, then use those credits for upgrade, equipment, and vehicles. There's also a 'Rampage' mode that allows humans versus human dinosaurs... so you can live your dream of being a T-Rex and eating people.  The game also features an in-game store with microtransactions, using Spiral Coins:  1,000 Coins - $1.00 6,000 Coins - $5.00 13,000 Coins - $10.00 75,000 Coins - $50.00  Thankfully, this store is PURELY cosmetic with most items costing $1 dollar. No xp boosts, or in-game upgrades... the most you can purchase are hats and skins for your marine or dino. At most, I can see just spending a max of 6,000 coins to get a character the way you want him to look, unless you want to go deeper with customization.  The game also has persistant stat tracking and a levelling system, however the system is very static... only unlocking set upgrades per each level.  The few things I can say bad about this game is that the maps and waves in conquest mode still seem too large. Gathering your entire army to move from base A to base B after you've spent 10 waves defending base A really doesn't make you feel like that base is 'yours'. Also, some weapons are more overpowered than others; and some items aren't that useful to invest your time into (IMHO, the flame turret). On top of that, dinos tend to 'pop in' if they're too far away... making a hunt for a large dino that you can idenifty close by a bit harder to locate. Also, the populations for game modes seem to be a bit low in my taste, with conquest allowing up to 5 people per server. Other modes have different population caps, but overall it feels small. The menu UI structure also is a bit hard to get used to... with the whole menu UI coming off a bit cheap. Granted, the old menu system from two years ago was DREADFUL, and this is an improvement... it's still not up to par with most games.  However, these are nitpicks for a game that really has been risen from the ashes of it's former self. The developers are very active in the games future, and this game does have the love and dedication of a passion project come to life. There's constant free updates to this game, and new features being added all the time; as well as having the team be very approchable with ideas and suggestions. With the changes I've seen with the past two years... and (at the time of writing) a new version of the game in development which will expand on this game, allowing for new features... including a persistant open-world game mode, ala Planetside 2... I can safely say that this game has a bright future.  If you had met me two years ago and asked about this game, I would have told you to never play it... to stear clear, and forget about it... If you had bought it, to try and ask for a refund.  Nowadays, I'd be asking if you wanna buddy up and kill some dino's in a APC. It's improved that much, and I'd be MORE than willing to give it a recommendation. It's cheap, it's fun, it's OOZING with Sci-Fi goodness, and there arn't many games out there like it.
5588	1	a	This game is fun, and a great value.  -Coop and PvP multiplayer modes. -Coop has bots for singleplayer and Multiplayer. -A variety of flying and ground vehicles. -Tons of achievments, some of them are quite funny. -Plenty of weapons and upgrades to choose from each play through.
5590	1	a	It is a really fun game with dinosaurs. Halo with dinosaurs is the easiest way to describe it. The game is really, REALLY cheap and for that reason alone you should get this game. The optimization isn't amazing, especially since this game looks like a launch Xbox 360 title. The framerate sometimes gets pretty bad, at around 50fps, and it is bad because this game looks pretty bad. Surely, it is not too bad - definitely acceptable, but nothing too special. Anyway, you should totally get this game. It is fun, if not a little easy for some people, but worth playing for at least 4 hours.
5592	1	a	this game is good but if you dont like something that can get repeatitive then dont get it I got it because it was a dollar so I got my moneys worth so if you want it get it on sale it is on often
5594	1	a	i played it with low spek, even though i feel heavy lag, but that wont hold me down to play this get gun, get skill, buy bow, ez unlimited ammo 9/10 would play again when i buy high spek laptop
5596	1	a	Punch a T-Rex to death after it wrecked your tank!  Ride a giant Crocodile!   Awesome game!
5598	1	a	7.5/10   Orion Prelude is a interesting game, and for $1 its completely worth it.
5600	1	a	Good engine graphics,can be a ps2 games,cheap :) and many sarcasm in this review :)
5602	1	a	Great fun and can't wait for the new updates!
5604	1	a	i wasnt really sure about this game...... BUT ♥♥♥♥ IT WAS 99 CENTS! (on a more serious note its a good game for 99 cents)
5606	1	a	Surprisingly addictive. Play it with friends.
5608	1	a	I..cant stop playing you monsters. For $0.49 its so amazing. This game is soo addicting
5610	1	a	it's like the low budget evolve thats actually fun
5612	1	a	Good Zombie game with friends. DLC's are cool but not nessicary. (If you are going to buy DLC's wait untill the go on sale, they go on sale offten.)
770	0	a	no seriously. no one should ever buy this game. not even for €0.99
5614	1	a	10/10 best game you could get for $1
5616	1	a	Great Game! Way Better than Before, So much fun!! You have to Play it to believ me, Its GREAT I love it 99999999999999999999999999999999FriedNoodles/10
5618	1	a	This game, oh man. When you get friends together this can be really fun. Fighting off hordes of dinos, having satisfaction for each head you blow off. You can fight to survive, so if a dino kills you, you kill them back and BAM you're alive! I suggest this for those with friends that want to play this. So far, good game. -12/-10
5620	1	a	Spent the entirety of a game running over small dinosaurs in a car with 'Get it on the floor' by DMX playing in the background.  10/10
5622	1	a	Good Game, worth the money!
5624	1	a	Halo, CoD (But better) and a host of other games smashed into one....AND DINOS. Who could ask for more? I loved it the moment I started playing, and bought it soon after!  Amoung the gamemodes, Survival, Free For All, team deathmatch, CTE (Capture the egg) and more!  Strongly suggest getting it, and help keeping this game alive, soooo much fun! 9/10  What could be improved is some of the multiplayer aspects; such as: While in F4A, enemys do not see the damage they;ve done to you when you've killed them. Not only is this frustrating, but they mistake it for you 'hacking' ultimately leading to un-kind words being thrown at said parties. Apart from that, I LOVE THE GAME!
5626	1	a	This game has come a long ways. It doesn't feel like the same game and that why you should give props to developers who stuck with it and made it bettter.
5628	1	a	Glitchy, unoptimized, garbage. If you enjoy generic tower-defence games and have a computer strong enough to run the terrable graphics, go ahead. The only reason it's worth it is because it's 99 cents. If it were 5 dollars I'd say it's not worth.
5630	1	a	Payed $1.49 for a 4 pack for me and my bros. Got at least $2.45 worth of fun out of it
5632	1	a	I'm not entirely sure why the score is so low. I quite enjoy this game and find it to be an extremely fun romp with a friend. We played for hours and didn't want to switch to anything else!
5634	1	a	Bought 5 four packs for $15 and sold the game for a key each on TF2Outpost
5636	1	a	It's worse than having T-Rex arms
5638	1	a	Shot a Triceratops in the face with a rocket launcher while nearing death. ♥♥♥♥♥♥ him off and got sent flying to my death. T-Rex threw a boulder into my face right before a pterosaur of some sort grabbed me. Got loose and fell to my death. 10/10, would have my ♥♥♥ handed to me by dinosaurs again.
5640	1	a	Tokyo drift into dinosaurs and the game's announcer says something about pizza  10/10
5642	1	a	Usually I try to avoid horde survival games like Serious Sam, but oh boy for a dollar, it is really fun to play. Its fun to play with friends and blame them for not healing you. Forever alone? you can play with close-to-useless AI bots to play with!  Also you can ride a dino while raining bullets on their face. 11/10
5644	1	a	Dinosaurs + guns + multiplayer + cars, count me in.  9.5/10
5646	1	a	This is amazing with friends and very intense. 7.25/10
5648	1	a	Good game. Enjoyable when you're bored. Easy achievments aswell.  9/10
5650	1	a	Amazing gameplay, and concept. Sure, its dinosaurs...Could be like aliens, or something....But its awesome!
5652	1	a	Pros- Fun horde gameplay Huge amounts of weapons DINOSAURS Mechs Tanks VTOLS Three classes Dinosaurs Swords Great looking graphics Reminicent of HALO Mulitple gamemodes Co-op PVP You can hover around a T Rex with a jetpack shooting it with a bow and arrow  Cons- Maps all seem similar Takes time to get guns  Hitboxes are buggy Random lag Some people on servers are evil  Overall- 8/10 would bang again
5654	1	a	Seriously a fun game. The graphics are what appear to be Cell Shaded like Borderlands. The leveling system is easy so you don't have to do a lot of grinding for unlocks. The sound effects are ok. Pretty generic. There's a lot of game modes available the one i like best is the horde mode. Its the only mode i've played thus far. The maps are well layed out and look awesome. My all time favorite graphical part of this game is the rain, snow, and frost that's on the screen. Even on the winter maps you have frost all around your visor. And when you end up ice frost over the entire visor once you go indoors it wil melt away which is really cool.   My suggestion while playing this game is have some music of your own playing in the background. It really helps from getting bored with the game. its a great game to come home to after a long day at work and just chill with some music,
5656	1	a	The Best game over with good graphics and anomations!!!!
5658	1	a	It's pretty good. Lots of action, non-stop. The concept is very well done. It's a little unstable at some points - fairly glitchy. The sounds need to be updated as well. I recommend it though. 4.5/5.
5660	1	a	not that many people play this so not many servers. great graphics though!
5662	1	a	Love it
5664	1	a	Pretty fun: The only thing missing is an unlimited survival mode. I don't get why there are things for 20k credits if I can only make that much by buying nothing rounds 1-9. e.e But overall it's a decent game, esepcially for 99 cents.
5666	1	a	It's so terrible it's good.
5668	1	a	A game that tries way to little to actually be its own game.  Instead it tries to take things from other popular games Slow motion time (Zed Time from Killing Floor) Large ingame store with cosmetics and other things to dress up your character (Team Fortress 2, Planetside 2, CS:GO and many more..) The game's animations are clunky, the voice dialogues make dialogues from Ride to Hell: retribution sound like a dream.   The dinosaurs sound horrible, the maps look horrible and the game in its entirety just feels incomplete.  But ♥♥♥♥ It was 99 cents!  So if you buy it don't expect anything amazing, you get what you pay for.
5670	1	a	If you're a fan of Halo: Reach's FireFight mode and love shooting dinosaurs, then this is certainly your game.
5672	1	a	Like Killing floor + Turok, but with dinos, and the wonderfully large ones that will chomp you in half, or grab you by the leg and carry you 80 feet in the air, only to let go and you fall to your doom! (unless you choose assault class, you have a jet pack)
5674	1	a	awesome game for its price. A lot of fun with friends
5676	1	a	very fun. u wont reget buying this.
775	0	a	Played for 10 minutes...  NOPE
5678	1	a	Best dinosaur-quickscope simulator out there.  Wonna get rekt by a t-rex and fly out of the map trying to understand what the f*** is going on? Well this is game for you.
5680	1	a	Didn't give me a headache like other cheap games 10/10
5682	1	a	I found this game by complete accident while browsing the steam store. Seeing it only cost $0.99, I was intrigued to try it out. I got some friends to play with me, and had an absolute BLAST.    ABOUT THE GAME:
5684	1	a	Just bought the game, seems good so far, not too many problems, really fun but then again I like fps.
5686	1	a	the devs took a crap on their keyboards. 3 years later they turned that ♥♥♥♥ into gold!!
5688	1	a	One of the sleeper hits of 2012!
5690	1	a	You can stack a medic on a mech on a tank and be invincible. Best game on Steam 12.967/10.
5692	1	a	The game is definatly worth the dollar game wise, but when you do play, if you find a good game, prepare to never leave becuase it is seemingly impossible to get a game with actual people in it. I'm either getting disconnected while I'm connecting or i'll loose connection to host, and every other server is full so theres nothing else to do but stare at your screen. Then i thought, hey i'll just start a server! nope. Sat there for a good while waiting for people and nobody joined.  TL;DR Good game with bad matchmaking. Fix for the matchmaking would make this game amazing
5694	1	a	Really fun, just don't take it seriously
5696	1	a	This is my favourite game that definitely isn't similar to Halo if Halo had dinosaurs in it.
5698	1	a	When I was the metascore I was somewhat worried, but I tried the game when it was free for 7 days; although I've only played for 2 or so hours the game is worth the cash, especially if you have friends who are willing to play too, but you can always find games online if you don’t.  The game has a nice feel to it. Like Killing Floors except in this game you kill a crapload of dinos. The game does sometimes feel cheap with the whole hip fire not being accurate at all, but down sight you will have no problem. It was pretty amazing to be chased by a T rex, makes your heart pump and leaves you with the feeling of what else is coming... well there are many more dinos and T rex is not the biggest one either.  Ignore the score, the game has been polished enough to enjoy with friends.  
5700	1	a	I rode on a Pteranodons back. 10/10 would fly again.
5702	1	a	Best, or Worst, 99 cents you'll ever spend, depending how you look at it, Those who judge a game for every little detail will find it to be a terrible mess. Those who accept the game for what it is (a game that costed you next to nothing) will find it a fun and joy-filled game.
5704	1	a	Awesome game really interesting i recommend it
5706	1	a	Oh this game is lagggy. but fun
5708	1	a	Absolutely rediculous, however, that is what makes it really fun. Drive a tank, man a mech, fly a hover ship thingie! It's definitely worth checking out on the free weekend or picking up for a dollar for some good laughs to perk yourself up! xD 8/10 This rating is so high because it wouldn't be as great without its many flaws. XD   www.twitch.tv/crescenda 
5710	1	a	Its a fun game. Shoot dinosaurs. The end.
5712	1	a	It's like   Skyrim   HALO with   guns   dinosaurs.
5714	1	a	I am not normally a first person shooter type of player, but Dino Horde definately lets me break out of my norms. It isn't just myself and my friends randomly trying to kill each other, but instead we're all trying to figure out new and faster ways to brutally murder the big bad dinosaur!  The hilarity of it all is the fact that I'm fighting long-extinct dinosaurs with futuristic weapons, and I'm still barely on par!
5716	1	a	Incredibly fun game. The metascore is the rating for the previous game before it was over hauled so don't let that scare you. Overall a wonderful dino-killing experience and a great multiplayer experience.   8/10
5718	1	a	The optimisation could be better, but otherwise it's alright.
5720	1	a	The metascore of this game is very misleading in my opinion, I don't know how bad this game was when is was released but now I think it's really good now. I don't think this game is supposed to be taken too seriously as it is far from realistic but it should be considered as a fun game to play with your friends (or alone like me). Shooting hundreds of dinosaurs has never been this much fun.
5722	1	a	It has dinosaurs and its .99 why not buy it?
5724	1	a	Excellent game.  Beautiful graphics if you have the PC for them, fast-paced gameplay, intense dinos versus humans combat, a wide variety of vehicles to choose from, and it can be very challenging at times. The environment weather-effects are well done and look very realistic, they also add an element of difficulty. It's hard to shoot dinosaurs when it's almost pitch black and raining. The visor effects caused by weather are also very interesting. Your visor can get frosty or covered with rain, making visibility limited.  I bought this game on sale for $0.75 and it was worth every penny. Some people give it a bad rap, but I have no clue why. Who doesn't like shooting dinosaurs with machine guns, driving tanks around and using a jetpack? Even if you only play it once or twice, it's well worth the regular price of $0.99. It's fun to play with friends while voice-chatting, I've even played with some Twitch streamers. I would reccomend this game to pretty much anybody. It's a heck of a lot of fun. Besides, even if you don't care for it, it's less than a dollar.
5726	1	a	Knifed a T-rex to death 10/10
5728	1	a	Solid shooter, Dino AI sometimes a little strange, but tons of fun to play. Would recommend.
5730	1	a	I love this new farming simulator 8/17 Birthday cards would 360 a t -rex again
5732	1	a	I bought this game when it was called Orion: Dino Beatdown. They changed it then to Orion: Dino Horde, It is now called Orion: Prelude.  The game is worth $0.99 if your body 'don't turn cold' purchasing this game you really haven't lived.
5734	1	a	First of all I want to say congratulations TREK Industries, for making a revolutionary product that will change the way we look at games forever. I have logged over 500 hours in this game on a seperate account and bought it again for this one and all of my friends just to prove my loyalty to the product. Now for the actual review.  Orion: Prelude is an amazing game that can be easily compared to AAA titles such as Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, the Halo franchise, the Counter Strike titles, and is better than mostly all FPS indie titles out there.   Graphics: Oh my god the graphics. This is a timeless piece of art that will be revered for as long as video gaming is alive. The graphics are simply timeless and they make the enviroment look absolutely beautiful. Low graphics in this game are basically equivilent to Ultra graphics in Far Cry 4. Water reflections are amazingly vivid, the dinosaurs are textured amazingly. Really nothing else can be said but this is an absolute must have game for anybody who enjoys beautiful scenery and amazing gameplay.  AI: If you can call it AI... it feels like you're actually playing with real people when offline. The grunts that help you move and act like they were real war veterans and move into and out of cover as well as taking positions to give them the upper hand. Advanced manuevers are no problem for this AI. Aside from the humans, the dinosaurs are superb as well. Amazing tracking, great movement recognition. Be careful, these things can spot you from a mile away.  Gameplay: This gameplay is honestly some of the best I have ever experienced. The best way to describe it is a mix of Call of Duty, Halo, and the balance of Counter Strike. While in the game I have had extremely intense situations where the entire team relyed of me to win. Its stuff like that that makes the game fun. In one instance I was being charged by several velociraptors and a T-rex. I turned on my absolutely flawless cloaking device and fled the scene back to the hut where i bought my sniper rifle and killed each and every dinosaur to win the game. Lets say i was sweating after that intense experience and was extremely proud of my self and my abilities to master this amazing game.  Overall I think this is a must have for any video game player looking for an amazing, intense FPS situation with not only good graphics and fun gameplay, but with balance and a cheap price as well. Honestly, this game should be at LEAST 10$ for a copy. I have bought it for all of my friends and we currently all enjoy the game together and play it whenever we have a chance. Keep up the amazing work TREK and make sure you buy this game before the price goes up! It's definitely worth the money!
5736	1	a	I managed to hang a tank off a cliff and shot dinosaurs with it. 11/10 would physics again
5738	1	a	This game is like dinosaurs on steroids it really made you rage quit when a stegosaurus dash onto you  10/10  recommended for dino lovers  Try no scope the raptors
5740	1	a	This Game Is 8/8 M8 Must Get This Game
5742	1	a	Awesome game to play over lan with your friends
5744	1	a	a game for fun with a good price
5746	1	a	Orion Prelude is the ridiculousness of awesome that I didn't know I needed.
5748	1	a	Come on d00d, its a dollar, need I say more?
5750	1	a	about this game a little bit laggy 
776	0	a	I started this game being very excited: ''Powered on Unreal Engine''- Wow, this game looks cool! Nope, this game just suck. The gamplay is very rusty, graphics are ugly and there are just a few of servers.  5/10 dinosaurs
5752	1	a	The most ridiculous game you can get for under a buck!
5754	1	a	I saw the video, because i wanted to know what kind of game that is and... wow ... what can i say ... THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER!!!!! The video was so good that i had to buy this. Everybody says that this game has bugs. I say this game IS a bug. But is not that the thing that makes the game funny ? 
5756	1	a	Triceratops flipped my tank 2000ft in the air and killed itself  11/10
5758	1	a	They turned this from one of the worst games of all time to a pretty decent game. That is some dev willpower.
5760	1	a	Worth the 0.99c, 10/10 would kill dinosaurs again.
5762	1	a	Have you ever wanted to just go nuts on dinosaurs? What about going nuts with tons of weaponry including a sword, gatling gun, and auto pistols? What if the dinos your killing came in massive, unrelenting hoards made of many varying dino types? This game is for you if you answered yes to any of these questions. I myself bought the game not expeccting much besides a fiew hours (maybe) of shooting things. Instead i was met with DAYS of fun packed, dino killing action. This game touched down on my inner child of wanting to blow stuff up and shoot huge guns with crazy power, and also having aspects of cooperative play. I have only played the survival mode of this game because it was exactly what i was looking for, and look at how many hours i have gotten out of this game. Seriously, amazing fun.
5764	1	a	You kill dinosaurs... That's it. 10/10
5766	1	a	Yes i recommend this game ALOT you can be dinos!your teamss are dinosaurs or ?dinosaur killers?There GET THE GAME BRUH
5768	1	a	This game is ruining my free time.
5770	1	a	Orion has been through many phases getting better &amp; better every time, (even though it has been getting more &amp; more powerful so PEOPLE TURN DOWN THE SETTINGS) also you can be a dinosaur. There are many, many achievements to unlock &amp; this is also very fun with friends. I can reccoment this game (an even better review with a more powerful PC) with a 8.2/10 (with the update that allows ships into the game 9.8/10)
5772	1	a	Orion: Prelude is actually really quite a fun and enjoyable game. The bugs are also hilarious.
5774	1	a	The box art looks pretty cool so it's got that goin' for it.
5776	1	a	At first I was like, 'ok'. And then I was like, 'POWJAM MASSEEEAAAUUUUUUU WWWWWWEEEEEEEEEEMMMMMMM REM REM KATEM PEW PEW PEW AAAAAAHHHHH DINOSAUR INCOMING! WE NEED TO TAKE THE FIGHT TO THEM!' Shortly following that I was like, 'Martin we need to get this kid a band-aid.'   'The storyline was alright' 10/10 -Martin Septim   'Well I think we should.' 9/e John McCain
5778	1	a	Fun game! Only $1 right now (June 6). It's sorta like cs or like cod but more realistic and with dinos! a little buggy at times and sometimes the servers arent too good. :)
5780	1	a	this is fun fast paced fps where you kill or be jkilled battle your friends or endless waves of dinosaur in this explosive game.
5782	1	a	Great game. Definatly doesn't deverve the bad reputation it has. It may be buggy at times, but the world is beutiful, the weapons are great, and the dinosaurs are really cool. I would definatally recommend this game to anyone.
5784	1	a	I would have gladly paid more than 99c for this game, it may be a bit glitchy but I have high hopes its going to turn out to be something legendary.  I am unaware of the previous iterations of this game but from what I heard, it was a disaster. And as people tend to get better at whatever they keep doing, I'm sure they will deliver a finely polished and optimized Orion: Prelude 
5786	1	a	Metascore is wrong. Wrong, wrong, wrong. This game is okay, fun to play and is entertaining. This is like CounterStrike, Left 4 Dead, Halo and, well, Dinosaurs, all wrapped into one. In my opinion, this scores an 7.5-8/10.
5788	1	a	The metascore scores WRONG its really fun to play with friends 3 hours to go but only for 1€!
5790	1	a	It's a reallly fun silly game. It's not the best but i really like it. You'll have a lot of fun:)
5792	1	a	Do i overall recomend this game... Yes for .99 cents. But once the sale is over, the 15 dollars is not worth it.  The goods: It is an addicting game that makes my neck hurt when I am done with the game session. The gameplay is awesome, and the money system is slightly flawed, some rounds i only get 500 income, even if I get alot of points.  The Bads: It gets bad frame rates. It probably could have been better on a modified source engine to fix the frames, as I have to run on medium to get 30-40 fps at beginning, and 25-30 at the lvls 10+.  The uglys. The lobby system. It is absolutely terrible. If you click on a game, you usually connect at lvl 5-10, And get desamated because you start out with only 5000 credits, or even less sometimes, with a starting pistol. If you are lucky, you join a game at the beginning levels, and you are fine. If you join a game before it has started, you usually are stuck there for a while because the host is afk while there are 5/5 people on the server. Sometimes it wont let you join games, or it is stuck on 'Connecting to Server'. The worst of all, is that the refresh button doesnt work. So I could be clicking on a full game, even though it says 2/5 people on it. usually after a while, it wont even let me connect, which brings me to my other point. So i have to end up restarting the game 2-5 times just to get in a game, because the refresh button doesnt work.  Once the free week/sale is over., I wouldnt reccomend this game, it gets maddening after a couple hours. The Ugly's and bads outweigh the goods way too much
5794	1	a	I played this quite a while ago. It's definitely not worth $15, but the gameplay was kinda fun. However, considering it's now only one dollar? Buy it, because you could get a dollar for literally ten minutes of work if you felt like it
5796	1	a	An amazing game for it's super low price. Even beats some games that are far more expensive than this. Don t question it, if you have a bit of extra money to spend and you want a game to keep you busy, just buy it. 
5798	1	a	well honestly this game rules  there are a few bugs here and there but all in all BEST DINO FPS ON THE MARKET buyin a 4 pack($2.99) is still cheaper than a whopper at burgerking however...dino meat over an open flame...sounds yummy
5800	1	a	It's amazing. O And theres dinos Yup Its cool
5802	1	a	This game is absolutely amazing. I give the devs props for keeping up with this game and completely redesigning it. This game went from crap to amazing. They gave it a huge graphical update and then added more dinos. This game just got better and better. They did an amazing job. I highly recommend you go check this game out.
5804	1	a	IT SAYS BUY NOW AND GET ONE FREE GAME (SO FAR A GOOD GAME) BUT THEN I DONT GET A FREE GAME I DID NOT BUY IT FOR THE FREE GAME BUT STILL IF IT SAYS FREE GAME I WANT MY FREE GAME
5806	1	a	nice game, but in my country, this game very lag :(
5808	1	a	if you enjoy killing zombies , on endless survival modes . You must enjoy facing dinassours on the exact same situations , except that in this game you can use vehicles for deslocation or attack purposes.  You need to be constantly capturing the outposts , which makes the game harder.
5810	1	a	Shank a raptor, for cash....
5812	1	a	Great Dinosaur First persopn shooter and really Action packed Teamwork is really important and has a variety of weapons , 
5814	1	a	they were busy doing whatever that i don't understand, i just know how to shoot dinosaur
5816	1	a	This game is way better than you expect. I bought the 4 pack for $.59 and had to convince people to play it. Everyone thinks its going to suck because its cheap. The 3 copies I gave away all three liked the game very much. The game is not perfect but if you have a couple friends and want to kill some time this is fantastic. Even at $1 this game is a winner. Id recommend it to anyone looking for a coop shooter. Game in a nutshell: dinos, tons of weapons, vehicles, survive. Im going to pick up the next orion game because I like this one so much.
5818	1	a	Wow. Such Dino's. Much guns. Very team-based. So kill. Ruined Doge's life. Five stars.
5820	1	a	A Fun game when purchased on a sale.
5822	1	a	This game is Awesome to play with Friends! if you got friends to play buy it if its cheap
5824	1	a	 ★★★✮☆
5826	1	a	This isnt a ♥♥♥♥ game anymore, albite its not the greatest game ever. but if your looking for a gmae ot ♥♥♥♥ around with friends this can do it. its score is like a 5-7/10. Not the best, Not the worse. just ok
5828	1	a	Sry bout other review ment to be funny....... anyway for 99 cents who would not buy it? If you aint happy with it so what it was a buck....... not the animal! Anyway BUY IT NOW!!!!
5830	1	a	This game is very much worth a dollar.  It's a competent (mostly), customizable dino-survival FPS with PvP elements tacked on. Granted there's some micro-transactions thrown in, but that's mostly just for cosmetic apperances for your character, dino, and weapons. The game has a tendency to bug out from time to time, but it's nothing really game breaking and at the most will make you laugh rather than get upset. People might be also turned off by the fact that the dinosaurs have a one track mind, meaning they'll attack whoever's the closest or whoever's shooting at them, but what do you expect? They also have a bad habit of puppy guarding the generator when you're trying to fix it.  This is an enjoyable game when you've got a group for it. Randoms are okay, depending on what kind of experience you want.
5832	1	a	Well worth .99 cents, but for .49 cents it can't be beat
5834	1	a	great fun game for hours of fun messing around with friends
5836	1	a	You could say, the dinosaurs got T-Rekt..  -Theodore Trillbilly, PhD, Moderator of /r/dinosaurs
5838	1	a	honestly really enjoy this game purchased it for less then a dollar and expected such crap. currently busy with gta 5 on PC and bloodeborn on ps4 but definatly keeping this game installed
5840	1	a	You use jetpacks and laser guns to kill acid spitting velociraptors and it costs as much as a small pack of gum, of course i recommend it.
5842	1	a	Once I bought the game I was like the game will probably be OK but after playing with some friends for a few hours. This game should NOT be 1 buck it should be at least 30. The devs pretty much made this a give away from a really good game. It reminds me a lot of Black OPs Zombies only you got Dinosaurs, jetpacks, Invisibility , Tons of maps, cool skins and customization options, and some other cool features. To be honest only thing this game needed was a story mode. Other than that, great job Spiral Game Studios!! Keep up the good work you've got a fan now!
5844	1	a	I only played this game for a few minutes and found it to be quite amazing. Some of the aspects in this game remind me of Borderlands2. Very fun co-op modes, loads of guns and tons of upgrades which can turn you into a juggernaut. I really like that you can carry up to SIX GUNS! ( after upgrades of course ) It's an easy game to play for someone that doesn't have a lot of time for gaming and just wants to jump into action.   Graphics are good for the price of this game. The gameplay and mechanics are fine but the AIs' intelligence is a little limited.   All in all it's a fun, fast paced, dino in your face shooter. I give it a 8/10. Worth the price their asking! Thank you for reading my review.
5846	1	a	Graphics are stunning, the most realistic thing I've ever seen. I wish I had 3d glasses so I could abuse the 3D mode. Has a huge class variety, which one is extremely different from the others. The Soundtrack is so nice I feel like bethoveen couldn't do better. Also, the learning curve is so smooth I can always learn more and more!   This game is the new eSport.
5848	1	a	Laggy, Buggy and 99 cents, yet its still one of the most fun games I've ever played.
5850	1	a	  One of my friends gifted me this game. Actually i wasn't planning to play this game but he said that he bought this not only for me but for our some common friends too. So, we downloaded and started to play. I can honestly say, i don't know much about this game's '' games modes'' except survival and conquest(i couldn't remember clearly which one is which.). Dinosaurs comes on to you wave to wave and you have to defend some energy things. There are some huge dinosours such like T-Rex and much more littles. Little ones can be slayed easily opposite of bigs. And flying ones are so annoying. I am trying to say that there are many kinds of dinosaurs are in this game.  For figthing with them, the games serves you a great range of weapons. You can find many things from rocket launches to ion swords. And each weapon make you feel the difference. There are maps that i don't know but the maps which i played are good. They are big and you can fly to the top of the mountains. Don't assume that you're invulnerable just because you are high, the flying ones still can reach you. On tundra, your glasses has frost effect and blizzards occures well, on another map when the rain comes the weather is nearly blackened etc. and these are such good things on a such cheap game. In conclusion this game offers you a great playability and the price is what it deserves even though it's no fun without friends.
5852	1	a	its cool trust me. also im pretty cool bro. i have friends and i have swag, suck it
5854	1	a	I got this game as a gift from my homie. At first I thought he bought a cheap sh*t for me but we had a lot of fun :D
5856	1	a	Wasn't particularly fun but I bet it'd be amazing with friends who are willing to buy it. All in all I would say it's worth the price tag it has on it but only if you have people to play with.
5858	1	a	Thumbs way-up.  The most fun I have had playing a FPS in a while. It reminds me of early Quake LAN parties, constant gibs, and non-stop action. There are several different ways you can play (survival, FFA, conquest, etc), lots of weapons, vehicles, various difficulty levels, etc.   So far, I have only played one class - 3 to choose from. Don't forget, you can play dino classes! Favorite vehicle so far: two passenger assault vehicle with rear mounted machine gun. You can ram/crush hearding dinos, but bosses toss vehicle and crew into the air.  This game is not thought provoking, deep, and will not solve any of the worlds problems. It is entertainment. There are games for solving puzzles, this is not one of them. Low metascore, but hey, it's easy to be a critic. You can stare at the idiot box, or you can roast some Raptors!   When was the last time you had this much fun for $0.99? Keyboard finger cramps included at no extra charge! Buy it. If you play for more than 5 minutes (and you will) it is worth it.
781	0	a	It stills being ♥♥♥♥.
5860	1	a	is cheap and great get it
5862	1	a	Frickin jet packs and dinosaurs!!!!! Dont care what anyone else says, this is fun on a bun!!!
782	0	a	after this 'XP GRIND' came out the game is ruined i would have recommened it but now theres ppl with such high levels who dont even know how to play the game running around and its pure chaos.. other then playing with other ppl this game is great. UPDATE still havent taken notice of XP GRIND and ppl think its just a cheap crappy game and cheating wont matter.. how would you like it if everyone on GTA v was max level with everything after all the work you put into it all now for nothing?! it sucks and all i want is this ♥♥♥♥ gone and at lest the leader boards and levels cleaned up but of corse the devs carely dont care enough to do anything
5864	1	a	Best buy at this price. Not the best game overall, but it gets really funny when you gather up with some friends. Lots of vehicles, helicopters, great weather effects, challenging achievements, and so on. You can also download and try maps made by the community, so the game doesn't really stay repetitive or boring.
5866	1	a	Recommended.
5868	1	a	Honestly,  One of the best experiences I've had with a game. Heres why...  1. The game mechanics are superb 2. Teamplay is excellent and fun 3. The game never lags  4. Graphics are second to none 5. Massive online community 6. Frame rates NEVER drop  All I can say is enjoy.
5870	1	a	Jetpacked into a falling helicopter then used it to kill a T-Rex. 10/10 Would play again
5872	1	a	You can have a party hat with small dinosaurs on it. 10/10
5874	1	a	don't take this game seriously...
5876	1	a	This game is like a First Person Balloon Tower Defense, but with DInosaurs! I love how you cna buy perks from eliminating enemies! All in all I think Orion is a great game.
5878	1	a	awesome game... I recommend it for everyone who like action game
5880	1	a	Wow.... I relize the game is pretty loltastic what I mean by that Is that I mean i'ts glitchy terrible and just wtf. Buuuut to me this game is actualy very fun and it is a original game to me and I would recommend this game to everyone. Keep the updates going and make new maps also... GREAT JOB!
5882	1	a	Got this game on Steam summer sale. After five hours of game play, I can say this is a fantastic game! I love playing the Recon class and use the bow alot. It is very cheap and you can get a lot of hours on this game.
5884	1	a	It is really fun either with or without friends (In the off chance you want to play alone and or don't have any)
5886	1	a	This game is pretty cool for his price, it's very cool
5888	1	a	don't take this game seriously...
5890	1	a	ORION: Dino Horde is an awesome game for gamers all alike. It has all of my favourite in-game things: dinosaurs, guns, death, blood and dinosaurs. Now who doesn't (except for girls) like killing huge prehistoric beasts with futuristic weapons or being the beasts and eating people? WHO FRIGGING DOESN'T LIKE THAT?! Oh and the gameplay is great, although a little laggy and buggy in places, but still great! I give it a 9/10.
5892	1	a	Jetpacked into a falling helicopter then used it to kill a T-Rex. 10/10 Would play again
5894	1	a	This game is like a First Person Balloon Tower Defense, but with DInosaurs! I love how you cna buy perks from eliminating enemies! All in all I think Orion is a great game.
5896	1	a	THIS GAME IS AMAZING 
5898	1	a	This game is the $h!t. You get to wear a jetpack and shoot dinosaurs... What more do you want? Oh u want to be a dinosaur? Well you can do that too. Just drop the 99 cents and start playing this game
5900	1	a	the devs put effort into the game, and improved it quite a bit, +rep the reviews before Dec 2013 are outdated, so think of that before making your conclusion
5902	1	a	It's buggy, ugly, unbalanced, and full of questionable design decisions, .....and mother♥♥♥♥ing dinosaurs. The worst best game I've ever played.
5904	1	a	The short version of why this game is awesome: YOU KILL DINOS. MANY DINOS. IN THE FUTURE. WITH AWESOME GUNS.  I had a lot of fun playing this game with my friends. I got the 4-pack when it was on sale for cheap. Mindlessly shooting dino's in coop is just straight up fun.  The gameplay reminds me a bit of halo, but if the spartans where fighting dinos. It's a bit more than that, but I think the compairison is fair, as many elements of the game give me that feel including wepons and vehicles.  My only problem with this game is it got kind of stale fast. Killing dinos mindlessly in waves with a few random objectives does get old eventually. I hope they put in some more varying modes, otherwise I'll get bored with it and have to take a week off to make it interesting again.  The game also has pvp, but I'll be honest I didn't try it very much. It seemed ok.  For a game though that I got super cheap, it was worth every penny. The developer also seems to be adding improvments constantly, so I think I'll stick with it.
5906	1	a	Game is great, very fun, kinda reminds me of serious sam with Dinosaurs
5908	1	a	The new update(s) have definitely put this game on a better place than what it's earned on Metacritic. It's what the newest trailer explains: Killing Floor x Halo mechanics vs Dinosaurs. If you haven't tried it yet, do so.
5910	1	a	For one dolla' you can flip off a T-rex as it headbutts you to the other side of the map
5912	1	a	you know what people get on my nerves? the people saying 'the graphics are not good' honestly in the 'rebirth trailer' i call it (commuinty appreciation' i dont think they metiond graphics just the gameplay dont judge the game on how the graphics are base it on the gameplay the mechanics and all the things it offers but if the game itself says good graphic sure hold that to them and other things they promised i see allot of promise verdict is                                                               8.5/10
5914	1	a	If you want to play a multiplayer survival shooter with your mates this is one of the best on offer. Just jump in not expecting much and enjoy a great laugh. I've fought a stegosaurus with a flamethrower, jetpacked into the sky and shot a t-rex in the face with a mini gun. I've pied pipered a horde of raptors to rocket jump doom and successfully juggled the slow mo perk of killing a t-rex with carefully timed rocket blasts! All this happened in multiplayer with a mate laughing alongside me. I have a Robin Hood hat, stupid purple guns and can't survive on my own above easy difficulty level even with my acquired perks, but I love it.  In the words of Smash TV, 'I'd buy that for a dollar!'
5916	1	a	especially great if YOU DONT WANT IT TO WORK
5918	1	a	...
5920	1	a	this game is alright a bit like call of duty and teamfortress 2 with dino's i found it a bit boring but if you like shooters with dino's then you might like this 7/10 forme
5922	1	a	It's a very underrated game I think. Altough I have no problem finding a game online I think it deserves a bit more attention.  Gameplay feels very solid, shooting acts very smooth as each gun feels different. Killing hordes of dinos is very fun by yourself or with a friend (witch is recommended) and the ragdoll physics can be quite hilarious at times. However the game can be a little buggy at times. A few times I've found myself stuck in a wall after a dino had rammed me, and I had to quit or your gun will freez and you can't shoot it, but that only happened to me once and I think it was a connection problem. I've had a very fun time playing and while it's on sale for a dollar that's a steal! 7/10  [Edit] Over time I got bord witht this game. Everyone online just wants to play survival, witch gets old after awhile. All the other game modes are left in the dust forgotten about. Don't even get me started on how 80% of the games avlailable the host is idle or somthing because they NEVER start the game! Trust me that gets really annoying. One of the main things I don't like about this game, in fact I hate, is the community. Most people I played with trolled with me or thought I was hacking because of how good I was doing, not to mention little to no teamwork. As for gameplay it's pretty solid. I'd say the game is more enjoyable with a friend. Theres just somthing about the game that doesn't feel right though, I don't know what it is but somthing feels off about it. It is a fun game but if you're looking for a game to spend hours on hours of playing I wouldn't get this game. The only reasons for me to go back and play it again would be if me and a friend wanted to be stupid and play or to try and get all the achievements. Maybe if I were really bord and had nothing better to do, maybe I'd play it again. If I had to rate it again it would be a 5.4/10
5924	1	a	Good! Best played with friends or randoms. When playing co-op or multiplay, there are like hardly any Australian servers to jump on that are free; they are either full or there is none. So you need to make up your own listen or dedicated server(or get one of your mates to do it) if you wanna play with people. And the servers overseas, yeah unless you like playing with 400+ ping, don't bother....  Otherwise fun game, to me it feels like a cross between KF and Halo, except instead of killing zombies or aliens, it's dinosaurs!
5926	1	a	Played it for a while but got bored soon. But since its super cheap give it a try.
5928	1	a	This game possibly the best dinosaur shooter I've ever played. That is all.
5930	1	a	one of the best shooter everyone should try
5932	1	a	99 cents to shoot dinosaurs, and get more updates than DayZ will ever have.  10/10 Devs WILL update again &lt;3
5934	1	a	easily the best dollar i've ever spent
5936	1	a	I am fully encouraged to recommend this game!...... to anyone looking for a horrific gaming experience &amp; the sexual assault of your wallet (If the game is not on sale for a price that can be considered 'expendable').  Gifted to me by a friend during the 99p sale, we were treated to a game with horrible animations, unusual keybindings, not one single form of tutorial, and horrific sound issues where footsteps reign louder than gunshots &amp; death of a player treats all player to a painfully loud slo-mo sequence. And after all of the updates this game has received since it's crtically panned release, it's INEXCUSEABLE that the developer has left these issues completely neglected. I'd speak about how starved of strategy the gameplay is, but I've not been capable to play this trainwreck enough to provide proper judgement. Unbelievably, me &amp; my friends had a lot of fun suffering at the hand of this game's poor design, but it was short lived.  In general, this is a game that is poorly designed across the board, and whose issues most core to the game have been completely ignored in favour of expanding the game experience.  You will laugh, you will anger, you will cry. Whatever the case, fully recommended to those seeking to see a video game at it's worst (when ON SALE). Otherwise, SAVE YOUR MONEY &amp; STAY AWAY!!
5938	1	a	Had inappropriate relations with a T-Rex, spawning little raptor babies, strange men in space suits come invade my land, my baby's daddy charges them and eats 1, my little raptor babies all swarm in and attack their ankles, hiding in the grass. They all die. I spawn more babies.  10/10 best 74cents ever spent.
5940	1	a	can 360 noscope a t-rekt with a racket launcher  `10/10
5942	1	a	Such an ace game, had a friend gift it to me as they bought the 4 pack in the sale and I clocked a solid 13 hours on it from the moment it finished installing!  Most fun I've had in a while when it comes to silly shooting games!  If you're looking for something to kill 30-60min I would seriously recommend buying this
5944	1	a	First things first, that metacritic score is BS. That score was given way back when before the game was reworked and re released. I bought it for a $1 during the re-release and honestly i would of paid $30 for it. The survival mode is my favorite mode, infact i havent really played many of the other modes at all, but survival is endless fun. Favorite thing about the game is the avatar esque ships you can fly in survivor or the mech warrior war suit, or maybe even the tank. I play assault so i have a jetpack because if i didnt the massive trex would rip me out of the map and chomp me in half. He still chomps me sometimes while i try to jetpack away and he chomps rocks to throw at you if you try to land on a cliff and shoot from safety.  Gameplay 9/10 audio 8/10 overall experience with the game is an astounding 10/10.   As we all know games get old after enough play but seriously this game is more than worth it and its epicness is unmatched by many other games with much higher price tags. Also its in no way pay to play you cant spend any money to get better, you can only just play which makes this game better than all those silly microtransaction games.   One thing i want metacritic to do is to review this game again and give it the 90 or 95/100 it deserves. BUY IT NOW!!!!
5946	1	a	...
5948	1	a	  I have to thank one of my great friends for getting me this game on my BDAY, but anyways I have to review this game.  I am not really a fan of dinosaurs BUT this game is indeed good I have to admit, this game does have a decent player base and the gameplay is really good, You can buy things in game to make your character look better like in TF2 (that godawful bucket of........ sorry venting) but yeah this game has a lot of great gameplay assets but I hope you enjoy this game. My score for this is a 9/10.    EDIT: WOAH, I just remembered how many microtransactions there are in this game, not only that but the A.I of the dinosaurs is actually a lot better than the A.I of your teammates if they are bots. I also joined servers where a ping of 300 was NORMAL. Maybe I was being a little to soft on this game but honestly IDK what else to say about this game besides, THE BOTS SUCK AND DON'T HELP YOU THAT WELL! 7/10 (-2 points)
5950	1	a	The game is really fun, even if it looks terrible. It is totally worth the price if you get a four pack and play it with some friends.
5952	1	a	10/10 Good Game - Grab Four Friends and its hilarious good times
5954	1	a	The Metascore is a Lie !!!
5956	1	a	Addicting. Simply addicting. You may be thinking 'Boy, this is cheaper than Garry's Mod on sale and has science fiction elements and dinosaurs. This game is probably a piece of crap or just a Dino D Day rip off'- YOU ARE WRONG. This game has a LOT to offer. I just got it yesterday and I have a hard time NOT playing it. There's too many epic factors to it. The only complaint I have is a low amount of weapons. Don't get me wrong, there's enough to keep yourself satisfied...but there isn't much of a balance. Some weapons may be around the same price, but one is way better than the other. It's really cheap, so buy it, install it, and give it ago.
5958	1	a	Got the 4-pack at 3€, played with my kids a few hours, already got my money's worth.  Don't get this expecting a piece of art, unless you consider goldfish in a blender art.  Go in expecting to shoot a lot of dinosaurs (nothing much deeper, though you can buy perks and guns in the game), and your expectations will be well met.
5960	1	a	cool $ 1.00
5962	1	a	Fun game, Has coop and i met some of the best people i have on my list through this game. This game not only made me have fun, but involved some good team work, has some awesome upgrades and really for .99 the graphics are pretty damn decent. This game is definitely worth every cent :P   If you get the game don't expect it to be extraoridinary, dont expect it to be mindblowing, but expect it to be fun. If you have some friends, jump on with them and just have a blast.
5964	1	a	I have to say this is maybe one of the best games I've played. Its got bugs, lighting errors, but that stuff is for people that play the game to be super serious and such. This game is soooooo fun I've played it alot. Its the type of game where you go to say: 'I'm done.. (Goes to hit ESC and then hears a T-Rex roar) ... nevermind, just one more wave.' You then see that when you went to leave at 9:00 PM its now 2:00 am in the morning, then you catch yourself at around 4 am then finally quit. Thats how it runs for me. I have two more words. Buy. It. (You will not regret it!)
5966	1	a	This is one of the best games ever made. I would pay $100 per round if I had to.
5968	1	a	Fun Game, but only in multiplayer. If you and a couple of your friends have it then play together. It could use some more work, but im convinced the next ORION game will be awesome.
5970	1	a	This game is very fun! I liken it to L4D2, but I personally enjoy this more. There's a variety of weapons, perks, enemies, objectives, maps, and vehicles. Whether playing alone or with friends, I think it's a good FPS with nice graphics. I reccomend this game to anyone who likes first-person shooters. There isn't a 'campaign,' it's just multiplayer/singleplayer arena comat.
5972	1	a	While the game and concept are really enjoyable, eventually, some of the enimies become too fast and tiny to hit... Fun game, just one flaw... still, for the price, i can recommend it, but not as a game I would see myself spending a lot of time on. Seems like a game ill play a few times then never play again.
5974	1	a	This is a pretty cool and fun game. You should get it.
5976	1	a	When compared the the like of Halo and Hatoful Boyfriend, you cant go wrong with this game. But if you compare this game against Airport Simulator 2014 and Gasp, Its still really good!  This game is best for young children. It shows them the importance of staying away from dinosaurs just like in real life. Dinosaurs and guns make a great combination to help their young minds.  Have some self respect and wear a diaper when playing this masterpiece. Taking breaks is a sin.
5978	1	a	ITS AWSOEM 
5980	1	a	People say this game bad but is not. It had layers. It like an onion. Onion have layers. Onion: Peepee is onion. When people say it ogre say no, it isn't ogre. All of the Shrek out of the swamp gas. Very happy.
5982	1	a	There simply aren't enough games with dinosaurs &amp; even fewer of these that are actually worth playing! For me, Orion: Prelude (O:P) is that rare exception. Although not much in way of a story in the game (no single player after all), there is quite a tale on how Orion came to be the game it is today...  The short version is, that O:P is an evolution of previous Orion titles, Dino Horde &amp; Dino Beatdown originally dating back to a successful 2011 Kickstarter campaign. Although recieving early criticism (that would normally kill a game ..dead.. disappearing into obscurity), the game continued to evolve with constant updates (big &amp; small) over the years from the developers. Spiral stuck with it! This dedication &amp; gradual refinement of the game has resulted in an excellent first-person co-op experience, with a well rounded collection of modes, weapons, enviromental effects, vehicles &amp; more to enjoy.   PvP isn't forgotten; it's also selectable. PvP feels more alike to a retro deathmatches, than a modern PvP (in a good way!), but I mainly enjoy the co-op modes. In co-op, you essentially have to defend your power core against waves of bloodthursty dinosaurs. Dinosaur kills will reward you credits, which you can use to buy perks &amp; weapon upgrades, in-turn helping you survive the later, harder waves. Some waves also have you securing objectives. Co-op doesn't feel ultra competitive, most of the time you don't watch your credits/kills, rather finding yourself just having fun surviving &amp; helping your teammates! I've found the community to generally be helpful &amp; friendly in-game too.  One of the real stand-out features in O:P has to be the enviromental effects randomly cycling on the alien world. From the day/night cycles to the extreme variety of climates &amp; types of weather. Adds so much to the atmosphere. Couple this with excellent lighting effects through what seems to be a thicker atmosphere and the results can sometimes be spectacular! Even overwhelming! You definitely get that feeling when your final wave gets a night cycle with heavy rain .. you know you are gonna see an epic close quarter battle!  Along with the awesome effects, there are 3 distinct classes to mix-up the gameplay. Each has unique strengths &amp; each you can progress/level-up in online play to unlock starting weapons, power-ups &amp; perks. Initial learning curve isn't steep, so once you get the hang of the basic flow it becomes very easy to sink multiple hours killing dinos! O:P rarely feels like a grind; even at lower levels (without a lot of perks) you competently kill dinos &amp; gain good XP. Plenty of dinos to go around too :)  If you can't find a friend to play with, there is also bot-support added in O:P to fill the ranks. This can be helpful to get playing quickly if server populations are low (which regrettably does happen).  The trilogy of classes are well balanced (no need for any other classes), as is the gameplay in general. Difficulty is super scalable. Weapons are mainly shared between classes so quickly become familiar, and vehicles are easy to use &amp; offer a good range of practical &amp; destructive uses. Repetitive? Sure, to a degree, it is the same thing over &amp; over and despite there being a lot of 'accessories' to the spice up the character classes &amp; tactics, modes etc, there are not a huge number of maps for each mode. I expect this will change soon with Steam Workshop support being added.  The A.I. generally employed by the dinosaurs is a fairly basic 'rush' tactic, which can feel pretty predictable (there are a few surprises though), but I find the larger dino numbers to counteract this limitation to a degree anyway. There are also the occasional technical glitches like querky physics (flying Stegosaurus anyone?) or clipping inside a dinosaur. Nothing game-breaking that I have experienced, but sure does make for some funny moments! Just like my many failed attempts at some of the more creative 'Ride a Dino for 10secs' &amp; 'Slap T-Rex 100 times' achievements :)  O:P reminds me a bit of those classic, simple shooters like a Serious Sam or Left 4 Dead, but with a bit of high-tech sci-fi flavor. This future-tech feel across the game contradicts the jurassic era dinosaurs &amp; remote wilderness landscapes nicely! O:P is not as complex mechanically or technically when compared to a top end AAA FPS, but its simplicity is also its underlying strength. It is great value ($1!), has strong replayability and the focused, balanced gameplay (some bonus ..ahem.. querks) offers a truely fun &amp; intense, dino killin' co-operative survival experience!
5984	1	a	I love this game its really fun and I didn't find out about the special abilities until I was playing rampage and I accidentally pressed LCTRL, and yes I know I'm a dinosaur but I don't care what others thinks.
5986	1	a	You shoot dinosaurs. 10/10 IGN
5988	1	a	This game is absolute silly fun. It's best played with your bro's!
5990	1	a	Hit a raptor with a truck and it went up really fast. 10/10
5992	1	a	WORST! GAME! I'VE EVER PLAYED!!!
5994	1	a	glitchy but fun
5996	1	a	This game is awesome, I love dinosaurs
5998	1	a	I thought this would be kinda crap but I actually just kick back and shoot stuff. People on co-op are really patient and fun! A hidden gem, but not a masterpiece. I just put some podcasts on sometimes as white noise and go nuts. Also, I killed two triceratops and a t-rex by myself, so I feel pretty good.
6000	1	a	This game is great already and its getting greater. OF course it has soem bad things like all games however it has some good things as well. I really love the game but i barely got time to play it and not much people to play it with.   I will list some good and bad things about the game at least in my opinion and then what but I cant choose for you. So just use this as some information about the game.  First of all the game is really fun to play with friends. I mean it as its one of my favorite things to do. Not just the open world to roam around and explore (That is not endless and always the same) but also like surviving the waves of hungry dinosaurs they throw at you. But also the versus mode can be extremly fun for playing with friends. As one of your friends can be a dinosaur.   I cant say anything of the pvp mode thought as i never did it.  Second the game has a different set of weapons and is a bit level based. The level is not that inportant in a few of the early difficult settings but it can be for like insane or higher. It gives you a goal to work to. As well as the weapon choise and the other things around it is great. And that you can heatshot dinosaurs sort of is also a fun fact.  Third the game is going threw a lot of good changes and got better form were it started. I played it when it started and it was not that great at all. But I loved the idea so even thought my friends suggested no to me I still bought the game. And well the game grew and made more rewarding. However my hours of gameplay are not that great i can tell that the game is going a nice way in upgrates and bug fixing.  Fourth the creators of the game are spending hard work on it. They even check the forums for ideas and post replys. As well as plan events and do work on the game. However there budget is low so they trying to do anything they can to keep the game alive and growing.And they are doing it good as they are fixing problems even added a few of the most requested dinosaurs in the forums to make.   Well i also have to say some bad things but they are working on those problems mainly.  Well one of the bad things is the ragdoll. The dinosaur ragdolls or the movement can look a bit messed up. But trust me its better then when the game started so they are working on it.  Second thing is like its not that active online. Well this is slowly changing as well but not that fast. There are more people coming in the game and it is a growing game. But its a slow growing game so you got to wait some or get some friends or people to know to play it with. Futher after the next patch they are making its propally gonne grow as well. But there is also a single player mode but thats less fun.  Third the teamkilling fact. There is no friendly fire in the game so thats a good thing. However in a small amout games and trust me really small amout of games you can find people that love to drive a car against you and drive you off a cliff. Or they try to get a achievment to drive a car full off team members in a big dinosaur.  I can list many more ups and downs on te game but i listed a few of them.  And my opinion is that the game is a good game but propally gonne become a great game when they are finished working.  I would say you should buy the game to play it and have fun but also to support the creators to be able to make this game into a great game.  However my opinion is not yours so not instand buy this becuse i say so.  Thanks for reading and your time.  Rust.
6002	1	a	Best futuristic dinosaur killer simulator of our day and age. Hands down.
6004	1	a	This Game is as good as it says in the trailer, the only bad thing about it is when it rains or you're on a winter map and is disrupts your view because it either frosts up or you get rain dripping down your helmet, Exept that i give this game a 9 outta 10!
6006	1	a	This game is actually kind of okay.
6008	1	a	Punched a raptor in the face and got 125 points. 10/10
6010	1	a	Miraculously healed raptor bite wounds and dino-acid-spit burns by killing a T-rex with a revolver.  10/10
6012	1	a	The seal is a ♥♥♥♥ 11/10
6014	1	a	7/10. Game has a low score and I wondered why? After playing this game I had a lot of fun playing I just couldnt figure it out. The score was taken a long time ago when this game first came out and was awful. This is not that game. I've played wave games, one of them being Killing Floor, and as much fun as Killing Floor is, in the end the only objective is to survive. Simple and beautiful. This game has that, but with dinosaurs. You also have actual objectives to complete which gives more of a challenge rather than just killing things, and upon completeing said objectives you gain more credits to buy more guns and other perks to help you survive. Not a perfect game but a decent fun one.
785	0	a	The game itself is a great game that can pass time and bring some fun, I am not talking about something that you would invest time into but a sort of game like a Zombie Mode on Black Ops, It's just a good game that can satisfy your needs for killing some dinosaurs in a huge arena that also has Objectives as well as Cars and planes to help you go around, but really other than a game you are only going to really play for around 30 minutes and never touch it again this game apparently is fraudulent or something along those lines from what I hear which is obviously not a very good thing for anyone, God just thinking about this makes me triggered about insurance fraud and crap from faked whiplash, but we are here to talk about the game.   -Pros  A good timewaster Cheap as ♥♥♥♥ - I mean at around 1 dollar why wouldn't you try it out, (don't try it out)  -Cons The game is not buggy but it is far from fully optimised FRAUD Only going to play it once a year No radar system to tell you where all the dino are so you get buttraped  Graphics are pretty bad  Did I say FRAUD already? 
6016	1	a	Very good Dinosaur Horde game even though there are other modes most players choose to play either survival or conquest. There are three classes in the game and each has a special ability the Assault class has a jet pack that allows him to go reach higher areas easier than other classes, the Support class has a healing gun that should be self explanitory although with a certain upgrade it can damage enemies and repair turrets, vehicles, and generators, and the Recon class can go you guessed it invisible. Gameplay is nice no glitches unless you have a bad internet connection so check your connection before you play any mode. Weapon choice is decent in this game with one assault rifles, two sub machine guns, two light machine guns, two shotguns, two melee weapons, three sniper rifles, and a plethora of pistols which can be bought in temporarily in any game mode and if you die you lose them but if you remember where you died or you use a custom made loadout from the weapons you've unlocked. Now onto the special weapons better known as (to seasoned players at least) adrenaline weapons which can be unlocked each class has two and a universal adrenaline weapon that can be used by all three classes which is a bow yeah a bow what are the odds; The assualt can use a grenade launcher and a rocket launcher, support can use a flamethrower and a chain gun, and the recon can use a laser rifle and a energy carbine. Customization is really the only low point in the game unless you have money with the choice to only change the skin of a weapon when you start the game you have two armor and weapon skin colors black or purple you have to buy more aromor and weapons skins except for one for that one you just have to get 75 achievements for it. There are helmets in the game with one being unlocked after getting 50 achievements but like the armor and weapon skins they have to be bought as well. Taunts are in the same boat as weapon and armor colors so yeah it's more of a pay to look good kind of game. The community in the game is also very quiet not many will use the in game chat function but no one will randomly start insulting someone so it's about 50/50. Final Verdict a 7/10 for hours of fun in survival and conquest, decent weapon choice, and the fact that when a class reaches level 60 that class has unlocked every weapon that is best suited to them do this for every class and you will have 10 weapons unlocked and ready to use for any class it loses points for mediocre community, low customization, no story what so ever, and the fact that you can't unlock every weapon
6018	1	a	Basically what you need to know about this game is that it takes place in the middle of Turok and Crisis where some of the idividuals in both games are in need of some serious dino ♥♥♥ kicking. Play as your favorite characters like master chief, the medic in TF2, luke skywalker, and the guy in crisis (you know the main guy who can be invisible). Then fight hoards of mother ♥♥♥♥ing dinosaurs, and for some reason santa? with all you friends.
6020	1	a	Not a big shooter fan personally, but O:Pre brings out the best of the few that I happen to like: Halo, Gears of War, and Tribes (ah Tribes I remember when you were king!). Haters gonna hate, but I find this game intuitive, engaging, and addictive! Now if I could just get a better set up so I could enjoy it to it's fullest with better graphics.
786	0	a	this game was ♥♥♥♥, i had more fun wiping my ♥♥♥
6022	1	a	A fun and entertaining game. As you go along you learn new tricks to trick and kill dinosaurs, you learn the best strategies for killing dinosaurs and for unlocking eapons. It's a splendid game with decent graphics. The only problem I have is some of the Dinosaur AI... This is coming from someone who only played the free weekend.
787	0	a	Such a ♥♥♥♥ game, wouldn't even buy it whilst it's 1 dollar
788	0	a	This game was 99 cents and I bought it for the laughs with a group of friends and we had laughs and never played it again.  It's got an unpolished UI with icons that look like they were made in paint. Gameplay just handles terribly (as do all the vehicles) and while it looks graphically fantastic it really isn't anything more than that.  The gameplay is boring and repetitive and you need to be playing in a squad to go anywhere.  I don't know why people are recommending this game (but as with most steam reviews, 90% are just bull and have no purpose to help you). But this game, it is honestly not even worth the time to check it out.   Don't waste your money on this even if it is 99 cents again, buy some other random indie game or some trading cards because at least you'll look at them more than you will ever play this game.  Gameplay: 3/10 Graphics: 7.5/10 Sound: 3.5/10 Overall: 4.6/10
6024	1	a	Call of Duty Zombies, but with DINOSAURS instead. Good for the price.
6026	1	a	I respect these developers. I respect them. These guys teach you to never give up on something.
6028	1	a	LoL i want this game ;D. I played the 'demo'.
6030	1	a	A rudimentary Dino FPS, great game for 90 cents.
789	0	a	Little Changed since I paid that 14.99 $ back in the day for Orion, graphically is Okay, but how the Dino's walk and attack, it's just NOT OKAY, why couldn't they take ideas from Turok with the Dinosaurs, the last Turok game that came out, was awesome as far as Dinosaurs are concerned. In this game here, since it came out, there are new maps and skins here and there for characters and Dinos, but nothing was improved either graphicaly or even gameplay wise, I would recommand this on steam sale for under 5 $, but not at a full price.
6032	1	a	REALLY CHEAP, REALLY FUN. MUST BUY FOR THE MONEY!!
6034	1	a	if its cheap get it ive played worse (black ops 2)
6036	1	a	BEST GAME NA, SO MUCH FUN TO PLAY WHEN TOTALLY BORED. TIMMY DOWN/10
794	0	a	Just NO... I got so disappointed with this game.. Don't buy it..
795	0	a	This game sucks, I paid $0.99 for this game on sale and I don't even think I got my moneys worth. My total play time isnt even a whole hour and half of that was firguring out how to play with friends. There is no strategy in the combat because all the dinoaurs out run you. Never buy this...
796	0	a	Definetly not worth the money, even though I bought it during the $0.99 sale. Terrible game, early 2000's graphics, terrible animations, and unbelieveable amount of glitches. 0 stars and extremely not recommended to be bought, not fun at all.
797	0	a	This game is broken beyond all hell and sucks DinoDick™  tl;dr When a game has a 36/100 metascore, DON'T BUY IT
6038	1	a	Anyone that says this isn't worth the 0.99 price is kidding themselves. If you can muster up 9 friends then this game will be a blast (just load up a server and play Vital mode). The second biggest drawback is that there is little documentation on setting server administration but if you have any experience at all with UDK you'll be fine. The absolute biggest drawback though is that multiplayer setup is handled poorly with password protection pretty much not working (so get your buddies to join your server quickly).  
798	0	a	Not bad at All, game looks like playing Unreal Tournament Evasion with more features, dinos, and vehicles.   Good: +Dinosaurs +a lot of Perks  Bad: +UI need more improvements and more easy to look +No Tutorials  it's worth if you want to try or loving co-op games, i'm not recommended because the game still need change some features and gameplay. for me, thinking before buy this one
799	0	a	I bought this game for $1 when it was on a steam for sale. It was definately worth it at the time even after all the bugs and horrible ai, I still found a way to have a decent gaming experience. But now the sale is gone and is now $15 so all I can say is do not get this game. My biggest pet peeves about this game is its massive frame drops making almost unplayable, from 40 frames down to 15 back to 30 down 20 and its not even a nice looking game at all, you could have a top tier gaming computers and you may have trouble running this game. Although if it ever drops the price point you might consider buying it since it does have some great moments but I should also warn you that this game totally copied their last game and resold you the same thing except maybe a few things changed here and there.
800	0	a	Terrible game 0/10 needs work
801	0	a	One of the video games of all time.
802	0	a	This is possibly the worst game on steam, not worth 99 cents on sale and not worth your time
803	0	a	I can not recommend this game to anyone. The graphic engine or the way they utilize it is horrible. I get framdrops down to 5fps with a GTX780 at times. The game is kinda fun the first hour or two, but after that it just blows.
6040	1	a	Often cited as 'The Halo series true origin', news of this gem have been spread widely through gaming communities. Regarded by many as the pinnicle of modern-day gaming, competing with such titles as Bad Rats, Mass Effect 3, and others of their caliber to take it's place upon the best of 2014. A true emotional thriller, bringing out the deepest reserves of the audience's primal urges in an accute reflection of modern societies, trying teamwork, testing courage, and pushing those who take the challenge to limits they never have never dreamed.  I shot a T-Rex in the head while flying with my jetpack, it was rad.
6042	1	a	For $1, this game is very fun. A little buggy, but very amazing. I bought this thinking 'Oh it's only $1. Might as well try it.' This ♥♥♥♥ is more fun than spending that $35 on 'Rambo The Game' and getting bored of it in the first 5 minutes. I still don't understand why it has a metascore of 36/100. It should be above 65/100 at least.  10/10 would play again.
6044	1	a	It's a game that has fun gamemodes and also theres diffrent kinds of weapons.Also you can upgarde to be better
6046	1	a	Kill Dinosaurs with a tank.  10/10
6048	1	a	I played it with friends and had a great time, but welp everything is better with friends... But this game isn't horrible and certainly you can have fun by yourself (especially since they added bot support),so for 1$? Hell YEAH, this game is worth it.
805	0	a	game sucks. I wouldnt have bought it if it wasnt so dirt cheap.
6050	1	a	Great game 9/10 the 1 problem i do have is the lag 
6052	1	a	This metacritic is wrong on so many levels! I am a huge fan of killing floor and this is beyond epic for me! I started playing this yesterday but would have played so much more if I had gotten the time. I recommend anyone who is also a fan of Killing Floor to get this game! I promise you, you won't regret it!
6054	1	a	ORION: Dino Horde is a wonderful game involving, yes, you guessed it, pigs. The game opens up new possibilities in the genre of first-pigson shooters. It includes a variety of maps and gamemodes to spice up the normal pig-shooter formula, and many customizations to make your pig stand out from the rest. Additionally, the visuals in the game truly shine. I was amazed at the Xbox One's new pig physics engine, where even the curly tail is visible and incredibly detailed. Compared to the predecessor, ORION: Dino Beatdown, pig AI is vastly improved. Instead of running around attacking you for no reason, the enemies now act like real pigs! You can play as many different classes of humans to take down the evil pigs, such as Medic, Medic, and Medic. The Medic class is my personal favorite. As for the modes, there is classic Survival, Conquest (a longer version of survival), Gun Game, Team Deathmatch, and more. It even contains a rampage mode where you can play as a pig! I had a lot of fun oinking my way to victory against 3+ friends.   Overall, ORION: Dino Horde is a masterpiece. Spiral Game Studios has made a huge leap in game design. The game benefits greatly from new capabilities of next-gen gaming, and provides a new and refreshing experience for those tired of pig-related FPS. I give the game a solid 4/5 stars.
6056	1	a	Surprisingly Entertaining.
6058	1	a	This game is addicting. The instant you purchase this game, all of your friends will attempt to disassociate with you as fast as possible, so no one will play other games with you, and you will have nothing to do outside of games. This leaves you with three options: Literature, single player games, and school. Literature sucks, so that's out. Single player games like Skyrim all seem bland after the immersive cooperative experiences you face in ORION, so they're out. What's left is ORION, which, like a fine liquor, must be taken in small doses. Your life will become a tempest of ORION and nothingness, continually honing your dino horde removal skills lest the apocalypse occur while slowly devolving towards insanity in the breaks between ORION sessions. Eventually, like an alcoholic, the tradition and care that playing ORION carries will be replaced by a burning desire to play ORION, and do nothing but play ORION. The periods of insanity in between sessions become periods of insanity in between maps. You will turn to heroin and methamphetamines as a means of escape of these loading screens, hoping that as your perception of time dilates, the game of ORION will blur into one continuous stretch. ORION is the world, and the world is ORION. ORION is you, and you are ORION. Time and space are replaced by an infinite moment, a string that coils in upon itself forever, the Mobius strip, the Ourobouros, the infinite, of ORION. Eventually, your mind fades to black, and the last thing your mortal eyes can comprehend is the image of a triceratops foot stomping on a human face, forever.  10/10 would play again
6060	1	a	Protect the generator and kill dinos in co-op or kill each other in multiplayer mode. Many game modes to play and a good number of weapons and vehicles to kill dinos with. Level up your class and unlock perks and weapons as you go great game at a great price.
6062	1	a	People got excited for titanfall, just cause it was cod with a mech. This has that mech, and then theres dinos.  Check and mate.
6064	1	a	'It's like skyrim with guns with dinosaurs; It's okay I guess' - IGN 12/10
6066	1	a	i'm not so sure why this game has such a low meta score its not overly a bad game in any aspect the pvp fun (but slightly lag at some points) there is a nice selection of weapons, perks, veichals and other things the only thing i don't like is the limited amount of classes having on 3 (since last time i played) and its quite a bit of fun with some friends and you get to kill DINOSAURS, FREAKING HUGE BLOODY T-REX AND SPINOSAURS WHAT ELSE IS BETTER?!?!?!
807	0	a	I dont know I played for a few minutes adn unless you KNOW what to do and your in multiplayer mode you'll be fine.
6068	1	a	great game so much to do. GET IT!!! worth the dollar
6070	1	a	many may look at the price and think the game is bad, but it's a fun game with wonderful graphics and solid game play over all 8.5/10 a hidden gem.
6072	1	a	I shot a dinosaur in the face and it threw a rock at me. 11/10 Would rock again.
6074	1	a	10/10 It's like Halo with dinosaurs PROS: -Always fun to play -Requires strategy and cooperation to take down large waves and large dinos -Large veriety of weapons and upgrades -Medeocre amount of vehicles -Small variety of special Dinosaurs -T-Rex underpowered -Spinosaurus extremely fun to fight (challenging because of speed, damage, health and size) -Interesting and original art choices and style -Missions are an interesting feature, not too challenging and premote moving around versus camping on a rock -This list can go on for a very long time  DOWNSIDES: -Needs more vehicle variety -Needs more special/boss Dinosaur variety -Needs more map variety
808	0	a	This game is crap
6076	1	a	greatest game ive ever played 
6078	1	a	Far from perfect, but still incredibly fun. AI needs a little bit of fine-tuning and the whole game could use a coat of polish, but that doesn't detract from it being good fun.
6080	1	a	got eaten by a giant crocodile and a T-Rex in less than 5 minutes 12/10
6082	1	a	This game is dank m8, go full sanic on that purchase button. 10.5/10 Skyrim with lube.
6084	1	a	Awesome game. I wish i had more time to play it.
6086	1	a	ever since they added hats i would say that this is the best game NA.

6090	1	a	Very glad this developer stuck with their game, they have turned it into something unique and fun. Nothing like gathering some friends and taking on hordes of dinosaurs together. A solid FPS action, my heart still pumps when i see a T-Rex trying the bite my head off and the panic when a pterodactyl grabs and flys you high in the sky. Great price as well.
6092	1	a	Good game. Dinosaurs, Vehicles, FPS, Huge Maps, lots of game modes, Has a level up system similar to Killing Floor, very easy to find your friends and play with them (unlike 80% of the crap out there that advertises multiplayer then never actually being able to play with your buddies). And who doesn't like hunting dinosaurs? Also border line educational as you find yourself remembering lots of dinosaur names you previously thought you had forgotten or never even knew. Highly recommended. :)
6094	1	a	Crashed a vehicle into a T-Rex, vehicle exploded, died trying to fight off T-Rex with a pistol. 10/10 GOTY 
6096	1	a	What a real man should do before death: achieve triangle with two hot chicks, eat kebab and kill dino using futuristic weapon!!! Now I have 66% of life achievements! : D
6098	1	a	10/10 - Best game ever. Must buy, the gameplay is amazing, the mechanics are perfect. Everything right down to the core of the game has been refined for your pleasure by these loving indie developpers. Support these great people by buying this game.
6100	1	a	Got stuck between two rocks; had to amputate entire body with explosives to escape. 127/127
6102	1	a	Very fun. and at the moment only a dollar
6104	1	a	This game is proof that meta scores don't always tell you how good a game really is.   10/10
809	0	a	Do NOT waste your time and/or money on this game.  To join a server, you have to wait until the current wave is over. If you die, you can't respawn until the current wave is over. What the ♥♥♥♥. You could be sitting there for over ten minutes waiting to respawn. That is basically unacceptable.  It's like it was designed by someone who has never played an online FPS.   Stick to TF2. Forget this piece of ♥♥♥♥.
6106	1	a	It has dinosaurs. And guns. And I got it for free.
6108	1	a	Jetpacks and dinosaurs, what more do you realy want?
6110	1	a	You get to shoot dinos with a mech and punch a T-rex in the face to death 9/10 would recomend Also did I mention HATS!!!
6112	1	a	I don't have much experience and I bought it later last year to play with some friends, but they decided it wasn't worth playing. However, I had a great time playing it and I would easily recommend it to anyone who likes or appreciates a good first person/third person shooter.
6114	1	a	THIS IS ♥♥♥♥ING AWESOME!!!!!!!!!   100/100
6116	1	a	So terrible, it's pure entertainment and fun with friends. Get it if you want a bad game with almost no redeeming qualities which can remain entertaining for how broken it can get.
6118	1	a	It's ok i guess
6120	1	a	Best game ever put cod,borderlands, and a little team fort 2 and you get this game for a $1 each or just buy four and give thme to your friends trust me you will have a good time
6122	1	a	This game is soooo much fun and very addicting! Best .99 I've ever spent. I bought this for a friend as well. As the waves get bigger, it just gets more and more fun. The hit points are similar to Borderlands, and its cool that you still get credit and XP based on the percent of damage you've done to a dino before it dies. So even if someone finishes off a dino you pumped a lot of rounds into, you still get a portion of the xp and credit.
6124	1	a	It's $0.99 for endless dinosaur kills :D, what more could you hope to ask for? Killing dinosaurs in real life isn't even close to the amount of fun you'll have in this game!
6126	1	a	a really really bad game. i regret every cent i spent in paying for this ♥♥♥♥ game. please do not buy it. let it die. let my shame die along with it.
6128	1	a	Nice, fighting dinosaur with an assortment of weapons and vehicles, team work and a lot of gamemodes, worth to try.
6130	1	a	I cant understand all the negative reviews! The gamemode are great, expecially survival and with 3-4 friends its incredibly fun. Multiplayer is a different thing. The servers are often filled with griefers and its just not fun.Anyway, 0,99 is a super cheap price for this great game and you wont regret buying it.
6132	1	a	You get to fight Trex' wearing big hats. What more could you want?
6134	1	a	It was decently amusing but in the end the limited animation and detail was just too unmoistening and I got bored. I'm sure very young children would enjoy it a lot though, as long as they aren't intelligent enough to of been spoiled by the more advanced FPS games out there.
6136	1	a	Very entertaining! quite addicting with the right team too!
6138	1	a	Great fun when playing with friends!
6140	1	a	brilliant game, love being the disosaurs, mecanics are very good, graphics almost perfect, controll pretty good,    could have more controll over server settings, and could have a storyline mode or carrer mode or something
6142	1	a	Not enough anime tities. 9/11 i would jihad for this game.
6144	1	a	Got firefighter hat then proceeded to flip people off in Multiplayer. 420/69 would flip them off again.  [UPDATE! 2/22/2015] So, I decided to play longer and make a better review.  Pros: + Nice looking eviroment and dinos + Nice players that never kick Low levels + Different classes with a few personal set of skills + Massive maps for Conquest (Base taking mode) + A Human vs. Human and Human vs. Dino PvP + Weather changes during game + AMAZING lighting (Not really a pro, but I love the lighting system. ;w;)  Cons: - Player models are... Not the greatest. - Some animations are a bit weird and stiff for players and dinos alike.  So, my over-all score for this would be...  8.5/10  I love this game. It's fun with friends and randoms.
6146	1	a	this feels like doing meth and then questioning all your life choices  but its only a dollar so lose yourself
6148	1	a	I'm still trying to figure out why I like this game. It's so awful but there's also something appealing about it besides the incredibly low price tag. It's a game that tricks you into thinking that it's good. You know for a fact that it's one of the worst things ever, but it's hard to deny that it's actually quite fun to play with friends.  What can I say? It's cheap as dirt so grab a friend or a couple friends and go kill some mindless dinosaurs. Defend your base, augment your abilities, buy some new guns, hop in a mech or tank, enjoy the diverse weather system, and then die at the very last round.  Final Verdict: (3.2 out of 5)
6150	1	a	fun for 2h, then, it Sucks a$$
6152	1	a	This is, im my opinion, the best game I have played, if I were to compare this game to any else, it would be impossible as it is the best experience you could possibly have. This game has never been beaten nor it will be beat in the coming generations as it has features that other games have not yet compared to.  ORION: Prelude is a wonderful and exciting game to play, it has graphics so good it could not be matched, personally whilst playing this masterpiece of a game, I felt like I was really experiencing the game IN REAL LIFE!!!  While playing with my many friends on this game, I have come to realise that the co-op/multiplayer is the best I have ever encountered!  Playing the new games in this generation seems to be too mainsteam and unrealistic but while playing this game with my buddies, the EXCITEMENT AND JOY can not be compared to other 'Boring and Laggy' Multiplayer games.  Overall I rate this Game 10/10, as features, connection to servers, co-op/multiplayer and fun you get out of this game could not be compared to other games in this generation.  ~Pingu~     
6154	1	a	Worth of it's price. this game is cheap at it's full price and on Steam sales it's even cheaper. I expected a game that is fun for couple of minutes and I got what i wanted. Although 4 pack was a waste in my case, since none of my friends that i gave it to wanted to play with me, but if you buy it for yourself, It's great!   The only problem i have with this game is that there are some small bugs and i think it could be optimalised just a bit better. I've met the recommended requirements and have to play on low quality to make sure it runs smoothly. But that's a minor complaint.
6156	1	a	You shoot Dinosaurs.... 10/10
6158	1	a	Just going to say DINO HORDE IS DINORIFI-Well Im ♥♥♥♥ing lame. IT's AMAZING
6160	1	a	Worth the money
6162	1	a	At first I was sceptical, then i decided ''Why not?'' And bought the game for 99cents... Best 99 cent spend ever!!! Really amazing graphics and dinosaur precision... Definiatly check it out! Awesome weapons and team work.. Also Sweet Vehicals for you to have fun with.. Running over Raptors is the best!!!!
6164	1	a	It's cheap, it's fun, why the hell not? Plus theres guns and dinos, GUNS AND DINOS.
6166	1	a	You literally run around slaughtering dinosaurs with your friends. It is my civil duty to recommend this game and yours to buy it.
6168	1	a	This is the most ♥♥♥♥ game I have ever played and I will never get my time and money back. This is the only game I have ever played that I actually regret playing and feel like my life was legitimately wasted.
6170	1	a	A round based dinosaur survival which can be team based or solo. I would recommend this game as it is good quality and fun for the price tag.
6172	1	a	I don't understand anything. But I shot a T-Rex in the eye, and it died.   10/10
6174	1	a	Dino Mayhem. It has it's flaws, it is very arcadey, but it is great fun with a team. Close to unplayable with randoms or by yourself.
6176	1	a	Dank M8  totally worth more than $1
811	0	a	So Bad Game ! Fail in Graphic and Gameplay ! Problem in PING  BUG BUG BUG ..... WTF
6178	1	a	Clearly the developers were high while playing Halo and watching Jurassic Park at the same time.  11/10.
6180	1	a	its good buy now its only 1eu
6182	1	a	This game it's masively muliplayer and very nice price =&gt;&gt; Best dinosaur survive ever ! Ilove this game because this game it's awesome ! I don't say this , all people and me say this !
6184	1	a	This is a great game, cheaper then CSGO skins and its fun. the most fun you will have with $1!
6186	1	a	this game is the ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ mate play this game is sick as HELLL
6188	1	a	i realy like pony's so i recommend this game
6190	1	a	Pretty chill game. You slaughter hordes of dinos. It's a pretty typical survival, with wave after wave coming after you, though the number of waves is limited. It's worth it for the price (it's been having good sales) if you like the sort of thing. Also, brownie points for glorious dino-slaying!
812	0	a	How the heck does a game get progressively worse with time? Somehow ORION: Dino Horde accomplished that. This game used to be a fun coop game in the same vein as Killing Floor, except with dinosaurs and vehicles. Now the community is dead and I can see why with the extreme lag that gets worse with every update.
6192	1	a	its a good game but i have a problem.My friend bought me a copy of this game but its not in my libary and when i try to play it ,it says that i have to buy it .can any ony help me D: 
6194	1	a	Orion: Prelude, more like Orion PreLUBE ME UP AND TOUCH MY ♥♥♥♥ THIS IS GOOD.  Not as catchy but I feel like the 2015 GOTY Edition Should be named that.  My Review- Ever wanted to be sent back in time and forced to shoot pixels at larger pixels making 18bit roars that you pretend you can hear so you dont instult the artistic immersion of this 2017 GOTY Blockbuster. Then this is the game for you. It has been designed with such pazaz that even Micheal Bay would be put to shame.   As for the graphics; they are so sharp and crisp I really believed I was sent back to 240p Jurrassic Era to slay Pixel mosters. The MMO elements work so well. You get all the satisfaction of playing WOW (staying a virgin for life, being fat and contemplating suicide) but it occurs even faster as the community is so polite. Honesty is the #1 Policy with these kind kiddos. They're all so honest as they're all 'banged my mum'.   The story is truely the most immersive experience since the holocaust. It's the most realistic story of any Pixel Dinosaur FPS Potato Teir PC Blockbuster in the history of this Klan.  The developers are a small team of PJ wearers from Tennessee. They have simple values, slaying blacks, white supremecy. The stuff us normies are too afraid to admit. They stand for whats right. AND OMG Their XMAS decorations are the best. They string up black folks on trees. So romantic. Regardless they're storming the white house soon to remove the ape who kidnapped Mr Bush. Y'all should join in. Unless y'alls some filthy ape lovers....  Regardless, 10/10 game with and amazing multiplayer, Potato Teir Graphics to make even the IRA proud, and last but not least a small indie team that has true murican beliefs. MURICA

6198	1	a	All time best purchase in the whole of today!
6200	1	a	Why did I buy it. ♥♥♥♥
6202	1	a	The price is really nice and its funny to play with friend
6204	1	a	Orion: Prelude, more like Orion PreLUBE ME UP AND TOUCH MY ♥♥♥♥ THIS IS GOOD.  Not as catchy but I feel like the 2015 GOTY Edition Should be named that.  My Review- Ever wanted to be sent back in time and forced to shoot pixels at larger pixels making 18bit roars that you pretend you can hear so you dont instult the artistic immersion of this 2017 GOTY Blockbuster. Then this is the game for you. It has been designed with such pazaz that even Micheal Bay would be put to shame.   As for the graphics; they are so sharp and crisp I really believed I was sent back to 240p Jurrassic Era to slay Pixel mosters. The MMO elements work so well. You get all the satisfaction of playing WOW (staying a virgin for life, being fat and contemplating suicide) but it occurs even faster as the community is so polite. Honesty is the #1 Policy with these kind kiddos. They're all so honest as they're all 'banged my mum'.   The story is truely the most immersive experience since the holocaust. It's the most realistic story of any Pixel Dinosaur FPS Potato Teir PC Blockbuster in the history of this Klan.  The developers are a small team of PJ wearers from Tennessee.

6206	1	a	plz get this game it is the best dino game ever
6208	1	a	I'm going to hesistantly say, yes I recommend Orion: Dino Horde.  It's definitely buggy. Animations seem a little stiff and unvaried. Graphics could use some... umph. I don't mean to say the graphics are bad and I see the style he has chosen, they just lack something.   I agree with some others that the weapons lack the variance and power they should. It often feels like I firing tiny lasers. Maybe the dinos need some sort of hit animation/ows***Ijustgothitbyabullet twitch? As much as I dislike Battlefield as a franchise, they do at least that much well.  The dino AI definitely needs some tweaking. And those f****** pterodactyls. F*** them.  Aside from that, the core elements are there, and can be very fun at times. I'm only afraid that this game will get tossed aside as the developer tries to promote his next game, 'The Orion Project'. To the Dev: It's going to be awful hard to make another game if you don't polish up the one you have now.  Summary: Fun, but unfinished.
6210	1	a	Not as bad as people say it is. Preety darnn good lol
816	0	a	10/10 would recommend
817	0	a	I think these devs only get money on this 'cause it's like a dollar to fifty cents at times and then someone thinks 'Oh, I can make a funny video about this game'. I assure you this title is not something you should play lightly. I have played most first person shooters of my era and this is nearly the worst one out of all of them that also tries to present itself as a finished game. 3/10 I made a video and wrote a review for it.
6212	1	a	I love this game, why? like they said 'The Metascore is misleading' is true, it is a fun ♥♥♥ game if you really try it. Beside, I bet you will enjoy this game without doubt.So, why should I explain it to you ? you should try it yourself and see for yourself. xD
6214	1	a	So i bought this game because it was a really cheap for a 4 pack during the summer sale. i can say i was not really expecting much, but i was pleasently surprised. i actually found this game to be very fun. There are some things like the match making, tutorial, and getting to the base between rounds. A lot of time you don't have time to get to the base to get the upgrades. Also a better single player would be nice, but i understand this was made to be a multiplayer game. i would give it an 8/10.
6216	1	a	This game brings back a lot of nostalgia from other games made in the past using the Unreal engine. It plays good, things work fine and there are some handy features to adjust some options.  There are plenty of modes; pvp and pve are a lot of fun, from killing dinosaurs, or suddenly finding Santa trying to kill you with presents.  This game is hilarious and fun. If you love FPS/TPS games or just for the fun you can have with this game, I would recommend this game to play alone, with random people or just with some friends. 
6218	1	a	cool game AAAAAAAAA+
6220	1	a	this game is so awsome 
6222	1	a	You paying only 99 cents, you can play the great game like paying 59 dollars 99 cents.  Very fun, many mode, good graphic, but you paying only 99 cents.  It's the best!!!
6224	1	a	I rode around and killed a T-rex on my jeep with a machine gun mounted on it, shortly after, a Triceratops came from around a rock and ambushed it, hurling it 50 feet up into the air. It then blew up and i nearly died but escaped. Once out I hid in a dead stegosaurus's hollow body to shelter from the hordes of raptors. 10/10 especially with friends

6228	1	a	Classic survival game,can be fun with a friend and there is a lots of achievements for hunters!Graphics are not that bad there is a day and night cycle and rainy weather.8/10
822	0	a	Poor quality, redundent gameplay.
823	0	a	If I didn't get it for only 99cents I might feel some serious buyer's remorse. Definitely not worth $15.00 let alone the 99cents. Clunky controls, unpolished game-modes, cookie-cutter builds, and shoddy environments.
824	0	a	Crashes when i change mouse sensitivity or anything else in options. Not buggy anymore my perforated ♥♥♥♥.

6230	1	a	Don't believe the metacritic rating. Fantastic constantly updated co-op shooter in the style of L4D. Here's to hoping that dinosaurs are the new zombies.
6232	1	a	All time best purchase in the whole of today!
6234	1	a	This is game is really good and fun. There is not much to say I guess, just that it's pretty fun and LOTS OF DINOSAURS. GO GET IT NOW!
6236	1	a	Gripping the turret mounted on the back of a transport vehicle, You can hear the guns barrels spinning as a cloud of bullets rips into the head of Tyrannosaurus Rex himself. The ice covered Tundra of the games conquest mode seems fresh as our group of four sets out to claim the first generator. Wave One hasn't started yet, and I have already found more enjoyment in this game then I did with most other titles I play, and I'll let you know why. First of all, if you buy this game looking for the First Person Shooter aspect, where you roam killing Dinosaurs, you have the wrong game. Sadly this title isn't the best feeling shooter on the Market, although at the core it is a well rounded combat system. If you want max enjoyment from this game, get some of your PC gaming friends that 'Play well with others' start a Steam Chat Room, turn on your mics, and engage in what could be one of the most thrilling CO-OP Shooters you will ever play. There is just something gratifying about leading an armada of VTOL warships across the frozen earth only to reign death upon everything in your way. Or Emptying the magazine of an Assault Rifle into a horde of Raptors as your team struggles to regain supremacy over the swarm of Dinos. If you are looking for the most fun you can have with a group of friends, look no further. As soon the game finishes the install process you and your buddies will be cutting through the Prehistoric, one bullet at a time. 10/10
6238	1	a	wtf were those guys smoking when they made this
6240	1	a	alright so... i tired it for a few mins and i can say right away that:  -yes this game worth buying considering the price. -yes considering the price it is satisfaying. -'cute' with friends i guess... -nice costumization.  -Horibble game in my opinion  .. yes considering the price its awesome but let me tell u this:  the animations are misplaced (i ran with a gun and my hand and the gun ran diffrent timing and directions) graphics are kinda ok... sound is ok too  the game works fine but those things i said and in general... not rly fun so i would reccomand it just bcuz of the AMAZINGLY LOW PRICE! 
6242	1	a	Love it for everything about it 
827	0	a	Free week? More like free waste of time! Not even worth 0.99.  It feels like a mashup of Primal Carnage &amp; Tribes: Ascend...  With loads of bugs, horrible animations &amp; lack of originality (it features Lightsabers, Dinosaurs, Jetpacks, and.... basically nothing new...).  Don't waste your time or money on this.
6244	1	a	great game.
6246	1	a	Orion: Prelude is a mixed bag, but definitely a lot of fun...and for the price you really can't go wrong. Co-op with friends is a total blast.  Also, dinosaurs!
6248	1	a	Great game so far!
6250	1	a	This is a game where you run around doin' I don't ♥♥♥♥ing know or care shooting pictures of dinosaurs ten outta ten hundred outta a hundred best game BEST GAME
6252	1	a	A good game to screw around in, if you fancy a coop game of driving around it a turrented jeep, while your friend uses the turrent to kill the bigguns, you simply run over the smaller one. Or if you fancy a minor challenge go to conquest and save up cash for a helicopter and then rain death and destruction on the ground. Not complicated, fun to play, and easier to adapt too i reccomend this game
6254	1	a	get eaten by big a$$ dino 10/10
6256	1	a	The game has its issues like the bug of when you host the server and when you use voice chat everyone can hear you but when they use voice chat you can't hear them.  The game is great and I've played a few matches with the developers and they are cool, fun to play with but they are mostly silent. Its fun if you like pvp or team based wave survival. Not to mention the two event maps with two hard boss battles that once you beat unlockd a special hat in your loadout, Which the developers should add more of those maps like an easter map, valentines day map, new years map. It would be cool, if you got 99 cents to spend i recommend you spend it on this game because this is the cheapest and most addicting game i have ever played! good going developers! keep up the good work and i hope you guys add more maps and secret unloackables to this game to keep us completionists busy!
6258	1	a	Great game. Metascore is dated from it's last name and title. Wait for another sale if you want it, but definitely get it.  Easily one of the best games for it's price, runs on unreal engine.    Maybe a little too much bloom though. lol.
6260	1	a	A fps with a planetary prehistoric feel. Co-op and pvp elements mixed with rpg and an interesting line of guns and augments. Face a unique line of dinos whom are not tooo happy with humans discovering and harvesting the resources of their planet.  11/24/13 First i'll personally apologise to the devs for such a late update to my review.... Over a year has passed and the devs were true to the word. Dino horde is at a state that i would recomend it to any gamer, casual or pro. Dino horde has also become much much more than a survival co-op. They have added pvp and over 5 more different pvp and co-op modes.
6262	1	a	This is seriously one of the most ♥♥♥♥ed up games I've ever played.......
6264	1	a	Great game, my recommendations!!!!!!!!
6266	1	a	If you're looking for a simple and fun shooter that you can easily jump into with some mates, this one is it. There are a few frustrating quirks (like not being able to join back into an active round once you die or if you leave) and you need a high tolerance for frustration -- those dinos can be ruthless. If you can stand that and want a game with a bit of a challenge, ORION: Dino Horde is a great choice.   Just don't try and play it on your own - the difficulty curve on the higher levels isn't something you want to tackle on your own.   The devs are very responsive in the forums and it's telling that you'll always find people dropping into your game between rounds if you're playing a 'Public' game.  
6268	1	a	You get to learn about some pre-historic dinosaurs! Your knowledge has improved 10 folds. 10/10
834	0	a	This Game Suffers From Bad Frame Rates Graphics And Thrilling Fights I Mean Cmon They Could Of NAILED The Huge Dinosaur Boss Battles  But It Was Just Another Small Dinosaur With Bigger Mass So No I Dont Like The Game Final Verdict 5/10....Just Because I liked The Lazer Katana
6270	1	a	-SAMPLE TEXT-....AIR HORNS.....HIT MARKERS.......even if your pc can handle this game it may not be able TO HANDLE THIS GAME....10/9-IGN
842	0	a	When i've played it, it was very crazy! But the problem for me was a bit laggy really because i'm using my laptop. I don't think it's recommended for the other steam users who has a poor condition on their computers because it's just a little lag problem really.
843	0	a	Glitchy and unfinished. Elements taken out of flash games. No story and terrible voice acting. Horrible graphics. Perfect game 11/10.
844	0	a	This game is absolute garbage, whoever wrote those quotes were either psychotic or a moron. I got this game fo 99 cents and I overpaid, if I could take this game and wipe my ♥♥♥ with it I wouldn't. Because it is to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ for even my ♥♥♥. 0.01/10
845	0	a	This game is as if Satan and Hitler had a baby.
846	0	a	It's bad.
847	0	a	I honestly dont like it that much it just feels improper, the #1 thing that annoys me is the vocals, they sound like scottish people who dident put any effort into voice acting. This new update just makes the game look like for kids now, and the taunts are just .. Wow.    Still worth the price though.
848	0	a	Just watch this, it explains it all the best I can:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCY_jaCFMdw 
6272	1	a	when you rub poop on the monitor the game looks a little better
6274	1	a	its halo....its turok....its awesome! love this game if you buy it let me know ill play!!
6276	1	a	super fun with friends
6278	1	a	Got it for £0.99. That's so good for the money. Probably will get something like 15-20 hrs out of it. Really fun MULTIPLAYER game. To compare it, I'd say it is exactly like killing floor... but in the style of Halo... but against dinosaurs, with big boss dinosaurs like T-rex's. Pretty fun. 8/10.
6280	1	a	i paid opne dollar for this and it has to be the best dam dollar ive ever spent if you have friends this is a freaking blast :D
849	0	a	Fighting dinosaurs is boring, and the PvP is the worst I've ever seen. Aiming is unreliable, the game lags with 64 ping when 4 people are shooting, its terrible.  Dino D-Day is a much better game if you want to shoot dinosaurs.
6282	1	a	It's like Halo with Dinosaurs! ( º ͜ʖ º)
6284	1	a	Finally!! A survival dinasaur game! You need a good computer to run amazing graphics but other than that this is a really fun game.
6286	1	a	THIS GAME COST LESS THAN A PACK OF GUM, AND IT GAVE ME MORE FUN THAT A PACK OF GUM. YOU MAY BE ASKING WHAT I CAN DO WITH A PACK OF GUM THAT IS EQUALLY AS FUN AS ORION: DINO HORDE? SHOVING THAT GUM UP YOUR ♥♥♥ THEN BLOWING BUBBLES WITH YOUR GAS IS JUST AS FUN.
6288	1	a	In the famous words of george bush, 'i did 9/11' This single statement by our former president perfectly describes what you would do to get a copy of this game. This game, coded as a collaborative project between william shakespeare and God himself, is a masterpiece of modern society. People always say that games like ARMA and HOtoful Boyfriend are real simulators, but this game takes the simulation to an entirely new level. In no other game or simulator will you ever feel like you are actually killing hordes of dinosaurs, never will you feel like you are actually going to be eaten and digested by a T-rex. In my short time so far playing this game, i have already contracted severe PTSD and need to scream myself asleep every night in fear that the dinosaurs will come back and rule the world, but thanks to this game, i will be ready to fight them. This game is worth 80 times more than steam is currently listing it, and should be fixed, i bought 40 copies of this game to give to all my friends, just so they too could be graced with the elegance and beuaty that is this work of art. I already know of more than 17 individual people who have attempted to infiltrate fort knox just to get money to buy 9 million copies of this game for the entire country of Sweden to play. Overall the game is perfect and at this point addition to the game whould only degrade its quality. You should spend no less than $144,760 for this game for not just you but everyone you have ever met. (9.00*10^100)/10
6290	1	a	It's an OK game. Fun to be in the Jurassic Park guys' shoes. The dinos scare the ♥♥♥♥ out of me.
6292	1	a	Best $0.50 I've ever spent!!! This game is addicting!
6294	1	a	Better than crysis 2
6296	1	a	AHHHHH!  DINOSAURS!  Games goes F2P -&gt; salty players that paid for it rant -&gt; games goes P2P It's not like that stop TF2 from being F2P, although granted at least you got a hat! 
6298	1	a	What kind of game is this? A $0.99 Game. Can't argue with that logic.
853	0	a	Don't buy this, I have a god computer and I can't run this on low setting, one level it went to night and started raining, and for the first time ever, I had to turn the gamma on my computer up. FPS was around 13 and I wanter to kill myself
6300	1	a	Ready for a little Joy-fun, Beautiful Family? ®™ ;)
6302	1	a	ORION: Prelude is really simple. Just get your damned weapons and shoot the damned dinosaur. Recommended weapon would be rocket launcher. P.S. I don't remember much of this game.
6304	1	a	I just spent money buying skins on ORION dino horde... i immediately regretted it. 10/10  Edit: Still regret it Keepo
855	0	a	Wouldnt recommend, but for $1 it has some laughs
856	0	a	im not gonna waste my time telling you how bad this game is, but its so poorly made I could not join or start a game.
857	0	a	Crashes on startup
858	0	a	Hands down one of the most boring games I have ever played. I suppose if you're interested in killing waves of dinosaurs in mundane locations you may enjoy this game, but the game is awfully boring hence the dollar price tag and constant sale for .50 cents. Plus you have the fact the developer is shady and probaly about to be sued.  'Just so people are aware, this game's name use to be Orion Dino Beat Down, and they changed the name and re released it multiple times as a new game just to keep people from seeing all of the negative feedback it was getting. This is the same game that utilizes stolen assets and the head of Trek Industries, formerly spiral game studios fired the real team working on it just before release without paying them. I'm writing this review now because they are attempting to get out of a DMCA and possible suit of their new game 'Orion' where they are literally doing the same exact thing and trying to play the victim. I bought this game before even knowing all of this, and felt so dirty for doing so, and im hoping and urging people away from buying into this mistake and scum of a company.' - ViziTronMan 
6306	1	a	This game reminds me of the older Halo multiplayer. This game is without a doubt worth $.49. I mean its not perfect. It has bugs and glitches but its only $.49 so you really cant complain. If I had to decribe this game, It would be Halo 2 +Dinosuars += Awesomeness
860	0	a	Wouldnt recommend, but for $1 it has some laughs
6308	1	a	''The most fun I've had since watching a hippo with explosive diarrhea. 10/10''
6310	1	a	play at free week. I think it is well worth playing.   some may call it junk, says the textures are outdate or something ,but I do have some fun from it.  The game play is simple and easy, the open world environment , the foes,the gameplay remind me of the game --Earth Defense Force: Insect Armageddon, which few people know about ,but I think they are quite alike .  Lower you expectation. Buy it if you like to enjoy simple fun game , and you would have more fun from onlineplay. Good to see that the dev team is still updating the game ,adding some new map and feature.  I'll give it a 7 out of 10.
6312	1	a	A 'Sci-Fi FPS' is quite a mouthful. But let me tell you, it's a mouthfull well worth it!  First of all, the game is just 99 cents. That's honestly a great deal for a game like ORION: Prelude that offers so much. The game has a pretty simplistic storyline; you fight dinosaurs. I will tell you the storyline is kinda weak, but in all honesty, did you pay a dollar for the storyline, or to fight dinosaurs?  The gameplay runs pretty smooth. The graphics are pretty nice, but only real complaint is that the dinosaurs are kinda generic, but again, it was only a dollar.  The game is downright fun, especially with friends. I'd reccomend this game; all you really have to lose is a dollar if you don't like it.
6314	1	a	For a while, I was looking for a game that I could pick up and play without remorse. Orion takes everything that's fun about shooters and combines it into one package... with dinosaurs. You've got dinosaurs, laser-swords, jetpacks, tanks, mechs, and gorgeous level design.   The standard survival mode is a blast. Basically, you fight waves of dinosaurs that get harder each wave. Every now and then, you have to caputre an objective that's swarming with raptors. As the waves get harder, your access to powerful vehicles improves. But that doesn't mean you feel safe in a tank with a spinosaurus, t-rex, and triceratops around.   With the release of Orion: Prelude, there's a new game mode that lets two opposing teams kill waves and earn credits, which they can spend on upgrades for themselves or detriments for the other team. You can pay to increase the frequency of enemy hordes or even to send a t-rex at them. There are tons of other game modes, too, depending on what kinds of shooters you like to play. THere are 3 classes, all with different upgrades, and a bunch of different dinosaurs that are even playable in certain modes.   If this game isn't fun, I don't know what is. Orion gets 10 pouncing raptors out of 10 power-jumps.
873	0	a	steam pls
874	0	a	This is survival of the fittest. Or the sickest. In this case. Do you like Halo? Well, you'll at least get the interface of the old Halo: Combat Evolved. Even though this game is built with Unreal Engine 3, it looks like an old PS2 game. This game has an incredibly broken AI, bad graphics and looks like it was designed within a lunch break by two drunk students.  This is not even remotely funny. Until you add friends. Then it gets slightly better. Maybe a little more than 'slightly'. Don't have any friends? Don't pick it up. Got friends? Go play something else. Seriously.  If this sounds harsh, I'm sorry, it is meant to be. If you are looking for something positive, look at the price tag and the fact,  that it's still being updated and recieves improvements well after release.
6316	1	a	This game is gr8 would buy for my friends and i again.
6318	1	a	Holy crap! So much fun for such a low cost!   Pros:
6320	1	a	This game had a horrendous start. The developers; however, stuck with it. They are constantly working to fix issues, and add new content. They also crave community feedback. It's nice to be a part of a game like that. The game is immensely fun. The visuals aren't the best, but they are quite adequate. The animations (raptors) are laughable, but the solid gameplay, large variety of weapons, the different playstyles of the classes, map and mode variety, and the occasional hilarious bug (i.e. a Rex that flies threw the air upon death) make this game an incredible experience that I keep coming back to. Grab some friends or lone wolf it and frag some dinos!
875	0	a	This game is so terrible! How do you mess up a game with dino's and jetpacks? idk but somehow they did. save your self the cash and just play litterally any other game
876	0	a	This game rips off so many other games, and it does it poorly, the animations are horrible and the overall quality is bad. It tries very hard to mimic games like Halo, and it even has an in-game cash shop. It's not even F2P! This is one of the worst games I have ever played, there is so little content and there is almost no depth. I recommend this game if you are mentally unstable.
877	0	a	It's not really that good, and even though I have only played it for a few minutes, I can tell already. It's mainly the controls, they feel pretty weird and don't work well. Good thing I played it on a free week instead of paying 15 bucks for it. 3.5/10 
6322	1	a	seriously one of the most fun games ive played in a long time!!!!!!!!!
6324	1	a	It's good. It's *really* good. But it's not $14.99 worth of good. Unless you have nothing else to spend $14.99 on. *Then* it's that good.
6326	1	a	Yes this game is awesome it might seem lame but it is totaly worth it.
6328	1	a	I got into my first game. I ran into my first dino to kill.  As soon as I started getting attacked, my xbox controller (which I wasn't using to play) started using the vibrators in it.  My whole desk started shaking, scaring my friend and 2 cats. The cats ran from the room like Satan was after their poop holes.  I will report back once I have played more.
6330	1	a	So good! Got it on sale for cheap and is very replay-able!
6332	1	a	Much better than when it was called 'Dino Beatdown' (that when the metacritic score got so low too), the developers have addressed most of the issues and added content.  However, its still not brilliant. You may find it worth it if you can find it on sale (like it is at the time of writing).  
6334	1	a	Makes my balls soft
6336	1	a	PERFECT GAME! lONG AS YOU DONT LAG ON IT YOU WILL HAVE LOTS OF FUN, much better than primal and dino d day.
6338	1	a	Want to play a 2nd first person shooter? Try this game out! Its like team fortress 2! 
6340	1	a	7/10
6342	1	a	This is an amazing game, i use an Intel core i7 laptop with 8GB RAM and this game plays beautifully :) i reccommend it to anyone who likes dinosaurs and guns.
6344	1	a	I got eaten by a Spinosaurus. If you don't know what that is, it's basically Godzilla before Godzilla. If you fps games, or dinosaurs, or both then buy this game. It's so fun. If you don't like dinosaurs.... then ♥♥♥♥ you.
6346	1	a	I Was Flying with my Jetpack and killed a TRex with a Sniper Rifle Headshot in Slowmo 10/10
6348	1	a	I played with a latency of 950, but still killed some dinos 10/10
6350	1	a	Pretty good fps co-op game but going on solo it is insanely hard to kill the biggest dinos while they try to kill you. I would say 8.9/10
880	0	a	This game blows nuts
881	0	a	DO NOT BUY THIS GAME  PIECE OF ♥♥♥♥  ♥♥♥♥ THIS GAME  Even though the game is $1 right now, dont buy it.
6352	1	a	Played singleplayer Got eaten by a T-REX  Played multiplayer pwnt everyone   10/10
6354	1	a	I actually bought this game and now it's free to play ? Lmao get it while it's free it's a cool game and nice graphics.
6356	1	a	Hey you! yeah you! do you have one dollar? if so buy this game! its cool
6358	1	a	Even though this game isn't perfect, it has a number of bugs and has gotten a lot of negative critique, I must say: it's fun. It really is! It isn't that fun to play alone, but with friends the game is super fun. If you're into dinosaurs and like FPS games, you should really give this game a try. I'm really enjoying it.  Also, the developers are really active and talk to the community, and they release patches often with more content to explore and bug fixes.
6360	1	a	This game is fantastic fun. Bought it on sale as joke but it surpassed my expections and the bad reveiws.   Explore detailed scenary filled with freaking dinosaurs then you're defending your base from waves fo the buggers. Easily to get to grips with, fanstic fun with friends, good interface and ballanced. All in all a great game, deserves more credit than it gets.   It feels like a work in progress but it gets better with each update, the artic update signifcant improvement. Weather works well and the buildings are good. The vehicles look and feel good, you can play as 3 classes or 10 dinosaurs. It's not a blockbuster game but it's fast becoming a favourite, easily up there with tf2 and l4d2 as a fun multiplier game. If you like those games with a bit of influence Halo and dinosaurs, you'll probably love this.
6362	1	a	Jesus, Everything i do needs to be Redone.  Dinosaurs, Guns, Jetpacks. Starwars. Jurassic Park. Do you people want MORE?!
887	0	a	Completely and utterly awful.
6364	1	a	It's...actually pretty fun. There's a pseudo Killiing Floor aspect to it in that you level up each of the three classes, gaining new passive abilities for each one as you go, and those persist across games. Shooting dinosaurs with guns is dumb fun in the best way, and every aspect of the title has been significantly revisited since the last free weekend. I hated this game the last time I played it, but I can see myself playing this somewhat regularly now. For a dollar, there is no reason not to check out Dino Horde.  Quick update to mention something I forgot to earlier, the game has a 'cash shop' in it that seems really out of place in a paid title. It's all really rather ♥♥♥♥♥♥ looking cosmetic items, though if you have a dollar or two to spare in your Steam Wallet you may be tempted to purchase a camoflauge for your character so you aren't the standard blue. It's worth noting you can unlock a camo, a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ looking hat, and some other dumb thing just by earning achievements, so if cosmetics are a big deal to you, don't feel like you are being forced to spend more.
6366	1	a	ORION: Dino Horde is pretty damn good. Survival Gameplay has 10 Waves of increasingly stronger Dinosaurs to fight, and your experience is more rewarding the longer you survive; dieing has the consequences of losing all upgrades, augments, and weapons you purchased during that life. This usually turns away or dissuades people who aren't good at surviving from continuing to play.  Multiplayer is difficult when playing with random people, but I blame that on practically nobody having a mic or speaking english. Communication itself is also practically nil, and most players (That I've encountered) will be more focused on rushing through the game, wasting resources and vehicles, and often dieing a lot in the process. To better enjoy a Survival match, I suggest getting some friends to play one with you.  The other gamemodes have very few players playing them, but that's due to the currently attempting-to-rise popularity of the game, and Survival is also the most commonly played mode.  If you're gonna get ORION, and/or play it, I suggest having a Microphone ready, a comprehensive grasp and understanding of the concept of 'Survival', good aim, better situational awareness, and some friends to play it with you (Who hopefully also have all the qualities described).  Try not to die!
6368	1	a	10/10 Best Lag Simulator of 2012-2014
6370	1	a	Based on the Unreal 3 Engine, we've got Orion: Dino Horde, or a game i like to call Dino Killer Future Simulator.  The game is simply beautiful, the visuals are simply ridiculously pretty (if you crank the settings up, like with any and all other games).  The gameplay is fun, even on your own, though it is challenging, also depends on difficulty.  There's lots of game-modes, a maximum of 5 players at once, due to it being a wave-style game... atleast in survival.  There's small dinos, medium dinos, large dinos, and i think giant ones too. (not too sure on the giant ones though).  You can use automated turrets, pistols, magnums, sniper rifles, large and small machine guns, a cool-looking tank that seems very similar in look to the ion tank in UT2004.  Very fun altogether, I give this game an 8/10, because it's jsut that good other then the reasons above.
6372	1	a	Sure, it has a few rough edges, and some of the models' animations are lulzy/'incomplete' but that doesn't make the gameplay any less fun after you get through the initial setup's verifying of the game cache. Cause lets face it... Halo Reach + Dinosaurs = Fun.
6374	1	a	Take Killing Floor, replace the zombies with dinosaurs, add vehicles &amp; wide open areas &amp; you have the potential to be one of the best games released in 2012. The game does however have some bugs, although the majority of them are not major. The worst ones I have seen is where you fall through the ground when getting out of a jeep or the game attempting to continue onto another round when you have technically finished the game. There is however an extreme clipping issue where dinosaurs can actually attack you through the wall of a bunker you may be in, although this is easy enough to dodge in most cases if you stay away from the wall, provided a T-Rex doesn't throw a bolder at you that somehow gets through the wall of the bunker due to the clipping issue. Another interesting bug is when the healing pad may inadvertently be healing the dinosaur, which isn't a big problem with Raptors, but is a huge problem when the T-Rex had his head stuck through the wall just above the pad.  The developers insist that Dino Horde is not a re-release of Dino Beatdown &amp; is banning anybody who states it is on the Steam forums for the game, but let's be honest; the fact that it replaced the original game is proof enough that it is. What sets it apart from a straight re-release is the fact that it was improved on; further game modes/dinos were added, bugs were fixed, among other changes. I don't really care that it is a re-release, the people who previously owned the game got it for free (which is a $5 discount if you purchased Dino Beatdown). I still say it's a great game &amp; a great value for the price even with the bugs.
6376	1	a	This game is sort of like halo, BUT WITH DINOSAURS!!!!!! There are cool weapons, nice outfits, many game modes maps, and more. in my opinion, dinosaurs are awesome, and if you like halo (i dont personaly, but i still love this game) then you should get this game. (GET IT NOW, ITS CHEAP, i think)
6378	1	a	Give this game a chance, do not take it seriously at all, and you will have some good fun. Highly recommend getting the four-pack and playing with friends, nab while it's on sale for silly value. :D
6380	1	a	Awesome game the first time it came as a free thing i played it a ton and had tons of fun
6382	1	a	fun and challegning at the same time
6384	1	a	LOL nice and cool game ever seen in my whole life :D
6386	1	a	♥♥♥♥
6388	1	a	People are being to hard on the game, even in its early stage it was stupid fun. you dont dis oldschool games for having bad animations, graphics, and lack of story. you enjoy this game because its good killing floor dino killing fun
6390	1	a	YES ♥♥♥♥, it was only $0.99. Co-op, Dinosaurs, Guns, Sci-Fi. Combat is decent. Remember $0.99!
6392	1	a	Think of a zombie game where you have to survive waves. Now replace the zombies with dinosaurs!
6394	1	a	great game 
6396	1	a	It's retro.
893	0	a	terriable game graphics are overrated when u cant even perform baisic mechanics like capping points  also didnt have fun with it either. i would rather play dino d-day at least i had fun with that. this game is a laugh to the original people who paid 15 dollars and yet i wouldent want to even pay 1 dollar. this game HAHA BAD. 0/10 go look into something else.
894	0	a	Is it worth 50 cents on sale? maybe Is it worth the time invested to install, boot up load and play? Not really.
895	0	a	Onion Dorito Hard is possibly the best FPS since Super Mario 64, no joke. I mean it has snow, hats, custom colours, DINOSAURS, guns and an 'Upgrade System' so it seems it was worth the 79p on sale. Seems to have more content than CoD and is cheaper than it.
896	0	a	♥♥♥♥♥
6398	1	a	This is the most broken, cheap, unimaginative, and repetitive game ever made.  Download it for free, have a laugh, and forget about it.
6400	1	a	lovely game, especially if you love slaying dinosaurs. but turn down the graphics if you're computer is running slow.
6402	1	a	It's like Killing Floor...But with dinosaurs :D 10/10
6404	1	a	Still Better than Dayz. 0/10
6406	1	a	get the game ITS THE BEST 
6408	1	a	Awesome. You should play this.
6410	1	a	:^}
6412	1	a	This is a fun game for a while. but it gets boring quite fast.
897	0	a	Dont let the price (or lack there of) fool you. This is a fairly bad game... like most games you can get a bit of enjoyment with friends, but literally find anything else; it's garabage.
898	0	a	  i've been waiting for this game to be in my library for a long time... and then, one day, it was free to play! i downloaded it and... i was disappointed, even though i love dinosaurs and guns... im sorry... graphics = bad, gameplay = bad... im sorry...
6414	1	a	damn i want my refund because i paid 50 cents for this holy crap im freaking out about 50 cents ok its good game ok ok im done
899	0	a	I don't like this game. 
6416	1	a	This game is incredibly fun for anyone who wants to play with their friends.
6418	1	a	Its a fun game and relatively simple shoot dinos, and capute outpost. Its better when you play with friends!
6420	1	a	Its a fun game and relatively simple shoot dinos, and capute outpost. Its better when you play with friends!

6422	1	a	I love this game i love the bow i love the teamwork i give this a 100 out of 10 i also like the pvp aspects
6424	1	a	I enjoyed it very very very much.
902	0	a	it used to be good, and i dont mind it being free to play although i bought it, BUT at least give us stuff for supporting the game?  ♥♥♥♥ you too developers
6426	1	a	One of the best dino games ever
6428	1	a	It's 1 ♥♥♥♥ing dollar.
903	0	a	DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK.
904	0	a	First of all I had to pay for this game, then it becomes free and then I couldn't get a refund for this game. After some couple of months they want you to pay for this.  These devs like to ♥♥♥♥ up alot, like they did when they released this game In the begining. It's the only thing they're good at. I used to like this game and It's cool to see that they supported It for so long when they got ♥♥♥♥ on by people whom bought at the begining. But now it's just a lost cause.

6432	1	a	It's an OK game.Definately worth 0,99$.You will have fun for a couple of hours.
6434	1	a	Fun when playing with friends.

910	0	a	this game has changed names 3 times since i've owned it.  it hasn't gotten 3 times better yet.
911	0	a	this game is not great. but its not bad. i do not suggest this to people who have already played primal carnage. the only problem in my opinion is the concept. and the way the dinos play out. what i do love is the vast amount of species to play as and the NPC/BOTS they work well as balancing the teams

6436	1	a	Once every lifetime or so, a game comes along that defines an entire generation of people. It may not be the most popular game or even the most well-made (though this one is). But it is a game whose vitality--whose culture and mission--is guided by the spirit of the times. A game that is of the same soul as its rapidly-evolving player-base.  This game is a leather-skinned, ten-tonne, befanged zeitgeist of the 2010s; it is filled to the brim with content, but as empty as the Dadaists who hurriedly cranked it out. A work of passion? Absolutely not. It was an accident. A beautiful, remarkable accident: Like life itself. It was a market-savvy cynical heap of a game, desperately trying to hitch a ride on the bandwagon of dino-themed entertainment. The game ressurected Michael Crichton--may he rest in peace--for the express purpose of tearing down everything that he could have been, in addition to everything he already was, and replace his memory with a plastic artifice and the lowest possible form of American consumerism.  This is why you need this game. Not because it's good, but because it's the most important game of this--of any--decade. This is the game that defines the 2010s better than any other; in all its flaws and successes. And it could not have come sooner.  In this game, you take on the role of Captain Henk Mercer, an intrepid planet-hopping paleontologist-slash-warlord with a heart of solid dino dung. You are tasked with killing every dinosaur that every existed, to protect future generations of hyperreligious Galactic Federal Citizens from the complexities of an increasingly secular, science-based culture which would become distracted from its faith by the presence of ancestral lizard bones. With a ragtag team of up to 17 other cyber soldiers (your fellow players), you must defeat hordes of enemy dinos (specifically, all pterodactyls) using four different unique guns. The guns depicted in this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game have essentially never been made before. They defy any description: But imagine a rocket launcher that has acquired sapience, knows its enemies' fears and hopes, and concludes to murder them anyway. That's generally how ♥♥♥♥ing sweet the guns are. But--again--only playing the game can imbue you with the visceral knowledge of how the guns work, because it's 100% feel and 0% logic. The game proves that there is no logic greater than raw emotion and, in proving this truth, the dinosaurs have finally killed Nietzsche; God is alive, and He is you. Read on.  The game is among the first FPS games to utilize a 'healer type' class: A player whose sole purpose is to increase the Hit Points (or HP) of the other players, should they suffer Dino Damage (or DD) during the game's progress. Keeping your healer class alive becomes essential and difficult, because there are T-rexes. Think about it: Prehistory's greatest fighting machine. And instead of having a gun, you've got a splint and some rubbing alcohol. But it's okay: Captain Mercer is--by the game creators' own admission--so overpowered that no dinosaur will stand a chance. The other 21-or-so players who are working alongside Captain Mercer are basically there to server his every perverse whim, while contributing little else. In many cases, these 'whims' are a rich tapestry of scatological sex acts that would make the Marquis de Sade blush. Make sure you are playing this game with a mature, open-minded party.  My one complaint with this game is that it deviates from Robert T. Bakker's important vision of the dinosaur. The dinosaur's cladistic roots indicate a shared ancestry among lizards, birds, and even early mammals. It's fair to say that all modern birds are, in fact, dinosaurs. Science has shown this time and again, however--to this day--anyone working in the burgeoning field of Dino-themed FPS games neglects to promote these new scientific discoveries. When you're standing on the shoulders of intellectual giants, and those giants are standing on the shoulders of sweet-as-hell stegosaurs and ♥♥♥♥, you need to learn how to ♥♥♥♥ing act like it. Show scientific progress a little respect, and maybe put some feathers and talons and beaks and ♥♥♥♥ in there. Is that so much to ask? Jesus.  It goes without saying that I've awarded this game the highest score achievable by an FPS: 1800 value points. If you've not yet played it, then gather up the requisite party of 4 humans and 2 dinosaurs and given it a proper go. You owe it to yourself and you owe it to the future of gaming to support such a monumentous project.  There will be no more important games this decade. Buy nothing. Play nothing else. Keep travel expenses to a minimum. Save your money for 2025, when all games will come with syringes and phone-jacks that you put into your forehead.
6438	1	a	This game is insanely fun and I mean who doesn't love killing dino's in a mech suit haha I definately recommend this game. Solo is crazy fun and it's even more fun with a group. Two thumps up and I hope ORION has more games to come like this.
6440	1	a	lots of fun. I paid $3.99 for this game and it's better than most of my $60.00 games and that makes me mad.
918	0	a	no reason to play as dino when assault class can just sit on walls w/jetpack out of reach with infinite ammo pistols
919	0	a	♥♥♥♥ing cancer... I have cancer
920	0	a	this is the worst game i have ever played
6442	1	a	Year 2016 and we are hunting dinosaurs.
6444	1	a	You'll either love this game or hate it. I happen to really enjoy it; it's amazing fun with friends and is all-out chaos when you get a full server going on any game mode. Is it game of the year? No. Are there some obvious faults with it? Yes. But I definitely think it's worth a try, especailly for the relatively cheap price.
6446	1	a	The T rex is the best dinosaur in the game because it powerful
6448	1	a	There are very few co-op games that everyone in my family of four enjoys playing. Somehow, this title appeals to our (normally diverse) gaming genres/interests, and has been a complete blast to play.   Also, I'm glad I read somewhere here in the reviews that the metacritic rating was for a diff. (earlier I think) version of the game and went for it during the steam sale. I can confirm, this game rocks.
6450	1	a	the trex is loud so turn down your volume, actually everything is loud, but its a dumb game 9.1/10
6452	1	a	A very fun game, although quick paced and a (tiny) bit laggy. People will find it fun, provided you play it in a multiplayer server.
6454	1	a	played as a T-Rex, spent the whole match trying to eat my raptor teammates. 10 outta 10, best game ever
6456	1	a	Good game but has starting trouble and will get stuck always
6458	1	a	Play in a prehistoric wilderness with futuristic weapons! Pteranodons and Tyrannosaurs and Velociraptors, oh my!
6460	1	a	for 0.99 this game if perfect. And it is better than FPS games like COD for me. I can play it as much as i want with friends and never get bored
6462	1	a	Killed a triceratops by stabbing it in the legs multiple times with a futuristic kitchen knife. 10/10
6464	1	a	Actually this was surprisingly good. Pretty much Killing Floor meets Jurrasic Park. High intensity FPS.
6466	1	a	I just realised that when you are in a server, and if you click'invite friends' the game will crash for some reason
6468	1	a	its good :) just buggy/glitchy that doesnt effect gameplay.
6470	1	a	The Sharknado of games
6472	1	a	So bad that it's good. 10/10, would spend 99 cents on this again.
6474	1	a	This game is 1 Dollar. It's honestly not worth that dollar. You could get more substance out of a dollar store bag of chips. A STALE bag of chips that's been sitting there since 2009.  The potential for this game is pretty solid, but it blindsides you with awful animations, slow gameplay that makes you want to stab yourself in the eyes and so many bugs you'd think you were in a motel in detroit.   I played 34 minutes of this game, and I can honestly say I would undo every second of it. 2/10, go buy 'Mountain' at least then you have something mildly entertaining, and probably better designed.
6476	1	a	Good game to play with friends. Yes the game has some issues such as the other players character levitating the entire time but that creates some pretty hilarious moments. For .99 i would recommend this game. Very nice!
6478	1	a	The developers changed the name of the game and now my gifted copy disappeared! wtf! I JUST WANT TO PLAY!
6480	1	a	This game is great if you can get it on sale. Go check out the devs change logs. These guys are giving the game a ton of love. The meta critic for this game is in the dumpster, but I assume that has to do with the games rushed release back in 2012. I never played that version of the game, but it's clear they have done a lot to try and improve their standing.   also, F metacritic.  11/10 - you can back stab a t-rex with a knife
6482	1	a	it has been released ♥♥♥♥ing 500000000000000000 times
6484	1	a	a very nice game to play :D
6486	1	a	Good game, I'll say its better than most games I purchased, and for the price its great. Good fun with Dinos, Tanks, Mechs,Jetpacks, lightsabers, vtols flamethrowers and alot of other stuff that adds to the fun. Good updates aswell.
6488	1	a	Got into a tank and a Stegosaurus picked me up and threm me across the map. 11/10 best game ever. Best $.25 I have ever spent
6490	1	a	Stabbed a Velosoraptor in the face then promptlly got eaten whole by a T-rex 10/10 would stab again
6492	1	a	It has its momets,but I would not buy it for more then $10.
6494	1	a	I don't know how this game got 36/100 i love it, me and my friends play it daily!!!
6496	1	a	If you like call of duty zombies than youll love this. its just like it but with dinosaurs instead
6498	1	a	Pretty entertaining game, especially for the price. if you have friends this game is buggy enough to keep it unpredictable and fun.
6500	1	a	You get to be a soldier fighting angry alien dinosaurs.... It is badass and crazy fun at times and I would grab it if you like multiplayer horde as much as I do. I would say 7/10 Has a few tiny bugs and is kinda goofy but is really good fun.  Quick Update: I wrote this review when the game was still Orion: Dino Horde, I felt it was better back then. the new content and crappy new menus hurt it in my book but it is still a decent game. The fact that it is 99 cents now helps and it does still have great in-game horde. Hope they fix some of there mistakes soon but I will still play the crap out of it!
926	0	a	spend my immortal dota item for this ♥♥♥♥ game its sucks
927	0	a	this game sucks !!!!
6502	1	a	best game so far ive played thats that cheap
928	0	a	This is seriously the worst game I ever played in my life. It is not a game that I didn't like, it is hard to like because of its many bugs and lack of content and balance. However, if you don't care too much about that kind of stuff, you can have tons of fun with friends. I don't recommend it though.
929	0	a	The game had horrid performance issues despite looking terrible, the gameplay was VERY clunky and it felt like a chore just trying to take aim at something. The combat is boring, the weapons are bland, and the whole game feels like a gimmick.
6504	1	a	The Metacritic score is wrong, the 38 score is for the first game (Dino Beatdown), not this game This game is totally fun and have 10 game modes and it's more fun when playing multiplayer of 5 players instead of single player, and the map is huge Although the animation is kinda odd, example the dino animation and player running animation, but it's forgivable I think, as long as the gameplay is fun The graphic is cool, but in my computer is kinda lag when I maxed out the graphic option in 1080p  And, the dino is playable too  I recommended this game 85/100
6506	1	a	This game is so dumb that it is fun!
6508	1	a	The meta score lies. This game is definately better than the meta score.
931	0	a	I don't quite understand this - If the dev is having so much difficulties making money, and looking where 'ORION' has gone, I must say that making this free was NOT a good move, on the authors or for the customers. I understand that making this free in order to lower the hate for this game and all it's glitches is a way to go, but at least give some regard to those who enjoy this, and spend their time playing it. 
6510	1	a	I shot a dinosaur and it flew 100 feet in the air. 11/10 would fly again
6512	1	a	When dinos be screeching, ears be popping
6514	1	a	This game is just wicked. Dinos and overpowerd wepons! Massive levels. Meca robots that you control. Tanks!  Just buy this game. Its so cheep and a good laugh with mates 
6516	1	a	This game may include Dinosaurs and ebola.
934	0	a	This is seriously one of the worst games I've ever played.  Go get it on the next sale.
6518	1	a	I was playing with some friends, we found a trex kill it, and guess what we said, *looks around* ... GET REXED   ooooo ooooo  10/10 would make bad jokes again
6520	1	a	Dinos and guns       that is all you need to know
935	0	a	Oh what to say...   This game was dropped unto steam as an early access before that term even existed. There was a few spare updates to the game after launch and then nothing happened. None of the promises that were made about the game on launch ever happened. A poor lackluster game from a poor lackluster dev.    But wait, there's more...    In an effort to avoid the absolutely terrible scores the game got, it was renamed and relaunched on Steam at full price. Twice. Apart from being borderline illegal, it's a ♥♥♥♥ move that usually only EA reserves themselves to.    But wait, there's more...    People weren't as dumb as expected. They complained about it on the game's Steam forum. Then they got banned from said forums, actively, by the dev trying to cover up that the exact same game with a new name was in fact, a new game. Which it wasn't.    But wait, there's more, apparently...    So this game got released twice under the pretention of being something new while in fact nothing has happened since a couple of weeks after launch in 2012, THREE YEARS AGO. And now there's a 'new' game up on kickstarter. Apart from the game itself being in a sorry decrepit state, the developer is one of the worst and greediest people I've ever had the bad fortune of encountering.   The game currently costs less than an icecream. Is it worth it then? Well, depends on wether or not you want to finance a person who treats people like livestock with wallets. (Buy an icecream instead.)
6522	1	a	Start the game: 200 ping. First dinosaur to fight. T-Rex Insta Death. Keep shooting every dino in the map. Lv 2. YAY!  Pros: It has dinosaurs. More dinosaurs, Dinosaurs.. And Dinosaurs.. or i forget something? Ah, yeah. Dinosaurs.  Cons: Where the f** is the Carnotaurus Sastrei.. C'mon..  Prehistoric/11.
6524	1	a	Fair.  Fair price = Fair content.  Why low content? well you do the same thing all over and over and over again. It gets boring quick, i see no character progression (jump in the game, buy stuff in that game, rinse and repeat). AI will charge the ♥♥♥♥ out of you, well as long as you're out reach you're fine. But hey! you get to crack dino skulls for a fair price.  I had fun especially when you knife a freakin T-rex and it goes down. This is a lot more fun with friends, but I have none(sobs a little). Kidding aside This is a lot more fun with friends that're into dino skull bashing. However I do not see the game as a daily staple rather an appetizer from time to time.
936	0	a	It cost me less than the price of a Mars bar, Im pretty sure a Mars bar has more thought put in to its coding. It lags, it hangs, it crashes harder than a malasian airlines passenger jet. The Gameplay is dull and repetative, with no clear direction given on how to complete given tasks. In short, save your money, go buy a Mars Bar!
6526	1	a	Personally, I think this game is pretty stupid. Its not super interesting or well made. The graphics are mediocre, the gameplay is meh, and everything about it is not particularly creative or good. It is, however, $1. So far, I've played about 2 hours of it, and I'll probably get another hour or so out of it, and I think thats worth $1. It can be pretty fun to beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of a dinosaur for a little bit.
6528	1	a	One of the best game of this decade 10/10 This include a revolutionnary combat system with dinosaurs and amazing graphics Would recommand to anyone interested in Video Games
6530	1	a	I like dinosaurs! (previous review)  [NEW REVIEW] ORION: Prelude is still one of the best games I've played, far better than most of those $40-$60 games. For just $1 hundreds of hours could be made and especially with friends. Because the price is so low it's very easy to find or get people to play. I'd also recommend their newest game ORION (The ORION Project), it's brilliant and more fun than this and this is already exciting to play.  I rate 5/7 (if you all don't know it's reference, get off the internet) If I find you on a server, I will rek you by sniping your balls off (and v-a-g-i-n-a-s for those who have)  Have a pleasant day...
6532	1	a	Cool game with alot of different FPS genres mixed into it, but feels incomplete. Who cares though its a super fun game for just $1.
6534	1	a	Great game! :)
6536	1	a	Paid $0.98 for this game... now it's free... I want my refund.
6538	1	a	this game is amazing , it's so addicting , 'now you are looking at my playtime , hmh only 1.1h atm' ,  but I know I will be playing this game alot more ! , It's like halo , but with fckn DINOSAURS.... Like if you like Halo, and surprisingly Like Dinosaurs also , then this is the BEST game for you ! , like damn. this price for such an amazing game ... It's just MADNESS , MADNESS I TELL YOU!
937	0	a	This is BS. I bought this game now its f2p microtransaction PoS
6540	1	a	Lag is horrible, but a good game in actual gameplay.
6542	1	a	This game just not have any T-Rex, but it got a T-Rocks 
6544	1	a	A Dinosaur kicked my car and I went flying 39million/10
938	0	a	Applied for refund, uninstalled game. I do not want to support this:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WurLQ0XLf20   To those who want a refund, you can get one through steam directly.  Follow the instructions here:  https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=6695-QIKM-7966   Hope this helps!
6546	1	a	  Thsi is an amzing buy for just under adollar its worth it ive played five hours i feel thats definatley my moneys worth
940	0	a	complete pile of ♥♥♥♥... sold some cs:go skins and bought this game for 0.99€... after 30mins, immediately requested refund... ABSOLUTE WASTE OF 3GB. much regret.  game is buggy and laggy, missing sounds, multiplayer doesn't always even work and bad texturing.
6548	1	a	I bought this game as a joke because I had 50 cents on my account left   It's actually a pretty ♥♥♥♥in good game
6550	1	a	More stolen content than a reaction channel. Unlike reaction channels tho, its actually enjoyable.
6552	1	a	Its a dollar.  Buy it.
6554	1	a	This game is great to play with friends. It's a combination of Halo and Dinosaurs and some other stuff. What more could you want from an FPS?
6556	1	a	I killed a T-rex with a knife. 11/10
942	0	a	Free to play now. Seriously? -_-
6558	1	a	+Rep Gud Gaem and werry good dinoshooter fps gaem, werri god 10/10 would never play again
943	0	a	omg i am buy this game and now free wtf
6560	1	a	Sniping from atop a vtol, that my friend is piloting, with a gatlin gun is how i spend most of my time playing......i have a 42% overall accuracy with said weapon.  I bought the game for a dollar.....totally worth full price just saying.
6562	1	a	Whoa. *Insert Whoa. face here*
6564	1	a	It's a cool game , pretty cheap , it's amazing.
945	0	a	Deffinitely better than beatdown, but not by much. This is one of those games you play for one to two hours and then never again. I reccomend playing for the free weekend, and by the end of that you will probably not care about the game anymore.
6566	1	a	I dont really know what to say other than: ,   360 no scoping dinasaurs with rocket launchers and hovercrafts. 11/10 would no scope again.
946	0	a	I got this game for .48 cents and I still feel like I paid too much.
6568	1	a	Get ready for some jet-packing, guns blazing, co-op game. The dinos only make it even better. This is the best game you can get for a dollar; Hands down. It is probably even better than some $5-$10 games.
6570	1	a	Great fun. Smiting dinosaurs with a rocket launcher while jetpacking across the battlefield is the meaning of life.
6572	1	a	my opinion if you can afford junk foods better to dump your dollar into this. ps, this is my first review of all time usually I never did.
6574	1	a	What could be better than shooting dinosaurs with awesome fun weapons? Although not highly polished, this game is great fun.
6576	1	a	needs optimization 
6578	1	a	This is ridiculously fun, Halo meets Turok, without the unnecessary theatratics, which is saying something because you don't ♥♥♥♥ about Turok.  10/10 would smash your girl again.
947	0	a	This game is not up to standards. I am very dissapointed in Spiral game studios. I would like a refund, I would like 5 chocolate buscuits and some tomato juice asap. This is to feed my cupboard hobos as they are starving becasue of this game.
6580	1	a	Open Game for first time. Round 1, fight some dinosaurs, seems like a normal game. Round 2 fight thousands of tiny dinosaurs all wearing pirate hats. Round 3 fight against invisble raptors.  Realism: 10/10 Immersion: 10/10 best game 2k12
6582	1	a	Wonderful game, worth every penny. Got a 4-pack of it too play with friends and after logging 33 hours on record I can say that I will continue to play this game. There is just something about killing hoards of dinosaurs that just feels so relaxing. I saw it go free for a while, didn't care I had payed for it. This game is a game worth playing!
948	0	a	This game seems like it can be very good, but right now it lags too much and my computer is pretty good so it shouldn't be lagging als there's no weapon flash or recoil so it just looks kind of stupid when you fire and all that happens is a gunshot sound and some blood appears when you hit your mark. This game has something going for it and I would be willing to pay a fair amount of cash for it once the lags get fixed but right now I just can't recomend it to anyone unless your willing to play a game that will probably be pretty laggy but still good overall or if you have a very good computer which may help with the lag but I don't know for sure.
949	0	a	I got this game because I was expecting turok, what I got was a laggy blurry dino thing chase me around until I finally figured out the controls. THEN I was killed even faster than when I didn't know what I was doing, due in part by lag. I think this could be a great game, it just needs more work.
950	0	a	Writing to just inform people of the shady background of the current developers of this game -    http://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1cefrz/orion_dino_beatdown_has_just_been_updated_to_the/   and   http://www.dualshockers.com/2011/03/14/update-project-director-of-orion-prelude-david-prassel-leaving-his-employees-high-and-dry/   Basically the developer (David Prassel) took the $20k received from the Kickstarter project, and promptly fired his team.  Also, the 15 minutes I played of the game was mediocre at best.
6584	1	a	This game is right up there with Borderlands and Payday 2 in terms of great co-op shooters.
6586	1	a	Some of the most fun I've ever had in a multiplayer game. You want this game.
6588	1	a	'only in the future do we fight our past'
6590	1	a	Gotta Admit that this game is kinda repetitive BUT There's something about this game that makes me wants to play more.Coop is fun with vehicle and stuff.Don't Worry about the low MetaScore because this games has been remade.
6592	1	a	Posibly the best game of all time, its unbalivably fun.
6594	1	a	Dinosaurs couldn't figure out how to go around mountain 10/10
6596	1	a	This is a beautiful game, Mechs, Dinos, Guns...'nuff said. On sale it's worth it, off sale it's worth it...please play this if nothing else in your life. One hasn't lived until you kill a t-rex with a mech, or a lightsabre.
1003	0	a	I GOT PICKED UP BY A ♥♥♥♥ING TERRYDACTYL. NO ONE PICKS ME UP EXCEPT MY MUM.
6598	1	a	Don't buy the vehicles. Only the dragonfly
6600	1	a	This Has to be the most fun ive ever had on a game its ♥♥♥♥ing amazing EVERYONE should have it Bloody 10000000/10!!!!!
6602	1	a	absolutely awful. all you do is shoot dinosaurs and jump.
6604	1	a	Uses credits to buy no fall damage upgrade. You're being bad and missing 360 noscopes on T-Rexs when suddenly you're flying upwards. WTF? That annoying pterodactyl who's been ♥♥♥♥ you up the whole game grabbed you and now it's taking you up in the sky for you know, 'reasons'. You shoot that dino 98438593458934589395043 times until you pistol whip it. Finally! You're free! You look down, you're 5000 feet from the ground. OH ♥♥♥♥! You close your eyes for the unavoidable demise about to come. You open your eyes 20 seconds later. I'm alive? OHHHH I bought that upgrade. Well thank Gaben I did! Well I better get back to 360 noscoping those T-Rexs... Here comes one now. GET READY NOW DI-. Eaten by the T-rex. DAMMIT I KNEW I SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT THE UNABLE TO BE CHOMPED UPGRADE! Lesson: Buy all the Upgrades. Also, get good at 360 noscoping you scurb.  11/10 Using 99 cents for this game= Logic Wait... Logic=Logitech Logitech is 8 letters long and Logic is 5. 8-5=3 The Illuminati Triangle has 3 sides. ILLUMINATI CONFIRMED!  Now stop reading this and just buy the game.
6606	1	a	Really nice game though, worth the money i would pay 10 dollars to play this game really really good (:
6608	1	a	Well worth the $0.99 its great fun
6610	1	a	It was a great game at first then i stopped playing then i played it again and i got addicted to again so its one of those games
6612	1	a	Worth every single cent of the dollar
6614	1	a	Got bored of killing guys with guns in TF2. Got bored of killing robots in Robocraft. Got bored of killing zombies in No More Room In Hell. This game is a perfect change of pace if you like killing different things. Killing dinosaurs was very fun, I killed a lot of them. 10/10, should play again.
6616	1	a	This game is somewhat unstable at random times but if you are patient, this game can be give you a good laugh. The Metascore is too low even with it updated. The online experience lacks trolls and it enforces people to stick together and communicate. The short time that it was on sale for $1 was the best time to get it. It is not worth the Store price but is worth more than $1. Very fun if you have friends. It is also a good experience by yourself. Very fun overall
6618	1	a	Cheap and good for a couple of hours with your friends. 6/10 Too many bugs and a lot of lagg
6620	1	a	The meta cretic score is a lie. Its a great game!
6622	1	a	I wouldn't exactly call this game 'good,' but it's 99 cents, and it's pretty fun to just ♥♥♥♥ around with the iron blade or fly around in a plane with a group of good friends and just have a good time.
6624	1	a	i approve of this game! 
6626	1	a	I guess there's dinosaurs or something.
6628	1	a	Chased across the map by a Trex. 10/10
6630	1	a	It's only a dollar. Most others would price this is a 15 dollar game. Think about that.
6632	1	a	Low graphics and stuff but if you like wave after wave of dinosaurs in Halo? It's pretty good.
6634	1	a	nice game for the price :)
6636	1	a	but... i ♥♥♥♥ing paid for this game!!! i want a refund this instant, not saying the game was horrible, but wtf steam, can we get refunds or what!? But in all seriousness, this game isnt that bad, and actually fun.  Game does require a pc with decent specs. my laptop is skat on the road so i cant play this game to the fullest. still fun tho
6638	1	a	Interesting game
6640	1	a	This is a good game, I only have 5 or so hours in it and in that time I found it a fun game to mess around in and not take serious. Didn't find any bugs or problems while playing.  Lot of content to keep you happy from a large selection of weapons, vehicles and dinos and classes.
6642	1	a	Awesome game for A buck.
6644	1	a	You kill Dinosaurs.......What more can one person ask for?
6646	1	a	My lunch costed more than this game and yet its a pretty fun game, Especially the co-op
1011	0	a	i should have listened to TB, this game is horrible, im running 2 titans and somehow this game still manages to drop below 30 fps on low settings, waste of time, horrible game. the mechanics are ok i guess, when they work right.
6648	1	a	this game is really FANTASTIC AND AMAZING !
6650	1	a	Good game lots of content and cant go wrong with the price
6652	1	a	First thing I'm going to say is that I'm not clear on who's stealing what from who, as I've heard that the creators of this game are in on a scandal. But I don't really care, because I'm here to review a game, not who made it. ~~~~~Pros~~~~~ - Cheap $0.99 or $0.49 during the summer sale. - Good combat system, not too repetitive. - The multiplayer is great IF you have one of your friends playing with you and you have voice chat. - The graphics are alright by normal standards. But Fantastic for 99 cents. - You can play as a ♥♥♥♥ING DINOSAUR (I don't know why you're still reading this after I said that.) ~~~~~Cons~~~~~ - I'll have to get back to you on that one.
1013	0	a	I have no idea what I just played, but then again, it's 0.99.
6654	1	a	Improved game. Honestly this is one of the better games for the buck I spent around $0.99 cents around the time and I actually enjoyed it I wasn't blown away by the graphics but by the gameplay it's seems as if the game alone should be worth around $10. If you want a couple hours of gameplay or even a hundred hours of gameplay this is by far one of best cheap games I have played in my entire life. Get this game if you want the best bang for your buck. Honest Rate: Graphics 8/10 Gameplay: 9/10 Concept: 10/10 Community: 10/10 (Very Friendly) Hackers: 0/10
6656	1	a	Awsome Game!! :D
6658	1	a	Everybody do the Dinosaur!   (you should also Walk the Dinosaur too, if you can... wouldnt want to get fatigued or anything,)  Really though, aside from the few imperfections, occasonal trolls, this game has VASTLY improved, and I highly reccomend it. Nothing is perfect.
6660	1	a	$.99 for lightsabers and dinosaurs. 10/10
6662	1	a	Great game and lots of fun. Jetpacks, Futuristic weapons, Augments, Stealth, objectives, tons of game modes, and giant Dinosaurs! It was worth the money and is fun enough that I'm still playing it off and on a month later. Not every game has staying power but I can see me revisiting this game again and again.
1018	0	a	Might aswell cut you leg off with a spoon, cause this game hurts your soul by simply being in the main menu
1019	0	a	The Metacritic score isn't lying.
6664	1	a	Simple, Fantastic, Classic! ~ ~ ~  CHEAP!!!    Hell Yes!
6666	1	a	for very few money this very much play i think i rate 7/10 good game yes ))
6668	1	a	in this game i've put 20 hours. that may not sound like much but for a 1 euro game. i don't know if i would recommend you the game at full price but for 1 euro. this game is worth 1 euro at least. 7/10
6670	1	a	It is worth f2p
6672	1	a	I feel like this game really taught me what it's like to be a paleontologist.
1030	0	a	wtf i purchased it and its telling me i didnt wtf,i hate this game thats not funny nor fair
6674	1	a	You Can kill T-Rex using Rifle and you can fly using jet pack what else do you need? It's Already Awsome
6676	1	a	Laserwords, Dinosaurs and ♥♥♥♥ing co-op. 10/10
6678	1	a	Beat a group of Raptors in the face with a Lightsaber and took a high-flying tour with my friend Jeffrey the Pterodactyl, which resulted in my bones shattering when he let my fatass go. 10/10. Would stab more dinosaurs.
6680	1	a	It has a smooth way of playing if your computer isnt to crappy. It can be either really easy or you can make it really hard on yourself if you put the difficulty higher! Also please note that leveling your class up is a must in this game. I don't think you will get far with a level 1 in your class on the highest difficulty. Mainly because if your a higher level you can start with a primary weapon instead of the pistol only! Still a fun game to play and a lot of fun to see your friends running from all the dinos while you laugh at them from afar!
6682	1	a	Worth a look when its on sale, lots of fun.
6684	1	a	this is a fun game, i really enjoyed it. its a great game for such a low price
6686	1	a	99 cents and more fun than some AAA games out now!
1031	0	a	Horrible
6688	1	a	Very first time playing just me and a friend, we spawn in have no clue what we are doing. We didnt even realize the round started and got swarmed, we composed ourselves and went on for 4 more rounds. Then a T-rex appears and picks my friend up a flings his lifeless body across the map, i died shortly after. 10/10 would bang
6690	1	a	Graphics aside, this game is great fun to play with. The survival mode is very similar to CoD: Zombies-but with dinosaurs; however there is a larger focus on protecting objectives. Great fun to play with friends
6692	1	a	Super Fun if you have friends to play with. You just shoot waves of dinosuars!
6694	1	a	From the first 5 minutes i enjoyed the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game ! worth playing with Friends Super Fun
1032	0	a	There are some server issues and not only that the game just keeps sending Dinos at you I love bears not Dinos
6696	1	a	Fell thru world and killed everything while being there. 5/5
6698	1	a	Imagine ark the new game for 25$ except entirely different except for the fact they have dinasours and you have this game. 10/10.5
6700	1	a	HOLY ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥, ITS A DINOSAUR. JESUS CHRIST. WHAT THE FUUUUCK.  That summarizes the game. 10/10
6702	1	a	killed dinosaurs with guns found out melee did 2000 dmg what is guns
1034	0	a	Half-Life 2 looks better than this game, which I can run on ultra with 60+ fps. My computer is fairly ♥♥♥♥♥♥, yet I can run a few games on ultra or even low and still get playable framerate. In this game I ran on low and got less then 10 fps, which is extremely unplayable. It may be bad because I have a terrible computer, but if I can run Far Cry 2 on ultra with 60+ fps, I should be able to run this on medium at least with 60+ fps.
6704	1	a	I remember getting this game when it was worth much more than 99 cents. Was fun while it lasted but for 99c, it is very much worth it even though I bought it at a much greater price. From killing dinosaurs to an all out pvp this game is worth a try.    5/10  
6706	1	a	This ♥♥♥♥ is a gem! Very entertaining. Not meny games that are going for one dollar are good at all. But this one is a steal. Yes there are bugs and yes the AI is kinda dull; However, the entertainment value is hard to beat. Halo, Star Wars, Call of Duty, and Jurassic Park in one game. Worth it.
6708	1	a	its literally killing floor but with dinosaurs  get this game you stupid idiot its only a FREAKING dollar
6710	1	a	You shoot guns, and kill things.
6712	1	a	I enjoyed the game thoroughly. In just an hour, I rode a plasma-laser Warthog, killed a Triceratops 20x my size, got thrown off of a cliff by a Pterodactyl, shot about 3x as many bullets as you can find in an armoury in Texas, and found myself lost in a winter-wonderland, forgetting that it wasn't an action-rpg, and that I had a base to defend.  7.5/10, would pay up to $20.00 for this game.
1040	0	a	I spent money for this game that did not even work for me and now its free. Wow i can't even get a refund for it.                                                                      WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
6714	1	a	Bought this game as it was on offer and it was well worth buying. Anyone into mmo/fps games should buy this game.
6716	1	a	Perfect Game Ever!!!
6718	1	a	&gt;Be 23 year old gamer &gt;Surfing on lelelelele Steam for good deals and playing some games &gt;Hears a loud thud on the door. &gt;It's the Orion: Dino Horde Devs armed with a machete &gt;'My prices are killers' the devs said &gt;Then they forcefully command me to... &gt;To open the door, get on the floor, everybody walk the dinosaur
6720	1	a	Awesome game, very addictive, paid 0.99 Euros and I didn't regret one cent ;).
1046	0	a	Not worth $15 more like $.25 - $.99
6722	1	a	A great time-sink game.
6724	1	a	I've only played this game for a few hours but it's okay so far. Not great, but not that bad.  You can play alone, with bots, or with humans. Waves of dinosaurs spawn in and you have to defend your base whilst shooting them. Some fly, some run, and some are just big. You get credits for killing them, which you can spend between waves at the weapon bases.   There are vehicles you and your team mates can use to travel around the map, and some of them you can fire from by using co-op, one driving, and one shooting etc.  After a few waves, better vehicles are unlocked.   Tips:  + Revive team mates + If you die during the wave, you lose your guns when you respawn + Dead team mates drop their guns ;) (lol) + Headshots do more damage + Use the Augment shop to upgrade your player + Shoot everything, buy the best guns + Stay off the ground level unless you're feeling brave 
6726	1	a	Its very good game!!
6728	1	a	This game is the most fun I have had in ages. I was sceptical at first because it is so cheap but MAN was I wrong. This game combines everything you could want. FPS, upgrades, cool guns, dinosaurs, mechs, tanks, hovercrafts, jetpacks... Do I need to go on? It is MULTIPLAYER!!
6730	1	a	It's basically Bioshock 2 except there are Dinosaurs. 10/10
1049	0	a	It's buggy and rough around the edges, but it isn't completely terrible.  99 cents is a fair price for it. Anything more is a rip-off.
6732	1	a	really really kid loving game...... no details and anything
6734	1	a	Really, this game is truly amazing. There are no dinosaur games/simulators like it, also you can fight a T-Rex in a Mech Suit....   So really your decison has been made for you, buy it! -Totally worth it.
1050	0	a	Its fun at the very beginning of the game but gets boring at the end the fun will never last!!!!
6736	1	a	This game is cool !!! &lt;3
6738	1	a	Pretty Cool
6740	1	a	im going to be honest, this is the first f2p game i have ever payed for, seriously, you have to buy credits with real money . the only place ive ever seen that, is in free to plays, if your going to have people pay for your game, dont make it a free to play platform.  aside from that, the gameplay is really cool, the community is amazing, but hot diggidy dog man, turn down the damn blur effects, there's so much blur that i cant see ♥♥♥♥ when im spectating, or even playing for that matter.
6742	1	a	You can kill a T-Rex in a tank - or punch his feet.  This game would be worth it even at 5€, but it's only 1, so go out buy it and have some stupid fun!
6744	1	a	This game is so much fun to play with a partner. WATCH OUT FOR THE FLYING BEASTS!

6746	1	a	Orion prelude updated review*  Orion prelude is a trully wonderful game. I still cant believe how awesome it feels even after a week playing the beta. The developers of this title did an extraordinary work to present us all with the new content update and lemme tell u, u wont regret it.  The graphics have been updated and overhauled to the best possible way. The gameplay has become really smooth and more fun. The addition of bots has made even single player more addictive. With endless mods that allow u to customize your characters/ pvp each other/play as dinos/test your abilities to the maximum/survive in open world maps, orion prelude has become what it was meant to be from the beginning. And that my friend is one of the best indie fps out there.  Although it has some minor flaws that need to be fixed, for 1$ on steam its maybe one of the best deals u will find in a game. If that is not a win deal, i dont know what is. Like i said in my previous review this game is better than alot AAA titles and damn more fun.  9/10
6748	1	a	The game has been released over 4 years ago. Since then it was constatly being developed, and worked on.   Game has received MAJOR overhauls over the years, all of which to appeal to players who still disliked the game. After the huge graphical overhaul the price was ever reduced to 1 dollar, and all people who purchased the game before that, received their money back in form of ingame currency.   TREK Industries is one of the most reliable game developers. From the time this game was first released, major companies have all released a few games. A good part of which were exactly the same games with different names, and charged 60 bucks for each of them.   Orion : Prelude in the meantime, has changed it's name 3 times, after the game changed so much, it was the same game only on the grounds of the basic mechanics used. All of which was done completely for free. No DLC's, no paid content, no reselling the same game (There is a cash shop in game for visuals. But there is no benefit to using it, it's just different skins.).  If you want to be sure the game you buy will not be abandoned : TREK.  Now, the game is being massively hated on, because of the activity of the drama lords. Seriously, the DMCA claim, has been proven to have grounds, surprisingly the person resonsilble, decided to admit it to the CO and even listed other things that nobody noticed, and thus agreed to take responsiblity.   However everything outside the DMCA claim, all of the things you can read on this game from the ones hating it, are mostly pulled out of context, or straight on misunderstood (Like the name changes).  If you have already read a lot of them, you probalby will not believe anything that I am writing, whatever, however if you have even a tiny bit of open mind, you should ask yoursefl, why do so many people stand strongly for this game, even though there is so many 'proofs' against them.   And the answer to it is : because these are the players who have seen all the love and work this game got over the years. The stolen models, which were already removed from the game, didn't influence the game in any way, nor they didn't harm Activision. Let's be honest the selling point of Orion is not that one gun, it's not the guns at all. It's not even the graphics, though I have to admit, that graphical overhaul update coming with Orion : Prelude was so good, my old PC actually stoped being able to run the game.   So really, it's a great game that is a lot of fun to play, especially with friends, features many gamemodes, and mixes the mechanics like no other game I know of. It's a perfect mix of sillyness, gameplay, replayablitiy and ideas.   You should definetely get this game if you have whom to play it with. And if you are hating on the game without knowing anything outside of the drama lords posts, please don't. Even if the models were knowlingly taken (which, again were not, case is solved already), TREK at least doesn't steal from you, the player. Which I can't say about some AAA titles out there.
6750	1	a	very fun if played with friends
6752	1	a	I can absolutely recommend this awesome game. I only tried the survival mode yet but it is much more fun than the other coop zombie survival games like l4d2 or killing floor.
6754	1	a	It sucks. There you go. Everything about it sucks. I bought is for a dollar on a sale. It was hardly worth that dollar. I've only gotten around and hour or so on it, and that was when me and my friend felt like getting angry at a game. Just don't bother yourself to buy it. Please, don't. Don't let the developer sucker you into this crap. It's so repetitive. Please don't.
6756	1	a	Cutting edge. Regular updates hourly, and its only a pre alpha! Its like the best early access its going to change the gaming industry. Why dino you go get it now, even at full price of 59 dollars a steal!!!!!!  Five stars - and that aint the safety rating!
6758	1	a	This is the cheapest fun game I've ever played. I don't think I've ever spent so little on a game that offered so much fun. I mean, even for only 14 hours played, that's about $0.07 per hour. I plan to play more, as my son loves the game and we played together last time.  Guns, dinosaurs, vehicles, and co-op action - what could be more fun than that?  As to the politics behind Activision - you filthy console fanboys need to take a good hard look at your precious CoD games. Every single CoD game is a blatant rip-off of a game that was released prior. Not to mention that they recycle their own assets every year to release yet another garbage game for a whopping $60, AND it gets released on both PC and consoles. Talk about greed and thievery. They're picking your pockets, and you have the gall to accuse others of stealing?!? Shame on you.  You people deserve Infinite Warfare. Enjoy that.
6760	1	a	I punched Spinosaurus to death. 10/10
1063	0	a	Bought this game game for 99p and it feels like a waste of money. Incredibly linear, unloved and unoriginal.
1064	0	a	I can only politely describe this game as a waste of hard drive space. The issues are as follows. 1. Weapon names can be misleading, an LMG is a 3 round burst rifle, and a light machien fun with the LMG tag is further along. 2. Enemies will still spawn, and attack you, when it displays wave clear. 3. spawn and upgrade room defense turrets start the game broken and don't fix themselves. 4. player character models look hideous. 5. the multiplayer lobby system is unintitive, with as far as I could see, no start game or ready up functions.
1065	0	a	This game is not worth 99 cents. This game is not worth the time it takes to download, even on a fiber connection. This game is a finely glazed sewageloaf.
1066	0	a	This game blows goat ♥♥♥♥♥. It was originally Orion Dino Beatdown, and I thought it had promise with jetpacks and dinosaurs...however only one class got the jetpack and it just had the biggest amount of bugs, crap ai, crap graphics, sounds and just about everything. Anyone who has ever played this warns anyone they can to not play and generally that its a waste of money....yes even at $0.99.
1067	0	a	I love how hard you're trying to make it seem like this game made a comeback! No one is playing on the servers that have nearly 900 ping...... Stop trying move on. I intalled then uninstalled 4mins later. This game still sucks people....
1068	0	a	it sucks!
1069	0	a	Wtf, it's not even worth a dollar
1070	0	a	This game has great potential; I've never though of a dinosaur based survival game. On the other hand, there are some things that need tiny tweaks and major improvements. First of all, I'll be talking about things that need to drastically be changed.  1. The AI for the dinosaurs need some changes. All that the ground dinosaurs do is, if you're on the ground, bolt after you with no strategy and try to eat you. If you're somewhere they can't reach you, they'll either start randomly running around not knowing which path to take to get to you, or they'll go and destroy the generator. Also, if you shoot a dinosaur it does not affect its movement; it will keep in charging at you until you finally kill it. 2. Very frequently I've been kicked out of a match for no reason. The game doesn't tell me why I've been kicked which is a major drawback. Those are two things that need major improvements on. Now I will list things that could slightly be improved on. 1. Animations for dinosaurs could be made more natural. Going along with the first thing I listed, If you shoot a dinosaur, they could flinch and/or stagger a little before continuing on with what they were doing. 2. Animations for the player have been a little buggy for me. If I reload my weapon, sometimes the magazine will fly into its place before the hand can move the mag into its place. If I equip a pistol, the pistol will be in its ready position without my hands and then my hands will come to hold the pistol. I think all of these things should be changed, and I hope the developer of this game sees this and takes action. I've heard this game has made improvements, but once these are changed, I will be able to recommend this game.
6762	1	a	this game is worth so much more than the asking price, i have been playing it about a year now and still love playing it today.... i have had hours of fun playing it and u will too.....    so stop reading feedback and buy it haha (joke)
1075	0	a	This...game....is...♥♥♥♥! Do not buy it! It used to be called ORION: Dino Beatdown. Terra-bad game. Bought it when it was said title..
6764	1	a	Dino farm simulator is the more action packed version of farming simulator. Instead of farming crops, dinosaurs breed and spawn all throughout your farm. You then have the luxury of choosing which vehicle to farm their carcasses with.   10/10 would bake again.
6766	1	a	Good game if its on sale.
1078	0	a	This is not Jurassic Park. 0/10
6768	1	a	Don't look at the rating. Just buy it at discount when possible. Nice Replayability, cool game type options, generelly friendly community and hey...Dinos to kill.
6770	1	a	why dont i get the game????
6772	1	a	This game originally released as orion dino beatdown and honestly it was pretty damn awful. but spiral is devoted to this game and the concept. I feel this game is in good hands and will blossom into an A plus game. This game is incredibly fun and can be tough at times but for its cheap price it is 100% worth every penny. And around the fourth quarter of 2014 they are updating the game with Orion:prelude which offers siginificant graphical updates to this stellar game. Do i reccomened this game? Hell yeah
6774	1	a	you no the dino attack t-rex kill the gay at the game
6776	1	a	This game is buggy but it is really fun.Its a really good time especially if you get it for a dollar.
6778	1	a	Welp....if it is 99% off go for it.Worth 10 hours but not any more.Ill just recommend the game but Im actually neutral on this one...
6780	1	a	fun game need decent harware to run not 100% friendly to new players but a great game in general thanks for the huge sale guys 99 cents awesome
6782	1	a	at $1 a copy, why the ♥♥♥♥ not
6784	1	a	Killing dinosaurs in waves, while purchasing weapon upgrades and augmentations in between. With friends, this is GREAT.  HOW is it GREAT?  Well, I was playing with two other friends. We spotted a vehicle that reminds me of the warthog from the Halo series, with driver, passenger, and gunner seats. I drove. What's great about the vehicles is that you can hold right-click and enter first-person mode. Reminds me of Halo: Combat Evolved.  Anyways, I was running over any dino in front of me, the gunner focused on the big dino near the area, and the passenger keeping the flying dinos away from us.  I had the brilliant idea of running into the giant dino. As I did, we flipped out into the air and nearly died. But we lived.  GREAT GAME.
1083	0	a	Crashes on starting/joining, also in-game store is dull. Also it is not on Early Access. Money well spent.
6786	1	a	Idk how this game got a bad score!!!! It's like badass but there has been allot of updates since then...
6788	1	a	First off, that metacritic score is not legit it's for a different game, This game is a really great action dino game that will have you hooked for hours. There's one problem other then some buggs not big ones only minor, It isn't as fun by yourself , get a friend. Just get the game! 6.5/10
1084	0	a	Well in my video  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqNG5YizcE  near the end you can see the overall qualiy of this game. The graphics are kinda bad and glitches run rampant.
6790	1	a	10/10 would snap dinosaur's neck irl thx m0m i luve yuh happy birfday breh got fade catch it in orion dino horde breh the last of the real dino stompers irl and in game breh got fade lets catch it breh i dont even care im trying to write a g00b review and you talking smack breh 1v1 me in rust gotr problem brew
1085	0	a	Don't buy it even for a dollar. This game is bad and it doesn't improve at all. Occasionally game title changes; what will the fourth one, i wonder?  I'd like to make summarized cons and pros section for this review like most of my reviews but unfortunately i can't. Don't waste your time and money. Buy a cosmetic DLC, TF2/CSGO weapons, $1 valued bundle or just buy a snack for yourself. Just avoid this abomination.
1086	0	a	Should've been free. To many bugs and lag if you ask me
1087	0	a	You can customize characters in lots of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ways, but due to high techs armors it's not really funny and you need to buy these.. The game has nothing innovative. I didnt find it interesting although it's only 0.99 euro.
6792	1	a	Look at nice dinosaur models. Then barbecue them!
6794	1	a	Takedown : Red Sabre, but with dinosaurs.  Only fun when you play it with friends and with a casual attitude.   Get it while its a dollar and have some fun.   (the dinosaurs have REALLY loud roars, I mean like deafening if you play with headphones)
6796	1	a	Halo + Turok + Killing Floor. MUST BUY AT THIS 93% OFF DEAL!!!!! 
6798	1	a	Played once during a free-weekend had a blast, would definitely recommend it the metascore to my knowledge is from before a massive overhaul/update?  I liked the gun selection and customization, it was also very easy to get into gameplay wise.
6800	1	a	Its like the shootiest dino blasting adventure ever!!
6802	1	a	This is a extremly fun game that has an amazing replay value, SO much fun.
6804	1	a	Good fun game MUST play with friends and DO NOT pay full price.
1089	0	a	Steam seriously needs to get its quality control in order. This is an unplayably buggy piece of trash.
6806	1	a	This is a super game for the price! It's like Halo with dinosaurs, You fight off waves of dinos in a multiplay, multigun, multi vehicle setting. I really like it for the full submersion being surrounded by attacking dinos really giving you great combat training. If your into first or third person shooters and want to sharpen your close quarters combat skills - This game is for you. 
6808	1	a	really fun
6810	1	a	Okay, listen up. Back when this was released, it was quite the mess, game didn't really work, wasn't fun to play and i just felt like i wasted my money. They later released more patches that supposedly would fix the game, they did not fix it, they gave away free Limited-Edition skins to Early Buyers, i still was not satisfied.  I ignored the game for about a year, it just wasn't fun anymore, it felt like i was just wasting my time playing this bug-riddled mess, i tried to enjoy it beacuse it looked stunning on the trailer, sadly the game wasn't the same.  However, during Christmas 2013, Spiral Studios released a Christmas Update, along with a huge new Map called The Arctic. This was when i decided to take another look at the game, and i noticed how they added a Levelling system, kind of like Killing Floor's (This was heavily requested by the game's community) some new Maps, and fixed tons of the bugs that had been plaguing the game since release.  While still being a quite flawed game (as you can notice while playing the game for a bit, ESPECIALLY those third-person player character movement animations, they look beyond terrible, sorry it had to be said!) i can finally say that i had fun with this game, and at the current 93% Sale price, it is WORTH IT.  The game is even free right now, all week, so why not give it a shot? 
6812	1	a	This is LITERALLY The best game I have ever played. Buy it immediately.
6814	1	a	This game is does not deserve a 36 from Metacritic. This game is fun, fast, and sometimes stupidly hilarious. Sure, the textures and models aren't amazing, but the enjoyment and playability of this game is quite high. The dinos will sneak up on you and sometimes you'll wonder what the hell is happening, but you will ALWAYS have a fun time playing this game.  I played this game when it was free about 6 months before writing this review and I loved the game. It has been on my wishlist ever since, and I picked it up when it was only one dollar. It's a steal for a dollar, pick it up NOW.
6816	1	a	FUGIN great a bit like CoD Zombies with DINOS
6818	1	a	This game is nothing like I have seen before. I thought you were dinosaurs and you have to kill humans but it's the totall opposite. I really like this game and i would recommend it
6820	1	a	Pretty cool game, if your into dinosaurs and biting peoples asses off. Or, if your into killing animals to extinction and trying to get eaten. WELL! THIS IS DA GAME FOR U!
6822	1	a	I think this game has a bad first impression. Especially if you're not into 'horde' games. The learning curb is pretty small if you've been introduced to games like this before. Just kill everything and upgrade as much as possible. It can be somewhat easy once you know what you're doing and can kite a bit. Making it into late game can be very satisfying because there's so many smaller dinos and several bigger ones running around all trying to get you and you can single-handedly take them all out if you're a good enough pilot. The clash of futuristic weapons and armor with ancient extinct reptiles is nice. The mode I've been playing is survival, basically Killing Floor with bigger maps, vehicles, and upgrades. There's many more modes to try out though. If anything I'd say it's a least worth trying out. It's also pretty cheap so that's nice too. Of course there are some bad things about this as well. The good outweighs the bad, but still. One of the biggest things I've noticed is that the skies usually aren't that great compared to the landscape. Could just be a texture bug, but I dunno. If anything they're just boring. Another big problem is getting stuck in rocky places of the map. Can be very problematic if you're trying to get an object last minute. This game is great and I do look forward to future updates to help with some of the issues it has.
1090	0	a	I have one word to describe it:lag
6824	1	a	This game is quite buggy and I feel like I'm shooting rubber bullets but when your playing with friends, this game is actually pretty fun :D
6826	1	a	great game for that price
6828	1	a	Game most definitely deserves a better metascore.
6830	1	a	Grab a knife. Slice for your Life!
6832	1	a	Punched out a velociraptor. 10/10
6834	1	a	$0.99, Why not??
6836	1	a	0/10 Dinosaurs are extinct SOO UNREALISTIC!!  But no seriously its pretty fun
6838	1	a	I bought this game for a dollar I think. As far as games go it's ok I guess, but when I read how long it's been in development and how hard the team has been working on it, I get the urge to stand up and flip my desk over, and walk out of the room muttering about syrup and potatos.  This game is fun for a dollar, but don't try and tell me it's been in development for 3 years when I could have made this in my sleep with the help of a couple pet seals dry humping my keyboard.  I have no problem with indy developers, but these guys sound like they are so full of crap. This game could run on a school science caculator. It's just garbage, it would be really fun if they would fix the mechanics and animates. The textures and graphics aren't so bad but yea it's crap.  But it only costs a dollar or something so you might as well buy it.
6840	1	a	This is a fun game, but what has ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off is that I paid for it and now it's F2P. I'm quite annoyed. Is there a way I can request a refund? Hahah. But non-the-less it is a fun game and great gfx. 5/5 if I get a refund
6842	1	a	The game is fantastic. It's come a long way from Dino Beatdown and as a lot of other reviews will say: do not trust the metacritic score. I've gotten more hours of fun than I have from games I've paid four times as much for. You can kill T-Rex's with flame throwers, rocket launchers, miniguns, bows, snipers, machine guns, a knife, a jedi sword, and grenades.
1093	0	a	Really really not worth your time due to bugs, bad game design and almost nothing to do. It makes the tutorals of MOBA's look good as you find out what kills you as you die again to no apparent souse.  This game is for when your drunk and want to rip the @£$ out of a game while making bad T-Rex jokes.
6844	1	a	You take a FPS, put on a hard mechanic, combined with HALO's engine and add Dinosaur AI and Skin, mixed with OP Guns and hard system requirements. Overall: 5/10, game has a huge lack of players and servers.
6846	1	a	Fantastic.
6848	1	a	Hey your qoute 'We released the worst game ever' Day one garrys incident is IMO
6850	1	a	awsome/cod/halo/tf2/juassic park/
6852	1	a	I really enjoyed and i strongly recommend it :D
6854	1	a	Better than any of the COD, BF, or Halo games. Worth the money if you like good FPS.
6856	1	a	This game is verry glitchy, But its a verry fun game still. Buy it, its cheep why not?  8.6/10
1096	0	a	'If you don't have anything good to say, don't say anything'. That about sums this game up for me.
6858	1	a	Not the best but very very far from the worst. This is like halo, and bit of borderlands and a dose of coop mixed in.  A great way to waaste time.
6860	1	a	Still better than COD 10/10 
6862	1	a	my friend got eaten alive bij a T-rex. :D 10/10
1098	0	a	The factor is that this game is simply terrible. When I first picked up this game, it seemed like it was going to be something fun to play with friends. Boy was I wrong, first off lets take a look at graphics. Listen, I know that graphics are not everything but this game looks like it was thrown together in a day. The animations are so very basic and so crappy that it truly does take away from any positive gameplay expierence. But perhaps your the person that could care less about any type of graphical fidelity and instead are content with a good gameplay expierence. Too bad it doesn't provide good gameplay either. The game is full of glitches, such as during a wave of dinosuars, the dinosaurs remaining count doesn't change at all, leaving you with a never ending wave. Or perhaps the factor that only certain dinosaurs bring down the counter, despite the factor that there is not a singal indicator as to which dinosaurs to kill. Then lets look at the factor that this game has so many elements from other titles. Now, there is nothing wrong with utilizing previously exsisting features in games to improve your own (Borderlands 2 driving mechanic, fight to revive etc.), that's what helps push the industry forward. Sadley this game does not have an original bone in it's body, and the features it does take from others, it does incredibly poorly. Overall this is a pass, I would NOT recommend buying this game.
6864	1	a	it is quite fun, and it seems like developers are really committed. I would recommend this game as it is continuously improving. With that being said it is certainly worth the discounted price and will soon be worth its normal price. They should however list it as early access so people know it will get better.
6866	1	a	FORGET THE METASCORE RATING. FORGET IT RIGHT NOW! Have you always wanted to fight dinosaurs with your fists? That's a weird thing to hope for! This game's for you then! It's weird just like you! But I bet you also have friends, right? No? Well then... IT'S STILL A FUN GAME TO PLAY ALONE. Although not as fun as with friends. PLAY WITH YOUR FRIENDS. If you don't have friends MAKE SOME ONLINE ONES. And if you don't have those THEN MAY NEPTUNE HAVE MERCY ON YOUR SOUL. 10/10 WOULD PLAY AGAIN IF I WAS IN A DARK ROOM WITH NOTHING ELSE TO PLAY.
1099	0	a	Alt+F4 does not work... it really should because i wanted to stop playing AFAP 2/10 would not bang
6868	1	a	This is just my first impresions,  It's avesome, gun play fun, dinos fun, movement easy, grafics pasable, sound effect a litle dull, but still fun  It's that rule it's so mediocore thats its fun... standard
6870	1	a	heard it was bad
6872	1	a	Very cool fun game. Bad that it doesn't hav an complex developer console like the valve games to make it work on pc from 1998.
6874	1	a	Great game! But hard to run.
6876	1	a	This game is so awesome. Think firefight mode on Halo: Reach, but ten times more awesome. Tons of content, lots of fun, and the community is also pretty great. Don't think i've ever had more fun in a multiplayer game before this. There are a lot of guns to choose from, the maps are absolutely huge, and the vehicles are pretty great. Everything handles well and runs smoothly. My only complaint is that there are only three human classes but apparently, there is a major update coming to this game in august which includes both a name change for the game itself and a bunch of new classes.
6878	1	a	T-Rex grabbed my tank, throws me away. Flipped over. Dead. Raged hard, but funny. Spinosaurus brutally murders me just eating me str8 of the bat. 10/10 I mean it may seem ♥♥♥♥ed up but hey it's really fun.  MAIN REVIEW:  Do you like dinosaurs? YEAH! Do you like getting like ♥♥♥♥ing devoured by them? DOUBLE YEAH! Do you like the Jurassic Parks and Jurassic World? YEAH!  Well, lets do Jurassic Park/World / chomping which probably turns out to be this game. This game has very outstanding graphics and possible real impressions of what dinosaurs were probably and has many cool features such as being in the future and many cool gadgets.  GAMEPLAY: When I first got the game around a year after it's release for $0.99 on a sale when it was originally $15USD, I liked it even though around that time it was ONE of the worst games but I thought it was amazing. Even though it had many bugs and other things I didn't seem to notice those bugs (Maybe a bit but not a mountain full of them) and I knew the game one day would become much more popular. Currently the gameplay is amazing as your objective in the dino survival is to survive for 10 rounds without getting the generator destroyed by the dinos. It might've not seen much but it was very entertaining. Although you probably raged hard when the Spinosaurus ate you, you were still enjoying the game.  Pro's and Cons (Past and Present)  PROS: -The Devs were very supportive and tried really hard to revive the game and suceeded. -Certain maps have a weather system and on cold maps your vizor could freeze -Unique weapons to choose from like Adrenaline weapons -Unique upgrades/augmentations to choose from to help win the game -Well textured graphics -Many different sounds -Well done impressions of the dinosaurs -It only costs $0.99USD  CONS: -Can get bored of it for a while and not play it for a prolonged time -Needs maybe some more classes -Couple more weapons  CONCLUSION: Overall, it is a very well crafted game and very cool and unique features and I would very highly recommend this game and really, it's $0.99USD. Try their game! they are just trying to make a good game and it is so just go ahead and try it.
6880	1	a	ORION:DH is like discount Halo with dinosaurs. I spent hours slashing dinosaurs and it was a good experience. The game is very cheap and also come with 5 trading card (each around 0.1~0.12 $ on market) thus profit. If you by chance saw this game on discount 75% or more, make sure to buy it. You won't regret it !
6882	1	a	Pretty fun game. It got very low metascore ratings due to it being released VERY early on when it was very glitchy with little content.  Its had a lot of improvements, though and it quite fun now. Good if you like slaying things with your friends.
6884	1	a	This game actually kind of rules. The metacritic score is outdated and wrong. This game has quite a few bugs and general lack of polish, but there are no game-breaking or even game-delaying bugs. If you can see past the shoddy UI and overall presentation, you'll find that co-op dino killin' is really fun. The core gameplay is actually done quite well. It could use some more dino types and better balance, but aside from that everything is spot-on and highly entertaining.
6886	1	a	Rode a vehicle full of teammates into a dino and it blew up. Won an achivment 10/10 id suicide bomb again.
6888	1	a	Better than before '-')b~~~~
6890	1	a	Awsome value for money.this game is better than some $20 games. Dont doubt my playtime, this game is meant to be played in short bursts.
6892	1	a	While its an extremley fun game on the outside of its dino like body, its a buggy mess on the inside. Some thinks its horrible, others think its awesome, Im in the middle somewhere, it looks amazing on full settings and you need a beefy computer to do that, gameplay wise, its really fun , but some bugs downright BREAK the game, like when my friend accidently drove off a cliff and he couldnt get out of the car even when it was upright, story, it has none, now to the dinosaurs you can fight, the Tyrannosaurus, Spinosaurus, Trike, Stegosaurus, Deinasuchus, Raptor, Compy, Pteradactyl, and a few more. The modes you will play most are the Rampage, Survival, and Dinosurvival, I will go over these. Rampage, you become the dinosaurs against other players as the humans. Survival is where you go through 10 waves and fight off hordes of dinosaurs, over time the objective will change simotaneasly. Dinosurvival is where its basically survival, but you can kill your teamates, which is weird, my overall rating has to be......... 7/10, like I said, its the glitches
6894	1	a	My friend could buy 260 copies of ORION Prelude by selling his csgo knife. 10/10 IGN
6896	1	a	METAscore was sooooo wrong this game is very fun and takes some stratgy or teamwork in some game modes and i love how u can play as the Dinosaurs.  78/100
1104	0	a	Don't waste your time.
6898	1	a	The Metacritic score is indeed misleading. It may not be as polished as some AAA titles but its not as bad as its metacritic score makes you believe. Its a fun unique game with tons of content, lots of game modes, a 50 level leveling system, 3 classes and tons of weapons and upgrades that its meant to be played with other people. The devs keep releasing updates adding and fixing stuff and there are many people playing atm.  I'd say that its worth a try, you'll enjoy it.
6900	1	a	I first saw this game when it was on sale, and when I watched the videos and read the reviews, I thought it was a joke. So I bought it. When I started playing it at first, I had no clue what was going on. After trying different gamemodes, I finally understood the joke and began enjoying the lighthearted and jesting atmosphere. To be honest, this game is a joke. But not a bad joke that gets told over and over again and makes you want to punch whoever is telling it. No, this game is a joke that pulls you in, chews you up, spits you out, and makes you want to start all over again. And I like it.
1106	0	a	don't work on windows 8.1 64bit, nvidia gtx 780 x 2 sli with 32gb ddr3
1107	0	a	Great idea for gameplay, horrible execution. The game environments look alright, but the character, weapon, vehicle, and building textures look like they were made by members of the Unreal Tournament community over a decade ago. I don't understand how a game engine can have the kind of performance issues that this game suffers from, even when all the settings are turned low, despite the fact that it doesn't look as good as other titles I've played (that perform better). The gameplay leaves me asking questions like: Why is the generator so far away from the other buildings? Why don't I have enough time to get back and buy weapons and upgrades between rounds? I also find myself asking questions about the originality of the game, such as: why does the tank look like a ripoff of the scorpion from Halo? Why are we fighting dinosaurs of different time periods, millions of years apart? Why aren't these like, primordial alien monsters that resemble dinosaurs (we are futuristic soldiers)? Why does the menu music sound like a cross between Battlefield games and the action score of Pirates of the Carribean (which already sound similar)?  I read a review last time I tried a free preview that stated the game still feels like it's in alpha. I agreed with it. I read a recent (community) review that said they've improved the game since then. My recent experience proves that to be mostly false and I still agree, it needs a ton of work because it still feels like it's in alpha.  Biggest problem: how is this not a free-to-play game if it has its own store?
1108	0	a	There's a good game in here.. somewhere.  The gun and vehicle play are solid and there are sparse moments of real squad camaraderie‎.  However, they're the exception and not the rule as lousy UI, poor squad communication (someone just hit the 'Follow me!' voice bind. Who did it? Not displayed.) and incredibly frustrating player death (wait 10+ minutes for the round to be over, and all your stuff is now gone.)  The item loss on death can be mitigated by unlocking permenant character gear through levelling, but the players who need this boost the most -- the newbies -- are completely left out. As a result, it's not uncommon for a new player to join up on wave 6 with nothing but a pistol and be completely slaughtered before he can earn the credits to get anything else. It's kind of heartbreaking watching a dozen of these players join your game, get murdered, and leave, one and two at a time.
6902	1	a	I drove a jeep. Ran over triceratops. Went flying and hit the skybox. 11/10 would do again
1109	0	a	This Game even on sale is a real dissapointment, but because of the marketing strategies used by the dev's they make this game look like game of the decade so dont get suckered in and bight the bait. All and all there isnt much to enjoy playing this game even with friends because the whole game is as the title sais; you are killing hordes of dinos and nothing else ever sure there is fancy guns mechanics and vehicles but it doesnt take away the fact that its only killing A.I dino's. It would be the same thing if tetris threw in mechanics to send blocks backwards and get upgrades its still just ♥♥♥♥ing blocks
6904	1	a	It's like killing floor  but its not
6906	1	a	A strangely fun FPS game enjoyed best with friends. The assets look like they were taken off of a Halo knock-off, but the gameplay of wave-based dino shooting and vehicle driving has a simple satisfaction that other AAA games don't always seem to provide.   That, and for less than a McChicken!
6908	1	a	For one dollar, it's definitely worth it. Think of it as an arena-styled game with some Halo-like vehicles and Borderlands-esque graphics. Though its not the most engaging game ever, its very fun at times and has rewarding gameplay. Mowing down hordes of dinos is always fun as you continue to gain credits in order to get better weapons and even vehicles. Great value and good fun for a dollar and you'll definitely get some enjoyment out of this for its price.
6910	1	a	If a dinosaur, killing floor, and halo had a love child this would be it. 
6912	1	a	It's actually pretty damn fun you can play as the spy with the amby knife and invis watch never buy any primary or secondaries the amby has infinite ammo and 1 hits everything anyway just get 100000 monies for backstabbing dinosaurs on halo maps.
6914	1	a	This game is a really fun multiplayer 'shoot-some-dinos' fps for one dollar.  +Graphics +Variety of equipment/guns/upgrades +Leveling plus permanent bonuses for leveling +Get to shoot dinos for fun +1$ -Could add more types of dinos and maybe a HUGE horde mode :D  Seriously, no cons really. Especially at 1$ no point in not buying it. Seriously a really fun game. Happy hunting.
6916	1	a	i dont have this game.
6918	1	a	Amazing game, pretty addicting and fun to play with your friends, at the price of 0.49$. Awesome! oops, forgot to mention. Open the door, get on the floor, everybody do the dinosaur!
6920	1	a	Worst game that I've ever played and I like it for that! The glitches in this game make it a hilarious game to play with your friends, especially if you like derping around and breaking the games. Obviously, it's not going to be a masterpiece as you only pay 0,99€ for it, but I think it's definetily worth trying at least!
6922	1	a	For 79p, Tony Hawks Pro Dino Buggy 2004 is the perfect addition to your library. Marvel as the mighty Stegasaurus aids you in flipping your dune buggy into a crazy 2160 degree trick, which nets you the one thing gamers love more than anything else: points.  Highly recommended, never before has the Unreal Engine looks so lush; comparable to the mighty potato mentioned so oft in the archives of the venerable fountain of knowledge that is youtube.  Punched a T-Rex in the face: 13/7
6924	1	a	11/10 would hear me roar oar oar oar oar ooarr
6926	1	a	More better then 'EVOLVE'.
6928	1	a	Got 2 achievments and a card while jetpacking into t-rex balls.  11/10 would play again.
6930	1	a	ORION: Dino Horde is one of those fun games that me and my friends have a great time in. There are many gamemodes and maps and most which involve the fun dino killing the game is based around. What adds on to the fun is their system of vehicles and the Rampage mode, which puts you onto the side of the humans AND the dinos. This is all around a very fun game to play and I recommend it.
6932	1	a	Bought it for a dollar. You shoot dinosaurs. Pretty fun for LAN parties, but not the best for single-player, in my opinion.
6934	1	a	Doesn't suck.
1115	0	a	Where my dogs at man? Where my medic dogs at man?
6936	1	a	Don't bother with the metascore.
1116	0	a	probably the worst game on steam
6938	1	a	I still have trouble accepting the fact that I paid $0.99 for this game. Even if you don't particularly love this game, you will still feel like you got your money's worth just because of how complete and all around solid the whole experience is. This is an A+ title in this gamer's opinion.
6940	1	a	this game very good 
6942	1	a	DUDE ! its like Boarderlands , Halo , Killing floor and Jurassic Park all in one game
1119	0	a	I saw a lot of reviews said that this game offers a lot of fun for a cheap price.Well,that's not entirely true.It's just too boring for me.The graphic is mediocre,the animation is dreadful,the guns have 0 recoil and it's pretty hard for me to find someone playing online since I play from Indonesia.I can't feel the survival thrill like in other wave survival games.It's just too unrealistic and illogical.It's not worth your money,unless you'll want to pay for boredom in a couple of hours.
6944	1	a	It´s like Left4Dead but with dinosaurs, and i love it
6946	1	a	Better than Bioshock Infinite, maybe.
6948	1	a	I recommend this game for those who played L4D and L4D2 as this is an awesome survival game !
6950	1	a	First Impressions: Not a great game, but the only multiplayer dinosaur attack pc fps I've ever played I thinkk. Loosely similar to **Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter**. Mildly entertaining, it's not awful if you've ever wanted to mindlessly shoot at dinosaurs for a few minutes. Pretty simple setup, and still people playing online so it's not hard to find a game  Cons: - lots of glitchy jumpy laggy physics (being picked up by the pterodactyl).  - weapon store in separate building from perk upgrades?  Pros: - large weapon variety (snipers, pistols, a bow??) - many many hungry dinosaurs - snow map is quite large - giant fat dinosaurs that take a whole team to wrangle  Kinda cool, like a 3 out of 5 ish  Check our other reviews!  www.KittiesAndBacon.com 
6952	1	a	Why the ♥♥♥♥ does this game keep changing names? Nah I don't care whatever it's ok, I got it for free so ♥♥♥♥ it, have a recommendation.
6954	1	a	this is cactus :D :3  IM DONG so a;caguash man
6956	1	a	I was really surprised how much fun this game actually is, and for only $1. I had little expectations for it, but was so surprised, I spent the first whole weekend playing the game non stop, I even reguarly host my own server there too. There are many modes in the game too Iprefer survival, and conquest the most, but also they have 1v1 duel, and FFA, and CTF. you should stop reading this review and just buy it already.
1126	0	a	Nice world. Great Trailers. But sense of accomplishment? Nah.  Single player (solo) in 'noob mode' should be removed from the gameplay options for the maps in this game. There is no noob mode as it suggests. You arrive on the map with a timer to find everything you'd need to be wearing before the waves of dinos start, but you can't look for those things until you turn on the generator which is how you start the first wave, a generator which, for some amazing reason, is located far from the base where your weapons and augments are located. If the premise is that we're establishing ourselves on some alien planet we know is habitated by dinosaurs then why would we put the generator some 150 yards from our main base? One could say it'd be because it'll explode if it gets too severly damaged, okay, then it would also injure badly and/or kill whatever made it explode too. None of this appears to have been happening.  -The dino flyers that attack enroute to the next base we're supposed to capture disappear too quickly or take a flight path that makes hitting them extremely difficult for the new player (differnet flight paths, aggression, etc., in noob mode would have been a great consideration).  -The vehicles were destroyed rather quickly as well.  -There's nothing but a sign over a building that gives any direction, nothing inside to show what station or location in the building of your base you're supposed to use to get weapons or an augment. No tutorial walking you through your toon's options either.  -When the triceritops (I think it was) had killed me and the game went into fight to survive mode, the dino walks away and I am moving at a crawl, unable to carry out that fight, though it said I have 3 lives left, apparently there is no actual rez, just a fight in almost dead mode where you can't even follow the assaulting AI let alone fire at it.  One might think I am asking for a finished game (as I see this has a kickstarter). No, I am asking for the game to be thoughtful of the new player they decided to have a free weekend for (February 20th-27th). If they're trying to sell the game through that free weekend (and thereby also sell kickstarter contributors) then this was their opportunity and though the executable code seems pretty clean and well done, which I do greatly appreciate, the chance for a new player to appreciate the actual game, to have the fun seen in the videos is just not there in the first run experience.  When we compose from a letter to a written story, maybe better said as author a letter or story, to communicate something we are to write to the reader or we'll have failed to communicate to those we want to express something to. Games, and the industry as a whole, are communicating a story and are always looking for new players, yet, their considerations of game design in relation to telling their story seems to follow whatever path the experienced and elitist gamers say is good. These are given preferential treatment in influencing the game design and often of closed alpha and beta relationships. Their input is great for those areas of the game such experience would lend itself to aiding in the design of, but for the new player and selling a game to the vast audience it has potential to reach, the gaming company listening to the entrenched 'professional' game tester, as with this game, finds the game has a very narrow appeal, and that the gaming company ended up designing their game to a player 'first time experience' in an elitist vacuum of these types of gamers whose playing of the game alone will not afford to keep the servers open. Thus the free game play weekend is wasted if its intended purpose was to elicit a large enthusiastic interest of new and highly energized players.  And remember that this free weekend isn't just to sell a game but is also an opportunity to sell it well enough to gain those new players as kickstarter contributors. This will be very difficult to do when the first impression, that first time one plays the game it seems to have entirely ignored that first game play experience, to have failed to give that first time player an overwhelming positive emotional response that brings them to want to continue the game to see what's next, and, to help develop the game further by contributing to the development -- a desire to have a direct connection to whatever comes next in that development.  I can't recommend the game or say it's a good game, I didn't get to go that far and only know how my first experience was worthless in regard to feeling exhilarated, feeling good about the game, and having any sense of accomplishment -- all of these were lacking.   For what I played, however, Spiral gets an A+ for code that's clean and well written, that had no graphic or other odd issues and for creating a visually appealing world that through videos sold me to try Orion: Dino Horde.  I hope they keep at it but know that they can only rewrite the first experience by assuring the one they offer is well scripted to achieve as broad an appeal as they can while well informing the player of how to play, so the learning and achievement are mutually occurring and help give every new player an incredibly positive player experience where their sensation from this experience creates an obvious knowledge that the game designers thought of the player first and their need for newe players to assure the game's longevity. This will also aid in making sure noob mode is easily identifiable for the new player (meaning we know that we can try harder modes and thus want to experiment, the first step in gaining our desire to play and become immersed in the game and its world).  In summary, what I am saying is that if Spiral doesn't design to achieve a large and enthusiastic player base (that will naturally come from new players) then the future of the game is dim, and to take the time to play a game that has a short life span is only good if you're sure you weren't going to play this that long anyway, but if Spiral's design and idea is to have a long standing game then the first consideration should be the new player and making sure these are plentiful and will, over time, not require a free-to-play weekend to gain. It'll be a great game if the same integrity that went into the coding of the game goes into the game's design considerations and map option characteristics.
6958	1	a	literally the best game ever made. totally not a halo rip off with dinosaurs. 10/10
6960	1	a	Totally worth the price (especially when on sale). It is an entertaining game where you shoot dinosaurs with your Sci-Fi friends while equipped with cool guns and grenades and jetpacks. Seriously why would you not play this game.
6962	1	a	Fantastic, perfectly created for our enjoyment! No glitches or anything!
1127	0	a	June 2014 I've noticed massive improvements since launch, but it's still a terrible game. The narritive voices are a joke, and are only there to hide the fact they don't have proper dinosaur sounds. Every dinosaur pretty much behaves the same way, they just rush at you when you get within a certain distance, and some have ranged attacks, or fly, but they are otherwise the same enemy. The game has a choppy and unpolished feel to it. It's cool that they are adding new things to the game, but the game really needs some polish rather than new game modes and items.
6964	1	a	this game is awesome, we can shoot the dino until turn to chicken
6966	1	a	Okay, this is the only review I've ever done for Steam. The Metacritic score is not justifiable. This game is AT LEAST worth the price. Get it if it's on sale. It gets really fun sometimes.
6968	1	a	Don't know why it has a 36 metascore, it's a fun relaxing game where you get to blow off dinosaurs heads and have an objective to complete with a team
6970	1	a	Really nice and good game 10/10
6972	1	a	I'm mainly a coop gamer and this game has a fun coop gameplay, pitting humans against dinosaurs in huge world maps with weather effects. Kill dinosaurs to earn XP, upgrade your abilities, buy new weapons, vehicles and survive the waves! Anxiously waiting for the august 2014 update.
6974	1	a	Halo and dinosaurs?! This game is sort of like Halo but with waves of dinosaur killing. Its a pretty cheap game and fun with friends. When it is on sale get it!
6976	1	a	Its got dino's and guns, nuff said!
6978	1	a	A very addictive game and fun as hell!! ^_^
6980	1	a	got picked up by a T-rex, used a rocket launcher to explode its head. 10/10
6982	1	a	The game is fun with your friends but it can become very annoying to play with all the glitches
6984	1	a	Got it for $1.50 with a bunch of friends on the Steam Sale and we all had a blast tonight. Don't let the metacritic score fool you. This was really fun.
1128	0	a	I just bought and played Orion: Dino Horde because it was on sale for a buck. I immediately regret this purchase. I knew the game was under development hell but it’s just so bad. And the community is worse than the game itself. It’s just filled with kids who think the game is better Call of Duty but even Call of Duty has some polish. It’s just so bad. The controls are so clunky even after changing the terrible default key bindings. Movement and aiming feel so stiff. There are so many missing animations. Guns sound and feel like peashooters. Even rocket launchers look, sound and feel weak. The art design looks like your generic scifi shooter. The music is bland. There is just no redeeming quality about this game. Holy ♥♥♥♥ I can’t believe something like this is even on Steam. It feels like an alpha build but it isn't. It’s a full game that has been officially released for 2 years now. And the sad thing is that was a kickstarter project. I almost feel sorry for the poor shmucks that funded this now obvious cashgrab.
6986	1	a	best fps yet
6988	1	a	It is a really awesome game :)
6990	1	a	It was worth the 59 cents I spent on it
6992	1	a	The game plays like Killing Floor, but with dinosaurs and Halo-style gear. I'm writing this based on the second major iteration of the game. I played it when it was still ORION: Dino Beatdown - back when it got the low Metascore that still, unfortunately, weighs heavily on it. It wasn't polished, and I think people expected more from it. This was in the days before Early Access was a thing; the game was buggy, and felt more like a late alpha or beta build than a complete game. That being said, the dev team's work to completely revamp and tweak the game shows. They added a mode to play as dinosaurs, more maps, and I hear they have mechs and stuff now - but I have yet to play with those. Point is, the game has come a long way, and if it sounds like a game you'd like, watch a few videos, and take the Metascore with a grain of salt. It's forever going on sale, so just wait for one if you still have your doubts.
6994	1	a	Literally don't know wtf this game is but I bought it and kept it cuz it had dinos. So worth it. (Idk if it is cuz I don't understand this game).
6996	1	a	Halo meets Turok! This game is all about survival and it does a good job of challenging you. This game is a BLAST with friends, it is still fun solo, but amplified many times over with more people. It has an addicting gameplay that rewards progress. All DLC is free and will be free, customization is simple yet fun. Where else can you punch a Trex in the face, get rewarded wtih 750 credits AND unlock an achievement?   Breakdown 8.5/10 (In it's current state an 8.5, but IMMENSELY strong potential to be a perfect 10!)  *High replayability *Tons of achievements to unlock *co-op or adversarial multiplayer *DINOSAURS!!
6998	1	a	Cheap, but very entertaining game. Hopefully they could make an upgrade about campaign though, like what are your objectives, why are you killing dinosaurs, and such, I think that we're alien visitors and just mining some power for our own planets or technology, should add details about such things. anyway, great game 8/10
7000	1	a	Fun game, good deal for the price.
7002	1	a	The best things in life arent free. But a damn good game can be $1
7004	1	a	This. Is a great game for those who like first person shooters  If you ever get broad play this
7006	1	a	Another dino game, I know, but this one is more of a survival shooter. Plus, you can get some stuff to look good and to impress. Overall, this game is brilliant and it was worth the 1 euro I gave for it.  -10/10 was not disappointed
7008	1	a	Fun Game Would get old fast but make sure you put silly Waves on ! Makes the Game Last a bit longer
7010	1	a	Its buggy in a funny way. It's definatly worth it, and better than most games with this concept.  PS: I hir a T-Rex in the ♥♥♥♥ with a knife, so thats a big plus.
7012	1	a	I remember when i bought this game when it came out, and i must say it was horrible. Like there was so many bugs that everyone was just mad at the devs for releasing such a bad game. But now i see they have improved and i wanna give it a try again. And based on other reviews, it seems like a good try (its also a buck)
7014	1	a	think of halo, and raids of dinosours atacking. that is EXACTLY what this game is. there is replicas of ghosts, banshes, and those tanks... its a rip off halo 3 - reach
7016	1	a	It's so bad it's good. Get it on sale.
7018	1	a	This game is literally sex
7020	1	a	3
1131	0	a	The unistall button works.
1132	0	a	there is a horde of dions that eat your face. play on the halloween map if you (dont) want to preserve your sanity. why do the t rex throw rocks from its face? no backstory whatsoever and this game sucks.
7022	1	a	I had a knife fight with a Pterodactyl. So much awesome.
7024	1	a	according to amazon dot com, this game is six times cheaper than buying a baseball bat to beat your own head in
7026	1	a	The Sharknado of video games.
7028	1	a	Just buy it play for 1 hour and never touch it again. 'Still better than FNAF' 10/10 ~Everybody
1134	0	a	it ran like crap in 2013, still runs like crap
7030	1	a	This game is really awsome and if you have friends to play with,it'll be even more awsome. I just wish this game was more popular.  Also,you can    Noscope a T Rex and kill him in one shot     11/9    Because only America puts months before days    -IGN
7032	1	a	Despite the many criticisms surrounding this game and its history, it's actually not bad, especially after all the free updates that the dev team has been rolling out, an unprecedentedly generous feature compared to the larger, corporate imperiums that dominate game design today, who not only disregard bugs and their player base, but would have them pay extra for such to be fixed in the way of expansions and DLC.  The game itself isn't exactly a revolutionary genre, but it incorporates popular aspects from several games and melds them together to form a unique and generally enjoyable experience. If anything, I'd say jetpacking above the reach of hordes of raptors and blasting them to smithereens with a rocket launcher is my idea of a good time, but take it or leave it: It's only a buck, yet worth quite a bit more in replayability.
1136	0	a	 Unless You Have Friends To Play With... Really Only Worth It For The Trading Cards
1137	0	a	i want my money back.
7034	1	a	This game cured my autism. But gave me astigmatism instead.
7036	1	a	Bad optimized.. freezes on i7 4712MQ + Geforce 940M, where GTA V works on high settings.. But it's fun to play! :)
1138	0	a	this game is garbage tried playing several matches and the game performs so poorly, yet it keeps going up on sales, it's not even worth a dollar  
1139	0	a	This game might be cool. If me and my friends could actually play together without 'cannot connect' ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.   Not worth 15 bucks at full price or 3 dollars on sale.  This game is st00pid.
1140	0	a	So I am going to be rather honest with this short verdict, if you are expecting miracles or top-notch gameplay or graphics, stop reading and avoid this game like the plague.  This is essentially a multiplayer game, one with co-op and versus options. You have your stereotypical bore options such as capture the flag, or we can actually explore the aspect of the game which is any different, the co-op mode versus those pesky dinosaurs.  The menu is rather broken, click refresh too many times and you need to reboot the game. It is essentially a bad version of Natural Selection 2's. You can tell why the game got a metacritic of 30, and after a year of updates, it is probably in the range of 50 now.  Getting in the game has its own issues, there doesn't seem to be good/dedicated server support, so you would end up joining some random guys game, most of these are stuck on the lobby with the host inconviently afk browsing x-rated sites, so I recommend perhaps starting your own game like I did. Wait for a few people to join, which tend to come like buses after waiting 5 minutes, then the game starts.  There are three classes, assualt, support and recon. I haven't played support, so I won't comment on that, but out of the other two options, I found Assualt to be the best. Recon has a really good cloaking ability, with some upgrades you are essentially invisible to the dinos and with a stealth weapon, it doesn't break, when getting attacked, cloak makes the dinos run after someone else too, making you totally vanish to them. However, energy is limited and it will take a while to get to that point, which leaves assualt. You might go 'Cloak versus a Jetpack, cloak sounds better..' but the thing is, most dinosaurs cannot jump, so even with the beginning, you can clinb upon a big rock and be untouched (save for spitters and rock throwing t-rex, and flying dinos). So it is consistently good from the start, and with upgrades, you can fly around almost carefree out of trouble.  You basically start in an augment building, the 2nd is a weapons building. If you set 5k as the beginners amount, you can go over to the weapons building to buy an assualt rifle, If not, you will need to do waves, which will get you money quickly since popping a dino is an easy 100-200 credits. weapons range from rockets, rifles, lasers, snipers, bow(!) and others.  You will get access to vehicles depending on the mode, with survival being unlockable after taking bases. You have swoopers (like out of starwars), jeeps (think warthog), a mech, a tank, and a helicopter.  The enemy AI is rather simple, it is a combination of mindless running around until they spot you, trying to take you like a female dino. Most of your time will be spend running around backwards and shooting them, unless you are on a big rock, then you shoot them from that as they cry foul of lack of long arms to climb after you.  Despite a lot of negative comments and feedback from the above, I actually ended my first couple of games. I audibly expressed 'aaagh..!' as I was getting chased down a slope by a t-rex, trying to jetpack away with no energy, firing wildly at it to try to kill it (we did! i survived). It is definitely one where you enjoy the novelty of the concept, plus, I really love co-op games opposed to single/competitive.  The game does have good controller support whilst in the game (not for menus). You would want to make some keymapping adjustments so it fits the typical console fps setup, but it works rather well and it is playable. Only downside is the slow aim-moving, since petradycals attack you in a frenzy like a moth to a lightbulb, which I found a lot easier to handle with m/kb.  Overall, the game is 5/10. It look and feels low-budget and it definitely does not have any polish on it.  However, if you got a few friends who are interested, pick one with a good rig/connection to host, talk on skype/ventrilo/mumble, get a drink and have a laugh. If you don't have any friends, you will probably play a couple of games and not bother more.
7038	1	a	Theres Dinosaurs :D that is all
7040	1	a	♥♥♥♥ game 1337/10 would ♥♥♥♥ a game again
7042	1	a	It's so sad to see people from reddit just buy this game to give it a negative review when it is a pretty good game, had some pretty decent times in here with friends, and more to come!
7044	1	a	The best game you can get for 99 cents. Imagine Killing Floor but with dinosaurs, its 99 cents... buy it.
1146	0	a	A truly horrible game, don't even consider buying this.
7046	1	a	rawr this is the best game evar &lt;3333333333 xD
1151	0	a	Where to start....  I played this game when it was a disgusting cluster♥♥♥♥ of bugs. It was as horrible as their trailer depicts it to be. I played for maybe 30 minutes before I had enough.  It has come a VERY long way. However, it is still astonihing to me that action propmpts are still missing (it took me about 3 waves to figure out how to purchase weapons, and an aditional 3 to figure out how to get reloads). Granted, most of the game breaking bugs are gone, but don't expect your gameplay experience to be close to what the trailer sells. YES there are high intensity moments...every few waves.  The controls are ok. Except when you are trying to hit flying enemies...that feel closer to puppets following a rail. Then you have to have very precise aim, else they will smack you and fly away. Or, play it risky, get the shotgun, and wait up until they are about 90% in your face before you take your shot.  The game, to me, is not worth $1. This game feels like a F2P that would beneffit from a microtransactions scheme. Seriously, not for me.
7048	1	a	Orion feels to be one of those games that has a few differences to how you play, but all together the game is quite fun playing with other people.
7050	1	a	this game is like COD zombie but it is dinosaurs
7052	1	a	The halo man fights dinosaurs in space, then uses dino-bones to buy upgrades and level up.  It's pretty much dark souls meets megaman.  Megaman and halo are the same person, right?   10/10  I mean, one is blue, the other is green, alter ego. I'm a cat and I know things.
7054	1	a	By far the best coin I've spent in a game...  Go get it.   You won't find better shooter at this price. Fun, massive killing, coop or versus, lot of stuff to do.  7/10.
7056	1	a	Lax a little in the content area. But at $0.99 its worth every penny.
7058	1	a	This game is absolutely hilarious at times, yes it's buggy still, but playing it with friends makes it all good to be honest. Especially now that it's only 99 cents, get it, you won't regret it!  The in game sound pack is horrible though, vehicles sound really bad, and so do weapons. On the other hand, the lightning and weather looks amazing for a game like this. So Dev's fix your sound!  10/10 would cape again.
7060	1	a	Dinosaurs+Weapons+Vehicles+PVP+Much more=Great game :3
7062	1	a	best 1 dollar purchase ever
7064	1	a	:) Yes, for a dollar, yes. :)  few servers but that could change in the begining few years back it was not all that but now i reinstalled and man i had fun, remainds me of small planetside2 with DINOS, with killing floor layout kinda. its a bit clunky on a few areas but if u like the above games im sure you'll find this to be fun for a while.   
7066	1	a	This Game is incredibly fun Flying around and shooting dinosaurs Just Fun   pros:   Good gameplay  Graphics are pretty great for a game thats a dollar  level design great  Taunts  Customisable heads   cons:        I give this game a 9.5 out of 10
7068	1	a	Never in my life before I had the chance to kill a dinosaur with a lightsaber. Thanks Obama
7070	1	a	Overall, I would recommend to anyone who is a fan of FPS; it is a dollar you will not regret spending.  +DINOSAURS +Great for co-ops with friends +Variety of customization options for players +Plenty of gun types +Vehicles are fun to use +Several game modes, including one where you can play as dinosaurs  -No singleplayer campaign/story -Limited number of types of dinosaurs (see a lot of the same)
7072	1	a	I hit a pterodactyl with a stick and it died. 10/10
7074	1	a	I got the game for like 1 buck. Really worth it when it was on sale, gave my friends and I a couple hours of fun. Though I don't think it's worth the 15. It's really the same thing over and over. Other than that it was fun for a bit.
7076	1	a	It's so sad to see people from reddit just buy this game to give it a negative review when it is a pretty good game, had some pretty decent times in here with friends, and more to come!
7078	1	a	Tiss a fun game famo
7080	1	a	ORION: Prelude is a very great game for a very cheap price, simple as that.
7082	1	a	spent 99c to buy this game.    it goes free 1 month later, rip asian cheap life
7084	1	a	Why do I love this game so much!? Idk, but it's a lot of fun, that's for sure! &lt;3
7086	1	a	good game to play if you have good teammates
1158	0	a	This is absolutely terrible, the PVP is awful the Horde mode is okay but the animations and sounds are beyond awful, But I guess thats what you can expect from an indie developer pfft.
1159	0	a	Literally the worst thing I've ever played.
1160	0	a	What can I say? This is it. This is the game we have been wating for. This game accomplishes so much and gives us gamers a truly next-gen experience. With all the content bundled in this game, for just a dollar you would be crazy to miss out on such a wonderful deal. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to playing.
7088	1	a	I really like this game...its retro and fun and i can play with or without friends...good game just to have a change of scenery
7090	1	a	surprisingly good fun this game. if you have a bunch of friend to play with then you can have hours of fun with it. wouldnt recommend just for singleplayer
1161	0	a	this game was NOT a good game. even if you have a awesome graphic card it still lags. played it for an hour and I was done with it. i dont recomend this game please DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!
7092	1	a	Did a future-helicopter barrel roll backflip into rocket propelled T-rex murder. 
7094	1	a	I gave a weird review, so now here is a more specific review on why you should buy this game. Now when I saw the game, I wasn't expecting a lot from it. That was because of the price. But I was truly wrong.  So first pro; Price. The game is very cheap. Next pro is the combat. You can fight (obviously, DUH) dinosaurs or players in the game with futuristic weapons, like various guns, melee weapons, turrets, and grenades. You can roll to avoid attacks. The combat is fast kind of like today's DOOM 4. Next pro is gonna be the shop. Get some credits and get spending on skins for your armor, weapons, swords (for their color or beam), and dinosaurs. Get new taunts and fancy capes, too. Now a cool feature that I like is the vehicles. You get a wide variety of vehicles from your standard car but with a machinegun, helicopters, tanks, even a robotic thing straight out of CoD AW. So that'll be it. Sad part is just the fact that there are still some annoying bugs since 2012, but I can ignore them. Normally THOSE bugs are, glitching inside big dinos, which is annoying.
7096	1	a	Pro's- Its cheap Lots of game modes Character progression PVP PVE Decent amout of maps interesting AI Plenty to shoot Easy to play Interesting game mechanics asortment of Vehicles Addictive Violence :) -Developers participate in the forums Lots of room hosting setup options Nice UI Achievments Leader boards  Cons- -Bad graphics optimization for duel cards (not the text script glitch just optimization) Big lag problems with Depth of Field and all particle systems they can be disabled but I like my tracers and enemt tracers ect.. -People are not notified to open ports for room hosting lots of bad ping and resrticted nat rooms -Dedicated server setup is terrible- lack of usefull detailed instruction and infact still havent got it working -Hosts have no server control options in game- can't kick idle when idle is disabled -Ai textures are not solid to the camera so when a dino head is in your fasce you can see he is hollow - Some Ai path finding issues can slow the game down like hunting for a mob/ group of mobs on maps to advance game can cost 5-15 mins of search time pointlessly to find a guy caught on a rock or a teridactle thats not allowed to leave a certain area.  Game and Gameplay 7/10 overall (graphical lag -1, Host control and port info -1 Dedicated server problems -1)  Dedicated server 5/10 overall (Lack of true instruction-2 Currently woring correctly -2 Lack of useful Information-1)  Host Server 8/10 Overall ( port promt needed -1, User control in game -1)  Game details: All of the perks from Unreal Tournament, Turok and Halo3- Toss em in a blender click puree and pour yourself a cup of Orion: Prelude (AKA Dino Horde).       
1163	0	a	this game was NOT a good game. even if you have a awesome graphic card it still lags. played it for an hour and I was done with it. i dont recomend this game please DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!
7098	1	a	虽然自己是FPS苦手，过这游对我说是那么困难，挺好的游，大家一起玩~ Even thought I'm a fool of FPS games, this game is easy to play. Welcome to play together, such a good game.
7100	1	a	It's a very enjoyable dinosaur survival game, but it does have microtransactions and that is not what i was expecting from a game 9/10
1164	0	a	yuck, tis game is a ruined game the trailers look nothing compared to the game and it's looks quite blocky just yuck. when i saw this game i thought hmm this game could be cool i looked at the reviews and there was alot of critisim but i though nah ill give it a try, once it was downlaoded i started playying then i said NO NO not again a ♥♥♥♥ game. The game looks nothing to the gameplay trailers i said well a waste of space. I dont recommend it
7102	1	a	ridiculous fun and only a dollar how have you NOT bought this
7104	1	a	'Let's see... Two quarters... Four dimes... A nickel... One, two, three... Four pennies! Guess I got somethin' to do for an hour after all.'
1165	0	a	its just cod zombies with dinosaurs -_-
7106	1	a	its reely fum soo pla its
1166	0	a	ok for its $0.99 deal but not very fun, quite repeatable
7108	1	a	Don't listen to the star ratings. This game is one of my favorite games on steam. This game is awsome!!!!!!
7110	1	a	Its a really fun and awesome game, great fun with hordes and hordes of dinosaurs, do get it its great. check out thegamingbeaver on it
1167	0	a	So my freinds, i have played 20 hours of this, more than i have played bioshock infinite, and here is my reveiw. Its not even open workd you're consrtantly defending a power genarator against din osaurs, but if you have a freind and two space helicopters it's extremely easy, or just get two rocket launchers, you get the choice of a knife or a gun that can provide you with infinite ammo and repair cars. Dinosaurs A.I is just suicidal, the multi-player is just 20 t-rex's standing outside the humans spawn, The audio is garbage, oh and the thing that makes every game worse, MICRO TRANSACTIONS! is there potential? If they re-did the audio worked on the dinosaurs and made it actully open world, meh. I dont know how this isnt listed aas early acess, it looks and feels like one. Unless it goes on sale for a dollar again, NEVER BUY IT! i've been told killing floor is better, which at some point ill get and look at, this reveiw of hitting a terrible game with a stick starts my writing reveiws
1168	0	a	This game is so freaking bad. I'd be hardpressed recommending this game for $1, don't be fooled by the interesting looking screen shots. This game is extremely 1 dimentional and quite unrewarding.
7112	1	a	The best thing since buttered bread.
7114	1	a	HOW DO I GIFT THIS GAME TO MY FRIENDS WHEN THEY GOT IT ON FREE WEEK AND THEN THEY UNINSTALLED IT BUT IT STILL SAYS THEY OWN IT
7116	1	a	Its a really fun and awesome game, great fun with hordes and hordes of dinosaurs, do get it its great. check out thegamingbeaver on it
7118	1	a	I would recommend this game 1000000000000000000000000000000000000/10 (and I even have some ideas that could make it a lot more fun)
7120	1	a	I can see my legs 10/10
7122	1	a	good game to play if you have good teammates
1169	0	a	This is absolutely terrible, the PVP is awful the Horde mode is okay but the animations and sounds are beyond awful, But I guess thats what you can expect from an indie developer pfft.
1170	0	a	Literally the worst thing I've ever played.
1171	0	a	What can I say? This is it. This is the game we have been wating for. This game accomplishes so much and gives us gamers a truly next-gen experience. With all the content bundled in this game, for just a dollar you would be crazy to miss out on such a wonderful deal. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to playing.
7124	1	a	I liked this game better when it first came out and I still think they shouldve stuck with what it was but its still fun to this day and now you can switch back to the old way of playing the game!
7126	1	a	lol, this was fun. much better than what they are doing with the orion project.
1172	0	a	This game was a waste of $0.99 It's that bad.
7128	1	a	still better than cod ghosts
1173	0	a	Not only is the controller so horribly optimised that you can't use your controler in any menu, but the game literally crashes every 5-8 minutes... and I have a $2,200 PC.  .2/1 Morgan Freeman's :(
1174	0	a	A good game for being only 0.99 cent , it has some issues like poorly optimized and also high ping , fps is not good sufficient , it freeze sometimes and my opinion for this game is 'I just wasted my 0.99 cent'
7130	1	a	Definitely worth a try!
1176	0	a	yuck, tis game is a ruined game the trailers look nothing compared to the game and it's looks quite blocky just yuck. when i saw this game i thought hmm this game could be cool i looked at the reviews and there was alot of critisim but i though nah ill give it a try, once it was downlaoded i started playying then i said NO NO not again a ♥♥♥♥ game.

1177	0	a	ok for its $0.99 deal but not very fun, quite repeatable
1178	0	a	I couldn't even get into a game with my friend.
1179	0	a	No tutorial, play/pay to win mechanic, choppy effects when using jetpack, odd UI, spectator mode can't move through walls and is slow as molasses, and buggy weapon issue (with primary not reloading).
7132	1	a	well... this game is just STUPIDLY AMAZING!!!
7134	1	a	ORION: Prelude is an awesome game that you can play with your friends that is both cheap and fun, it has many weapons, perks, and vehicles, as well as many dinosaurs that you can shoot and beat up, the graphics may be meh, but if you base a game of off just that, then you wouldn't know a good game when you saw it, becuase most games that have amazing graphics tend to have an awful story and/or gameplay, and you have to pay like $60, ORION: Prlude is a cheap $1 dollar game, there is a $59 difference, so even if you didn't enjoy, it's not like you lost money or something, so go ahead and stop reading this review and buy the damn game already, what are ya waiting for, go do it!
7136	1	a	This game is so bad you can't stop playing it.
1182	0	a	I don't get it. This game went through so many name changes, trying to shed away the bad opinions of the game because the developers are supposedly working so hard on it. I bought Dino Horde because it was cheap, played a little, and clearly saw the flaws right away : Missing animations, general slowness for no reasons, dumb menus, dumb map design. Apparently though, so many reviews of people begging players to give the game another chance because it was much better now than it used to be. So I downloaded it again...   First game : I load a map, I shoot, the gun is immobile. The hands/arms animate, but not the gun... Fine, it must be because the game isn't started, right? I need to find a generator, maybe it will animate after? I find a generator, walking very slowly because everything is sluggish, the game start, the gun still doesn't animate, but now it doesn't animate while a dinosaur is seemingly stuck in a circle in front of me.  Maybe the map didn't load right? I exit the game, start a new one, choose a new map... It's the *same map* as before, but with pumpkins, cell shading and a laughter track added. I play around a little, I die, next map loads. They ask me to choose my class, I don't, I press escape, I am brought to a Spectate other players screen. Weird, it was a solo game. I press escape, I am brought to the main menu, but the map is clearly still loaded in the background.  So in 5 minutes I am faced with the same issues as with Dino Horde : Missing animations, general slowness for no reasons, dumb menus, dumb map design.   Why are reviews saying that this game changed for the better? It did not. Adding cel shading to a map doesn't make a game better. The player's animation and movements are all ♥♥♥♥ed up. When we jump and touch ground, we get a foot smaller and then pop back to full height. Guns don't animate. Gun's impact particles are oriented with the walls, not with where bullets come from  I have a download cap when I live, no ISP offer unlimited bundles, and yet I re-downloaded it based on all the 'This Game Got Better' posts. I feel like I was robbed of my bytes here. This game is *not* better than it was. I'm deleting this game and I will *not* fall in the Orion trap a 3rd time.
1183	0	a	rubbish even for a free game!!
1184	0	a	I imagine that HIV would offer me a more enjoyable experience.  Weapon handling is utterly boring. Sound design is atrocious. Animations are stiff. Horrible usage of post processing to cover up low-res textures.  It's a game you buy and there's also a cash shop. It was crappy with Guns of Icarus Online did it, too. But, GoI Online was fun. This isn't.  Pass on it.
1185	0	a	Steam should be ashamed to have this in the marketplace.  Worst game that has ever been made.
1186	0	a	OK, I did not mind the game, heck I am astonished by how it had improved since I last saw it when it was Orion Dino Horde *Watch that video by Total Biscuit by the way, I'm not being paid for it but he's just fantastic.* However it has problems which turned me away from it, or at least 2 problems.  Littlest one: The game is not very well optimized, I play this on a laptop but given I can run some high speed stuff with no problem, this is a problem....Though it is one that CAN be fixed so I will not hold it against the deveolopers.  However our biggest problem: The Community, sure the games can be fast but honestly, no one helps you either because the game doesn't do a good enough job of telling you 'Oh your teammate is down', and even if they did, there's a number that would let you die just out of SPITE, often killing any dinos you shot so that you would NOT get up.  Overall its an OK game but the community...just the community is all.
7138	1	a	Very addictive.
1187	0	a	Traditional score - 4/10 Recommendation - Avoid. There are much better alternatives.  I found this to be intensely generic.   The gun physics are a joke, the weapons themselves are entirely too expensive for how much use they are, the enemies have intensely stupid AI, and the player skills are almost entirely useless.  The graphics are pretty, but the sounds and music are utterly forgettable, the level design is generic and repetitive, and the waypoints the game sets for you are way too far away. Especially given how the game allows you 60 seconds between waves (even if pterodactyls attack you continuously).  It quite possibly may get much better later, but you know so does Killing Floor, and it's fun from the get-go.  But hey, give it a try, you might love it. I have 2 free passes if this review didn't scare you off.
7140	1	a	  Nutshell Review:  
7142	1	a	This game is absolutely hilarious at times, yes it's buggy still, but playing it with friends makes it all good to be honest. Especially now that it's only 99 cents, get it, you won't regret it!  The in game sound pack is horrible though, vehicles sound really bad, and so do weapons. On the other hand, the lightning and weather looks amazing for a game like this. So Dev's fix your sound!  10/10 would cape again.
7144	1	a	Dinosaurs+Weapons+Vehicles+PVP+Much more=Great game :3
7146	1	a	for a one dollar game, this is really fun and has pretty good graphics it may not be perfect but its really cheap and i would pick it up if you like kiling dinosars or like jarasik pakr 
1188	0	a	Couldn't play it. Shooting didn't feel sharp or even responsive. Also I paid a buck just to watch it go free, but whatever. Also, the devs are children.    No but seriously, they only use reviews written anonymously by some kids online in all their game trailers. Has anyone else noticed that?
7148	1	a	First off, to everyone compaining about the game going Free to play and not getting anything, you did get something, the 20K spiral credits for in game cosmitics, about a 16$ value, those just starting without having bught before going F2P won't have that, and apparently you also got something in the seqeal too, if you buy it, but i don't know about that, as i haven't done so.  Now onto the actuall review...I'd be hard pressed to recommend this game if it wasn't free, and there has been questionable history around the game, but, overall, for a game that is as old as it is, it is a deceint co-op to sink a few hours into every now and then with a friend, or level grinding.  Plus, free, so you don't have much to lose.
7150	1	a	I've played it in demo period and i really enjoyed it playing with my friend,its cheap too so why not try to play this game? 
7152	1	a	Nice game
1189	0	a	I wuz lok oooh dinisore big and it lok kilt meh and i wuz raelly maad
7154	1	a	Would vote for biggest improvent of a game I've seen.
7156	1	a	very nice shooter, fun to play, graphics are ok, cool dinosaurs so what else ?
1194	0	a	Some terrible game. Have no idea why it has such good ratings.
1195	0	a	I forgot I even owned this game.
1196	0	a	the only thing I liked about this game was the price.
7158	1	a	you know what ??  This is actually a good game, it's just lack of development. and, maybe can you add the low resolution ? like the 800 x 600 and so seriously.
1197	0	a	Just... wow.  I regret the decision to even download and play this title.  I came into the fray with optimistic thoughts screaming loudly 'THIS IS GONNA BE GOOD'.  'Cause 'Turok mixed with Halo'? I love both titles? Damn right I'm going to play this, I have to. I didn't even know the history to Orion: Dino Horde, or what Dino Beatdown even WAS. They weren't even on my f**king radar, at ALL! Now I completely see why.  But god damn what a f**king lie that was because the entire game is executed so badly, the high expectations that it set itself begin to smolder into a pile of broken Alpha-testing nonsense, yet this is DEVELOPED and RELEASED at that. Going to mesh two good games together is aiming to pull alot of fans of both types of genres and when you invoke such f**king power words like that, you need aim well and aim high to appease both audiences because the bar has been as such by those previous titles. But oh man, you guys pulled a number on me good, man.  (You might as well sub out the 'Halo' bulls**t and replace that with 'Tribes', because that is the only thing that screams to me besides halo. A bad Tribes clone with dinosaurs.  Every gun in the game has around a 100ms delay for firing and for hitting a target, so you have to probably calculate the Coriolis effect before you hit anything thats more than 50 f**king meters away from you and it's worse if it's in the sky.   Everything feels like its clunky and runs like its just an amalgamation of crap, and the fact that when youre playing and you die from...oh lets see.. a f**king pterodactyl immediately lifting you off with no regard or warning, or a couple of small dinosaurs that you cant even see because the grass texture is so tall and its dispersion is not very good whilst the dinosaurs in question are hidden in plain sight until you're on your back pockets bleeding out attempting to shoot at them to revive.  Theres another thing, the dinosaurs. The pinnacle of this game is the dinosaurs, right? Wrong. That couldnt be more far off from the truth. Because you might as well be fighting newborn babies in the form of giant lizards that are radioactive to the touch. You wont know that youre getting hit because the animations for your foes are so terrible that when they do them its literally NOT what theyre actually doing. ------ Example: Dinosaur walks up and is right in front of your face and you just hurt terribly for some reason, no animation, no nothing its just a roomba moving at you with dinosaur legs attached. You move away and eventually it begins to do an animation for a bite in your face that does nothing, until you stop then you begin hurting because the vacuum is back on again.  Example 2: Be me and my friend, on a boulder next to a cliff with a tree on it, stegosaurus walks towards us and looks at us and and a floor stomping animation sends us up into the air out of nowhere but the dinosaur did nothing but look at us. It could have farted and I'd believe it at this point. Then it raises its front legs to stomp us because im right infront of its face it would definitely hit me again. It lands and nothing even happens, we didn't even move. What?   Man I'm already tired of thinking about everything in this game that I encountered that im not going to continue much on this anymore. In the THIRTY SIX MINUTES that I played I encountered so many things that would put me off of it I wouldnt even consider replaying this until they redo it entirely. (OH WAIT YOU DID THAT?) Well too ♥♥♥♥ing bad, make it again. Or dont. Either way until you do better this game WILL NEVER CEASE TO EXIST. IT WILL NEVER GO AWAY. IT CANNOT BE UN-DONE. ARE YOU PROUD? IS THIS A CONSPIRACY TO TARNISH SPIRAL GAME STUDIOS?  This game tells me nope.
1198	0	a	I only have this game because I bought a four pack so I could taint my friends' libraries.
7160	1	a	Incredible game, only because it found a way to make Instagib completely uninteresting
7162	1	a	Great game if you love Jurassic park and first person shooters!
1200	0	a	Complete waste of money. You can never connect to any servers. So you wont be able to play the stupid game. Boring gunplay
1201	0	a	poorly optimized and also high ping
7164	1	a	4 pack it ASAP!  Dinos..... Sci-fi weapons..... co op...... laughs..... onsale for a dollar at times..... It is a no brainer. If you are scared to lose a dollar on a game then your loss....
7166	1	a	you know what ??  This is actually a good game, it's just lack of development. and, maybe can you add the low resolution ? like the 800 x 600 and so seriously.

Well too ♥♥♥♥ing bad, make it again. Or dont. Either way until you do better this game WILL NEVER CEASE TO EXIST. IT WILL NEVER GO AWAY. IT CANNOT BE UN-DONE. ARE YOU PROUD? IS THIS A CONSPIRACY TO TARNISH SPIRAL GAME STUDIOS?  This game tells me nope.
1203	0	a	this game is a peace of $h!)  sorry but it is and i want my money back
1204	0	a	Not good, shady practices, but ♥♥♥♥, it was only 49 cents!
7168	1	a	If you hate this game, your mother didn't love you.  T-rex killed me over 50 times, and a stagosaurus splooged on me. 11/10
1205	0	a	WTF, THIS SUCKS, NOW IS F2P, WASTED. I QUIT THIS GAME CUZ IT'S ♥♥♥♥♥ LAGGY. HAVE TO WAIT FOR WHOLE GAME TO SPAWN BACK. SUCK LIKE ♥♥♥♥
7170	1	a	This game only for 1€ totally worth it  10/10 would buy again!
7172	1	a	Its fun but for me lagish
7174	1	a	This game is amazing. I LOVE it when my games have ps2 graphics yet still lag. The lasers the dinosaurs shoot out of their mouths is beautiful, and the texturing is so good it makes me want to vomit and cry in the bathtub for about 3 hours.   If you like being depressed, I highly reccommend this game.
7176	1	a	Well just like a ton of players I also bought this game for around 1 dollar and now its free, well ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥...In spite all that game isnt that bad, you like dinos, you like FPS games, you're gonna like the game...
1214	0	a	This game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥.
1215	0	a	They made it free to play, but I don't think they can save it in the long run, it's just not worth it...  A lot was promised, little given, but that's my own fault for buying early access, so I shouldn't complain too much. I only post this review so that others are aware of the way the devs/publishers of this game operate, for when they release their next game.
1216	0	a	The Co-op in this game is quite fun to play with some friends, but i wouldn't recommend buying this game as it is increbile buggy if your are going to play solo. Also the developers appear to be rather nasty people. D:&lt;
1217	0	a	Steam should be ashamed to have this in the marketplace.  Worst game that has ever been made.
1218	0	a	After getting into the game I said 'It looks like the entire graphics design budget was 2 cans of Mountain Dew'. After playing for a while and seeing all the bugs and glitches I said 'Nevermind, the budget for the entire game was one can. I was in the process of figuring out how to refund when I noticed the option to write a review. I'll continue after this. If you want to waste the (fortunately very low) price of the game, go for it. But don't expect a well made game, or even a decently made one.
1219	0	a	poorly optimized and also high ping
7178	1	a	ORION: Prelude is an awesome game that you can play with your friends that is both cheap and fun, it has many weapons, perks, and vehicles, as well as many dinosaurs that you can shoot and beat up, the graphics may be meh, but if you base a game of off just that, then you wouldn't know a good game when you saw it, becuase most games that have amazing graphics tend to have an awful story and/or gameplay, and you have to pay like $60, ORION: Prlude is a cheap $1 dollar game, there is a $59 difference, so even if you didn't enjoy, it's not like you lost money or something, so go ahead and stop reading this review and buy the damn game already, what are ya waiting for, go do it!
7180	1	a	The only game servers I can find are ones where I have a ping of 150+  Otherwise its a good game
7182	1	a	A good game for being only 79p.
7184	1	a	I got this game on sale for 50cents. Definitly not the best game ever, there are some issuses with it. But the game is fun easy to play and great for you and your friends. its cheap too. I boughtit for some of my friends.
1224	0	a	A game that cost 0.99 cents, is worth 0.99 cents. Dont expect much much from it.
7186	1	a	Nice game
1225	0	a	ENG:  It's change into F2P -model what was absolute 'NO' -for me so, i don't recomented that a game any more.    FIN:  Muuttivat pelin F2P -malliseksi mikä on ehdottomasti 'EI' -minulle joten, en voi suosittella tätä peliä enään.
7188	1	a	(UPDATE) i cannot belive how much i downplayed this game. since they devs began to update this game it has become one of the most unique and fun fps games out there. THE METACRITIC SCORE IS A LIE. THAT WAS A REVIEW FOR DINO BEATDOWN WHICH WAS THE BIGGEST CLUSTER ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ STORM OF A GAME. BUT NOW IT HAS BEEN UPDATED AND REVAMPED AND YOUR MAKING A MISTAKE NOT TO PLAY IT.  This game is actually not that bad. the graphics are pretty decent and everything else is pretty good. too. the reason why metacridict is so low is because it is the review for dino beatdown, which is a game that was a sin towards humanity. but after all the patching and updating this game is pretty good. reminds me when i played turok on the n64......
1226	0	a	Its not bad, but definitely not good  graphics are really not impressive, but considering i got this game for less then a dollar you get what you pay for.  gameplay is pretty poorely done in my opinion with so many other clones out there that have done it so much better even for free.   Connections for gameplay are just bad in the best case senarios and when you have to rely on fast twitch movement and need smooth gameplay to make good shots. Without that a FPS is nearly worhtless.  3/10
1227	0	a	this game is so bad, it's so laggy and you can shoot dinosaurs through the wall like the good old early 2000s counter strike. Such a bad game. Not even worth my 1 dollar. Dont buy it.
1228	0	a	This game is pretty much Halo with enless waves of dinosaurs but with terrible graphics and terrible physics. Even if it is on sale I would not buy it. And if you do get it, make sure you look up a tutorial first, it does not tell you how to play the game. The maps are HUGE, which is good and bad. Good because you can roam around and get away from the dinos easily. Bad because it sometimes spawns you on the OPPOSITE of the map you are supposed to be and with no vehicle. Overall do not buy this, it is a waste of money, I have no idea how this has so many good reviews.
7190	1	a	If you hate this game, your mother didn't love you.  T-rex killed me over 50 times, and a stagosaurus splooged on me. 11/10
7192	1	a	Fun game really like it. Really can't stop playin'!!! :D
7194	1	a	Good weapons, good graphics, good textures.
7196	1	a	couldn't figure out how to attack 10/10
1234	0	a	This game is like a cheap ♥♥♥♥♥, fun for 20 minutes but it gives you a disease after you play with it. Would not recommend.
1235	0	a	When I played this game back during one of its myriad of free weekends, it was a half-baked piece of garbage that wasn't all that well put together.  When I played this game during this current free week, it definitely showed some improvements and the horde mode is OK but it's still not all that well put together. It also has one of the worst Instagib modes I've ever seen, the kind of Instagib where it is just easier to run up to the guy you're trying to shoot and kill him with the butt of your rifle.  Frankly, this game was more entertaining when it was a complete ♥♥♥♥ing mess.
1236	0	a	I tried to like this game, I really did. While my friends were calling it garbage, I defended it. The truth is, however, that they were right. I never played Dino Beatdown, and I didn't bother with the Metacritic score; going off of some brief gameplay videos I figured that while the animations looked clunky it could at least be one of those games that is fun to play with friends. Those videos don't quite prepare you for Dino Horde, and I can safely say that even at the price of $1.00, I would not recommend buying this game.  The animations are bad, and in fact very laughable. Running looks like you've got a stick up your ♥♥♥ and when you're in first person in a car you can often watch in horror as your weapons wiggle around. However, these animations are typically situational - no, most of what you'll see of the animaiton quality is in the dinosaurs themselves who often come off as cartoonish, rigid or downright broken in their movements.  The gunplay is very unsatisfying. Everything kind of just haphazardly squirts blood when you shoot them. You'd expect such a loud game to at least have some great, satisfying sounds to accompany each shot, but they don't. Every enemy is a bullet sponge and each weapon is unpleasant to use.   However, the most frustrating failings of Dino Horde is in the fact that when buying upgrades in Survival, dying will cause you to lose them. Additionally, despite boasting a large number of game modes, many are just not fun. The worst was where you're forced to play Support and just stand around as raptors spawn out of the air on top of you, trying to last as long as possible.   The only positive points I can truthfully give this game was that the vehicles were at first very fun and interesting. If you're forced or tempted to play this game, jump into a vehicle as soon as possible. The only difficulty you'll really find with vehicles is how their tires are somehow incapable of running over small dinosaurs. However, even they were not enough to save Dino Horde for me. I will not be reinstalling this. If you want a dinosaur game get Natural Selection 2 or Primal Carnage, a lot of ORION's assets were ripped off from those games, anyways.
1237	0	a	ORION: Black Ops 3 is a highly original game.
1238	0	a	Even after the update and name change, it's still the same bad game as it's always been. Buy DIno D-Day and/or Primal Carnage instead. Both are much better dinosaur games. 
1239	0	a	I've only put a half hour into this game but..  What the hell is this game?  No, seriously, look at actual reviews on it. It feels like a game made in Unity engine using 3D assets you'd buy in a pack to use (but the reality is they just fired the workers that created them after they handed them over). The idea that this game could ever get a 10/10 (as shown under reviews) is ridiculous. This entire $1 sale is just a con to squeeze the last bit of money they can out of this turd of a game.  Do your research before buying it, you'll see a trail of unpaid workers, crowdfunding scams and general distrust over this developer with only a little bit of googling. No reputable person or gaming website would ever give this game a rating over 10.  Bugs, bugs everywhere, assets that clearly weren't made for this game.. the list goes on.  Stay far, far away from this.
1240	0	a	What the actual ♥♥♥♥ is this mess? Honestly, this is the worst game I've ever played on steam.
7198	1	a	I buy it once.... ask for refund and steam refund my money.  but now i buy it again and enjoy the game.....  thanks for not abandoning this game and made it works.... love it.
1242	0	a	Paid for this game get nothing extra when it goes free2play. ♥♥♥♥ off
7200	1	a	 So what is ORION: Prelude?
1246	0	a	They changed the name of this thing three times, now.  and, now, it costs only 79 cents. They probably don't know any other way to grab cash and go.
1247	0	a	Don't even bother. Even if it remained F2P forever, it's terrible. SWTOR tier.
7202	1	a	Was a good Game to troll your friends with by just gifting it to them.... Aaah the good ol' times...  11/10 would spend 15€ again!
1260	0	a	Let me just start off by saying this game looked cool at first, but then i actually played it and boy was i wrong. First off all the weapon variation is absolutely abysmal, its either assault rifle that shoots chocolate covered marshmallows or a flamethrower that will give the dinos a slight tan equivalent to a nice day on the beach. The dinos look and behave like pidgeons that have been fed bread crumbs laced with weed. This game is absolute trash and writing this review was a huge waste of time as was downloading and playing this game. Having this game in my library disgusts me. Please remove this game from steam so that nobody has to go through playing this pathetic excuse for a game. If i were to sum up this game in one word, that word would be Pathetic.
1261	0	a	First off, The devs of this game, Absolutley ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Everytime this game gets too many Negative reviews on steam or Metacritic they 'Update' The game (Breaking it even more) and give it a new name. The HUD? Absolute ♥♥♥♥. They were too lazy to change the Menu icons to keys instead of xbox buttons. Even when you have this game at the highest settings it still looks like it was made in 2006. The lack of difficulty is baffling also. After killing a few of the easiest dinos you can go and grab yourself An lmg, SMG and upgrades to your ability that is determined by one of the 3 classes.  TL;DR: Its a terrible port from the 360. Barely even worth $1. I Got it for $0.27 and i would gladley take it back.  Update: Many people cannot gandle the truth
1262	0	a	Baaaaad game.. Stay away. Horrid sound effects where they exist at all. Feels and moves cheap. The animation is amateur. The lighting is horrible. Menus are clunky. When you die the game just instantly goes to a loading screen.. no idea even what just happened. I could go on but it's worth more effort than the game is worth.
1263	0	a	Where do I start with this game? I don't even know HOW to describe it. Its like dinosaurs, future tech, and master chief all jumped into a blender and was then consumed by the game developer. Time passed, and so did the product through the developer's intestines, leaving us with this 'game'.

1270	0	a	Look how many hours I have spent on this game. Look. Just look. Probably 110 of those were on Orion: Dino Horde.  Since the upgrade to Orion: Prelude the game is just an utter mess. Sure, it looks 'better' but al the 'fun' has been sapped from it. I've tried to play this game several times since the 'upgrade' and don't think I've finished a single game on it.  They added *more* stupid flying dinosaurs and made them harder to shoot. They made the 'Compy' dinos harder to kill. They made it so that when a big dino 'stomps' the ground you go flying further in a car than if you're on foot. They made it so you can be flying with your jet pack and still be affected by a stomp on the ground. Honestly.  Add to that the fact that when they said they had ironed out loads of bugs and made it better when in reality what they really meant was they made the best gun on the game less powerful than a hand gun that you start with and introduced bugs that weren't even in the previous version then you start to get a great view of the actual 'upgrade'.  Is this game worth 79 British Earth Pence? Sure. I would have paid more than that for Dino Horde. Probably more like a few quid. But it's now just sat there, dejectedly, in my Steam library. So sad.
1271	0	a	This game is so ♥♥♥♥ing bad, I wouldn't give it to my one year old neice to play. Everything about this game is absolutely terrible and is broken to ♥♥♥♥. How the hell did they charge $20 for this game when it came out, This isn't even worth it being free; it's just a peice of garbage on my computer. But as for the game play driving a car sucks ♥♥♥♥ and is laggy as ♥♥♥♥, every gun is absolutely useless and doesn't work, many of the animations are broken; and they're making another one! That's a ♥♥♥♥ing joke. Please nobody buy this game, don't even consider looking at it at all; it's not even worth the space on your hard drive. I played almost an hour of this and I regret every second of looking at it.
7206	1	a	Have you ever felt like you wanted to play CS but also dinosaurs? Have you ever wanted to be overwhelmed by the sheer amount of holy ♥♥♥♥? Have you ever craved that sweet sense of pleasure you get from committing genocide on an extinct species? Then this game is for you!  There's almost 65 billion things to do! -ride cars -shoot dinosaurs -fall off of towers -ride cars -get upgrades -ride cars -ride cars  With so much stuff, this game feels like an unlimited amount of awesome! Just think of something, anything, and statistically you probably can't do it in this game. But out of the things you can do in this game, you can do all of them in this game! (Including leading those terrifying flying dudes into your friend's heli!)       420/10 3dank5me -ride cars

1286	0	a	This game is a scam. Valve is backing up scumbag developers and allowing false advertisement on this Steam page and not allowing refunds. These developers fired their dev team and took money for themselves using a KickStarter campaign. They have stolen props from major video game companies and small dev teams. They released this game in a pre-beta state. They are using false advertising tactics to get people to purchase this game.   I've supported Steam since 2006, and this is the first time I've been disappointed with Valve for allowing devs like these onto their store, and then fiercely defending them on the Steam forums and on Steam Support. I cannot be issued a refund of the four-pack I purchased because of the Steam Subscriber Agreement. However, they falsely advertised this game as a complete build, and they are using the agreement as a way to prevent having to take a publishing loss.
7208	1	a	definitly a awesome game  like killing floor with dinosaurs
1287	0	a	I can tell you before it got its makeover it was pretty ♥♥♥♥, I played the makeover for a few minutes and that was pretty ♥♥♥♥ as well but it looks like they updated so i might reinstall it
1288	0	a	I remember when i bought this game for $16.00 what a rip.
7210	1	a	very good and cheap game, but i dont understood some parts :D
7212	1	a	I want to be the very best, Like no one ever was. To kill them is my real test, To end them is my cause.  I will travel across the land, Searching far and wide. Each Dino Horde to understand The power that's inside  Dino HORDE!!!, (gotta kill them all) its you and me I know its my destiny Dino Horde, oh, you're my best friend In a world we must defend  Dino Horde, (gotta kill them all) a heart so true Our courage will pull us through You teach me and I'll teach you Di-No-Horde, gotta kill 'em all 
7214	1	a	The game has seen radical changes since it's original release and has finally become a rather solid and enjoyable game. There is still room for improvement (some people complain about the Bots). Personally I enjoy it. I like the leveling system, buying perks ingame, buying weapons in game to suit your playstyle and the pure JOY of running down dinosaurs with a jeep.  Upsides: Fast paced action, lots of maps, lots of weapons, lots of perks, easy to get started, epic Tyranosaur fights. Downsides: the Bots in single player are...dull, could benefit from more 'visceral' dinosaur related fatalities.  Overall an excellent value for less than the cost of a chocolate bar.
7216	1	a	you need to buy this.... you wont find a game with this much content, customization and polish for 10 euros....devs fullfilled everything they promised after a bad start, and vent even the extra mile.
7218	1	a	Way better than anything Activision ever put out, THERE I SAID IT!!!
1302	0	a	Terrible game.
1303	0	a	Did they make it horrible on purpose? After how many years and this is what you came up with? How does one make unreal engine look so horrible... if not on purpose.. There are a ton of built in smooth animations for free in the engine that apparently they didnt use. And those textures??? wth.. are we still in the days of quake? and physics are horrible.. you get stuck walking next to a wall.. If this was a school project.. id say Nice work! you're def going to make a great game after you graduate.. but .. its not , its a full release of a 'completed' game that from what I hear the devs take pride in.. I know I wouldnt.. at least make the textures and models look a little better that would be a good start. Oh and the sounds... ugh.. am I firing a cap gun? anywho..
1304	0	a	Even thought this game is free on Steam right now.Do not play it.It is competely unfinished and is unplayable.The game constanly lags(even in the menus) and isnt even gpu or cpu demanding.Please spare yourself and avoid it at all costs.
1305	0	a	Even if you were being paid to play it, it would not be worth it.

7220	1	a	Sorry fellow reviewers, but you're supposed to rate this game, and not whatever scandals can be happening with the studio behind it.  Simply put, for its price, Orion Prelude can be hours of fun with your friends, and can thus be considered a great game if your point in gaming is having fun.  There you go. Trek 9 might have done some shady/♥♥♥♥♥♥ things, in the past and even currently, but this game is still the same game it was a year ago, and I recommend it.  1) Stay away 2) Only recommended when on sale 3) Recommended  4) Highly recommended  5) This is a must play
1311	0	a	this could be fun if i could connect to a server...
1312	0	a	The trailer for the game made the game sound so good and so hyped but in the end result there was just no action.It turned into more of a hunt down dinosaures the size of a skittle.Even for a dollar felt like a rip off.
7222	1	a	Killing Floor, But much bigger wolds, pvp, and Dinosaurs. A lot of time and effort has been put into the game to make it really smooth. Good game, and super cheap. (At the time of writing this it was 99cents)
7224	1	a	This a fun game, pretty balanced, and the graphics were good. Overall, a very pretty game

7228	1	a	Best played in Co-op...
1322	0	a	Honestly...this is my opinion, and mine alone...but this game isn't as fun as I was led to believe it was. Granted, my frame rate issues didn't help much at all...but either way, my interest in the game quickly faded after about...maybe half an hour into my first match. Sure, I love the fact that it's basically a zombie horde game but with dinosaurs, but...it was just far too repetitive to keep my interest for long. The dinosaurs were...in all honesty, they don't have great AI. Sure, they're good at surrounding you and tearing you to pieces; sure, they're good at charging you and running you through; sure, they're good at taking you out before you have time to react...but their attacks were far too predicatable and you could easily skirt them without receiveing any damage. The weapons were a bit...iffy, in my opinion. The pistols just sound like the automatic rifles, just in single bursts. Oh, and don't get me started on the fact that some of the sound effects for two or three particular weapons are taken straight out of Command and Conquer: Red Alert 2. I'll likely go on a tangent about that. But the rifles just felt...unbalanced to me. It was far too easy to get kills with them since they have next to no recoil from what I was able to see through my low frames. And the accuracy wasn't all that great, IMO. The last thing that really irked me was the fact that objectives were so damn far away from the bases. I mean, 500 meters is fine and dandy, but 1000 meters away from the main base? And you have to get there before dino's overrun the objective. What annoyed me was that you find out about the objective right at the start of a wave, so you have about 3-4 minutes of running to do in order to get to the objective while dino's are spawning already halfway to the objective and overruning it. You have no time to get to the objective before the raptors and ptera's are all over it. Granted, my frame rate issues were a large factor in me not enjoying my time playing the game. But I couldn't fix it for the life of me. But regardless, it was about fun for the first five minutes while I was fighting off raptors and compy's on my first wave. I mean, let's face it, anything with dinosaurs in it is going to be fun. I can overlook most of what I stated above simply because I can understand just how this game might be entertaining for the majority of players. But for me...there's no fun in repetition. For meticulous players like myself, I would not recommend this game However, if you're one to not be bothered by what I stated above, then this is a $0.99 game worth getting if you're simply looking for a fun time blowing the heads off of raptors. In that case, I would recommend this game to those players.
1323	0	a	theres like only 15 servers with no one in them. Honstly don't know how this game can still be this bad looking after 3 years of support. The trailer over hypes the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game. Not even worth $1.

This game is SO ♥♥♥♥ing buggy, the AI are dumb as real dinosaurs and you might as well be handling a payload of nukes at the rate which dinosaurs die to your hand...OH GOD! HOW DID IT GET THIS BORING?!
7236	1	a	'Halo with Dinosaurs' My friend said to me. I find it to be pretty accurate.
1336	0	a	I really believe its a good game even as arcadish as it is now, but I just cant reccommend this to any of my friends. There are not decent servers with playable pings for me and my pals. Nowhere in my region are there any servers...I bought it simply because I found it cheap. Gameplay animations, etc could really use some polish...but for the low price I wont complaint much there.
7238	1	a	This is the dumbest ♥♥♥♥ing game I have ever played. Rather than researching and studying the dinosaurs you just kill them. This game would be much better if it included the PETA helpline so I could report it. 0/10 and I have crippling depression. Also as a side note, I noticed the guns look a lot like the ones from Call of Duty, not sure what that's about.

7240	1	a	There are games that get pumped up with so much hype whipping people into a frenzy, parting with their hard earned cash, only to then leave the gamer wishing they had not wasted their money, and then there are games that truly deserve the hype and actually end up exceeding the gamers expectations. Bioshock without any shadow of a doubt is in the class that should DEMAND you play the game. This game has the ability to suck you in, leaves you marvelling at just how much there is to do and the fun you can have doing it and… well… quite frankly for the last four days certainly left me with severe lack of sleep as I just could not put the game down. In short this game rocks and must be played!  Bioshock the latest first person shooter from 2K Games and considered “spiritually to be the successor to their previous System Shock 2 title, is set in 1960 starting with our hero Jack surviving a plane crash in the ocean and making his way in a bathysphere (mini submarine) travels to the underwater City that is Rapture. On his journey in the bathysphere Jack is painted a picture by a man named Ryan that Rapture is a beautiful and wonderful place to live, only to leave Jack bearing witness to a completely different picture arriving at Rapture and to a City that looks to be in ruin and with Jack quickly being attacked by a rather grim looking creature that is a Splicer. Armed with a two-way radio Jack is befriended by Atlas and starts his journey through Rapture for what will become the fight of his life. Welcome to Rapture, this is Bioshock and make sure you have a good stock of clean pants, because you are in for one Hell of a ride.  Control wise Bioshock is played from the first person perspective and the buttons are mapped very neatly. Your right shoulder button cycles through all your collected weapons with the right trigger controller the fire on each weapon. Holding the RB button brings up all your weapons and makes it a lot easier to quickly change to any weapon when the heat is on. The left shoulder button cycles through all your available plasmids (more on that later) with the left trigger activating your chosen plasmid. Again holding the LB button brings up all of your active plasmid choices and lets you switch quickly when needed. That leaves the face buttons to be assigned to the likes of using a med kit, reloading a weapon or topping up on your plasmid eve, interacting with objects and jumping. Finally the thumbsticks are then left to control movement and panning the camera and clicking in the thumbsticks will activate crouching (left) and also zoom control (right) if a weapon allows it.  The first thing you will notice in Bioshock apart from the fact you are deep underwater is that your surroundings are rather dark and as a hint for the people that have yet to play the game, before you even start playing you are asked to agree the lighting levels and if you feel the need, then whack it up slightly to help you… That said I never touched any settings as the mood is perfect and fitting for a destroyed city and getting leapt on by a Splicer out of the darkness is all part of the fun really.  Now while I leap into the gameplay aspect I don’t want to give too much of the game away as the plot has more twists and turns than a roller coaster so I will leave the gameplay to what you have in front of you rather than what you are doing for who and who said what. But in saying that, and just to get the ball rolling… you have arrived in Rapture with Atlas talking you through where you need to go and with Ryan the creator of Rapture watching you on the CCTV system and seeming to think you are CIA or KGB decides to set his army of Splicers and bots on you… “Well nobody ever said life was easy – eh.  Surviving in Rapture will come down to a few things. Firstly there will be the choice of weapons from wrench through to pistol ending in a rather awesome flamethrower. The neat touch here is that these weapons seem to have been created after the city was in ruins with people fighting to survive so have a rather home feel DIY look to them bolted together with empty tins and what not rather than being all futuristic (well after all this is 1960). You will find weapons scattered throughout Rapture but your best bet is to look to prise them from the dead hands of a Splicer you just killed. You will also find two types of vending machines throughout every level of Rapture that will allow you to keep topping up on your supplies of ammo should you be running low – that said ammo can also be collected from fallen enemies and you should never struggle to be without. You will also later in the game have the ability to create your own ammo from bits and pieces you find scattered throughout Rapture with the U-Invent machines and you will also find weapon upgrade machines that can only be used once, but will change how your weapon operates improving it in certain categories.  Your second piece of survival comes down to plasmids, and plasmids genetically modify your bodies’ structure allowing you to attack people in a whole new way. These plasmids include being able to shock someone, stunning them so you can move in for the kill, freezing someone allowing you to explode them into shards of ice and through to setting people on fire to name a few. Plasmids can be found throughout Rapture but later in the game pretty much becomes purchased with ADAM (will cover that little bit later). Just like you have a Health bar, you also have an Eve bar, and it is Eve that is the substance needed to sustain your use of plasmids. Top ups to Eve can be found in syringe form throughout Rapture or again by purchase from a vending machine/finding the syringes on dead bodies. Without doubt plasmids make the game what it is and are damn fun to use, and you will end up on the look out for bigger and better plasmids so you can experiment over and over again with new and stronger attacks. Having a Splicer run at you only for you to freeze them, whip out your shogun to watch them explode into tiny shards of ice never stopped being funny, amazing to see in action and damn cool to do. Aside from plasmids you also find and can purchase tonics, which are designed to enhance you in a number of ways from both physical attributes to mental. These cover the likes of being able to disappear if you stand still, through to being able to move faster all the way through to being able to hack objects easier. Tonics are not to be confused with plasmids, which in effect are weapons… tonics are there to make your life a bit easier but are not physical weapons you can see in action – just think of them as enhanced abilities.  I referred to ADAM which essentially is the substance needed to enhance your abilities but gathering ADAM in itself presents you a constant two prong problem. Little girls in the game which are referred to as ‘Little Sisters’ carry ADAM in their body, but your first problem is finding them with your second problem is having to get past their personal body guards that are the ‘Big Daddies’. Big Daddies are genetically modified and walk around in huge diving suits and carry enough armour and weaponry to scare the living daylights out of anyone. To get the ADAM you have to defeat the Big Daddy and then should you manage to do that the game then switches you to a moral choice to make in order to obtain your prize. When you move up to a Little Sister that has just lost her body guard by your hand you are given two choices. Harvest the ADAM which will give you the max amount but basically means killing the child, or rescue the girl which gives you less ADAM but with another character in the game (no spoilers as to who) promising you future rewards for having done so. Your moral choices will also ultimately give you two distinctive endings to the game… I was the good guy and rescued them all, so I am yet to see my evil side ending, but having seen pieces wrote on it
1342	0	a	holy ♥♥♥♥ the graphics on this thing is as bad as those hentai movies that are out of snyc
1343	0	a	Game is a horrible mess, on top of that, Dev has had a past of stealing textures from other games, Don't be suprised if he changes the games name again to escape all the critisim,
1344	0	a	even for a 1$ is a ♥♥♥♥ing waste of money.
1345	0	a	This game feels like an alpha. Fun for the first 2 games of survival. No explanations of game mechanics (so you end up wasting a lot of ingame credits). Needs far more work to be a functional, complete game.
7242	1	a	Way too laggy here in Central America....
1347	0	a	Game is nothing but rip offs and poorly coded boring gameplay
1348	0	a	y u put money on the game im mad &lt;:( 
1349	0	a	So much about this game is wrong... The first thing you notice is that you have no guns. Instead, you have a textured object in your hand, that supossedly does damage as the ammo counter in the bottom of your screen counts down. You have no way of knowing however, as not only is there no data on your enemy, but the gun does not move; there is no recoil, there is no muzzle flash, and there are no bullet decals. This just begins to describe the potentially fatal experience of Orion Dino Horde, including hills that you walk through, no explanation to the gameplay, overly large maps with no navigation, game ruining glitches, a dedicated fan base of 11 year olds, and T-Rexs that throw rocks from their mouths. You read that last bit right. The T-Rex throws rocks from their mouths.  However, with all of the faults the game has, it makes for a hilarious experience, especially with a friend by your side as you smash into dozens of dinosaurs in overpowered vehicles, trolling the serious players into rage quitting. Only buy it if you have a friend(s) to play it with. That is when it holds any value.
1350	0	a	   The old metacritic score was 36.  
1351	0	a	there is too much llag and the game crashes alot 10/10 would stick a shovel in their ♥♥♥
1352	0	a	Quite frankly, this game is awful. Simply put, it's bland, boring, and the videos make it look like a completely different game. I bought this while it was 99 cents, and you shouldn't.
1353	0	a	Stephen Hawking Runs Better Than This Game
1354	0	a	Gabe newell should pay us to play this piece of garbage
1355	0	a	This game is ♥♥♥♥ing cancer. Don't buy it. All the maps are the same. The dinosaurs ice skate jet li quick style.
1356	0	a	The game uses stolen assets. Negative reviews are being swept under the carpet to keep the game from looking bad. They are currently suffering from a DMCA because of stolen assets, again. Just stay the fudge away from this game and don't ever support this developer or publisher, they have dishonest morals.
7244	1	a	You can turn invisible and knife raptors, 10/10
1363	0	a	99 cents for a game! Yes please!  Oh wait, no. This game sucks.
7246	1	a	The Best Game I Have Played In A Long Time! Keep Doing The Great Work! :)
1365	0	a	It doesn't cooperate with my controller which is compatible for pc gaming. It is very irritating when holding down the shooting button nothing happens. There have been times in the game where I'd try moving forward and my character would just stand there. Not enough time to get a new weapon and when spawning my character would automatically die. If that were fixed then I'd totally recommend it.
1366	0	a	Literally Don't Buy This Horrible ♥♥♥♥!
1367	0	a	Terrible. I got it on sale, and it was the worst waste of a dollar ever.
7248	1	a	So bad it's good and somehow gets worse the better it gets
1372	0	a	For some reason, this game crashed my brand new computer twice...  Aside from that, I almost feel that there's a few things in the game that would make a world of difference in the game. The biggest thing is the music, because the music almost ruins the moment (that's just me though). Also, the controls I wish would have been universal with all the vehicles, but maybe I didn't play long enough to check.
1373	0	a	... Where do I start? It was horrible short experience. The game doesn't grant you any information whatsoever. There is not even a tutorial to bring at least an introduction of what to do and what the controls etc are...
1374	0	a	It is ♥♥♥♥
1375	0	a	I have a question for the developers, and I have some positive feedback. Question: Is this seriously all you managed to do with three YEARS of trying to improve it? Did you SERIOUSLY think any of these changes were improvements? Positive feedback: Great job with lowering the price. $0.99 is still a bit too much given the quality, but it's better than &gt;$20/
1376	0	a	A dull FPS with the elements of others and dinsosaurs instead of whatever generic game you want to compare it to.  The graphics aren't great and the framerate will drop randomly for no reason.  The gameplay itself is fine, there are no bugs and the controls are reactive. It's just you get to do the same thing over and over again, nothing really exciting.
7250	1	a	havent played much, but so far, it wasnt the best but it was decent, great game seeing as i got it for 99 cents but i wouldnt pay 15 dollars for it
7252	1	a	Great game with loads of fun and par graphics,good to have it! Cheers!
1377	0	a	Absolute garbage optimization, so much that the game is unplayable. I would describe more, but i can't cause i cant play the game. You'll probably have more enjoyment out of bad rats then this piece of trash.
1378	0	a	This game is not ready to be released to the public.
7254	1	a	1000 HOURS INCOMING  PLASE PLAY THIS WITH YOUR FRIENDS  I LOVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
7256	1	a	This game should be part of 'Steam's early access' Program it needs a lot more work, came out year ago and they revamped this game for the better but more effort is needed to be done to call this a 'completed game'
7258	1	a	Hundreds times better than Primal Carnage ! Very well optimized ! You can purchase equipment like in Just Cause 2 (weapons, tanks, helicopters). Best 0,49 cents I've ever spent ! 9/10
7260	1	a	Games can't fail, only developers can. This game is by far the greatest bang per buck value. It plays a lot like Unreal Tournament 2004, combined with a bit of HALO all mixed in with dinosaurs.  Grab a couple of friends and go nuts in this game. You'll have a blast and I don't think you could spend that little bit of cash anyway better. This developer should get way more praise, they are like the indie CDProjectRed.
1382	0	a	I am disapointed with where my money went.
7262	1	a	Ignore the negative reviews. They were all written before the game was so beautifuly updated. I would play it more if my laptop would handle it better but the devs are amazing and really put effort into theirs games. Recommending it unless you have a laptop not suited for gaming (are laptop generally suited for gaming?).
7264	1	a	its fun with friends xdd, plus its one dollar    ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t time xddd    U SHOOT ♥♥♥♥ING DINOSAUR STHAT TRY TO ♥♥♥♥IN ♥♥♥♥ U AND THEIR IS A SANTA BOSS THAT ♥♥♥♥ING RAPS UR ♥♥♥ WITH ♥♥♥♥♥ MISSILES
1384	0	a	Unless you want an overwhelming urge to kill yourself after 10 min of gameplay then i dont think this game is for you...
7266	1	a	  NOW THE GAME IS FREE??? GIVE MY 40 CENTS BACK!!    JK, the game is good, so its nice more people can enjoy it and probably this means more players to play with so i gess it is a win for all
1385	0	a	Graphics of 90s, gameplay of 90s, bugs of 90s. I could recomend it if it will be 98 year, but now it is a trash. Not worth disk space usage.
7268	1	a	i dont havev this ga mw si yeahghgh itsa very gooods
1386	0	a	its nice but the controls are very crazy wierd and the attacks of the dinos are not very well made when u attack it feels as if ur not even doing any damage to the enemy humans players can win easily needs moore very crucial updates will change review if changes are made correctly.
1387	0	a	A-W-F-U-L GAME don't waste $1 on this crap.
1388	0	a	After several attempts of playing this game, like for real. I didn't manage to shot a DAMN THING. I've spend over 20 minutes waiting , searching , sprinting... but I couldn't play it.  Why I couldn't play it? Because this game has tons of random crashes that random things causes them. Just no.
1389	0	a	It's just plain bad.,,, Don't buy it, not worth the 40 cents.
1390	0	a	I don't know why I didn't like this game. so...   - I feel boring when I playing this game  - I don't know why I write this review I only played this game like a ♥♥♥♥in' 0.2 hrs  yeah!! I'll rate this game 99/100 what?
7270	1	a	Finally, a christian game developer that knows dinosaurs lived alongside humans.
7272	1	a	This game is has a few rough edges, but it's really fun.   If you enjoy Killing Floor, Sanctum or Team Fortress 2 in Mann Up mode you should give ORION:Prelude a try. It's like playing Sanctum with bots instead of a maze, but on the island from Ark and with special abilities and hats.   I suppose every game has hats now, but still.  Give the zombies a break and mow down dinosaurs for a change.
1397	0	a	'Mostly Postive'  This statement is obviously manipulated. Yeah for a $1 sure, buy it.  ***There are TONS of reviews claiming the game is bad, but give a thumbs up anyway...hmmm***  Quite possibly the worst game ever created, or offered via Steam.  I am sure to be burned at the stake for this from the devs/marketers.  1. Horde Survival - Dinosaurs come at the players on a STRAIGHT PATH in groups riding choppy animations and an absolute lack of AI. 'B-Line to you and chomp.'  2. Art design is crap. Objects look painted like Supreme Commander up close, nothing seems to have a cohesive theme with any other items within game, everything LOOKS like someone plopped down objects in Garry's Mod and went 'Yep thats Half-Life 3.'  3. Terrible movement, maps are MASSIVE to the point of not fun. Games go on forever. Vehicles are cheap and clunky. It honestly looks like bad engine demo.  Can anyone tell me why it's trying to look like Halo?

7274	1	a	I do recommend this game although it does get a bit laggy...
7276	1	a	Very Plain and simple: Just paid €0,99 for this game, We've found it due to the free weekend on steam, but it is just to epic to forget for only €0,99 cents.  We decided to support the developer and bought the game with the entire team and we're still pushing other members/employees to buy this game.  We've made a full video review on this game, make sure to check it out if you want to see more of this game before buying it.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71GfZhJzWdU   (Make sure to watch the video on youtube itself for full HD (1080P) video)  For 99Cents you just CAN'T complain about this game and her 251!!!! achievements :D 
7278	1	a	♥♥♥♥ 
7280	1	a	best game in the entire world must buy please buy join based gaming
7282	1	a	Love the game, good graphics and nice bots, but id like to have more colors and able to change them for free. Still, u cant get a better game for 1euro.
7284	1	a	Ever wanted to play as a dinosaur and eat people? Check! Ever wanted to kill dinosaurs? Check! Want to customize your weapon loadout and persk/abilities? Check! Want to face off against increasing odds against hordes of dinos? Check! Like faster action? Check! Like teamwork and teamplay? Check! Like driving tanks with your buddy as a gunner? Check! Like flying aircraft and decimating the field from above? Check! Enough reasons to like the game? Check! Check!  TL:DR Its a game that you can jump in to play 15 minutes or 4 hours. Its simple to learn, yet difficult to master. Offers the ability to customize to your play style. Annnnnnd it has Dinos!!   Super duper important facto: You can melee headshot a T-rex with a lightsaber. &lt;- Need I say more???
7286	1	a	Its so good you the creator must be proud
7288	1	a	If you have a dinosaur fetish this is the the game for you.

The game has that information in its ♥♥♥, game is lagging, AI is buggy and i'm getting max 25 FPS on minimal settings... Did i say that my PC meets the reccomended requirements?

1418	0	a	Since I was young, I have always had a raging passion for dinosaurs. My room was covered in dinosaur posters, and while my friends were playing with their action figures, I'd be cuddling with my Stegosaurus stuffed animal. Boy, those were the days. Now, back to my review of Orion: Prelude. Upon first glance on Steam, I was befuddled. My heart began to pound. A game for only 99 cents... and it has dinosaurs! Purchasing this game was nearly a no-brainer, the only problem I encountered was giving up 1/10 of my hourly wage from McDonalds to pay for a game. But hey, for some childhood nostalgia, it had to be worth it. I couldn't be more wrong. This game wanted me to kill the ones I loved. My enthusiasm for these creatures was one of endearment, and Orion: Prelude was telling me to hurt the animal I idolized. How could I agree? After completing a round of this mindless horde against cute little raptors and a righteous Tricerotops, I had enough. I immediately quit the game, and spent the rest of my Friday evening crying to myself about how the world is so morally evil, like most Friday nights... well most nights in general. But thats besides the point. This game attempted to ruin my zeal toward dinosaurs, and I couldn't take such a harsh hit to my life. I will be forced to use the Steam refund policy and spend my money somewhere else.

1441	0	a	STAY AWAY! Spend your money elsewhere, even if it's just a buck.  Clunky, unresonposive controls. Sluggish movement. Terrible mechanics. A.I. is next to non-existent.  I like to think I have a fairly high tolerance for bugs and and patience when it comes to quirks, especially for indie games. However, not only is this 'game' amateurish, it is outright unplayable.  The only consolation is that I spent a mere $0.99 for it. Then again, in hindsight, if I had put a dollar towards a lottery ticket instead, I probably would have a higher chance of winning a jackpot than buying anything developed by ORION ever again. This is by far the most intolerably unpolished game I have ever had the misfortune of having on my computer.

1443	0	a	Eh. If you like the site of dinosaurs, this might be for you. Otherwise eh.
7308	1	a	ORION: Dino Horde is a Indie Game Shooter, that is amazing! The Graphics are standard from what you'll find from a Nintendo Wii or a Play Station 3 and this game is alright. Why people hate is soo much is because they hate it. HATERS GONNA HATE. Overall The Game is Amazing 7/10 Co-Op Your Main Objectives are surviving the Dinosaur Horde or Get the Generators Active.  Deathmatch Free for All whoever survives wins. Its a every man for himself.  Survival Survive the Horde and win the game  This Game has alot of potential and many of them survived but others failed. 7/10 from VivaTheGamer

1450	0	a	Bad game !!!!  Cause what ? well you just need to realize that this publisher: TREK Industries and this Development: Spira Game Studio, just stealing content from Activision product. Not just that, this Publisher just re-release the same game (but with diferent name like Orion: bla-bla-blah) and make people spending their money to buy the another series of this game.  I suggest you, not to buy product with name 'Orion' anymore. didnt trust what i said ? you can visit here:  Look at this proof 
7312	1	a	Cool game  cool Devs  the game is insane lol is like Star Wars Vs Jurasic Park  pls you can use a light saber  and is free like come one is worth it to download
1452	0	a	The Orion Prelude was one of the worst games of all time-Once Now it is a bad graphic, first person, dinosaur hunting, survival game. Servers only Costs money too buy items and there is no Steam trading inventory for it. Pros- 99 Cents Cons- Bad Graphics Lagging... Slow Costs money too buy in game items No trading As IGN said 'Please don't waste your hard-earned dogh' I rate this game- 3.1/10
7314	1	a	so this game is for kids like 7-12 years old l thought wow something like borderlands NO lts just epic guns wow but shoting is totaly lagged and the island is too bugged this game is hard 2 cuz you must kill flying dinosaur wtf lts really good to gift for you frind 7 years he gonna be happy and you will pay 0.50 euro so good gift 6/10
7316	1	a	Stupid fun, everything a mindless shooter should be. At 99 cents it's a must buy.
1455	0	a	The game is buggy as ♥♥♥♥.

7318	1	a	shoot dino be dino
1457	0	a	  The game is running really slow for no reason, all settings on low, not too many people playing it and some dinos take lots of time to die.
1458	0	a	Argueably one of the worst games I've ever played. Guns without sounds, lack of decals and general polish, horrible UI and awful animations.  The little amount of voice acting present is low quality and repeated over and over. That this game has sold as many copies as it has makes me very sad.  Steer clear of this game.
7320	1	a	Got lots of hours killing dino basterds great price, and playablity buy the four pack.
7322	1	a	Jetpacks, tanks, dinosaurs that the game calls 'dinos,' this game has it all. Jurassic Park meets Deus Ex meets your birthday; 2/5 for some decent co-op, dino destruction. Recommended if a dino fan and on sale
7324	1	a	Fun. Horde. Survival. Simple. Exciting. The graphics aren't amazing but it's 99 cents. GG. 7/10

1460	0	a	&gt;what is A.I B A D G A M E A D G A M E  I feel sorry. At least the devs tried to make this good.
1461	0	a	$0.49 ?!!!!!!  So bad it's still not worth it.
7328	1	a	Honestly it is like Halo with Dinosaurs. If you are doubting buying this game don't. It's so cheap but so good. WHY IS IT SO CHEAP?!
7330	1	a	great game.
1463	0	a	Where is Orion 2 
1464	0	a	im glad i spent .99 cents on this game thats all i can say
1465	0	a	i would rather play other shooters like call of duty     its not bad but its not good 45/100
1466	0	a	This game cost less than $2 yet somehow i still feel like i got ripped off&gt;
1467	0	a	From the bowels of some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ developer that had absolutely NO clue what they were doing, they bring you ORION: Dino Horde, a ♥♥♥♥ game for ♥♥♥♥♥.  This is 100% objective. The leveling system is bad. Collision detection is awful. Mapping is bad, but not as bad as i'd think from basically a glorified Source Engine mod. You know, games that are free. I bought this game when it was £0.01 and it's not even worth that.  0 stars.
1468	0	a	This was a waste of 99 Cents
1469	0	a	This game is awful. Every aspect is awful. I think all these positive reviews must be fake. srsly...
1470	0	a	Worst game I've played
7332	1	a	49 cents on sale the best 2 quarters i've spent on a game that offers so much and yet get it for so little

1473	0	a	This game sucks... it's really boring game.
1474	0	a	The first borderlands has better graphics. This game is a little fun when it works but, it doesn't work very often. This game is s**t, even for .53 $.
1475	0	a	Allthough I did not buy this (My freind gifted it to me) I highly regret installing this broken shell of a game. The port is terrible, even on ultra high graphics the game looks like crap, The team based mechanic is non existant and this is the 'Fixed' version of the game.  PROS: It is 99 cents. CONS: to many to count.
7334	1	a	A very cheap -er- good game.
7336	1	a	Great Game! Would recommend. IMO its a mix of oldschool tribes plus some new ark style gameplay. Definatly worth tume and money! Some bugs ive found but what game doesnt have them.
7338	1	a	i vault the fence, crash down into a pile of dead leaves, and pick up my father from the fallen. inside the constant hum of insects, i breed into eternity. where was god in all of this   the answer is that i awoke naked and alone inside of a cave, the lights were flanging and I felt the crushing hollowness of a century. the voices boomed around me, and I felt fear for the very first time. minutes like bullets intersected by screams, i slip into the skin of a new tyrant, and firmly grasp the rat's neck
7340	1	a	this game is insane. love it, ten outa ten would recommend to anyone
1476	0	a	This game sucks so f**king bad, like holy sh*t. Don't buy this if you have any right of mind.
1477	0	a	I cannot explain how terrible this game is. I have played this game for a total of 7 minutes and 45 seconds and honestly I hated every second that my eyes burned on these playstation 1 visuals. I have seen better looking videos and games on my iPod Nano. However I am told that the developers were ging through a tough time being blind. At least thats what I am hoping because this game is worse than that one time a small unloved child from a third world country choked on his own sadness. I wish I could refund my time and life wasted on this pittiful 17th century game that was funded by small children haters foundation. I am truely sorry if you bought this game, for you have been sucked in by the steam sales and the crappy games they put up for less than 5 dollars. FarmVile in my opinion would get my seconds of my life then this sorry excuse for a videogame.
7342	1	a	Halo meets Dinos. Graphics: 10/10 Gameplay: 10/10 I was playing with a friend and suddenly he began to get arrows stuck on me, finished with a selfie. Now i can go out and say: I hunted dinos like you but then i took an arrow to the knee.
7344	1	a	i like this game a lot however there is some lag issues i recomend checking out the steam guild to fix it but overall AMAZING!! i love shootin them dinos:)
7346	1	a	Way better than the game it's meant to be preluding
7348	1	a	WTF Valve? Where is my game what i got for free? Return me back!!
7350	1	a	New, quick-review is as follows: The game has definitely improved in almost every area since launch. Some textures on buildings and the general vehicle design might be amateurish, but I recommend you look beyond these minor issues and find at least one friend to get the game, (perhaps on sale, or if you're an indie supporter buy at full price) as getting together to mow down scores of prehistoric beasts is great fun!   OLD REVIEW BELOW I recommend AVOIDING this game, unless it is: A) On Sale; like it is today for less than 4 USD (August 19, 2013) B) Something you and your friends would enjoy playing together for some stupid fun
1483	0	a	This game kinda sucks. idk how else to put it. Very weak overall.   Repetitive and boring. With very low production value. honestly way better Horde mode co-op games to be played than this one.  Would not recommend
1484	0	a	Well what to say about this game...great premise. Execution is...well not so good. Tried it,but after 5minutes of playing i had no idea what was i doing, what should i do etc. Good game,but needs a lot of polishes. When its in sale and you have nothing to spend your money on, i say go buy this game just for lulz.
7352	1	a	Well, i have played fora couple hours now, and i must say... ITS AWESOME. yes there are glitches, i came across 2 in my playtime but it was not to bad. i really enjoyed this game i mean what other game lets you fight dinos in a mech suit?
7354	1	a	Don't trust the rating! This is one of the best fps's I've ever played. I recommend it if you like Halo and Jurrassic Park.
7356	1	a	Underrated but incredibly fun
1486	0	a	I spent 0.99 cents on this game. THIS IS ♥♥♥♥♥♥, GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK
7358	1	a	This is my current stress buster. Do-op dinosaur shooting. Nothing else needs to be said really.
1487	0	a	lame all around. bad graphics, bad game play, hardly have time to grab new weapons even. does not allow you to level up//no story line or campain mode.
7360	1	a	Fun shooter Dino slayer who wouldnt enjoy????!!!!!!!
7362	1	a	cheap and fun 
1492	0	a	Like masturbating with razor blades.
1493	0	a	My only gripe with this is that it's UNREALISTIC. Humans and dinosaurs weren't around at the same time. hell, T Rex and Stegosaurus didn't even live together. YOU NEED TO CHECK YOUR FACTS BEFORE YOU RELEASE GAMES
1494	0	a	I lost R$ 2,19 buying this game
7364	1	a	Orion: Prelude is one of the best games ever! Looking at the price of it might make you think that it has DLC or overpowered weapons but no! You buy the game and that is it! It has some cosmetic items that you can buy with real money but it is more like a donation and it gives you no advantage! Overall the game is great! Graphics are not the best but it fixes it on gameplay!  This game has a 'single-player' mode that is basicly same thing as offline but with bots!  Also when I tested the server creating it worked perfectly. It doesn't have the same problem as Valve games (so in Orion: Prelude you don't need to make dedicated servers to play with friends)!  Totally worth of your money :)
7366	1	a	Just a simple fun game. I'm not going to give this game a bad rating just because the company that made it is having some problems. As for the real question, is the game any good ? I have to say it is. To me that is all that matters.  The Good I went into an easy survival server for my first time playing. It is a simple set up go into the building that has what you want to buy, and get it. The more dinosaurs you kill the better stuff you can buy. The gameplay fells relaxed, no rush just fun. The bosses are large dinosaurs which are fun to kill.  The Bad The Pterodactyls are what killed teammates more then the T-rex. The Jeep turns by moving the mouse, while the tank turns with the 'A' &amp; 'S' keys.  The Ugly The only ugly thing is if you want to play this with a controller. I like to use a conroller when I can, because keyboard, 7 mouse kills my wrist. But this game doesn't feel right.   With that said using keyboard, and mouse was easy this game. You just find a good spot, wait for the next wave, and mow them down. Alot easier on your wrist when you're mostly using just the mouse.
1496	0	a	STAY AWAY FROM THIS MESS!   Orion Dino Horde is nothing but a rebrand of the god awful Orion Dino Beatdown,however with more content and SOME bug fixes,the most notably one being the better optimization. BUT all of the issues are back full force:  -God Awful Dinosaur attack animations -Horrid Gunplay -TERRIBLE Sound Design -TERRIBLE firearm sound design -TERRIBLE Voice Acting -Sub-Par Graphics for a 2013 release,this looks like an early UE 3 game  there are other games that execute this ``Wave Survival`` mechanic much better than this travesty of a game,instead of buying this save up some cash and buy Killing Floor,this game was supposed to be a mod but SOMEHOW it got funded and now its asking for your hard earned cash,by the time im typing this review this game is on sale for 1 $,in my opinion its not even worth a dime throwing your money away is much more fun than buying this piece of crap.
1497	0	a	♥♥♥♥ game, funny for half an hour but doesn't excuse it for sucking. Bought it out of curiosity, wasted my money.
1498	0	a	This game is worst game i ever played ! Lag , Hard to new players and it is not fun game !! Hate that game !!!
7368	1	a	Great game, bit glitchy but for those money, must have
7370	1	a	one of the best games i have ever played its right up there with elder scrolls and battlefield
7372	1	a	The Best Game I have played For ever!
7374	1	a	If Bungee saw this, they would sue. 10/10
1501	0	a	I noticed a lot of other people said they were prompted with controller buttons on screen instead of keyboard when playing. I got the exact opposite. I had my controller plugged in and was prompted with keyboard options. So it sounds to me like this game is ♥♥♥ backwards and i'm not surprised because it sucks. A lot. Don't waste your time.
7376	1	a	Pretty fun game to play, especially since it is extremely cheap.   Pros:  Simple gameplay Good to play with friends Very cheap, literally the price of a can of Pepsi Dinosaurs   Cons:  Players don't seem to communicate much, which can make it pretty boring if you're not playing with friends AI can be a bit buggy at times Pterodactyls are annoying asf  Definitly recommend if you're looking for game to play with atleast one other friend, not as fun on your own
7378	1	a	Shoot, run, shoot, run , laugh as the dinosaurs ragdoll on the floor like lifeless insects.
1504	0	a	could have been improved
7380	1	a	literally the best game i have ever played. puts tripple A titles to shame.

1507	0	a	Just terrible.
7384	1	a	I punched a pterodactyl with a pistol, I stabbed a Stegosaurus with a sword, I tackled a Tyrannosaur with a tank... It's an okay game.
1508	0	a	Its alright
1509	0	a	Every time I try to start the game it just crashes and i unintalled and reinstalled it and it still instantly crashes
1510	0	a	It's 1 dollar for a reason.
7386	1	a	better than Call of Duty Ghost
7388	1	a	This is probably the best game I've ever played. Stunning graphics, next gen engine, haven't encountered any bugs yet. If you really love your friend, gift this to him/her.  Actual quote from IGN: 'The next Bioshock: Infinite' 11/10 -IGN
7390	1	a	Gave me motion sickness and an headache within an hour of playtime 10/10
7392	1	a	This is a perfect example of a game steam shouldn't be selling. It's more than disappointing. It's downright terrible. The idea that this could be sold for actual money is insane.
7394	1	a	GRAAAAHR! RAWWWR! *Fwomph!*
1511	0	a	The only game i wish i could delete from my library.
1512	0	a	What ever you do. Dont you ever buy this Game. It was the worst Game I ever bought and I even bought a 4 Pack because I though wow Dinosaurs must be fun. The Release Version was unplayable. I mean the dinosaur killsound was a Civilian HL2 Death sound. The Game was in such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ state that they released the Game again 1 year later under another name? HOW BAD CAN YOU BE THAT YOU HAVE TO CHANGE YOUR NAME. The Original started a meer riot in the Steam forums for refund. So dont buy this. just dont!
7396	1	a	Really a Great FUN game. I paid for it when it was on special but it is deffiently worth 14.99USD. I love the game. Everyone should buy it!!! :) :) :) Hours of fun
7398	1	a	why do i have to buy the game two times!!!!!!
1513	0	a	Don't believe their lies. It's a third-rate Unreal Tournament 3 mod, with tons of jank and like, one looping music track. It's worth 99c, but not a penny more.
1514	0	a	....... really.......
1515	0	a	bad fps treatment
1516	0	a	This game is the worst piece of ♥♥♥♥ I have ver seen. The creators should literally take the computers they made this with and shove it up their asses. 10/10
1517	0	a	This game is advertised as an amazing reboot. To be honest, its rubbish. Its laggy for all the 4 people i know who have this game even though we all have very good computers, Its confusing to play and a waste of 79p !
1518	0	a	This game is ♥♥♥♥. It runs horribly and its a killing floor with dinosaurs. Its a one euro pound or whatewer its not waste of money but it doesnt last long. Buy killing floor instead or buy dino-d when its on steam sale.
1519	0	a	@InternetBeaver Why did you make me buy this?
1520	0	a	Terrible. 5 dollar budget. wasnt play tested. If there are more words to describe it, I dont think they exist.
7400	1	a	very funny and doesnt need a strong pc
7402	1	a	I SHOT A LITTLE FOOT IN THE FACE! WHAT MORE COULD I ASK FOR FROM A GAME!!!!
1526	0	a	game doesn't start. 10/10 would play again
7404	1	a	Amazing game. Ambient arena with your friends and weather and EVERYTHING YOU COULD WANT. Btw, who cares if anything is stolen from the game. Games always steal sounds, textures, etc. And that doesnt make the game any less great.
7406	1	a	  game is 1$ why write a bad review also its rly fun with friends
7408	1	a	gg steam votes for sale when game was already 99 cents on sale instead of a real game. wp steam community
7410	1	a	what is life
1532	0	a	Its prettyyyyyy bad.
1533	0	a	awfull is a kind word
7412	1	a	i bought the game when it was 5 or 10 EURO :(
7414	1	a	scammed me from my dollar. WHY IS IT FREE.
1536	0	a	If you didn't think you could waste 50 cents, look no further.  
1537	0	a	What about people who play when it's not F2P ?? no ♥♥♥♥ing refund for this ?? i feel disapointment so much :&lt;
1538	0	a	They make jokes that in 2012, they made the worst game ever, but now theyve turned it around.... NO.. The gaame is still pretty bland. i may have found this game interesting back in 2005, but here we are 10 years later and their gfx still look 10+ years old. the community seems pretty dead... there is barely a choice of server/game mode to choose from, i still cant get past the fact that this game looks like it would be ok back in 2000-2005. I wouldnt recommend playing this game unless its the very first game you play in history, that way you cant compare it to anything else.
1539	0	a	Welp now that it's free I feel stung by the developers. Real insult to anyone who bought this scum for money. Hopefully I shove my 99 cents so far up my ♥♥♥ to simulate being ♥♥♥♥ed by the developers.
1540	0	a	Trash. graphics are mediocre, performance is horrible, and dont even want to hear the audio, which sounds like a game from 1995, actually, worse. cons: poor quality, no singleplayer, bad multiplayer, overpriced dlcs, and not optimized.  pros: workshop.
1541	0	a	  THIS ♥♥♥♥ING GAME BLOWED MY EYES AND CAUSES TO ME A MENTAL PROBLEM
7416	1	a	this is the best game
7418	1	a	it is the best 49 sents ive spent
7420	1	a	Amazing game, not even $1. It's like a mix of Halo &amp; Planetside 2, but with DINOSOWERS!
1542	0	a	  The game costs a dollar and is always on sale for a reason.      cuz its bad         It's a good game if you're 8 years old I guess.
7422	1	a	Jetpacks and dinosaurs. What more do you want in a game?
7424	1	a	nice but i cant run it on may pc :( but its ok this game is good :D
7426	1	a	Slightly badly optimized, with netcode that could do with a LITTLE smoothing, but the true fun of the game is in the brokenness of some of the weapons. Cloaking and backstabbing (never breaking cloak) to your hearts content never gets old. Revolver shooting everything never gets old. Getting enough upgrades that you're basically a walking tank never gets old. It invokes memories of good old COD Zombies, but ten times more broken. Absolutely fun.
1550	0	a	Its an ok game but SEVERELY BROKEN did you have to dip down in quality after you almost got sued Step up guys seriously
7428	1	a	All of the reviews are steam ones.  10/whydoesthisnumberevenmatter.
7430	1	a	This game is beyond amazing. This is a cross between Halo and Ark. This game is worth the money also very fun with friends and it wastes sometime are you hands and its just a very good game overall.
7432	1	a	Halo and Borderlands had a lovechild with Turok. It has lots of flaws but its fun with friends, and its only a buck.
7434	1	a	'well I mean its 99 cents so i guess its goood if you like being castrated by a raptor as you are humped to death by a horny t-rex at a million miles an hour until you ♥♥♥♥ing die' - anonymyus
1561	0	a	Ugly. Awful. Bad gameplay. Waste of time. Sorry I gave this game a shot and it's just bad. Looks cool and fun at first however it's not.
7436	1	a	Absolutely worth every penny, CDN$ 1.09 spent well THANK YOU DEVELOPERS FOR MAKING MY LIFE. THIS GAME IS COMPLETELY NEXT GEN QUALITY AND IS ABSOLUTELY GAME OF THE CENTURY
1562	0	a	Sure am glad the specs keep changing
1563	0	a	All I can say is, thank goodness for the free week.   After about 10 minutes of playing, all I want to do is uninstall this crap. I honestly would have been ♥♥♥♥♥♥ had I even wasted the measly $0.99 on this.
1564	0	a	  ♥♥♥♥ just ♥♥♥♥♥. it's a waste of download space boring repetitive and servers are extremely laggy, if you shoot anything 1 ft in front of you it's gonna die 4 years later.
1565	0	a	Pretty terrible game, looks like it's from 2005 and plays like it too. Good then, but not now.
7438	1	a	ORION sucks. ORION Prelude is pretty darn good. Fin. Its like $0.04 and you get 3 free copies to give to your friends. Imagine Borderlands Co-OP but youre fighting Dino's. Yeah I know, its hard to imagine. So rather than waste brain power trying to picture it, spend the 0.00005 pesos and get it. Just dont get ORION. That totally blows. Oh, and the devs are total dipsticks. I cant believe the people that made ORION also made this. Its like they were drinking while making one of them. Obviously they were drinking while making Prelude because its so much better.
1569	0	a	very ugly, very boring game...looks like it is from 2009 so ugly. The gameplay is very boring too. Looks like Dinosaur meets killing floor.
1570	0	a	this game is really good but the massive lag spoils what could be an amazing game
7440	1	a	This game is awesome AND very cheap,in fact too cheap for being this awesome~! :D (not that i am complaining~ xP) In the beginning i was 'Meh,this games is hard and not that good,but after a while,when i got the hang of it and started to have fun,i thought,hey it's not bad,actually it's very fun~!' xD
7442	1	a	This game is beyond amazing. This is a cross between Halo and Ark. This game is worth the money also very fun with friends and it wastes sometime are you hands and its just a very good game overall.
1574	0	a	They ♥♥♥♥ing ruined it with prelude, the game's preformance sucks ♥♥♥ now, lowest resolution gets 15 frames on a decent gaming laptop.  It was GOOD ENOUGH 3 MONTHS AGO, STOP TRYING TO MAKE IT BETTER.  holy ♥♥♥♥
7444	1	a	Im gonna ram a rusty nail through my spinal and eat my ♥♥♥♥♥
1576	0	a	THE GAME IS FULL WITH BUGS AND I WENT MY MONEYS BACK
7446	1	a	Full Review: Orion  dino horde  Prelude might have rough animations, (Not only the derpy animations of players and Dinosaurs, Try doing a melee attack with the CV-10 Pistol. I dare you.) and I have no idea what the heck the story is (I ASSUME it's about humans going back in time to the period of dinosaurs because earth in the future is all ruined and stuff. It might be another planet with dinosaurs on it. No clue)  Game Play: 8/10 As for gameplay, well, Orion is quite fun, and plays quite like one of my favorite games: Killing Floor. The addition of Jetpacks and Cloaking is great, and while it's twitchy like the ORIGINAL Killing Floor (2.5 for UT2004), it's still a blast to play with friends when you get bored of (Insert party game here. Probably CS:GO)  It also has deathmatch, which i don't really play, and PvPvE mode (Deathmatch WITH Dinosaurs!)   Graphics: 9/10 Orion: Prelude has some pretty graphics. While my laptop can't fully handle them, the game looks great on my buddy Damieok's Battle station.  Hats: Hat/Hats This game has hats. Hats are fun. Not a lot of Hats like TF2, but a nice little selection.  Music: 9/10 The Music is pretty damn epic. Nuff Said.  Price: 10/10 BUT ♥♥♥♥, IT WAS 99 CENTS.  SERIOUSLY. IT IS A DOLLAR. LIKE, LESS THAN A CHICKEN SANDWICH. AS MUCH AS 4 TWINKIES. THIS GAME IS WORTH 4 TWINKIES IN MY BOOK.   TL:DR Review:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoHFWd1qi0c 
1579	0	a	This game... Just no... No... Not worth your time... Just don't bother.
1580	0	a	Still not worth it.
1581	0	a	Litterly not worth the trading cards i sold to get the .99 cents to buy this..... soo glitchy, very little ingame instructions and the animations are terrible. THE worst game i have played

1591	0	a	its not smooth, dinamycs are not very good, if you want to buy, buy it with a good discount.
1592	0	a	A total piece of crap to me. I hate the game play, but you can enjoy it. I would rate it 3.5 out of 10
1593	0	a	Pathing AI is hilarious.
7460	1	a	I loved the look of the game. in game storyline or the concept is very good. I wish i had a better computer to actually play the game....
7462	1	a	Got drop kicked by a velociraptor.  I r8 8/8 m8
1594	0	a	Nope.
7464	1	a	dino horde is a great game filled with futuristic weapons but i often get big lag spikes that last for about 2 min. but exept for that its great
1595	0	a	I was foolish enough to buy this game because I thought it would be a laugh. I was wrong. Take the objective. Take the objective. Take the objective. Take the objective. Take the objective.

7466	1	a	I love this.
7468	1	a	Great game, awesome 3D tower defense game. Like Left 4 Dead with dinosaurs. There isn't much bad about this game but the one thing that has me sad is the serious lack of different Dino's. Only 3 or 4 in the game. If you have to play that over and over, what's the fun?
7470	1	a	What happen at the servers? I cant see any server at refresh except 1 Insane dinosurvival. HELP
7472	1	a	Its fun. Get some friends to buy it (or get the 4-pack) and play. Some people have had some trouble with connecting, but I've never had this issue.
7474	1	a	Dinosaurs can blow up the power plant 10/10
1600	0	a	This game has so much potential, but it sucks so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bad. everything looks like ♥♥♥, buggy, and controls like running through knee deep mud. 2/10
1601	0	a	This game is TaRASH i wouldn't recommend this game to my child if his life depended on my ex paying child support. This game is a -1/10 wouldn''t play it if my friend's life depended on it.
7476	1	a	this game is really fun i would reccomend it to anyone but there are some good things to it and some bad things to it soo im gonna tell you whats good and whats bad about it.  good things:  it has great graphics  it has alot of servers to play on it has mulitple gamemodes to choose from (my favorites are vital rampage and survial) it has a alot of weapons to choose from. it has a alot of different dinos.  it's only 1$ it has alot of maps to play on.   bad things: there are only 3 classes. you need a good computer or else it will lag insanely (i got rid of the lag by changeing my settings) it takes a long time to download bots are a little dumb. not too many but still has a few bugs.  besides all the bad stuff this game is amazing.
1602	0	a	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCMRpia6K_o  just watch that video, and YES this game is ORION: DINO HORDE NOT Prelude.... the only reason I own this game is because it was a gift from a friend over steam.I joined a game, IN THE LOBBY, and when the match started, I was prompted with wait for next round to respawn.Round timer: 45:00 minutes left, so I left.
7478	1	a	I know I haven't played it for very long, I had put off buying it because of negative reviews, but those reviews are garbage. This game is fun.
1604	0	a	Orion: Prelude caters to the zero demand in first/third person sci-fi dinosaur shooters, it's continued existence and updates is one of the great mysteries of life
7480	1	a	Really feels like a beta of an upcoming free to play game, and has a lot of issues, but if you look past that and realise it's just a 1$ (or less) game and realise how much fun you can have killing dinosaurs with your friends, then you'll def. like this game.
7482	1	a	It's a dinosaur hunting game...Online...with GUNS !! 10/10
7484	1	a	I dont remember buying this, Is that bad?
1608	0	a	when i first played this game it was very laggy and the graphics are bad so i avoided this game for about a year and now im posting a review
7486	1	a	It's a dollar don't be cheap, lightsabers, dinosaurs, and jetpacks, lower video settings to low if you're middle class citizens
7488	1	a	so cool and you can fly
1612	0	a	you should just let this game be free because all your doing is anoying a lot of peoplee by putting out for only a week free and its not that good any way so just make free !!!!!!!!!!!!!
7490	1	a	This Is Just TOO AWESOME GAME!!!!!  +Plenty Of Weapons +You Can Play With friends +Vehicles +Many Difrend Maps +Too Much dinosaurs +Good Graphics +It's Only 0,99$ Game  -Soldiers -Soldiers Riding On Dinosaurs -Some Tiny Glitches -You Must To Pay Real Money For Hats  Questions:  Does It Have Voice Chat?    Something Else To Say:  Don't Look Comments JUST BUY IT Its An Epic Game  10/10
1613	0	a	4 Million copyies sold isn't a selling point for a $0.99 game.
1614	0	a	I tried to like this game... I really did, but it is sooooo boring. The first few minutes where like meh this game is ight. but in a few more boy my opinion would change. Just in the first 5 minutes it was so repetitive the dinosaurs aren't even that hard and multiplayer isn't that fun either... the game would be a great idea if they remade the graphics and added a story mode to it i wouldn't regret buying the game but sadly i do... 3/10 would kill raptors that don't even hurt me probably not again
7492	1	a	What the?
7494	1	a	More addicting than sex on cocaine. 69/10
7496	1	a	Finally I just started playing this game after the 1.3 update.   It sat on my library for almost a year, you know, it was $1, why wouldn't I buy a 1 buck 3D relatively decent graphics game that was accepted by more than a 50% of it's owners?  Well, to me, this game actually deserves a try, and definitely, it is worth the $1 I paid for it, would pay 2 or 3 times that price.  It pretty simple (learnt how to play it in 1 hour), it's fun to play, 3 classes, many weapons to choose from, many upgrades, good graphics, nice maps, good Dino's AI, good multiplayer system, and the best part, you do this all in a relatively short period of time. There is a game mode where you play 5 matches in 35 minutes or less, by then you already upgraded all your skills, bought the best weapons, and killed 150 dinos... =D  You can think of this title, like the best mobile 3D FPS with Dinos game you have ever seen, but running at 1080p on your PC screen, with a mouse and keyboard attached to it.
1624	0	a	Worse than socialism.
1625	0	a	Uh, what? No explanation or anything, game just throws you into a clunky lobby and even clunkier gameplay with no explanation. Lame.
7498	1	a	Right, this game never really caught my eye before for a number of reasons, primarily because they didnt really sell the gameplay well. It went dont to like 70 p and me and a few mates thought screw it, lets buy and it is actually such an amazing game. Yeh the graphics are nother special and there arent alot of guns to chose from, but the gameplay is so much fun. Thus far we have only played survival, there are only 4 of us and I gotta say its a really relaxing jokey game that can range from easy run arounds to extreme difficulty. I would pay 10 pound for this game id say, under a pound is ridiculous, its such an amazing game to have as an option to play with ur mates.  PLEASE BE AWARE this game is no fun without having someone to play it on, community isnt exact big or active anymore and you cant really joke around with urself..
7500	1	a	Orion, Onion.   Game - Awesome  Graphics - Makes the game not that awesome
7502	1	a	10/10
1629	0	a	What a waste of money. I will never play it again.
1630	0	a	This game is very unstable  -10/10 wouldnt rate again
1631	0	a	a dollar is practically worthless and i still feel like i wasted money on this simplistic, boring, barely-a-game.
7504	1	a	To be frank, propbably the best 99 cents you will every spend, regardless if you constantly play the game or not
7506	1	a	coop multiplayer with tons of guns and jetpacks and dinosaurs. Whats not to love?
1634	0	a	bought this game to play with my friends and was disappointed to discover that the game will not launch on my pc. instead i get a white screen and the task manager says its not responding. i hope this problem is fixed soon 
7508	1	a	I don't own this game, but I was allowed to write a review for it, which is nice. 10/10
7510	1	a	Pretty cool!  A lot of content/game modes.
7512	1	a	8/8 this game is great 
7514	1	a	Jurassic Park + Borderlands 2 for 60 cents. 10/10
7516	1	a	only problem is it doesnt have good fps on my computer
7518	1	a	This is one of the best dino games ever!!! please work on the bugs and grapichs... BUT ITS SO GOOD
1642	0	a	Not worth the money
7520	1	a	This game for the low, low, low price of the lint in your pocket is one of the most fun games I've ever played. Especially if you play with friends. It's survuval mode is really fun but the PvP is where things get interesting. The game is also surprisingly alive so you will run into players occasionally and they are all pretty cool guys.
1643	0	a	this is a horrible game, the trailer makes the game look really cool, but looks can be desiving. when i started playing i got an instant headace and this game is not worth the 99 cents.
7522	1	a	i have bougt 8 games and given to my friend´s and all all of them liked it super good game!!
7524	1	a	Played it when it was free probably going to buy it again. One of the games I actually felt like reviewing. You can have many weapons and it can be an endless amount of fun. This game is one of the fun ones.
1644	0	a	all hail the lag king of all my games with no lag love u counter strike as for u prelude 1st place for lag and terrible quality and great lag u done it this time guys
7526	1	a	THE GRAPHICS ARE TOO BEAUTIFUL FOR MY AYES.  10/0,1
7528	1	a	its alright i guess
7530	1	a	good nice dinosaur mabey ark try to get stuff like this!
1646	0	a	I save my video options and the game crash dont buy this
7532	1	a	Great game but no servers still buy and play cant beat 50 cents thats like the price of a potato chip bag but chips taste better then Orion.
1647	0	a	waste of a dollar, too laggy to play, stupid concept. overall rating- 2/10
1648	0	a	horrible
1649	0	a	I meet the maximum requirements of the game and more...   yet on lowest settings i get 20fps what is this
7534	1	a	it's ok, but an awkward mix of Counter-Strike,(the voice commands)Dirty Bomb,(the accent)and Halo(the graphics) I can see why it's only 99 cents now, but it's pretty good, I guess
7536	1	a	its ok for a dollar
7538	1	a	Ignore the meta critic this game is actually pretty good.
7540	1	a	it sucks so much id rather play cod
1653	0	a	only baught cause 49 cents and i got bored after 3 minutes of playing it. to sum things up this game eats ♥♥♥
7542	1	a	This is a good game, but ive had lots of problems with it, it lags out so much that i cant even play it. fraps says i get about 6 fps in this game. yes the ideas good but the execution is poor. but i would still say its a game worth getting as long as its on sale.
1654	0	a	dont lose mony on the sh'/'/t
7544	1	a	Amazing game! Cant wait to play with friends!
7546	1	a	Orion prelude is a great game and it has it's ups and it's downs but I think it has way more pros than cons lets look at that. Pros.  -1$!! How can you pass that up and sales are just amazing. (or so I have been told I have not know'n this game long enough to see one.) -Five player co-op and quite a few other game modes. -A lot of perks and weapons. -Being able to play as dinos. -Awesome vehicles. -Unlockables like starting weapons wehicle upgrades and starting perks and a few other things. I think I have gotten most of the things that are good now lets transition to the bad. Neutral. Stuff that is in between. -Trading cards they are nice but some people may dissagree. -Graphics im fine with them but they aren't the best. I think I have covered these too. Cons. Stuff that is not really of the liking of most -There are too many orion games to give this one too much attention to adding stuff and fixing bugs. -It is a bit grindy but this is not ussually a big problem. I dont know if I got all the cons but I can edit this later.  Final rating 8.5/10 I would get it.       Tl;dr This was my first review so I don't think it is perfect and I might view it differentally later.
7548	1	a	This game rocks. The graphics aren't top notch, but who cares? Battles are fun and addictive and it's awesome to kill a T-Rex by yourself :) For 1$ this is a super bargain!
1656	0	a	Waste of a dollar. Cheap ♥♥♥♥s.
7550	1	a	For less than £1, it's a good game to play co-op.
7552	1	a	I love this freaking game bought a 4 pack for my sister
7554	1	a	Great game bought it when it was called orion dino horde but nvm dinos could have more intelligence though
1657	0	a	An F U to people that bought the game
7556	1	a	What every dev should do instead of ditching their games
7558	1	a	This game is Gr8, buy 4 pack for a m8 and use him for b8 this game is under8ed m8... BUY IT
7560	1	a	Oi m8 we thinkin about getin Orion:Prelude eh? Would giv a 4/20 m8 rele noice. Dont play on that ♥♥♥♥in potato though m8
7562	1	a	gr8 b8 m8 i r8 it 8/8 no h8 cuz im l8 but w8 im only 8
7564	1	a	after 2400 hours+ i have to say that this is the best videogame to ever exist.
7566	1	a	ITS VERY GOOD!!!!!!!!!1  but please its too slow and laggy no servers ... kind of, its really badass to quickscope sum dinos in the head  i really recomend it btw its cheap
7568	1	a	Cheap/10
7570	1	a	This game......THIS GAME doesnt need a frickin review. its got thousands of those. THIS GAME doesnt need fixing, or a story, or just about dang anything. THIS GAME IS BADASS. you will play it. you will play it some more. you play it for 9 hours in a single sitting. but most of all...you will play it, and YOU. WILL. LOVE. IT.
7572	1	a	not worth the dollar unless yourcanadian then your dollar isnt worth ♥♥♥♥
7574	1	a	An exquisite, meticulously-crafted dinosaur survival game that surpasses the quality of gameplay of ARK: Survival Evolved. Also conveniently has a diluted price and can run on a mediocre graphics card.
1662	0	a	It was said to be a bad game, and it improved over the time. Better graphics and such. But i still think the graphics suck( I have it at max everthing for graphics) FPS sucks ( Turned everything to the minimum for this, and I have a very good pc) So, I belive in my perspective that this game still sucks.
7576	1	a	&gt;gets T-rex egg &gt;Chased by T-rex and spinosaurus &gt;Hides in bike shed &gt;They try to lure me out with promise of friendship &gt;Fall for it &gt;gets eaten &gt;respawns &gt;grabs egg &gt;wins game &gt;T-rex ragequits
7578	1	a	You have a gun. You shoot Dinosaurs. Why? Because you have a gun. And there are Dinosaurs. Dinosaurs. That's all that really needs saying.
1663	0	a	I fell for the trailer and the reviews. I thought it was a really good game. Then when I started playing it, I had the worst lagg (probably bc of the lack of servers) altough there where like, 20 people playing this game worldwide. I didnt know what to do, there was no information anywhere, and the graphics sucked, so no I dont recommend this game.
7580	1	a	the framereate is jumpy and you cant tell whats going on half the time. its a good idea but it needs work i only recomend because i want others to see this games potential.
7582	1	a	Super fun for the money and lots of content.
7584	1	a	Knifed a T-Rex in the ♥♥♥ Would reccomend
7586	1	a	This game was totally worth the $0.99 when it was on sale. This game brought in future technology and mixed it in with dinosaurs. Its very cool becuase you get to fly around in a jetpack shooting dinosaurs in the face. I would rate this 7/10.
7588	1	a	is cool has big dinosaurs has flying dinosaurs has robos pew pew and lazer gunz pew
1665	0	a	no..... you still failed IT IS STILL A PRETTY BAD GAME Its not bad in graphic support but... THE DINOSAURS FTW????!!!! they glitch like s**t! and when the velociraptors stand still... the head is showing up 90° looks just like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ guy who saw an airplane for the first time but its not very bad... fix the glitches plz... then its 10/10
1666	0	a	DO NOT LISTEN TO THE LATEST PUBLICITY CAMPAIGN STATING THAT THIS IS A FIXED GAME. THIS IS POSSIBLY THE WORST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED. IT TAKES AGES TO GET INTO A GAME AND WHEN YOU DO YOU MAY AS WELL BE TRYING TO STICK LEGO TO CAT TURD. AWFUL
7590	1	a	Logged in didnt know what to expect so i just played a solo survival start mowing through dinos then all sudden trex appears and eats me 10/10 would become trex crap again
7592	1	a	Jesus christ ! Only a dollar ?! You guys need to increase the price :\
7594	1	a	Jetpacked to a mountain and watched them die    11/10 Would be a Traitor again
1668	0	a	You got caught stealing but instead of manning up and admitting you tried to play the victim.   You have managed to get a large majority of gamers to side with Activision, one of the most hated publishers...  BRAVO!  I hate activision as much the next guy, probably more, but you sir, is truly despicable and I am ashamed to have this bag of stolen assets in my game library.
1669	0	a	i would rather have my virtebrae remouved to suck my own ♥♥♥♥ then to pay $0.56 for this peice of ♥♥♥♥
7596	1	a	11/10
7598	1	a	*F+3* 'Where my dogs at man? Where my medic dogs at man?!'  10/10
7600	1	a	my honest review:  + the price! it's only 0,99€ if you like FPS by 1% u should 100% buy! + fun, fun, fun + just good ol' FPS Action - no story + basically the multiplayer game u wanted after Turok came out + a lot of upgrades to buy from credits you earn by shooting dinos (weapons, class upgrades, various gear, etc...) + Coop + lots of players play all the time + you can kill and play dinosaurs and also a T-Rex, and it's for a buck (in sale under a half buck!) SO WHAT THE F ARE U WAITING FO? TUROK?! + jetpacks + dinos + jetpacks &amp; dinos + jetpacks &amp; dinos for under a buck   - with graphics all on High the game doesn't look like in the videos - graphic is more than outdated - ingame communications?! (only a text chat, which looks worse than worse) - microtransactions for better gear not only cosmetics - not only the graphic also the gameplay mechanics are kinda outdated, for example the dino 'physics' are just 'not there' ^^ - basically no atmosphere -&gt; just action (i hoped for a little 'crouching-in-the-bushes-hunting-t-rex-creepy-atmosphere')
7602	1	a	♥♥♥♥♥♥ Optimization(for my pc anyway) but decent game.
1670	0	a	I spent 10$ gifting this to all my friends and it turns out to be free. 0/10 wouldnt gift again
7604	1	a	this game is good
1671	0	a	was fun till i ran into the halloween and christmass map and yelled 'NO!! I BOUGHT A KIDS GAME!!!'
1672	0	a	It runs like s@it it's boaring  and grapfics arend even that good
1673	0	a	Well..It's a cool game and very cheap tho,but i found alot of bugs like kicking me out of the game at the end of the match and loosing the xp i got. FIX IT PLEASE ! ALSO I SPENT A ♥♥♥♥ING DOLLAR ON IT NOW ITS FREE -.-
7606	1	a	Rolled away from a raptor and right into the T-Rex's mouth. Got eaten immediately and thrown across the map.   10/10
7608	1	a	this has been the best sence d dino day 
7610	1	a	Metacritic is wrong. Now with all the updates this game is a very cool horde game. It's very fun to play with friends.
1679	0	a	My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.' I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.
7612	1	a	For $0.89 this game is a solid choice for anyone looking for a game that is good to kill time also not P2W so thats a plus.
7614	1	a	I played this game so much that it didnt even start.
7616	1	a	I don't have this game and i can write a review for it so horray.
7618	1	a	If they could just smooth out some of the gameplay the way it is, the game itself would be fun. RIght now it's too clunky, gets very frustraiting in the higher level waves when you can't move appropriatly. Otherwise I'm looking forward to seeing how this game shapes up!
1685	0	a	Bad overall
1686	0	a	This game could've been amazing. It's not.
7620	1	a	Nice game me and my friends love it, good job developers!!!!
7622	1	a	If you don't have one or more buddys to play with, this may not be worth your dollar. But if you have people to play with, this game is actually really damn fun. I mean, yeah it's kind of trashy and after a while it will probably get too repetitive to play kind of 'actively' but it costs just a dollar. So if you have one or more co-op buddy/s, grab a dollar and enjoy the best game on Steam that you can get for this price.
7624	1	a	Got it about a year ago. Looked cool but never played it. Played this week because why not. Spent 31 minutes solo. Had more fun than playing fallout 4 last week.  10/10 would buy again.  #MakeDinosaursGreatAgain
1688	0	a	'Still Garbage'-Chrisg16  “Orion: Dino Horde, in it's current form, is one of the best co-operative games to play with your friends around. I strongly recommend you try this game at the next f2p session that is offered.  10 – Community Review   “It wasn't until recently that I bothered to try the revamped expansion/remake that is the current incarnation of the game and I have to say it has improved from what I would consider a 3.5 to an 8.  8 – Community Review   “The developers stuck with their first game. 14 months after the game's initial release, I played Orion. I love the game. I will probably put more hours into this game than I typically do with AAA games.  10 – Community Review
7626	1	a	This is one of the greatest multiplayer games to play on steam. I've been playing with my friends through skype for a few days now and it just keeps getting more addictive. It's made with the Unreal Engine so it's perfect :D. I will always love this game ;-;
7628	1	a	blew dinosaur bits everywhere with helicopter rockets, 9/10
7630	1	a	This is a really good game. Hitler approves.
7632	1	a	Went in with honestly not high hopes, totally blew my mind it was actually quite enjoyable, definetly gonna buy it
1690	0	a	i really gave this game a try.. expecially due to the high amount of positive reviews. But in the end.. i couldnt get a single game to actually work.  Its lagging that much, that the game is simply unplayable. The maps are poorly designed. The AI is ultra stupid. There is in ingame shop. The game feels unfinished in pretty much every aspect (engine, AI, maps, HUD, controls etc etc). Nothing is actually 'smooth'.  IMO the game is not even worth the 1$ it costs right now.
7634	1	a	No game is bad for a dollar
7636	1	a	This game is pretty underrated. I enjoyed this a lot more then I thought I would have with my friends. Best to play with friends so you can scream at each other when a TREX comes out of no where.
1692	0	a	really bad game
1693	0	a	I would not recommend you waste $1 on this game lol
7638	1	a	ok dude so the game is all like badly made lagy glitchy man but its a cool game like take on dinosours like call of duty but with dinosours and fels like planetside 2 lots of game modes nice laidback communty not to many kids but i gota diss this man cuase my pc specs arnt makeing this lag but im dissing it not cuse the lag just cuase despite the fact i came into this game and never once failed to kick ♥♥♥ therse one major drawback in this game i cant overlook in this review   POTHEADS VS DINOSOURS nothing aobut that should ever happen  it about a  7/10 due to poor quailty codeing and genral game build  for demonknight gameing and potheads everwhere this is X_Dk_Green_Jesus_  Note: Would Buy Again If It Becomes A Series Possably   * STONER APPROVED GAME *  REVIEW IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE DURING FURTHER GAMEPLAY
1696	0	a	Don't get I already had it, but its making me pay because of the update. DONT GET IT ITS BS
1697	0	a	Hahaha, this is hilariously bad. I mean for a game it's lacking so much. It feels more like a mod that is still deep in beta. The ratings are pretty accurate here. I won't say that you'd be hurting too much getting this for $1.00 but I don't recommend getting this for it's full $15 price. It was atleast humurous to play but I don't think I'd be getting in it again anytime soon.   Revelations 2012/ Bioshock infinite
1698	0	a	This game is worth the 99 cents I paid for it. The graphics are alright not great but not crappy either but the gameplay is really laggy, slow and feels overall not good. The game really isn't even that fun you just walk around and shoot at things that run at you and its not even hard. Overall I would not reccomend this game I only bought it because it was 99 cents.
7640	1	a	If you think that there are dinosaurs in battlefield then this game is for you
1700	0	a	I bought this game on a whim. That and it was 1 dollar. I managed to play enough to fulfill that 1 dollar but at face value it would not be worth it.  Why? For a game that is supposed to gone from a 3 to an 8 it feels like there are still numerous issues that have yet to be dealt with. For one, the issue with trying to join in a server and it doesn't work. There are times when joining a server crashes the game altogether.  Gameplay-wise I find that being eaten by a large dinosaur is a bit redundant due to the fact that you have a gun. Seriously, get eaten, blow the dinosaur's insides out with bullets or go kamikazi with a grenade and BAM! dead dinosaur. But the game says that's impossible.  Music is okay, can't complain about that.  Announcer voice seems to be a bit funky here and there when trying to announce things but otherwise not worth adding or removing points.  Overall, it's an okay game if you buy it bargain-bin(Around $0.99) but as a full game there are better games out there. 7/10.
7642	1	a	Great game, don't be put off by the metacritic score. It's fast-paced, loads of fun and does a good job of tying RPG-style progression into a sandbox FPS shooter. Vehicles were fun too. Absolute carnage with sci-fi and dinosaurs, you can't go wrong.
7644	1	a	best 99 cents i have spent :)  good game! love how u can customise your character. when you play solo maybe 2 or 3 bots to help out could be good. but whateves. fun game ! awesome idea for a game hehe !
7646	1	a	This game is really cool and it is being updated constantly and soon they will be making a whole new better version of these game in replacement of this which will be cool. It is totally worth the price and expecially now since it is $1. Only problem i see in this game is the lack of open servers and some weird animations with taunts and walking, having your torso move and not your uper body, but that doesnt impact the game at all.
1704	0	a	This Is The Worst Co-Op Game I've Ever Played.
7648	1	a	Halo totally ripped off of this masterpiece of a game, sad to see sell outs these days. Play the original FPS Orion: Dino Horde today 10/10 must buy
1705	0	a	No manual, no tutorial. Even a mouse-like dinosuar could take you down, (before you find it).
1706	0	a	This is an unfinished game. The animations for characters, player view models, and dinosaurs are lazily done. For instance, the pistol equip animation doesn't sync with the pistol itself; the pistol will be in idle position a good half-second before the hands are fully out there. The gameplay is shallow, since it's basically 'kill dinosaurs with no real impact with their attacks' then 'buy one upgrade' and rinse, repeat.
7650	1	a	This game is fun if you like killing dinosaurs and the game kinda reminds me of halo with dinosaurs the metascore is off.
7652	1	a	this is rellay cool
1708	0	a	So i recently come upon this game think 'Holy crap im going to be able to like rpe some fckin dinosaurs. So I had to make a choice to rather get food for my family, or play as motherfckin dinosaurs and let my family play a couple times. So I decided to buy Orion Dino Horde. At first I was like, holy fricken jesus look at the small dinosaurs that just horde the generator, screw orion dino horde, it should be dinosaurs like to orion the generator with a horde. While I play, I let my friend Anne Frank play for a while, she said 'lulz i gve it 0/7, bt il be bck, im goin to gt baked' so i assumed she ment going to the sauna because that game was amazingly optimized but instead she climbed in the oven and left me a note saying 'lulz, il nver be an mlg orion dino horde player lik u'. I said aw, you really think im that good? Of course she didn't respond because the game was sooo good it made her kill herself. So then I thought, if im really that good, ill need other people to tell me that. So I got a buddy of mine named Lorenzo who was healthy and young. After he was done he said 'lulz hld on polp, i ned to seee mi parnts bcuse lulz' I was so confused so I waited and a week later I go to his house and hes all 'U DID DIS TOO ME' and I ran and talked to Lorenzos dad and he said, 'lulz dat fagot got ALD from somedinhg clled Dino Beatdown'. I got really scared and left. 2 years later i go back to his house and he is now hooked to a respirator and a suculant incubator. Thats when I realized something, that game gave him ALD. So I let him play it one more time for good old times and he said '.-.. ..- .-.. --.. / ..-. .- --. --- - / ---.. -..-. ---..' thats in morse code, so that means 'lulz fagot 8/8'. I really couldn't believe how Mlg I was at this game. But then that made me think, one person who played this game killed herself, and the other onee got ALD from it and only enjoyed it when he was paralyzed, blind, deaf, and could only move his hands. So finally, my review on this game is that you rather have to be MLG like me John Motherphockin Sorcerer Polp, or you die and get ALD from it. It was worth buying this game then giving my family food. Lulz i give this game 1/8, would not get noscoped by dinosaurs again.
7654	1	a	One of the best multiplayer experience I've ever had.
7656	1	a	Great game for only $0.99
7658	1	a	For $ .99 This is Worth the Buy!
7660	1	a	Great game, but a bit pricy
1710	0	a	.
7662	1	a	cheap but verry good
7664	1	a	It is the coolest games. It is like a advanced version of Primal Carnage although I still like Primal Carnage
7666	1	a	this game gave me the biggest dino boner must have
7668	1	a	Me and this game; #Besties.
1711	0	a	Sucks... Fun but gets boring
7670	1	a	Got headbutted by a T-Rex so hard that my Tank exploded. As I flew through the air dead I picked off another Dino, came back to life, and jetpacked up shotgunning Pterodactyls as I flew up. I then got mauled to death by a pack of Tiny Dinos that I couldn't hit. My only hope is that Jurrassic Park 4 is as good as this game.  TLDR;  10/10 would cause Extinction again
7672	1	a	Dont listen to anyone who thinks this game is garbage, this is the best indie game out there
7674	1	a	THIS GAME IS THE SHIIIIIIT  GO BUY IT NOW ITS WORTH YOUR MONEY, IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME GO PLAY THE FREE TRIAL
7676	1	a	Amazing, amazing, totally worth it! Great graphics ( I dont think the critics like shooters anyways!) Lots of weapons, intense, and lots of combat action. With the control of 10 dinosaurs and 3 humans with hundreds of skins and dressups. It makes it even better, it's a pure action game.   'Crushing thriller, action game!'
7678	1	a	This game is awesome relatively fun while disregarding it's initial Metascore. It's very simple as in repairing your power generator and securing an objective but hell you get to kill dinosaurs with Mech's and air ships that can literally kill anything at a moderate speed.  Although it can be repetitive more often than not but it's well worth the $.99 buy.  7/10
7680	1	a	Great game. It's alot of fun, and it looks great. The combat is fluent, and overall the animations hold up, though some are a bt wonky. A bit of warning ahead of time: It runs like ♥♥♥ on lower-end computers, so you might have to sacrafice some graphical settings it you don't have the best P.C.
7682	1	a	much improved dont read into older scores, the game was redone.
7684	1	a	Great fun for fps/sci-fi game lovers, very addictive, lots of stuff to it :) and giant triceratops :D To sum it all up its basically killing floor with dinosaurs
7686	1	a	You can pistol-whip a Stegosaurus, would recommend.
1712	0	a	It's killing floor, with dinosaurs.
1713	0	a	i bought the game and now i don't have it anymore WTF
7688	1	a	its fun but it keep's crashing when i try to get on a sever but i love this game reyminds me of a game i played whith my dad a long time ago  
7690	1	a	Fun with friends
7692	1	a	This game is so bad its good... but only when the sale is 90% or better.
7694	1	a	Totally worth $1.50 Developers really polished up this game well.
7696	1	a	Great game with friends, 10/10 would recommend, it never gets old shooting velociraptors and triceratops' into oblivion.
7698	1	a	Does everyone own this game or something?
7700	1	a	Nice game with low price :)  8/10, I like mp mode cause it funny if play with friends. Using bazooka and K-Boom xD
7702	1	a	sooo worth it if u have a friend to play whit its just rly awsome game i strongly recomend it :D
7704	1	a	This is a really fun game. Its a wave based FPS that has you and other players shooting Dinosaurs. You don't really get to see that in a game formated like this. The weapon selection is good and the controls work fine, however if you are on a lower end or dying PC you may have to turn the graphics down by a significant ammount. Not to meantion that no one really plays this game! Its only $0.99. This game is well worth your time and could use support for servers. This game gets an 8/10
7706	1	a	When ever those ♥♥♥♥ing gigantic titan Dinos are like right on you and suddently in your face it juts makes me freak the ♥♥♥♥ out and i start shaking and ♥♥♥♥ O_O
7708	1	a	If you like dinosaurs, you will love this game. With a few friends this game is a blast!   AND YOU CAN PLAY AS A MEGASUPERAWESOME DINOSAUR!!    
7710	1	a	never played it but it let me do this
1715	0	a	its sad that ppl are acutally create this games  bad Graphics No alot of guns  I aucttaly think that its no worth 1 $ its should be Free to play dont waste 1 $ for it i no like it!
7712	1	a	It's like Skyrim without dragons plus dino's and guns! 8/8 m8
1717	0	a	You could actually have more fun just going to the restroom
1718	0	a	played the game fo about 2 hours get bored cant get my money back tried to refund cant get the refund cuz of 20 minutes to much damn this game my money real good
1719	0	a	I bought this game on my laptop and it ran fine on the lowest settings and now I have a pc, And putting the game on low to med settings it will still lag, I dont understand this, on my laptop I have a gefirce 610m 2GB and on my pc I have a GTX 750ti which is far supirior, I would like to recomend this game but it runs like ♥♥♥♥, well the way it is optimized.] Apart from the graphics the gameplay is alot of fun, no servers but solo is alot of fun with bots. I can tell it is sort of like halo and dinosausrs together.  The controller mapping works great, not sure about keyboard. (didnt try) Overall I would not recomend as it runs very porly so unless this is fixed I cant recomend.
1720	0	a	Is there any way I can refund this game? It's WAY too laggy
7714	1	a	I have had more fun with this game than I have most budget titles, highly reccomend
1721	0	a	I bought the game for my 'team' ( 3 very close people), and we heavy relly on coop, but this was like a time-travel; this is was a a great game, for a game dated about 20 years ago.  I know, it cost like a bus ticket, but it was an awfull hipster trip.
1722	0	a	I'm sorry.   I know it's only a buck.   But it is not very enjoyable.   Especially when there are free games that are more fun. Seriously.   I gave it a shot.   Cost me a buck.   But I don't think this was worth the download.   Sorry.
1723	0	a	I could have spent the one euro on a coke or something. I knew this was bad, but this game puts the word bad in a new dimension of bad. Like shaving your beard with a kitchenknife kinda bad. This game hurts right in my feels. But I was stupid enough to even buy it to begin with.
7716	1	a	One of the absolute worst game I have ever played. Missing animations all over the place, and those that aren't are stiff as hell. Taht being said, I payed $0.99 for this, and I have had so much fun making fun of it and laughing with my friend. Great concept, horrible execution.
1724	0	a	I didn't want to buy this game...  ...but hey it was 99 cents!
7718	1	a	for a 1$ its worth it , i have fun with this as much as i do with killing floor. 'which is a time waster game when your bored' this isnt a game you play for 4 hour straight , but a hour of fun once and a while is fine, just like killing floor
7720	1	a	ORION: Prelude in one word is Nazi Zombies (from Call of Duty) with Dinosaurs! What could get more awesome than that! The game builds off the (slightly overused) you are doomed! Make a last stand and survive as long as you can kind of thing. You start with nothing but a pistol and your class ability and as you kill dinosaurs you earn credits which can be used to purchase weapons and augments which upgrade your character! (Sounds familiar, right?)   The game also features versus modes but because of how few people play versus I was never able to find a game to join which means I am therefore unable to review the versus and will not be including it in my final score.  A major thing to point out is that the game is full of bugs, I often found myself being headbutted by a dinosaur before being sent flying over half a kilometre, then face first into a rocky cliff and I would penetrate the wall and be stuck inside the cliff. Another common bug for me was driving through any sort of water in a a vehicle, and I would fall under the map, unable to move and forever falling I had to quit out of several matches because of this.   Final Score = 7.5/10 
7722	1	a	Experts have suggested that staying home and playing Orion:Prelude keeps you safe from the two contained Americans with Ebola in the United States. It's also proven to keep you away from actual threats, like the flu, ad Mormons.  Stay safe, play games, and only go outside when there are hardly any people around, because human contact is the major killer.
1726	0	a	this gamne is terrible it has a bugg that makes it unplayable where you spin uncotrolably
1727	0	a	There is only one time when you play a game for the first time. This game seems to not understand that.
1728	0	a	Tried for a solid 20 minutes to join a game. Got jack ♥♥♥♥.  Broken game, don't buy.
1729	0	a	Don't be misled by the other reviews, this game is an unfinished piece of garbage. This 'game' is exactly the same as Dino Beatdown, and makes no attempt to hide it, as it still goes under the same name in the game files. The game itself looks absolutely nothing like a 2012 release, with shoddy textures, extremely low-polycount models and very natural selection type gameplay. As if it couldn't get any worse, the game also features a cosmetics shop, stocked with low-effort reskins and glaringly bright armour colours.  Overall verdict: This game is ♥♥♥♥. If you want giant monsters, strategy and sci-fi themes, go play Natural Selection 2. I'm glad I saved myself 99p by playing it free.
7724	1	a	It's really fun with friends, but pretty boring alone. Lots of stuff you have to pay for but overall great game for $1.
1731	0	a	6/10 I'll play it only when friends are playing and I'm glad I only paid 99 cents. Really weird collision detection, hitboxes, dinos can do a zero G turn like a snapper lawn mower, game crashed on my first launch, and I've encountered several bugs during my first few hours. One bug being people were freely able to join into my 'Friends Only' game. Still fun to play with friends.
1732	0	a	It is pretty funny, I'll give it that.
7726	1	a	EDIT:  So far, Orion: Prelude has not been that laggy. The menu is still a little sluggish, but the game seems to run fine. I will probably re-start playing this now.  Old review: It's a fun game. It can get kinda laggy for me sometimes, but it's not that bad and you get used to it.
7728	1	a	Hey, this is a really good game.
7730	1	a	Looking Forward to more Improvments. Cool Game. Good cheap fun, best with friends.
7732	1	a	This game is fun to play with friends, and in summary I give it a 7.5/10. The only game-breaking thing I've encountered are the two most annoying enemies in video game history. Spitting dinosaurs that take forever to kill, and pterodactyls similar to rakks in Borderlands, but can grab you and 1-hit KO you. Buy this on a sale, not for full price.  ==============EDIT 4/1/15============== They fixed the annoying enemies (birds are still annoying when in the helicopter, but that's understandable), and generally made the game much better! They give you $20 of credit to customize your character at the start, which is great. The game looks and feels much better since I've last played it. Servers are a tiny bit glitchy but not too glitchy to become annoying.  9/10 great fun with friends.
7734	1	a	meh. It isnt the most fun game I have ever played but it defently wasnt the worst. The gameplay is pretty straight forward (shoot anything that moves) but that isnt a bad thing. Its simple easy gameplay that can be picked up in a second. Thats what I like about this game....Now for the bad....not much I can find so far except the combat (even though I do like the simplicity) gets dull and boreing to me atleats after a while. Aim, click and shoot and thats the game. Id give it a solid 7.9 out of 10
1734	0	a	I've got it 2012 for 10€... Yeah, I'd like a hug right now. :'(  Oh? My hours played? Yea. my steam bugged all the day, and back in 2012 the game didn't wanted to be closed. I mean, steam thought the game was open and counted the hours.  If you ever wanted to buy this game, do not. Spend that 1,00 for whatever you like. Some candys whatever. Get something food or water for it, idc, BUT, do something usefull with it.  You can thank me later. Cya
1735	0	a	Not worth a dollar Gameplay is boring Guns don't recoil properly all around a pretty lame game
1736	0	a	{This is for mac players} Its fun i tried it but it aint mac supported....
1737	0	a	A good try at a game but it falls short in most areas. The combat is iffy and the controls feel weird. The concepts are all there but it is just missing something. It has many multiplayer aspects which can be fun but all fall short of amazing.  Personal Rating: 4/10
1738	0	a	This game is absolute ♥♥♥♥. The sounds, AI, and overall the total game is really bad. The AI just runs in circles, along the main route, or just straight at you until it kills you.  I've asked so many times for a refund, and been ignored every time. When I bought this, I noticed that none of my friends have played longer than ~1 hour. Now I see why.  Please, just don't buy it. It's really awful.
1739	0	a	Got a weapon, dinosaur ate my brains out. I thought my life over for a few hours after that.
7736	1	a	A fun game to play with friends!
7738	1	a	How to play this game: 1:Start the game. 2:Try to join an online lobby 3:Fail 4:Start single player 5:Shoot Dinosaurs 6:Buy new ♥♥♥♥ 7:Get bored after 3-4 games 8:Pick it up again when you're bored just to have some quick fun, and waste some time 9:Repeat Did I mention it only costs a dollar?
7740	1	a	Its Halo and Borderlands in a nutshell
1741	0	a	jumped on a car and got launched across the map
7742	1	a	FIrst spawn, run to a chopper looking thingy and proceed to shoot a T-Rex with missles while everyone on the ground gets eaten... my $1 was well spent in the first 2 minutes alone!
7744	1	a	this cost me 99cents i bought ark for thirty bucks this one for a buck minus a cent is more fun i love people because Jesus loves me
7746	1	a	Its Awesome primal rampage
1743	0	a	Did not really dig this game as much as I thought I would. Did not play well, bad clips all over and not very visually pleasing either.
1744	0	a	No dont get this game this is a wast of time and money this game will not let you play it and worst game ever in history and never should have been invented in the first place screw this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1745	0	a	Quite stupid. It could have had much more variety.
7748	1	a	not bad game but i dont know why its little lagy for me maybe my pc suck,dunno. 3 words- BUY THE GAME (if you are nolifer)
7750	1	a	- Every map is the same except for different tree placements - There is no variety in weapons - Night maps ARENT AT NIGHT - Enemies spawn in between waves - The UI is painfully bad  11/10 Would reccomend.
7752	1	a	Only played for a few seconds, already better than Ark Survivor 10/10 ;)
1746	0	a	runs badly on windows 7 (i got windows 8 still laggy)
7754	1	a	Easily one of the best games ever made, hands down
7756	1	a	not bad at all.
1747	0	a	Intersting concept, but not very polished.
1748	0	a	its super slow to connect to servers, even EA's servers are way better tha this game's servers. (i have good internet)
7758	1	a	Truly stunning. Great game I deffentaly suggest it. Worth the money
1749	0	a	Really bad attempt to make a decent 'horde' mode game which is all this game has to offer with graphics from the 90's.
1750	0	a	Buggs And Bad Graphics !
1751	0	a	garbage game, not worth 99cents
7760	1	a	But ♥♥♥♥, it was 99 cents.
1754	0	a	I played it for 30 minutes it was okay glitchy but okay, later I turned the game off and now as soon as I start the game it won't boot it just stays running and now I can't get my refund :)
7762	1	a	Yes it's worth 1 dollar.
1755	0	a	
7764	1	a	Lot of fun with friends 8.5/10
7766	1	a	really good game. it helps alot of people. it helped amanda todd find bleach. (the anime)
7768	1	a	A fun game to play. Doesn't need crazy skills but teamwork is indeed needed sometimes. Has interesting game modes with most of the games on the edge. Plus is not expensive and can run on every pc.
1758	0	a	is a bs game was tricked into buying the game. it was on sale for a dollar when the main price was 15.99 so i was like cool what a deal bought the four pack and the next day it was 1.99 all the time, would never have bought this game if it would have been a dollar all the time was looking forward it being 15.99 so i could trade it on cs lounge or use it to my advantagfe at a later date but the game bombed and was a scam as soon as it was put to 1.99.
7770	1	a	Oh come on a stupid dollar game probably pixel is taunting me to play it. Dang just had to buy it not even knowing what it was. ok lets boot it up ok and BOOOOMMMM thats when it changed my mind! Epic Game for a dollar get it and you will have fun!
1759	0	a	i cant open lobby why help pleas 
1760	0	a	Yeah 0,99€ Is still to much for this shity game!
1761	0	a	To be honest this game is good when it is known as ORION: DINO ( open beta ) but now after its open beta , the graphics of the game is totally like ♥♥♥♥ and lag much more worst if you are connecting to europe server
7772	1	a	BUY THIS GAME! Its always cheap enough that you always get your moneys worth and more! i had 13 hours of fun in 2 days and kind of got bored. BUT! Its a great game!
1763	0	a	1. Pull up options, cuz my computer's a potato. 2. Disable a majority of video settings 3. Set quality to low. 4. Try to play. 5. All I see is white 6. Reset settings. 7. Click Save 8. Crashed.  1.69/10
1764	0	a	uhhh. dafuq is this halo/cod zombie remake?
7774	1	a	Buy it now for Free 99
7776	1	a	Get 30 fps with a gaming laptop, kden
1765	0	a	Yellow its me    So pretty much this game is so bad its good. I had wanted to purchase it before when it wasnt f2p but when it came out i was psyched. I played this for 40 mins and had to stop because it couldnt connect to server. Its addicting in a weird type of way. Its pretty good besides the fact that it lags when i have an i7 and nvidia gtx 960 so yeah...        bai      r8 5/8
1766	0	a	Audio clips for the guns and everything sound terrible or sound like they've been ripped from another game, graphics look like dog ♥♥♥♥. Glad I didnt pay 99 cents because it wasnt worth it. 0.1/10
7778	1	a	still 10/10 for 50 cents
1767	0	a	Give me my euro back!
1768	0	a	TL;DR: Fun for the first hour or two, but was controversial, and is unoptimized, even after more than 3 years of development.  So this game has been the subject of plenty of controversy for over 3 years. Released multiple times with different names such as Orion: Dino Beatdown and Orion: Dino Horde. Then it was also part of another controversy as far as theft of assets. But let's get off that and into the actual game.  You basically survive wave after wave of killing dinosaurs, while completing the occasional objective or two as the match goes on. You can do this on your own, but it's usually more fun to play with people. It's rather fun, if you like having no challenge, as dinosaurs can easily be unable to get to spots on many of the maps, making it easy to exploit them. This is because of how easy it is to get to some places with the Assault's jetpack, but even then, you wouldn't have too many issues with the normal dinos if you were another class, due to how horrid the AI is. The flying dinosaurs are hardly any issue either, as they don't take too much to kill. This effectively drives any fun in the game extinct unless you like potshotting giant reptiles.  I had some fun with this game, worth the 1 dollar I spent on it, but to be quite honest, I have no faith in the devs at this point, and I doubt this game is going to become much better at all, as much of an unoptimized mess that it is.  But hey, now you can kill derp dinos for free.  You'll get some fun out of it, but don't expect too much more than what you get in perhaps the first hour or two of playing.
7780	1	a	WOW. Value for money is an understatement for this game. This game is worth about £12/$15 or maybe more but you can get it for £0.79/$1 or less (during sales) Also 15 DIFFERENT gamemodes !!!!!! What!!!!!!! For $1 !!!!! Oh my!!!!!!! Bottom line is definitely worth it. Trust me.  UPDATE: Now free to play, where's my money
7782	1	a	Very good game, I bought it years ago, it went Free to Play, I don't mind, really, if it didn't I would never have played it again with friends, so here's a summary of good and bad things about it.   The good :  + Lots of skills + Lots of different weapons to choose from + Really fun and all +   MOTHERF*CKING DINOSAURS   + The addition of PvP with playable dinosaur was a god damn great idea + Different classes with very different styles available + Runs greatly on every PC ever, really, if it doesn't work blame your PC and moreover what you installed on it   The bad : - I do not understand Melee :C - What the actual ♥♥♥♥ is going on ? - OH MY GOD IT'S A ♥♥♥♥ING T-REX !  Welp, that's it, I don't have much to say about it, see you later on Orion ! :3
7784	1	a	I play this game is not to good but funn if i bored that i is when i don t' do. and i say this too hunk da trunk and right this for da good! so that you see this and tink that this game is good-becus it are fgood for the price it has on the game you buy for little price and when i say that i meen this game and not otehr game becaus i tell yo u its good forr only its price not more because it need mor to doo. i am not scuuby so me dont solv this case easy like them crew that he in so i only say this from my heart and brain not from sience or other sorcec like math, and otter stuff like cemistry and other that i think not of now that. i only whant to say this for not longningn this review forr too lon....
7786	1	a	Great F2P Game.
7788	1	a	It's free now so cool but i spent like $0.75 a few months ago.  Good game, but yeah like i need money (that bad i know) so i refunded it yeah cool
7790	1	a	Dragons and cool ♥♥♥♥. Never played tho
7792	1	a	I enjoyed it when it was a free game for a while then it ran out of its freeness and i realy want it so if someone would be generous to gift me this game then that would be amazing! I do understand its only one dollar but steam is being glitchy and wont let me get it.
7794	1	a	I never wanted to kill dinosaurs with a bow and arrow. Until now.
7796	1	a	At time of writing this i only have 2.7 hrs of gameplay, but that was with my friends, i bought it for all of them and we had an awesome session. the graphics are good, the gameplay is daft but fun, and quite frankly unlike almost every other recent review, i dont care if some of the assets were stolen or not, it looks good, plays good!  Well done DEV, keep up the good work!  Try it, its cheap, in fact get the 4 pack, and have fun with your mates, you wont regret it!
7798	1	a	This game is amazing fun. If you enjoy action games and dinosaurs. Then this game is for you! The fighting is just non stop and although the re-spawn times are quite long the game is still really enjoyable!  I recommend this game!
7800	1	a	Prelude sounds like Pre-lube, hilarious and brilliant. 10/10
7802	1	a	It's like being a kid in the 90's that's playing with thier toys. Cheap plastic figures that are a blast to play with. And online is still alive.  dinosaurs remain......dinosaurs remain........  good times.  I understand that a game can't be for everyone, and if you feel like you wasted a dollar so be it (waah-waah). But those that got this for free and complain about it, stfu....make a better game....and send it to me for free. Then you can show the obvious imperfections of this game and how to make them better while still being a fun game. K? thnx ;)
7804	1	a	Not bad of a game. I actually had a ton of fun playing this with my friends. Hopefully some nice updates come out fixing a few bugs, and updating some sounds and effects to make it look even better.
7806	1	a	Omyyygawwshhhh! Super Duper Omega addictive! It's fun, Kewlll, worth the price considering it only cost 3 bucks!
7808	1	a	This game is stupid fun, lots of maps, gamemodes, etc. Driving in a buggy running from a T-Rex while your buddy shoots at it with a turret? Nuff said Definitely worth the asking price of $14.99
1774	0	a	Cancer.
7810	1	a	Good/Bad All I can say. There are pros and cons. Mechanics are ok. Graphics could use some work. Game needs to include a better chat system as well as an in game speach system. Overall it is fun. I recommend the lightsaber duels. :)
7812	1	a	did you guys take down all the multiplayer? i cant find any servers, and i cant host my own
1777	0	a	  Is this game 0,99 cents? This game should have been free, or even better you should be paid 0,99 cents for each minute you play in this mind numbing game. I played for 50 minutes and i feel like throwing up. The driving is awful and the weapons seem to go right through your hand. The only positive aspect of this game is that it made me rethink my life choices. I rate it a solid 2/10.
1778	0	a	very boring dont buy it
7814	1	a	The game is, ok. Its cool for about 5-10 hours then it gets old. If you like short, cheesey, repetitive games then u will love this game.
7816	1	a	Sell some crappy CSGO skins and get this game already. Super fun for the cost!
7818	1	a	So, I beat suvival mode by myself with out the useless bots with the starting pistol... this game is broken but worth the 99 cents because it is hours of laughter. GLITCHY DINO MURDER FEST!
7820	1	a	true aids, but good for $1.00
1781	0	a	played again after a year break. game is still empty of players.
7822	1	a	Length of Time Played: 26 minutes Distance Played: Not even 1 game Achievements: None Personal Grade: B+  Opinion of each aspect  Grading System - Based on a five-point rating system (5 = Outstanding, 4 = Good, 3 = Average, 2 = Poor, 1 = Awful)  Gameplay: 4/5 Stability: 5/5 Story: 3/5 Controls: 5/5 Graphics: 5/5 Music: 5/5 Sounds: 5/5 Difficulty: 4/5  Probably would have been an epic first-person shooter, IF my computer wasn't so laggy. I could hardly run it on LOW settings. I recommend this game if you have a beefy computer.
1782	0	a	I paid 1$ for this game. Actual money.  Its being updated pretty frequently but in its current state, I should have bought some ice cream instead.
7824	1	a	I want this game to be free to play pay to win. Then I would play and eventually buy stuff espially if you only start with one class and can level to get new ones or by them with real money.
7826	1	a	SO glad I bought the 4 pack... It is simple, which is all the better for just getting some battle in. However, it is tons of unpretentious fun, none of the blah, blah bits that I usually just want to click through as fast as possible to PLAY (could use some tutorial snippets, though, still haven't figured out what the hack/decker looking thing is about). It's all about the action.   I didn't get into the Halo types of games much, could play for a bit, but, don't need or even really want the big drama story, and it is pretty much the same thing over and over - we're getting attacked, kill the funk out of all attackers, and try not to die too much in the process. This one, we played for 7 hours straight right after buying, and will do again with more friends. The achievements are amusing also, although I am apprehensive about actually acquiring all... it certainly feels like an accomplishment when you kill a T-Rex without assist.   I do wish that the 360 style controller had the mic button (maybe if it was among the programmable options?), that's what I use because I'm used to it, and taking a hand off to press left ALT is not really feasible... But, as the only real complaint in a $1 game, that's pretty impressive.
7828	1	a	This game has a ton of poetential. Its cool, Great physics, easy-to-handle guns, and a good concept, there are bugs and glitches, but what game doesn't have those. Give the game time, and it will grow more and more like it has in the past couple years.
7830	1	a	This is a great underrated fps you should definitely buy it and play it woth friends!
1784	0	a	I'd like to say I recommend the game because I used to love it. But it won't launch for me, this is an issue I also have with Smite so I think it's my graphics card, for the 2 it says it launched as 32bit dx9. That's all I know about the issue. I'd love if this could get fixed because it's a really fun game but I can't actually play it! Edit - Game works on new computer, still a bit boring, gameplay is limited.
7832	1	a	Best nonsensical game of all time?
7834	1	a	  This game is better then the 2end game  and it's fun with friends!!!
1786	0	a	This is literally the worst game I have ever played. Not even worth the download time for its free weekend.
1787	0	a	This game has poor gunplay ,the dinosaurs take almost random amounts of damage, the characters dont start with anything more then a pistol and you have to buy all other guns,When you die you go into a second wind style mode which would be good save for the fact that when you go into this mode ALL OF THE DINOSAURS RUN AWAY FROM YOU makeing it nearly imposable to respawn unless its the start of a new wave. If you wanted m to play a horde shooter i recomend killing floor or if you want a game where you can kill dinosaur-like creatures borderlands 2 also has better gunplay
7836	1	a	I paid 1 $ for it and i still wish i hadnt. It looks fun but when you play it it just sucks. One good thing is its not as bad as COD Ghosts. Get a game like Dark Souls, CS:GO, Borderlands 2 , or even the Stanley Parable is better. 4.5/10
7838	1	a	PLAY FOR TREX ♥♥♥
1788	0	a	Ai is awful, the dinosaurs get stuck on walls. the graphics are on par with an xbox game (no, not a 360, before that) circa red faction 2 era. for all its supposed to tout, the videos make the game look 10 times better. save your dollar. this simply is NOT worth it. even if they give it away for free, still not worth it. so many other interesting games you could play, even free ones. this game is flat, boring and brings NOTHING new to an FPS genre. this game will make you think of what a freshman high school student would show as a computer science project. if you think i feel hurt, i am. i didnt even buy this crap. my friend gave it to me and asked me to play with him. so we did. controls are clunky, and every gun and aspect of this game is nothing but regurgitated crap you have already played many times. this should have just been an extra piece of content in a real game. sort of like how they added 'Zombies' to Call of Duty. dont get me wrong though, CoD sucks too.
1789	0	a	Worst game ever it's a wasting of money. Don't buy it.
1790	0	a	it mite be my pc but the gaem is 2 laggy
7840	1	a	this is a fun addictive shooter with a call of duty zombies and a halo feel. It is definately a must buy because it is only 75p
7842	1	a	This is a great game for dino lovers or people who just want a new kind of FPS.
1792	0	a	I wanted it to be good, but it's clunky, awful looking, cheaply made and not very fun.
7844	1	a	Charming
7846	1	a	Still better than GMod.
1796	0	a	I tried it, I didn't like it. It has... it's... ... I DIDN'T LIKE IT, BUT IT WAS NOT BAD. Just not my cup of tea. Maybe it just didn't make sense to me... or not creative at all? Whatever it is... I'll pass.
7848	1	a	Good for a laugh, and some FUNNY DINOSAURS, that aside, running things over is VERY fun....erm,Yeah, just...there is no ingame selfie option, big minus, and workshop support :() OH NO, NO WORKSHOP! LOL. its very fun sometimes though, very fun.Extremely fun, Duper Super fun. oh, wait, HOW CAN A PTERODACTYLS TEETH EVEN SCRATCH A FUTURISTIC HUGE MASSIVE HELICOPTER!?!?!?
7850	1	a	BEST GAME EVER!Graphics are very good,you can even play the game with an older computer,it works just fine! It's worth the 2 euro i paid for it! And ooh,be carefull it is highly addictive! :DDD
7852	1	a	The best game, I love it. It has it all, 10/10!! Get it, it is worth it.
1801	0	a	this game always crashes
1802	0	a	Biggest pile of.....  Yeah its a cheap game, but ive played played much better free to play games than this trollip. 6 attempts to try and connect to a game, when i finally did game was laggy as anything, internet connection is fine, and running a gtx960 which is more than enough to play this game.  Dont waste your money on this, only worth it for the 6 free badge cards, which if you sell will pay for the game itself.
7854	1	a	this game is the sh*t, buy it now
7856	1	a	This game's amazing. The graphics are good and the style as well. Love it.
7858	1	a	this game suck balls
7860	1	a	I agree with basically everything everyone has saying, the game started out shaky, albeit i still had fun playing it, but Much added content and updates its unreal how much has been added. I vote 7-8 game play, 10/10 for developer, basically showing they care.
1803	0	a	Its free now...thats how ♥♥♥♥ it is
7862	1	a	Bought it on sale for 1 dollar basically. I think this game deserves more credit but...BUT that constant running back and forth between the point you have to protect and the weapon station is a hugeeee pain. Even if you use the teleporter or use vehicle. It's still a hugeeee pain. There's no incenditive for people to play medics because they don't have rocket boost jet, their medic gun needs charge every now and then, and on top of that, the dino seem to be programmed to go after medics. Plus medic doesn't get as much credit as these other units so what the heck, who wants to play medic -.-  anyways, despite that, for 1 dollar, definitely get it. The server system are unstable and there are still bugs that freeze the screen but for 1 dollar, you can't complain. :)
7864	1	a	IT'S NICE GAME
7866	1	a	The blood, sweat and tears put into the creation of this BRAND NEW sequel is true dedication from the best of the best developers...   But the fact it's so ♥♥♥♥ makes it fun!
7868	1	a	I would recommend this game for anyone on a budget whom needs a fun game to last them a while. It's really just a fun, relaxing kill'em all type of game.  Can't go wrong for a Dollar!
7870	1	a	I've never seen such a complete failure of a game turn out to be such a great gameplay treat. It may have taken a near complete rebuild, and it still needs more weapons and such, but damn it's a lot of fun......now anyway.
7872	1	a	I'm Not seen the System Requirements of this 1 dollar game Goddammit,.. I never thought this game Will be like Call of duty System Requirements
7874	1	a	this game is totally awesome i reccomend it for true gamers!!!!!
7876	1	a	I WANT IT
1816	0	a	I thinkt the fact that the creator had to use Imovie to make the trailer says alot about this games budget
7878	1	a	The dino's creep out of no where and just destroy you...  What a game...  Got the four pack for 0.79...  8.5/10 IGM
1817	0	a	This is how you steal assets from another game and claim that assets as yours.  Good way to reduce production money and time.
7880	1	a	Kill Dinos HAHA but overal I really enjoy this game
1818	0	a	I couldn't get the game to work. My beast machine couldn't handle Orion Dino horde.
7882	1	a	Be a Espinosaur and eat your friends     10/10
7884	1	a	I think that ORION: Dino Horde is a pretty decent game with a lot of awesome features. There are a plethora (huge variety) of weapons that can only be found here. The graphics are awesome, though it slows down my computer a bit, but that all changes in the options which make the ORION experience worth every cent.
7886	1	a	Love this game. Buyed it like an year ago, idk why i write this now, but it's just amazing.If you hate dinos and love Halo, this is the game for you.
7888	1	a	This game Good but I want more Vehicles  
7890	1	a	I do recommend this NOW. But I do feel bad for the people dat pay for this since many of em really wasted their money and on other games even tho its .99 the devs really just want ur money and then make it F2P to rip em off. I recommend this game just for fun nothing else nothing more. since this game is actually pretty fun and I enjoyed it. I would NEVER pay for any of their games tho since i saw many MANY negative reviews to not make me pay for ANY of em. If u play with friends u will have fun other then dat its just a game for fun and its not perfect which makes it more fun. And since its free try it wont hurt to try but I suggest people to not use money for this since the devs are after ur money and basically ripping u off.
7892	1	a	It's a good game , i recomandet
7894	1	a	I got this ame in Early Access through my friend's dad. Back then, this game ran choppily and was called 'ORION: Dino Horde.' I have not played this game as it is now, but it looked promising. Now that is in full release, the servers will likely be full. Also you get Steam Trading Cards, which you can sell. They fetch a good price too.
7896	1	a	Its... cool...
7898	1	a	It`s Ok, the store aint working doe but gameplay is chill
7900	1	a	This game is pretty cool.
7902	1	a	Easily the best game for $1,it is just a buck..... buy it already.......
7904	1	a	But shieeet- it was 99 cents  For real, best spent dollar ever
7906	1	a	Very fun and enjoyable game. A very cheap game that you can play with your friends.
7908	1	a	1 Opened game  2 Joined a single player survival game  3 turned the generator on  4 Bought a Trek-9  5 the first wave started  6 Murdered some raptor babys  7 wave ended  8 bought a bow and arrow  9 T-rex comes thew a wall and kills me instantly   1000000000000/10 would be eaten by a drunken T-rex
7910	1	a	Solid upvote! I played the Free Trial about a year back and had loads of fun blasting dinosaurs and opponents in halo-styled fights. If you like halo or turok, welcome to the game-child. Worth the try!
7912	1	a	Its neato burrito :)
7914	1	a	No Screenshots, no Let's play video are going to tell you how fun it's this game, you really need to play it to discover it, I had been playing this game since Dino Beatdown, which really was the version I enjoyed the most, yes this game was nerft and yes this game has some bugs but nothing that stop you from playing it.
7916	1	a	Interesting concept. Very buggy but still fun. I had the most fun after turning the graphics down as far as I could. Was worth the 4 player sale price!
7918	1	a	This nice game to play with your friends, also you can play multiplayer to it's fun,and you can have fun from this game i love this game buy it if you like! :) Good Day
7920	1	a	awesome game definentally worth the 99 cents (on sale) perfect for a relaxing time! 
7922	1	a	I am this game this game is me 
7924	1	a	Got it when it was on sale for $1. GREAT game for only $1. Idk if i'd give it a ten or anything...but for $1, it doesn't get much better. If full price (I can't see because I already own) is $25 or less, then I'd recommend it!
7926	1	a	This game is pretty fun. Especially worth it when it goes on sale for a dollar.
7928	1	a	I r8 8/8 no h8 plz no calls after 8 call me at 888-888-8888, plz sk8 to r8 n' don't b l8.
7930	1	a	I only have to say one thIng, AWESOME
1821	0	a	The server connections and server browser are horrible.
1822	0	a	UPDATE: Spiral changed name, and the game changed name- it is now orion:prelude- and it does not change anything that is written in this review- so make your own conclusions on how bad this game that is now on its third name is.  Bad. Do not buy.  Killing Floor is a hordemode shooter that focuses on one thing and does it damn well- only objective is to shoot well-designed enemies with well-designed weapons, and the sounds, music and feel are all tehre to make that fun. Weapons are powerful and feel powerful yet balanced between eachother, enemies are dangerous yet 'fair' and react to shots.  ORION DINO HORDE however, does the exact opposite: it give a player tons of guns and vehicles and makes all of them very bland. it gives billion game modes out of which 1 or 2 are worth playing and rest are dinosaur carp. Enemies feel plastic, hitboxes are wonky and movement is hideous. all animations are f-grade be it enemy, friendly or vehicle. The entire sound design is hideous: the loudest weapon in game are dual pistols, which deafen out tank gun and dual gatlings 100 to 1. weapons are laughably underpowered and imbalanced, only this enemies do is rush you like kamikaze planes.  Most of the flaws in the game are obvious to anyone who stops to sit for 5 seconds on 'what should good gameplay include', but Spiral is content on pumping out 'more is better' without a single thought on quality of the game.
7932	1	a	As silly as this game is, it's addicting and awesome :D You slay out dinosaurs in many different game modes, purchasing weapons and upgrades as you advance, as well as vehicles
1824	0	a	I regret spending 74 cents on this game that is developed by amateurs. Don't be fooled by their game trailers. Why do you think this game costs 74 cents?
7934	1	a	I like it. dont know why, but i do. I find myself playing this way more than expected.
7936	1	a	Can't hate the game even if I was told to (I have played 200+ hrs with multi accounts). Fun Co-op game with great difficulty settings, as well as 4 class to choice from. Overall its an incredible game  8/10
1825	0	a	It's broken. Maybe a good laugh with your friends, but not really worth picking up, even for a dollar.
7938	1	a	Buy it I mean its freaking 99 cents! 
7940	1	a	Just about the best game that I've ever played. Graphics are on par with Assassin's Creed Unity and overall gameplay is above and beyond anything I've seen in the last decade.   I did play it under a different name. Dino Hoard. And it was great. I recommeneded it too all of my friends and they all played it for 2 hours each.  If I had a dollar to buy this game. I would.
1826	0	a	Orion: Dino Horde is a fun game even solo I enjoyed the gameplay and the wave after wave of dinosaurs heading toward me with killer intent BUT then it started crashing. After about 2 hours or so after playing I took a break and started up my steam account and launched the game only too have it freeze on me every 5 or so minutes. One of my friend's computer started doing the same thing later on. My computer can run most games on their highest settings but even turning down the graphic to a lower setting did not help. The developers need too fix these bugs if so they'll have a enjoyable multiplayer game on there hands
7942	1	a	shot dinos on the lowest settings fun was had it was pretty cheap to so I aint even mad.
7944	1	a	BEST GAME WHAT I EVER PLAYED BEFORE! REALLY, THANKS!
7946	1	a	Only played a little bit, at first I played alone and it got boring pretty fast, but when you play with friends this game mixes together a great feeling of excitement, hilarity, and suspense (after all that T rex could be right around the corner). So much you can do and the maps are a fairly good size as well leaving literally hundreds of different ways to get to where you need to go. not to mention the various vehicles and even a mech suit. Plus who hasnt dreamed of bow hunting for Dinos! 9/10
1830	0	a	a junk game, a dumbed down version of halo with much less
7948	1	a	This game is really nice .. Thanks for making it free for 5 days . I really appreciated it ..
7950	1	a	Ignore the not recommended stuff, although the game is slightly, ONLY SLIGHTLY buggy its still the best game ive ever played, I mean someone who did not buy the game when they saw 'dinosaurs and Jetpacks' the games itself is exiting with huge boss fights with t-racks and other HUGE dinosaurs, lots of weapons easy controls oh and TANKS AND MECHS because we thought it couldn't get better, with all that said I definitely recommend this MORE than the beautiful game
1833	0	a	pretty bad, glad I spent $1 on it.  The problems are the map is too big for walking and too small for the slow vehicles. Combat is boring, AIs are boring, graphics are too simplistic.
1834	0	a	This game is unplayable. I streamed this @  www.twitch.tv/sirspoony  and frapsed it for first impressions youtube.   I was unable to create a solo game.  I was unable to join any online games because they were all locked.  I was unable to play with friends and viewers because none of us could team up for games.  Games would just not launch.  This game is not even worth the $0.99 because it did not work for me or the many people trying it out in my stream as well. So guessing it's either broken or so unstable server-wise that it makes it unplayable.  On a side note. They trolled gamers everwhere and won. They actually fooled the many idiots into thinking this is a recommendable game? Sorry for your obvious loss of some humanity based on trickery.
1835	0	a	I hate this game cuz every time I die I lose all my money that I've saved for weapons and have to start over again :(
7952	1	a	I dont know why, but it wont let me even update it. It said clear up the hard drive a bit, and i did. That appearantly did not work...... Any help?
1836	0	a	This game is awfully buggy and quite crappy. I guess one could like it in a 'so bad it's good' kind of way but honestly it isn't worth it. Good for one fun night with friends but after that you'll never go back
7954	1	a	I adore this game its a ton of fun I highly suggest it its like killing floor with dinos.   (also random tip you can ride on the wings of the Vtols and the backs of the dragonflies and its very very hard to fall off even if they start going in circles.)

7956	1	a	Thrift shop style
1841	0	a	Don't trust their newest propaganda people! This game still sucks! 1/10 Don't buy this. Please.
1842	0	a	Very very bad game...
7958	1	a	i like to play orion prelude
7960	1	a	Those Dinosaurs don't have ♥♥♥♥♥
7962	1	a	dont buy it
7964	1	a	WOW That discount 
7966	1	a	Buy when on sale its a good game but not worth the 15 bucks i got it for 99 cents so yea i would give it a 7 out of 10 because it is a little to pricy anyway it is an overall good game with a little feel of tf2 because hats
7968	1	a	I recommend it for kids.
7970	1	a	Well if you like shooting dinosaurs, this one is for you. The metacritic label is wrong of course, because it isn't even for this game. I think it's worth a buy, especially if you have friends playing.
7972	1	a	If you are into ever spinning dinosaur, dinosaurs launching themselves into the air while mulipling themselves (yeah.) or being unable to move for certain reasons while dinosaurs come at you, you might enjoy this thing.  Oh, remenber to press 'V'(melee button) while reloading. It cancels reloading animation, like completely.  4/10 7/10 for lolz
7974	1	a	BUY IT!!!IT'S SO FUNONE OF THE BEST GAMES I HAVE EVER PLAYED!!!(especially with friends)
1845	0	a	What sort of ♥♥♥♥ing computer do you need to run this game, i mean i got 12 FPS ON THE MENU. You know you have screwed up somewhere if your menu runs at 12 ♥♥♥♥ing frames. 2/12 thanks alot Valve. Oh and say i have a bad computer bad it says i have over the recommended
1846	0	a	♥♥♥♥
7976	1	a	its a really good game
7978	1	a	This game is worth more then 99 cents.
1847	0	a	This is the biggest piece of ♥♥♥♥ i've played since sonic 06! It lags constantly even though i have a computer with system requirements AND i even uninstalled all my games to make sure that it would run and it even managed to crash my computer multiple times!
1848	0	a	I purchased a four pack for around $3. After installing it and playing for a little short of an hour, I can report that it has poor graphics, subpar gameplay, and is more than a little repititious. Spend your time elsewhere. To those I start to send copies out to, I owe you apologies.
7980	1	a	You have to buy this game! It's just so much fun. I played with my friend for 2 hours in a match against a robotic santa that flew overhead and dropped bombs on us. It took us over an hour to kill him!
7982	1	a	A must have for fans of thr Zoo Tycoon series.
7984	1	a	It needs to be on mac
7986	1	a	At this point they might as well be paying me to play this. How many times has this game been free again? 10? 20? Anyway, you get your money's worth, which isn't much of a feat for 99 cents.
7988	1	a	shot a pterodactyl with a tank shell, then tank got flipped by stegosaurus and fell of cliff with my tank..... true story 11/10 
7990	1	a	Played for 5 mins got bored. ^^ Whoops left my comp on  I I I  I I I  I I I
7992	1	a	Awesome game here is all you need to know 1. you shoot dinosaurs as space marines. 2. you can eat space marines as dinosaurs. 3. there is no real plot but I guarantee that you will not care once you aim down your sights at a velociraptor. 4. There are Jet packs. 5. It is a first person shooter and third person dino. 6. The ion blade is basically a lightsaber so you can kill dinosaurs with a lightsaber. 7. The game plays like a dream. 8.There are tanks. 9.There are mechs. 10. For the uninformed all of these things are awesome and completely cool. That is all 9/10
7994	1	a	I Think it's a good game to have in your steam library. It looks good.   Rating: 8/10
1851	0	a	its HARD to say if i recommend it or not, its not a total waste of 0.99 cents  its fun in the begining, but the gameplay its buggy, the Dinos MAIN PURPOSE is just to rush you....RUSH you until you kill it... i would rather suggest to save the $$ for a better game like killing floor or something better than this :D ~~~~~~~UPDATE~~~~~~ I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME AT ALL  The gameplay isnt smooth always buggy/shaky/etc the Bots are weak and terrible in solo play i say the bugs RUINS THE GAMEPLAY
7996	1	a	its ok for a cheap game but does get boring the graphics could of been better bit like halo with dinosars lol Recommended:  OS:Win 7 / Win 8 (64-Bit)  Processor:AMD 6-Core / Intel 4-Core  Memory:6 GB RAM  Graphics:1 GB Graphics Memory (SM 3)  i bet this could run on a mobile
7998	1	a	People say mean things about me, and that makes me mad. Shooting dinosaurs in the face with giant robots makes me less mad. Metacritic don't know crap. Highly recommended if you want the true sensation of childlike wonder.
8000	1	a	awesome game to be fair :D fun everytime you play
8002	1	a	This is a amazing game , the developers have had a lot of hardship but they have persevered and made a very successful game , my only complaint is that it is $1 it should be more :)
8004	1	a	This game is horrible. Incredibly bad. I love it.
8006	1	a	That's a good game but it need more improvements like  1. There should be different character models like : a) Male b) Female in all classes  2. Dinos must have slam system so players can't avoid them by going on rocks
8008	1	a	Amazing game just cant wait till prelude 'Offically launches'
8010	1	a	Best name-changing simulator I've ever played! 9.4/10
8012	1	a	Like Skyrim, with guns!- 1gn
8014	1	a	For those of yougoing by the Metacritic score, I ask you not to. While I have only played this game for eight minutes, I can recomend it IF and only if you have three buddies that also own it, I have only played solo and it is near impossible, but it can be done, definitly pick it up on a steam sale, I got my copy for a dollar. I haven't encountered glitches or bugs as of yet, but I can tell a lot of work has been done since release.
8016	1	a	Ma turf foo' dino
8018	1	a	I have to say , this is a nice game , the vehicules are good and there a good choice of weapons but if you want to make this into a better game you need to fix the colision system and lag issues . There also a imbalance in the classes , everybody use the jetpack .
8020	1	a	For years (er, 2001 actually); the only game I played was Halo: Combat Evolved..  If you liked/loved Halo, you owe it to yourself to try this game..  It costs a dollar dammit- buy it just for the hell of it.
8022	1	a	stupid fun, and the people who made it seem to have put a lot of work into it. I kinda feel bad paying $1 for it, since it's so much fun with friends
8024	1	a	This game is the meaning of fun i got this game for 1 doller adn i got payday 2 for 10 still cant decide which one is better this gaing is slowing becomeing a must own
8026	1	a	Paying $0.99c to hunt dinos? Nuff said. Take my dolla now!
8028	1	a	Started off as dino beatdown which was filler at best but i did spend a couple hours on that. Then it turned into its 2nd form Dino Horde and it was a lot better and I spent more hours playing that. And now its it's in its 3rd form and it has vastly improved since the very beginning. So say what you want about the game but when you sell it for $1 and STILL consistently upgrade the game on this level, then you have to give the develpers mad props.
8030	1	a	Pros:  - References to Jurasic Park - Cool weapons - Interesting Objectives  Cons: - boring sound and ambient, not inmersive at all. - it seems it get stuck in some development state, alpha maybe? - Achievement 'Manly Man' (boys club) - the same dinosaurs that we've seen in other games, over and over again.  It's a cool game in alpha release, if that's the case. Recomended for boys 
8032	1	a	Best not even a whole dollar you can spend on a game. #BringMeSomePizza
8034	1	a	What a cool game
8036	1	a	Its a strange, buggy, incomplete, unreasnable game.  Buy it.
8038	1	a	Assault rifles, shotguns, laser guns, flamethrowers, tanks, mechs, airships, and dinosaurs. This game really is pretty awesome. Great for LAN's or teaming up with friends for some mindless fun.
8040	1	a	Awesome dino fps Hard to go wrong
1854	0	a	Started off ♥♥♥♥, became good after some love and craft, now it's gone to ♥♥♥♥ once again. The weather effects alone ruined everything.
1855	0	a	The systems at play here just did not grab my attention. I thought it might be interesting to hunt dinosaurs in these large and open arenas, but I continually felt pestered by the smaller enemies, and the large enemies could be quite spongy. However, at this point, the online servers may not be as populated as they once were. More players and teamwork might make the title more enjoyable.
8042	1	a	Not a bad game,but defenitely needs some optimizing in the next patches.You got dinosaurs,vehicles,a nice amount of weapons,some customization.It's a good game,not the best,but you can surely enjoy it with a couple friends if you have the time.And it's cheap :D
8044	1	a	ORION: Prelude, killing dinasours with lightsabers and futuristic weapons seems legit right?
8046	1	a	The video says to ignore the Metacritic score. I agree with this statement! Well worth the dollar paid for it, and I dare say it's worth the regular $14.99 price. It's not perfect by any means, but it provides a good bit of entertainment with friends.
1859	0	a	This game is god awful. right from the start you know its bad, because the game doen't even have a tutorial! so the first 10 minutes you are running not knowing what your doing, and have no idea how to get any weapons so you can actuall do anything. The textures are terrible, they are so low resoulution, that they look like games from the n64! the only good thing about the graphics are your player model, and even that is only decent at best. The voice acting is decent, but not up to par with todays standards, heck even the legend of zelda from the phillips cdi was better. The only good thing about this game is menu, ant that's because it has artwork, that is kinda cool to look at. And the net code for this game is terrible, not worse then brink's but that's not saying much. All in all i would give this game a 3/10. It has got to be one of the worst game i've ever played, I urge you not to buy it, even if it is only a dollar, it is that bad.
8048	1	a	This game is lovely, killing with your team mates surviving endless hordes of dinosaur's perfect :) a bit laggy tho sometimes.
8050	1	a	EPIC. worth definetly more than 1 dollah...it has some small bugs in the movement of dinosaurs but the game its still improving so...ive seen bigger games with serious bugs so i dont see why so much hate the game actually has good graphics(unreal engine),fun gameplay(coop againts the dinosaurs and deathmatch are the two main types),and nice soundtrack...sometimes it reminds a bit of borderlands...so if u wanna have fun with your friends other than homo-pillow figthing u have to buy this one...its 1 dollah..seriously now...1..
1860	0	a	the graphics are bad alot of lags the ingame skins cost actual money to purchase and this game is just boring it has no plot and no consept except playing with friends and if you dont have at least 3 more friends that play this game this game is just boring
1861	0	a	If you want to play a good dino game, dont try this. Very low budget game, but this isnt a problem. The models are low resolution, servers are laggy, and much more.
8052	1	a	*sets large dino spawn rate to 500%* *has to fight 5 triceratops, 5 stegosaurus, 5 t-rex, 5 deinosuchus, and 5 spinosaurus all at once* *wins after a grueling 30 minute long fight* *realizes I have 5 more rounds to go before securing the base* 10/10 would fight 25 large dinos again
8054	1	a	You like flying motorcycles? You like killing dinos with futuristic weapons? This is Killing Floor, Halo and Borderlands in one game. And you get all that for one ♥♥♥♥ing dolar. Totaly worth it. 10/10
1867	0	a	The concept is nice but the controls are crap. Sometimes you're able to move normally, sometimes you can't strafe for some reason, and sometimes you just can't move at all. It wasn't worth the dollar I spent on it.
8056	1	a	Very VERY fun to play.
8058	1	a	its a very fun game
8060	1	a	THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER IF YOU DONT BUY THIS GAME THAN U R A IDIOT PLZ BUY IT IS RLY WORTH 300,000$ BUT THE DEVS R KNICE AND LET YOU GET IT 4 THIS!!!!!1  jk it sucks
8062	1	a	This game surprised me. If you like guns and dinosaurs, this is the game for you. 10/10 would do.
8064	1	a	Kill dinosaurs. Buy guns. Kill more dinosaurs. Buy more guns. Kill more dinosaurs. 10/8 what more could you want.
1869	0	a	needs better optimization
8066	1	a	good as far as i can tell. but i have issues with performance even though i have a good pc
8068	1	a	Fun game! Graphics are like Team Fortress 2! It's really worth the 99 cents. I would recommend this game to anybody who's interested in first person shooters. Its a well build game, and I love it. 
8070	1	a	i cant really rate this bad or good but for the price of £0.79 its a decent game
8072	1	a	U shoot Dinos Nuff Said 10/10
8074	1	a	ITS A ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ DINOSAUR LASER FIGHT!!! IN SPACE, WITH SHARKS! ITS A BALLS OUT DINOSAUR LASER FIGHT!!!  ITS ♥♥♥♥ING SCIENCE, JUST ASK ALBERT EINSTEIN! (HE INVENTED SPACE)
8076	1	a	This is a great game. It's very fun to play and it's even more fun to play with friends. It's a very cheap choice but i recommend to wait because the 4-pack costs only 0,99 in the sales. Then you can play with your friends. Recently TREK Industries released 'Guardians Of Orion'. You can try that. But if you don't have the money or the computer for that, i recommend you to get this one.    Final verdict - 8/10
8078	1	a	PLEASE READ  -------------- I would reccomend it in the future when I get some better PC. But for now my computer can't handle it and it even skips frames. I love this game truely and got it for a wonderful deal of 99 cents but be warned, your computer may not process this game well. 10/10 It's just my PC that makes the fault.
8080	1	a	This is a really great co-op game to play with friends!
8082	1	a	this game is awsome haha,love to play this over and over xD
8084	1	a	Hey guys it's me, Ben Affleck. When I was filming Argo (maybe you've seen it lol) I would pass the time between filming scenes to play this video game. Orion: Prelude has a story that puts Good Will Hunting (another film I starred in with my best friend Matt Damon) to shame. All of the proceeds from this game go to relief efforts in Israel. I am a HUGE supporter of the Israeli plight and wish to see prosperity in the Middle East. I give this video game 357 Afflecks out of 5 Afflecks. Not buying this game would cause another Shoa goyim, oi vey!
8086	1	a	thE NEW UPDATE IS AMAZING AWSOME LOOKING GAME recomend to ALL who love shooters,fps,DINOSAURS
8088	1	a	There's ♥♥♥♥ing dinosaurs in it. Don't think, just buy it.
8090	1	a	addicting game if you like borderlands you will LOVE this
8092	1	a	Yes THA ♥♥♥♥♥♥ BEST GAME EEEEVVVVVVVVEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRR NOT but its fun
8094	1	a	Good game to play alone or with some friends.
8096	1	a	best 10 minutes of my life
8098	1	a	Everybody on the entire planet should get this game. Especially all my Steam friends.   STOP READING AND BUY IT!!!
8100	1	a	♥♥♥♥♥
8102	1	a	So, i just downloaded the game and actualy payed the money to keep it in my library. If you are obsessed with polished graphics, effect, animation etc. Get out of here right now, this is not your game. While having some decent graphics, they actually look very dated and the animation are very sloppy and baddly done.  But the thing is, if you don't look very much into those aspects, it's a pretty decent game to have fun for a while.  The modes are pretty fun and killing waves and waves of dinos keeps you playing for a good while. It's kind of addicting! It remembers me Killing Floor but with dinos. Kill waves, after the waves arm up, repeat.  Is it worth it? maybe. For me it's worth it. i really like the game!   Pros: Addicting Tons of fun DINOS! MORE DINOS! vehicles (actualy this would go in the 'meh' section)  cons: Animations are crap Graphics look like from a 2008/2010 game, not a modern game.  Veredict: A nice game if you want to play something different since most games like this are just about zombies etc. It's a nice alternative! and as i said, if you don't put importance to the graphics and the animations, try it out! And more now because it's just 0.99$!  6.5/10 
8104	1	a	good but I now have to pay for it. I did have it free and I am a steam user
8106	1	a	I joined my first game. I asked someone how do I switch weopons. I got kicked. gg no re this is a game you would find on the App Store. but +1 because I don't want to seem like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥
8108	1	a	Aside from all the bugs and blemishes throughout i found the game actually rather entertaining.I myself would certainly purchase this game.With its budget price and rather surprising graphics while supplying both competitive and co-operative game modes its great.however i will admit this game needs some tender love and attention yet.the bugs can be irritating and you never know when your host will leave and so far there is no way to migrate host instead it favors removing the match alltogether booting you out leaving you with little more than the experience and a sense of unfinished business.if you have some patience i recommend at least trying it out when it is free.
8110	1	a	so game, very cheap,     such dino, many hours    wow
8112	1	a	Played it for a couple minutes its alright.
1877	0	a	This game honestly isn't that good, I am glad I got it on sale when it was a dollar. All the game is, is to reactivate reactors over and over while killing dinosours. There are vehicles to get to the reactors faster, but honestly I left the game minutes after I realized it lags when I shoot. I would rate this game 2/10
8114	1	a	A lot of people ♥♥♥♥ on this game. A lot of critics apparently too; that metascore is the lowest I've seen.  Graphics wise it's nothing special, but nothing worth complaining about either. It looks like an unreal engine title from about 2008.  Which it is.  It needs an ingame tutorial. The level system, just like in EVERY shooter that has EVER had a level system or XP, is out of place and in the way.  The animations are a bit wonky and even the big dinos, if you get them one on one their AI is rather lacking. The game has a bunch of bugs. The difficulty curve is a bit too steep- you may find yourself at a point where your current difficulty level is no longer any challenge, but the next one up is nearly impossible.  That said, none of this got in the way of enjoying the game for me, because this game has the great advantage of being one of the extremely limited number of titles in which a person can utter the phrase 'I just shot a T-Rex in the face with a tank cannon' in earnest. If you like cooperative shooters, get this. If you want a PVP experience, this game has pvp modes but they are NOT a focus of the game. Perhaps its novelty will wear off faster than a more polished game like killing floor, but I still reccomend it.
8116	1	a	IT WAS $.99!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
8118	1	a	i have the game and my game is lagy and the mous and the keybord is really werde and thats it 
8120	1	a	dinosaurs and stuff. would recommend
8122	1	a	Halarious game. The ragdoll physics are especially funny. Nothing better than punching a dead t-rex into a tree with a car.
8124	1	a	Great deal for a $1. Standard FPS game, fun with your friends.
8126	1	a	I have really enjoyed all of the time I have put into the game so far. There are tons of different game modes and ways to play the game which gives it even more playthrough value. Although there are a few issues with laggy servers and lost connections, overrall it hasnt greatly affected my expirience. For $1 the game is totally worth it. Grab some buds and go take down some Dinos!
8128	1	a	It sucks, but for a buck it's worth the buck.
1878	0	a	WTF IS THIS ♥♥♥♥! DONT BUY THIS CRAP!!!!
1879	0	a	Wow even for 50 cents I feel robbed. Takes a lot for me to make a comment and being a Steam user for many years this is my first review. DON'T BUY it!!!!!!
1880	0	a	Why did I actually pay money for this piece of crap?
8130	1	a	This game brought the dino's back to life!
8132	1	a	I generally don't leave reviews but I feel inclined to show this game some support due to all the negative feedback. I don't understand all the hate on it. While it may not be the most sophisticated game by any stretch, Dino horde is good casual mindless fun. You shoot progressing waves of dinosaurs in a futuristic setting and upgrade your gear inbetween rounds.. What's not to love?  It gives a sort of old school type of fun before games were more complex. Given I can already tell this is a game I can fall back to at any time to just kill some time, it's current price is a complete bargain. In all reality I'd probably be comfortable paying 10$ or so for the game as it gives fun multiplayer but lacks any depth.  Any how... It's a fun game. If you can get it on sale do it, at the very least you'll put an hour or so into it and for a buck i'd say its worth it.
1881	0	a	This game is ♥♥♥♥ do not buy it it sucks vagazle for money
8134	1	a	This game is like butter Soft when you put it in the microwave But cold when you put it in the fridge I burned my orion prelude copy and i can't play it Recomandation: Don't let your Orion Prelude Copy in the microwave for 20 minutes on High
8136	1	a	11/1 would lightsaber a trex again
1885	0	a	Laggs sooooooooooo much other wise id play it!
1886	0	a	I bought this game for a dollar. I wasted that dollar. When it says in the trailer that the metascore is misleading, it is correct: this game should get a much lower rating than 34.
8138	1	a	I was once a lonely man, with nothing buy my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥ laptop that can barely handle more than 5 tabs open in google chrome. This game changed my life. The graphics are good enough that my eyeballs dont fall out of my head, and bad enough that my computer can actually run it without ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ it's self. There are tons of bugs in this game, some fun, some annoying, but I love all of it's perfect imperfections. This game made me literally cut my self in excitement when i first played it. I am a new man now. I've only killed 6 people, and that was because they were standing inbetween me and my game. I dream about this game. This game not only changed my insignificant life, but this game became my life. This game and I are one.  In conclusion...  6.45/10 It's ok I guess
8140	1	a	trex spinbot
8142	1	a	Enters Rampage server 3 Spinos Disconnect from server Plays singleplayer T-rex roars, R.I.P Headphones I is rip in pepperonis 10/10 would have more glitches.

8176	1	a	This is game is pretty good
8178	1	a	It's actually a ok game so i think you shoud get it!
1896	0	a	Not very addictive, unsure what I had to do*.
1897	0	a	♥♥♥♥
1898	0	a	This game poopy.
8180	1	a	cut a t-rex in the ankles with a knife until he die
8182	1	a	Not as bad a game as everyone says, buy it with some friends and enjoy shooting dinossaurs, its fun and with the new updates its playable and enjoyable.
8184	1	a	Punch Dinosaurs. Nuff said. But in all seriousness, this is a very fun game. But it's better if you have friends to play with. if not, it's still great to play.
8186	1	a	some may say that killing dinosaurs with lasers and rockets isnt fun, these people are missing out on something really cool. you can shoot them alone or knife them with friends, build up strategies or just leeroy jenkins straight through with only a knife. all in one, its a good game and i picked it up for 1 buck, look out for sales dudes ;)
8188	1	a	This game is great in my perspectives...  A little bit laggy but very good game play, this game is good for friends you like to play with this 5 player coop game makes you and your friends very enjoyable with different unlocks, weapons, taunts, hats, cosmetics and etc this game makes you look so cool. Orion prelude is a game which you slay dinos and unlock alot of things, Orion prelude is one of the funnest games i had, also the single player is very fun, if you are a single player guy get this game and play single player solo or bots, this game is very fun in my perspectives.. worth the 99 cents! this game might be worth 2 dollars.. this is a must buy game all the fun for .99 cents!!  
8190	1	a	A game in which 4 or 5 players hold out against a horde of Dinosaurs and the occasional giant crocodile in maps ranging from forests to even an icy hell landscape. Dinosaurs range from the classic T.rex to the Stegosaurus . If you liked Left 4 dead then you will love ORION (The T.rex throws giant rocks just like the tank)
8192	1	a	Honestly this isnt my favorite game. but its actually quite fun If you have friends to play it with its way better, but what would I know seeing as all my friends are playing DOTA or TF2 playing with bots is fun. but the game feels somewhat 'dead' without other player If you manage to increase your FPS above 20 and play you'll have a good time Enemies are pretty fair. easily killable in the early rounds and harder enemies as the match progresses There are some thing I feel should change however -The maps are buggy -servers are hard to get into -most servers are empty Its free so I cant complain about it in that department. its fun so thats another good thing And its buggy which leads to some hilarious gameplay like floating players or headless dinosaurs chasing you around the map probably a 7/10 (taken 3 away because of the things I listed before) If this Isnt helpful to you then keep scrolling until you find one that is
8194	1	a	it is realy fun!! :) 
8196	1	a	Halo with Dinos.
1902	0	a	The best thing about this game is its quick uninstall time!
8198	1	a	Fun to play enjoyable to alot of people.I think its one of the best games better then call of duty and tons more. Favorite game ;D 
8200	1	a	FANTASTIC GAME!. 100% worth the 1$ cost!
8202	1	a	what up with single player 
8204	1	a	I LOVE THIS GAME
8206	1	a	pretty fun game, now that its free i definitely recommend giving this one a try, the major downside is the way the hitbox works. it's great when your playing alone or are hosting, but the bullets register on the host side (which is dumb, hitboxes should always register on player side and have that info sent to the host) so you could be shooting a dinosaur in the face on your screen and not actually hit it at all, so the ping time has to be extremely (impossibly?) low for this game to really be enjoyable with friends
8208	1	a	wow. this game wanted me to do cocaine off my car windshield. pterodactyl is best in show. tru art with the copters and killing teamates 10/10 will pee pants again out of excitement
1905	0	a	the music is really laggy aswell as gameplay
8210	1	a	this game was amazing. it was everything you want in a dino fighting survival game.
8212	1	a	So bad its funny.  Best .99$ game i ever bought.
8214	1	a	I paid a frickin dollar for this and its more fun than any 60 dollar game I have played. 
8216	1	a	But sh!t, it was ninety-nine cents! (Bag it) Coppin' it, washin' it, 'bout to go and get some compliments Passin' up on those moccasins someone else's been walkin' in Bummy and grungy, fu*k it, man I am stuntin' and flossin' and Savin' my money and I'm hella happy that's a bargain, b!tch I'ma take your grandpa's style, I'ma take your grandpa's style,
8218	1	a	Pretty good for getting rare achievements so, i think for 1 key (that's what i've paid for) its ok. But wouldn't play again.  5 non existing ragdolls out of 10
8220	1	a	My friend gifted this game to me.  10/10 would accept gifts again
8222	1	a	Blows up car with grenade Car doesnt blow up Car bounces straight up I lose it out of my sight I miss my car.  10/10 would miss again.  Edit: After 40 years i still could not find car. I am thinking of starting a campaign to find my car again, please help me on this quest. Possibly in orion prelude 2.
8224	1	a	Fun to watch your friends get eaten by dinosaurs, 10/10 would watch/play again.
8226	1	a	its a nice game
1910	0	a	Well you watch new vids, you see the price and look for reviews. You can imagine this game would be nice to play. Even for just few mins of fun... but no.  Fighting dinosaurs is funny one time. 5 sci-fi soldiers per map against waves of A.I controled dinos. Between waves , you have to purchase gear, each kill give you cash you can spend in your base (starting point). But devs didnt though i would be nice to bring the 2 damm buildings needed to buy weapons and upgrades close each other... Indeed when you have 50 secs after each waves, you loose nearly 20 secs to reach thoses two buildings... annoying.  Some weapons are nice, but others are just useless, in general weapons doesn't have this 'feeling' of power you can have in most shooters.   Vehicles are dispached on the map, the interresting thing is the ability of support class (3 classes at the end) to repair vehicles. The unlimited amount of vehicles wich is quite annoying in games today was replaced here by the need to spare them. Good idea ! The problem is that vehicles are horrible to handle. One guy told me 'this is halo's driving style'. Here this is worst ! You will scream against dinos who will knock back your vehicle especially the mech wich is a scam. Vehicles weapons overheat. The Hud overheat indicator is not appropirate and will stuck you many times during battles.  For foot fighting; you will hate this game when a big dino will chase you and, in an act of courage, you will take him down by yourself and die like a ♥♥♥♥ because one minor dino blocked you on the way of your retreat. Because you can't go trough them. In this game, movements are not realistics like third person view where your torso is stuck as if you had a rake in the ... hum... you got the idea.  But he most annoying: crashes. For many years i never had a game such impossible to stop ! After 100 mins of playing the game crashed. It it was just impossible to stop the executable ! Amazing... especially when you succeed by closing your session, again you launch the game and... nothing. The game launched apparently steam recognize it but... nothing. No executable, no icon, nothing.  When you enter the game you see a banner where devs are planning to launch a kickstarter for a new game with AGAIN sci-fi soldiers vs dinos BUT this time in an open world. Hey Devs ! If you wanted some cash for your kickstarter you got 1 buck but you won't get anything else from me !  Note they dared to add some kind of item shop in the game (with their scandalous promoting vids !) . I didn't really browse it but francly they've boasted a bit too much of their game to think people will buy more than this title.  If you wan't to slaughter dinos (and humans) go on primal carnage wich much more interresting.
8228	1	a	36 out of 100 Yes thats not acutire this game is no master AAA game but its fun enjoyable and id request it also good with friends My only complain is the AI itsw a bit buggy but i mean its worth a go so get a group and hunt some dimos my friend

8230	1	a	Not bad for a 2$ game

8234	1	a	Such a stupidly glorious game. Played with a group of guys at magfest and we just tried to kill triceratops with buggies  10/10 would allahu akbar into dinosaurs again.

8238	1	a	So I decided to go ahead, disregard the Metacritic score for the old version and give this game a try. And after trying the free demo, I had to buy the actual game - the whole setting is so over-the-top hilarious - shooting down hordes of dinosaurs in coop mode - and the actual gameplay is a lot of fun!  There is no tutorial of any sort, so you'll have to give yourself a bit of time to figure out how stuff works and what you are actually supposed to do - but once you jetpack on top of a rock, thinking you are safe from the hordes of dinos running below and planning to snipe them off one after another - and then some flying dino dives down, picks you up and pulls you high up in the air, only to then drop you once you start shooting at the critty - then you're hooked ;)  Super fun, and a developer with tons of humour and a huge commitment to this game.
8240	1	a	It is an average game, its cool to play with other people.
1915	0	a	Not that fun and there are barrely any in game sounds
1916	0	a	Haha, it's even funny. It's REALLY bad! I don't think i have words to describe it.  Good thing it was only $1.
8242	1	a	This game is OK, but its not someting you HAVE to have. It has a lot of bugs, but it is playable. Though, IF you consider getting this game, do not pay more then $2-$3 for it. I played it during the FREE week when it was $3, but it did nothing for me. A week is more then enough of that game to get bored of it. The META score is a bit harsh, but it justified.
8244	1	a	this game is actually quite fun despite what the metascore says, I decided to look into it, and they're reviewing what came before when it was Dino Beatdown and not Dino Horde. It's a decent game, great fun with friends, I'd give it a shot for 99 cents.
8246	1	a	Good game overall, but i wouldnt had bought it if it wasnt in sale.
1917	0	a	Purchased this game long ago and asked for a refund as it was THAT bad.   There are so many bad things to say about it:  1) Gameplay feels weightless and unsatisfying  2) Multiplayer is lifeless and unabsorbing  3) It feels pointless, unrewarding and repetitive 4) There is no demo, which means people waste their money buying the full version, which is dreadful
8248	1	a	PLEASE NOTE: IF YOU CAN'T RESPECT THE OPINIONS OF OTHERS, THEN DON'T READ THIS. THIS IS PURELY BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE WITH THE GAME, IF YOU DON'T AGREE, THEN GO WRITE A HATE SONG ABOUT ME AND UPLOAD IT ON YOUTUBE.  This game was not worth your time, and you shouldn't buy it Although this game advertizes for having immersive co-op, co-op is barely present. The only 'co-op' this game has to offer is swarming the larger groups with dinosaurs stiff as wooden boards, while your team shoots all the dinosaurs down, except the pterodactyls, which are so small that they're impossible to hit, while some random guy is screaming at people over voicechat to come repair his vehicle. The AI in this game is not that great either. Enemies often circle around in the tall grass a couple of times and then charge straight at whoever is closest, regardless of wether a wall, a tree or even another dinosaur is in the way, not to say it matters, since most dinosaurs clip through each other. If you play as a dinosaur, the game then gets even worse. you spawn somewhere close to the players, half of the time, without a map, arrow or anything else to guide you to the so called 'survivors' forcing you to search for them. It doesn't help that the maps are HUGE, and everyone is mashed into a claustrophobic mass of crudely animated violence. If you don't have a somewhat beefy computer, this game will run with less than 15 fps, even on the lowest graphics, so take note of that, especially with the motion blur, where you won't be able to see 5 feet in front of yourself.  pros: -has some weapon variety. -better optimized for pc than Toukiden Kiwami.  cons: -awful co-op. -does not run that well on slower computers. -although it does offer multiple gamemodes, they all feel the same. -Developers went as far as to change the name once, just to get it to the steam frontpage.    final words: if you really REALLY don't have any other games to play, and have a lot of free time at your hands, then go outside and get a life.  I certainly hope this review helped you save your money, if not, then come back and write a review like I did, to help others see what lies beyond the wall  This is what i would have said back at Orion: dino horde. these people completely turned the game around, and is now enjoyable, and fun to play. they fixed many of the bugs, most of the stiffness, and did a ton of tweaks to the performance.  true final words: Buy, but don't wait for a sale. these guys who made the game spent a LOT of time improving the game little by little, until it finally became good, plus they made co-op a lot better too. If you bought this game previously, I say give it a second chance.  That's all, praise the sun.
8250	1	a	Good game overall, but i wouldnt had bought it if it wasnt in sale.
8252	1	a	It's a fun game, The graphics are alright, it's super fun to play with friends.
1919	0	a	In short, this game is Killing Floor with dinosaurs, but subpar. You survive waves of  zombies  dinos, earn money for killing them and buy progressively bigger and nastier guns with them. Sounds pretty straightforward, and it is. The problems with this game are that it's unbalanced, looks worse than Unreal Tournament 2004 (but still runs horribly) and feels very amateurish for a comercially sold game.  For starters, there's only one class out of the 3 you are offered that is actually worth anything, and that is the Assault class (the guy with the jetpack). The other ones have a cloaking mode and a healing gun, but they aren't worth giving up the ability to NOT DIE when you are picked up by a pterodactyl, stop yourself from being mobbed or casually fly around the triceratops that you are pumping full of lead.  There are a bunch of purchaseable guns on offer when you finish a wave, but most of them are either too weak or have horrible accuracy/recoil, so expect to use the same guns on every match. Or you could drive around in a warthog-ish buggy and have some guy man the turret (or man it yourself) to become almost invincible to the dinosaurs.  There are some things that Dino Horde does right, though. It mixes it up by having you defend generators, fight boss dinosaurs, and move around to different bases, which breaks up the monotony quite a bit, and it is rather satisfying once you get a hold of one of those badass turrets, admittedly.  I feel a bit bad for bashing an indie game, and honestly, if you're the forgiving sort, you may get a good amount of fun out of this game, but there are better games you can play about surviving waves of enemies. There are better games about blowing dinosaurs up. There are none to my knowledge about surviving waves of dinosaurs, though, so if you have a fixation for surviving a horde of prehistoric reptiles (perhaps it's the only way you can get it up, i'm not judging you :-D) then pick it up in a sale or something.
8254	1	a	I was gonna buy an m4a4 zirka and then i figured out this beast was 1 dollar. addicted probably
8256	1	a	Its a good game, you kill dinosaurs and stuff. You can use a shotgun to literally blow the head off of a dinosaur. :P
1921	0	a	BACK WHEN THE GAME WAS CALLED ORION HORDE i liked this game, its was defo worth the money,team work was the key.was fun with friends and these people who say its crap they have not played enough to warrent calling it crap.a must buy for 99p/ $0.99 i retract this statment ^^ its utter garbage ...chagend the game so much its not even the same game and as for the stealling content thing well GG orion GG  DONT BUY THIS GAME NOT EVEN FOR 1P /$0.01  DONT SUPPORT THIS GAME IN ANYWAY SHAPE OR FORM  DONT LISTEN TOO ME I'M ONLY A PANDAWW I RAN OUT OF BAMBOO THIS MORNING AND I'M HUNGRY  lol   WORST VIDEO GAME EVERRRRR!!!! (the simpsons)
8258	1	a	I highly recomend this game for thoose who have some good friends and they want to do something not too serous their weekends. Otherwise I recomend you to go away
8260	1	a	perfectly gives u the exxprienz of whet $|-|itting in a bottle feels like, including how u feel after
8262	1	a	if you like dinosouars this game is for you 
8264	1	a	DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY LOL!
1923	0	a	Honestly, after a second ''remake'' and content update...it is still as buggy, cheap and boring as before. Seriously dissapointing and a waste of money.  I highly respect the devs for their devotion and the love they put in the game...but it is not enough.
1924	0	a	What can I say? I only bought this for my friends and myself as a joke and paid 0,50€ when it was on sale.. and that was way too much.   Let's list some 'features': No actual gameplay (except for running and shooting), UI is from the early 2000's and is horrible to use, artstyle (if you can speak of art in the same sentence) is mostly just mimiced from big sci-fi titles, the soundscape is just plain wrong...  Oh, and did I mention that the game is full of bugs? Ah, sorry no, it isn't full of bugs IT IS a fricking bug. The bright side is that the bugs are mostly hilarious (try driving a car head on to a dino).   That doesn't make the game entertaining or anything though. Let's just say it aloud: It's rubbish. And what I've heard, the devs (if you dare call them game developers) have been selling the game under different titles for ages. So basically, they're frauds and should not be allowed to publish anything in the first place.   I hope someone reads this. If I manage to save a single euro, dollar, yen or whatever from being spent on sh*t like this, I can die in peace.
8266	1	a	For only $1 you can't go wrong if you don't enjoy it you havn't realy lost anything but I love it best to buy it for all your friends to play along aswell makes the game even better. So much potential still to come!
8268	1	a	Someone get that sniper.
1935	0	a	ok i know i dont have a mega super £10000 pc but i can generally run most games with about 20fps on mid graphics, but this this game. i dont know where to start. i dont know what the gameplay is like because it runs too badly for me to play. i put it on lowest graphics and i get about 4fps if im lucky. when i tried to play it on mid graphics it froze and what i could tell by the screen where horrid graphics. luckly my friend paid for it not me.
8270	1	a	Maybe its not so bad if you turn all your graphics to low so you can't see the garbage you're playing.
8272	1	a	support for this fantastic and it so fun espically assult JETPACKS FTW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
8274	1	a	It was like an arcade game. I put in 50 cents and got a little entertainment.

8298	1	a	♥♥♥♥♥♥ copy-paste game that has been released x times on steam. Even for 1 dollar feels like a scam to me
1943	0	a	This is by far the worst game I have ever bought. I only paid $0.99 for it and feel I was ripped off. There is nothing about this game that is original, the gameplay is horrible and the developers should be ashamed for releasing such garbage. I would not recommend this game to my worst enemy as it would be to cruel.
8300	1	a	Probably one of my favorite games, love every aspect
8302	1	a	cool and good co-op 
8304	1	a	This game is worth 100 times more than it cost. Best player: Assault Best gun: AWP for 15k Upgrade gun in weapon shop for 20k Upgrade urself for more than 30k EASY MATCH!
8306	1	a	Meh, it's a game made for kids. You can shoot dinasaurs for a little bit but not much depth or polish to the game.
8308	1	a	Shoot dinosaurs in the face for $.99.    What? Buy the ♥♥♥♥ing game!

8312	1	a	Running with a knife looks like you are the duck from the swiggity swooty gif. Double jump makes your screen glitch. Dying crashes your game Its like Halo if Halo was not fun and had dinosaurs.  Overall a fun time for the price, buy it now before price increases. 7.8/10 Too much rain animation on my visor.
8314	1	a	Good gameplay. Wish graphics looked a bit more realistic. 7/10
8316	1	a	i bought this game in 2012 when it first came out and ive loved it ever since. its a great game to play with freinds
1948	0	a	While I would recommend the game if you could get it for around two dollars like I did, I couldn't recommend a full purchase. The game runs horribly on even outstanding systems. The idea is at least interesting. I give the game that it has one of the more unique ideas out there, but its charm dimms a little after extended play. The gameplay is fun throughout with good upgrades, and challenging enemies, but it also containes some annoying bugs. If you do get it, get it on sale. Be prepared for extreme temperatures too.
8318	1	a	SOOOOOOOOO.... CHEAP :D this game is awsome

8326	1	a	Your Honor, haven't these ridiculous bugs    taken up enough of this court's valuable time?    How much longer will we allow these absurd shenanigans to go on?    They have presented no compelling evidence to support their charges    against my clients, who run legitimate businesses.    I move for a complete dismissal of this entire case!    Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going    to have to consider Mr. Montgomery's motion.    But you can't! We have a terrific case.    Where is your proof? Where is the evidence?    Show me the smoking gun!    Hold it, Your Honor! You want a smoking gun?    Here is your smoking gun.    What is that?    It's a bee smoker!    What, this? This harmless little contraption?    This couldn't hurt a fly, let alone a bee.    Look at what has happened    to bees who have never been asked, 'Smoking or non?'    Is this what nature intended for us?    To be forcibly addicted to smoke machines    and man-made wooden slat work camps?    Living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man?    - What are we gonna do? - He's playing the species card.    Ladies and gentlemen, please, free these bees!    Free the bees! Free the bees!    Free the bees!    Free the bees! Free the bees!    The court finds in favor of the bees!    Vanessa, we won!    I knew you could do it! High-five!    Sorry.    I'm OK! You know what this means?    All the honey will finally belong to the bees.    Now we won't have to work so hard all the time.    This is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature, Benson.    You'll regret this.    Barry, how much honey is out there?    All right. One at a time.    Barry, who are you wearing?    My sweater is Ralph Lauren, and I have no pants.    - What if Montgomery's right? - What do you mean?    We've been living the bee way a long time, 27 million years.    Oongratulations on your victory. What will you demand as a settlement?    First, we'll demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps.    Then we want back the honey that was ours to begin with,    every last drop.    We demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more    than a filthy, smelly, bad-breath stink machine.    We're all aware of what they do in the woods.    Wait for my signal.    Take him out.    He'll have nauseous for a few hours, then he'll be fine.    And we will no longer tolerate bee-negative nicknames...    But it's just a prance-about stage name!    ...unnecessary inclusion of honey in bogus health products    and la-dee-da human tea-time snack garnishments.    Oan't breathe.    Bring it in, boys!    Hold it right there! Good.    Tap it.    Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups, and there's gallons more coming!    - I think we need to shut down! - Shut down? We've never shut down.    Shut down honey production!    Stop making honey!    Turn your key, sir!    What do we do now?    Oannonball!    We're shutting honey production!    Mission abort.    Aborting pollination and nectar detail. Returning to base.    Adam, you wouldn't believe how much honey was out there.    Oh, yeah?    What's going on? Where is everybody?    - Are they out celebrating? - They're home.    They don't know what to do. Laying out, sleeping in.    I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way to San Antonio with a cricket.    At least we got our honey back.    Sometimes I think, so what if humans liked our honey? Who wouldn't?    It's the greatest thing in the world! I was excited to be part of making it.    This was my new desk. This was my new job. I wanted to do it really well.    And now...    Now I can't.    I don't understand why they're not happy.    I thought their lives would be better!    They're doing nothing. It's amazing. Honey really changes people.    You don't have any idea what's going on, do you?    - What did you want to show me? - This.    What happened here?    That is not the half of it.    Oh, no. Oh, my.    They're all wilting.    Doesn't look very good, does it?    No.    And whose fault do you think that is?    You know, I'm gonna guess bees.    Bees?    Specifically, me.    I didn't think bees not needing to make honey would affect all these things.    It's notjust flowers. Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.    That's our whole SAT test right there.    Take away produce, that affects the entire animal kingdom.    And then, of course...    The human species?    So if there's no more pollination,    it could all just go south here, couldn't it?    I know this is also partly my fault.    How about a suicide pact?    How do we do it?    - I'll sting you, you step on me. - Thatjust kills you twice.    Right, right.    Listen, Barry... sorry, but I gotta get going.    I had to open my mouth and talk.    Vanessa?    Vanessa? Why are you leaving? Where are you going?    To the final Tournament of Roses parade in Pasadena.    They've moved it to this weekend because all the flowers are dying.    It's the last chance I'll ever have to see it.    Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry. I never meant it to turn out like this.    I know. Me neither.    Tournament of Roses. Roses can't do sports.    Wait a minute. Roses. Roses?    Roses!    Vanessa!    Roses?!    Barry?    - Roses are flowers! - Yes, they are.    Flowers, bees, pollen!    I know. That's why this is the last parade.    Maybe not. Oould you ask him to slow down?    Oould you slow down?    Barry!    OK, I made a huge mistake. This is a total disaster, all my fault.    Yes, it kind of is.    I've ruined the planet. I wanted to help you    with the flower shop. I've made it worse.    Actually, it's completely closed down.    I thought maybe you were remodeling.    But I have another idea, and it's greater than my previous ideas combined.    I don't want to hear it!    All right, they have the roses, the roses have the pollen.    I know every bee, plant and flower bud in this park.    All we gotta do is get what they've got back here with what we've got.    - Bees. - Park.    - Pollen! - Flowers.    - Repollination! - Across the nation!    Tournament of Roses, Pasadena, Oalifornia.    They've got nothing but flowers, floats and cotton candy.    Security will be tight.    I have an idea.    Vanessa Bloome, FTD.    Official floral business. It's real.    Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.    Thank you. It was a gift.    Once inside, we just pick the right float.    How about The Princess and the Pea?    I could be the princess, and you could be the pea!    Yes, I got it.    - Where should I sit? - What are you?    - I believe I'm the pea. - The pea?    It goes under the mattresses.    - Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart. - I'm getting the marshal.    You do that! This whole parade is a fiasco!    Let's see what this baby'll do.    Hey, what are you doing?!    Then all we do is blend in with traffic...    ...without arousing suspicion.    Once at the airport, there's no stopping us.    Stop! Security.    - You and your insect pack your float? - Yes.    Has it been in your possession the entire time?    Would you remove your shoes?    - Remove your stinger. - It's part of me.    I know. Just having some fun. Enjoy your flight.    Then if we're lucky, we'll have just enough pollen to do the job.    Oan you believe how lucky we are? We have just enough pollen to do the job!    I think this is gonna work.    It's got to work.    Attention, passengers, this is Oaptain Scott.    We have a bit of bad weather in New York.    It looks like we'll experience a couple hours delay.    Barry, these are cut flowers with no water. They'll never make it.    I gotta get up there and talk to them.    Be careful.    Oan I get help with the Sky Mall magazine?    I'd like to order the talking inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.    Oaptain, I'm in a real situation.    - What'd you say, Hal? - Nothing.    Bee!    Don't freak
8328	1	a	it was fun
8330	1	a	10/10 like work  thanks :yay: good! all Rush buy  all -off summer sale
1953	0	a	there is a reason this masterpiece is only a dollar.
1954	0	a	This game sucks. You're probably here because 'Hey it's a dinosaur shooting game! Let's try it', trust me I felt the same way too but when I started playing, it's not how it is in trailers and videos. It's really boring, weapons are really dull and the environment is bland. The dinosaurs sometime looks like they're floating and chasing after you. You know, i've tried the other dinosaur games like Dino D-Day and Primal Carnage and have both. They are much more worth than this! You're only gonna buy it if it's free or under a dollar, other than that don't get this.
8332	1	a	Great, challenging game.
8334	1	a	this is the best game if ever played 
8336	1	a	I LOVE THIS GAME AND THIS CO-OP OMG! CATCH A GAMERA OMG LOVE THIS GAME ^~^ ^3^ ;-; ===================================================================

8340	1	a	Fun. That's all I can say. Fun.
8342	1	a	it's A pretty addicting game! it is still a really rough diamond,but it has potential! Just needs a little more optimizing and better voice acting and this will be an outstanding game Hope it gets more updates!
8344	1	a	is good game, but is not quality game
8346	1	a	Jurassic, futuristic FPS multiplayer. Plus, its free (now.. those dang developers). Could disappoint but again, its free. Just stop reading reviews ad give it a go. Oh and by the way, you can get a jetpack.
8348	1	a	At first sight, this game appears to be lackluster and unpolished. Do not be fooled by the games subpar visual treatment. It is jam-packed with multiple gamemodes,player customization, and a plethora of weapons to annihilate the dino fiends! The content in this game is what games today are lacking and should focus on rather than the eye candy made to appease the mass of 'seeing is believing' gamers that exist more today than ever in the gaming world! This game is a combination of Halo,Dead space,Borderlands 2, as well as league of legends, and I have never seen a better mash-up than ever before!
8350	1	a	this is the best game if ever played

1956	0	a	ok i know i dont have a mega super £10000 pc but i can generally run most games with about 20fps on mid graphics, but this this game. i dont know where to start. i dont know what the gameplay is like because it runs too badly for me to play. i put it on lowest graphics and i get about 4fps if im lucky. when i tried to play it on mid graphics it froze and what i could tell by the screen where horrid graphics. luckly my friend paid for it not me.
8354	1	a	Its so baws.
8356	1	a	I cried, I laughed, I shot a dinosaur in the bum. 11/10 best accounting software Ive ever used! Makes my taxes fun to do every year! Rawr!
8358	1	a	This game has awesome co-op! They seriously have improved so much since last time when I played! Go and get it, It has beautiful environments, and has Multiplayer go fight against players and friends  I. Am. Now. A. Huge. Fan. Of. This. Game. You. Should. Be. Too. :)
8360	1	a	Great game, many great, fun, and scary times. first time i played. i cried, spinosauros are scary. played with friends. we all cried because T-Rex is much harder than spinosaurus. playing more than N00B difficulty makes it very boring tho. overall great game 8.7/10  My metascore would be 87/100
8362	1	a	First Person Mode and Dinosaurs well made ORION: Prelude specially with our guns and special power per character type.
8364	1	a	The game is not perfect, it has a couple of buggs but it is very fun so its worth the money.
1960	0	a	wad the hell am i doing with my life
1961	0	a	the optimization is awefull
1962	0	a	I have no idea, a long long time ago this had a free weekend and i played it and it was actually kinda fun. i bought they game now cause its dirt cheap so why not and it is awful. Performance is extremely bad and poor optimization. games that look better even on lowest setting i can run them on higher settings anyways. this game looks awful and even on lowest settings im getting all sorts of frame drops and stutters. Theres not many servers, and rarely any fun servers with fun people. I don't see big dinos as much as i nearly used to back on that free weekend. the guns are nearly unusable, having no recoil and it feels like im shooting a pea shooter, yet dinos die extremely easy, and even on the hardest difficulty, i found it really easy. the vehicles feel stiff and also nearly unusable. not a good game, not even worth 99 cents
8366	1	a	contrary to what people believe on metacritic  its not a bad game anymore. ANYMORE. but this game needs alot more players to really become one of the scene. which I believe it has the potential to.
8368	1	a	I cried, I laughed, I shot a dinosaur in the bum. 11/10 best accounting software Ive ever used! Makes my taxes fun to do every year! Rawr!
8370	1	a	GAME IS INACCURATE WITH ITS ACHIEVEMENT NAMES, CAVEMEN DIDN'T EXIST WITH THE DINOSAURS...   -1 point game ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
8372	1	a	Wtf i payed 1 Euro for this game and now it's free???? Give me my M4A4 Griffin back plz  (still a good game)
8374	1	a	TFW game you bought for cheap price becomes free.
8376	1	a	36 out of 100 Yes thats not acutire this game is no master AAA game but its fun enjoyable and id request it also good with friends My only complain is the AI itsw a bit buggy but i mean its worth a go so get a group and hunt some dimos my friend
8378	1	a	Abselutely worth it
8380	1	a	contrary to what people believe on metacritic  its not a bad game anymore. ANYMORE. but this game needs alot more players to really become one of the scene. which I believe it has the potential to.
8382	1	a	Simple pickup and play fun, I do like punching Dinosaurs too.
8384	1	a	This is a fun game and for 1 dollar you can't beat it.
8386	1	a	The game is not perfect, it has a couple of buggs but it is very fun so its worth the money.
1967	0	a	i forgot what it was about but it has a nice name
8388	1	a	its all about the gameplay. Graphics arent the best, but arent bad. What brings me in is the unique stlye of play that is lacking in so many FPS's today.
8390	1	a	Fifty-fifty
8392	1	a	the game crashed... 10/10
1972	0	a	'60+' updates. Well 60+ updates later its still a very buggy, laggy, broken game. Its good for a laugh in the first 5 minutes but its really really not that good. within my first game i was knocked under the map and couldn't do anything about it. It is only 1 dollar and thats what its worth 1 dollar because its not a good game and frankly not worth playing.
1973	0	a	Not even worth $0.99. Horrible.
8394	1	a	This game is fun, little old kind graphics but worth giving try, specially its just 1$ , for sure NOT waist of money !
1984	0	a	The metascore is real. Don't believe what they say about fixing the game.
1985	0	a	Do not spend money on this game.  This game seems interesting in premise, and as it may be fun at first, if you spend a few hours with this game you realize that it isn't open world like it says it is. It is also grotesquely repetitive and there isn't enough in this game to warrant a buy. I bought this game when it was ORION Dino Beatdown and was excited for an update, and it came in the form of hats and microtransactions. I am disappointed with the quality of this game and the potential that was lost with the greedy transition into a microtransaction game.
1986	0	a	Horrible
1987	0	a	No. Just no. 0/10  Cons: - Bad graphics - Boring gameplay - Ridiculous voice lines  Pros: - I removed this game from my library
1988	0	a	Got killed by a dinosaur and still had 3 lifes left, 15/10, would uninstall at sight.
1989	0	a	Has to be the worst game i have ever played. I am shocked and appalled that this has a rating of 'very positive'  I could plug my controller into a log of my ♥♥♥♥ and be more entertained.  
1990	0	a	Plagiarism is no joke. Do not buy this game. The developers stole art from many other studios and do not deserve your money.
8396	1	a	To be totally honest, this game isn't that bad. It has very good and fun gameplay, but the developers gave up on the project a long time ago. It's still relatively enjoyable, and it's worth the small price tag. If you ever have a small bit of cash, throw it at ORION: Prelude. It's pretty fun with friends (although a little buggy), and the ragdolls are hilarious!  I've had this game since the day it came out, and I still think it's pretty good in terms of gameplay - acompanied by stunning graphics.
1991	0	a	When you paid $0.99 And Now It's free...

1994	0	a	Just don't buy ....don't... istant regret.  -low texture -bugged physics -Ai ?! 
1995	0	a	Forgive me lord for I have sinned  Seriously though, this game is incredibly bland and comes off as very ametureish. The UI looks terrible, the game still has lots of bugs, the environments are crazy bland (And WAY too big IMO,) the music is generic as hell, enemies are as dumb as they come and the gunplay just isn't that great. Sure, the game is usually $1 when it's on sale, and I've definitely gotten some great games for just $1 but here, it's not worth it. If you want a horde-mode style game that badly, just get Killing Floor. If you want a competitive shooter, get Counter Strike. If you really want to play a dinosaur shooter, I highly recommend the much more enjoyable Primal Carnage. Orion just isn't worth your time or money.
1996	0	a	Completely unfinished and broken. DO NOT BUY.
1997	0	a	its ♥♥♥♥
1998	0	a	it does not work on my screen so i cant play it
1999	0	a	This is the most worst. The gameplay isn't as fun as other dinosaur games I've played. Who the hell manages to make being a freaking dinosaur not fun?! Movement is glitchy and slow, leaving you open to be gunned down by the human players EASILY, even as the tankiest of dinos. The sounds are horrible - either loud and screeching to punish headphone users, or bland and forgettable. Never, EVER press the roar button if you wear headphones. YOU WILL REGRET EVERYTHING.  When the game makes even walking around the map a tricky chore, LET ALONE COMBAT, you know something's horribly wrong.   Play Primal Carange instead if you want some fun dino vs human action. PC isn't perfect by any means, but it gets you what you want: violent, chaotic combat mixed with some stealthy hunting in between. Also silly cheesy dialogue, if that's your thing. And while the t-rex is loud in that game, at least it doesn't attempt to rupture your eardrum like Orion does - and roaring as the T-rex does something useful! In PC, roars trigger different abilities for the dinosaurs. Neat. Also you can make the T-Rex headbang to music and that counts for a lot in my book. 
2000	0	a	basically a poor mans evolve
2001	0	a	Aside from the dev being super shady, this game is just as ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as it's price suggests.
2002	0	a	Worst 12 minutes of my life.
2003	0	a	No. Not a horrible game, *ahem* REVALATIONS 2012 *ahem* but still not good. It's trying to be Borderlands, but it's failing. Meh graphics, meh gunplay, meh fun. Good way to describe it: Meh. I'd give it maybe a 2/10 or a 3/10.
2004	0	a	THIS GAME...... no, this THING is awful  The Ai is completely broken, just jetpack to the nearest ♥♥♥♥ing rock and they will sit there thinking '♥♥♥♥! I wish I evolved to jump instead of choosing to inhabit a world full of deadly cliffs, eternal rain and trees that look like they exist, but don't'  At least the devs and dinos have a few things in common, like brains the size of wall nuts and trying to sell anything so they can buy a slab of dry meat.
2005	0	a	Terrible game. You know it's kind of red flag-ish when it's one dollar, so you should stop there, but if you're like me and get this game, you'll see what I mean. Introduced immediately with really shoddy-looking menus, and overall terrible interface, you see microtransactions everywhere so you can level up too. Then, once finally joining a decent game that doesn't kick you out after the first minute, you just see really, really, really ugly gameplay that's like a bad version of Killing Floor, but even worse. It's an open map with waves of dinosaurs that progressively get harder after waves where you get better too, but the dinosaurs just have a weird way of fighting that's so awkward and clunky it isn't fun. I could rant on for hours about how lacking this game is, but I think this summarizes it. Verdict: Awful game and should be never played by anyone.
8400	1	a	[EN/FR] So... A lot of people say ''That game is Poo'', but that not real. At the begin, its was a empty bugged game, but the game get a lot of update, and completely change. Now the game is really nice, that not the best game ever, but for something make indie, and with a price down to 0.99¥, no reason to reject that game....  Il faut savoir que si Orion est aussi mal jugé, c'est tous simplement que avant, ce n'etait rien d'autre qu'un jeu catastrophique. mais a l'heure actuelle, le jeu a énormément changé, en un tres bon jeu, surtout pour un petit indie, avec un prix reduit a 0.99￥. A essayer, difficile de ce plaindre pour ce prix la....
8402	1	a	Never played x3
2018	0	a	i payed for this useless thing and now its free its not even a real game
2019	0	a	I'm quite annoyed that I keep getting this game re-gifted to me by my friends. First, it was Dino: Beatdown, which was totally ordinary and mod-like in presentation (and not a good one at that), second I was gifted Dino: Horde, and I wasn't even sure if it was a different game. Finally, I was gifted this version, and while better than the other two, I'd hardly call a new engine a few more features a new game. It feels like there is always a new attempt at getting this game finished, it gets some updates, and then promptly disappears under a new title.   Would like to see some sort of 'finality' (and I mean real finality, not just stop updating it or re-releasing it as something else). The concept is great, but the delivery is constantly flawed, which is a real shame.   
8404	1	a	I wasted 99 cents

2034	0	a	game is bad sad game with a music copied by a famous game..
2035	0	a	This game makes practically no sense You're dropped into a world and told to shoot dinosuars A bunch of weird ♥♥♥♥ has happened to me in my playtime. I have;  -Been butt♥♥♥♥ed by pterodactyls -Been eaten by a T-Rex, in which I sat in its stomach while in the first person view as it boomed around, stomping on my teamates while it was having a temper tantrum -Recieved enough credits to start buying stuff I actually needed and gotten kicked from the game due to a supposed 'Error with my internet' -Met a lot of friendly people who shared their knowledge of the game openly and honestly (I'm not joking, the community is really friendly) -Played games that never ended -Played games that ended quickly -Gotten negative credits (my record was -12) -Been pushed off of a cliff to my doom by a stegosaurus -Revived a team mate while I was incapacitated -Been blinded by the stupid HUD freezing mechanic -Lagged to the point where everyone was still playing the game and ♥♥♥♥ but I couldn't damage the dinos or even use any ammo in my gun  Overall, it's a ♥♥♥♥ game. But the potential it has is amazing... It just needs polish. Then it won't be ♥♥♥♥.   Oh yeah, and ♥♥♥♥ pterodactyls. Most overpowered ♥♥♥♥ since ACR/noobtube/scavenger combo.

2053	0	a	this is a horrible game
2054	0	a	ORION: Prelude is a game about people fighting dinosuars in multiple game modes with weapon upgrades and player buffs as well as having the ability to play as a Dinosaur from Raptors to the giant Spinosuarus. On the surface, it seems really fun and a LOT like Primal Carnage, but this game is VERY buggy, which probably explains why it's regularly 99 cents. (I got it for 40 cents on sale.) There are very bad camera glitches as a dinosuar that make playing correctly impossible with the only solutions being either dying or re-joining the game. It's also isn't very balanced with players on the dinosuar side being able to pick boss dinosuars like the T-rex and Spinosuarus from the get-go, which are dinosuars that are VERY hard to kill with starter weapons. The textures aren't that great, the controls, especially for the Dinosuars, are very bad, the animations will kill you on the inside, and it gets very boring after a short ammount of time. This game may be cheaper, but I'd save for Primal Carnage or The Isle if you want to play a Dinosuar survival game. This game DOES give you lots of easy awards, though. So, there's that.
2055	0	a	One of the worst games I've played.

8420	1	a	This game is like Bubbliscious Bubble gum. You really think its the best investment for a dollar, so you buy it. At first, the sweet, blueberry flavour caresses your tounge, then it becomes bland after a half hour, so you begin stuffing more pieces into your mouth. After about 20 pieces, you realize that you've made a big mistake, and just shoved multiple chewy, corn starch-like objects in your mouth that provided no actual nourishment. Lesson: buy trident. Best game of all time. 11/10. Would recommend
2066	0	a	I bought this game when it was $9.99. I regret that decision.    3.6/10  
2067	0	a	other than it being ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ it's still pretty bad. models are janky as and it's badly optimized
8422	1	a	I bought this game and now it's free? Why? And do i get some bonus game items or what? Pls tell me I want to know.
2072	0	a	At first, i thought the game looked cool, you know, dinosaurs, guns, eplosions, Michael Bae, etc When i first started the game was on high graphics so i wasnt too fussed, turned it to low and i still got 20 fps when i can run dino d-day (much better dino game) at 60 fps on ultra!  i bought this game for my friends and believe me..........don't get this piece of ♥♥♥♥
2073	0	a	Personally, I hate it. I mean really not worth even 99 cents. The graphics are mediocre at best and the level objectives are compleatly confusing.not to mention that i don't even think you can play as a dinosaur in a game that revolves around them. It's like the developers said, 'Hey, you know what would be cool? If we had 'Call of Duty' and 'Jurassic Park' and put em' together!' Honestly, it looks like the game was made on a toaster. ---&gt;DO NOT BUY&lt;---
2074	0	a	One of the worst games iv ever played in my life.

2082	0	a	ORION: Prelude  Oh dear this game ... I do not reccoment this game ! This game is so bad optimized that it will run 40 fps if you have an nvidea geforce gtx 980. But there is even more ! The animations are wierd. Your opjective in the game is hard to know because you do not really now what you have to defend...  1 cool thing: There are HALO cars in this game !  Overall Rating: 2/10

2087	0	a	Not that Good.
2088	0	a	No, I do not recommend this game.  I played a few minutes of it and already knew it was just another crappy shooter game, if you enjoy shooter games, then yeah give it a go, I enjoy shooter games but not awfuly made ones.  0/10
2089	0	a	To sum up my experience: it's a crappy left 4 dead with dinosaurs with blur that'd make you think your eyesight is going bad. 'but it's only 1 dollar kappa' CHILDREN IN AFRICA COULD'VE EATEN YOUR DOLLAR! YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED.
2090	0	a	Good concept... but the game needs a major optimization overhaul. I don't mind sub-par graphics.... but this game has been around for a few years and boasts about the constant updates and improvements made during this time. That being the case, there is no reason why I should get ok-ish to somewhat bad FPS on this game with minimal video settings, when other games like Skyrim and Call of Duty run smoothly on MAX settings.... If you're into not-so-great visuals coupled with not-so-great FPS, then this game is for you if you're willing to throw away a dollar... As for me, I'm going back to my 'real' games that at least function well enough that problems are hardly observed....
2091	0	a	While the gameplay itself could be very entertaining, something is terribly off with this game. While I am aware my laptop isnt a powerhouse, that is no reason for the game to have such low fps. We have come to the conclusion of terrible optimization. Sadly, 2/10 for me, but I really wish it would work.
2092	0	a	Bought this one when it was on sale. Provided a bit of entertainment but then found the game a bit pointless. Maybe I'm missing something and maybe some updates have made it a bit better, but probably better off spending your money elsewhere.
2093	0	a	Fun idea, looked fun, was fun for one round. After figuring out how to play the fun really drops off.
2094	0	a	For 99 cents this isn't a bad game at all. Certainly it is much better than it used to be, and what it used to be was quite literally a broken piece of ♥♥♥♥. but now its become a somewhat fun game for about five minutes, then I got bored and confused and gave up. So, there's that.
2095	0	a	Don't.
2096	0	a	I BOUGHT 4 PACK FOR 2 GAP!!! READ THIS ONLY IF YOU GET SIMILAR OFFER!!! I was not going to buy this game... Ever really. It first came to me when I saw WTF is... W/e this was named back then(considering it has changed name in my own inventory by now as well who can blame me for forgetting) Devs claim game now is better than it was. I don't really have a line of my own to compare it to. However I can compare it to my impression from what I saw years ago on WTF is... .  IT'S F|_|CKIN SAME!  Yup, it looks same. Anything with a wheel controls like ♥♥♥♥. I saw nobody even try to use vehicles. Now guns.... Guns don't know what recoil is. I do... It took me a while to understand that they don't.   Ok, so no recoil, shity weapons,shity driving...  Shity... Dinos... Yes dinos ... I wont go in to AI ,or lack of it because there is some, I think it is borrowed from zombie/alien shooter. Dinos look terrible even for years ago they look terrible. Maybe my texture settings are not on high maybe res isn't that good (who knows? Oh right I and 3 of my friends cozz I bought 4 pack), but dinos and not only dinos, all visuals look like CRAP-♥♥♥♥ BUNCH OF OF IT SMEARED OVER EVERYTHING... Game looks grey even when it is not grey... If that was meant to be well then... Why do I say though that dinos look like crap? Well reason is simple: I played Dino Crisis on PS1 long ago. Those looked better. Heck I replayed it on epsxe couple years ago it still looked good. 15-20 years later (aprox.) this comes out and it looks worse. Something is wrong there.  Now I did say 2 things here First that I bought 4 pack of this so one game cost me 0.5 gap... About 0.8 suds each. Currently it is priced at 0.79gbp per 1 and 1.99 per 4 At this price you might as well buy it because: it is fun TEAM shooter where you and your team of friends will have fun. Co-op mode is the only viable mode here(do note however there are plenty of good coop games out there but this one is OK for a weekend or two)   HOWEVER that said  Second thing I said was that alien or zombie shooter has similar AI... As in it always goes towards you... IT IS HORDE SHOOTER SAME AS THIS. With many big significantly important things to keep in mind: Singleplayer, Story, Survival, Turret modes, upgrades, drop upgrades, perm upgrades, progression system shall I even continue?(no) so I'd suggest if you aim for single player or lone wolf experience... Spend 10.99 on zombie or alien shooter and play that...  Or hell better yet...  http://store.steampowered.com/app/630/  it is free And due to this I do not recommend this game
2097	0	a	Totally ♥♥♥♥ing booring game, spent 5 mins in spawn while wawe completed... I don´t recommend this game.

2106	0	a	The game is ♥♥♥♥♥ly optimized and the graphics are complete garbage. Even for under a dollar (what I got it for) it isn't worth it.

2108	0	a	My friend said its a good game. We're not friends anymore...
2109	0	a	Cheap and boring shooter about dinosaurs.
2110	0	a	You know what this game reminds me of? Left 4 dead. But then replace Zombies with Dinosaurs. Then make the controls built SPECIFICALLY around a controller. Then make half your targets airborne. Then make them impossible to hit. Then replace the other half with chargers and tanks. Then ♥♥♥♥ it sideways, call it Orion Prelude, and release it half ♥♥♥♥♥ on Steam with compelling looking art that does NOT look like the game in ANY way, then make it $0.99! 3/10!
2111	0	a	this game would be better if it werent just a plain wave survival game. theres no storyline ive found and it makes it boring fast
8434	1	a	best game na  bet plot best boobies best story best graphics best movement animations game or the year by ign-1965
8436	1	a	This game is so terrible, and steam should be ashamed for allowing this to be even released in the state it is in. I hope steam will honor a refund for the first time ever. Game is so buggy and crashes. Worst $9 spent.
2112	0	a	This game is a mindless, boring shooter. You are just shooting on Dinosaurs, wchich don't even pose a threat to you. Maybe the bosses are more fun, but i quit after half an hour because the rest of the game is just boring. It's not even worth 10 cents. It's just a waste of time.
2113	0	a	Well, Its almost FREE, But sad to say Its just a time of waste if you feel like killing dinos all day with no story Progress, No well drawn people, And dont forget the Gameplay. Overall-1/10
2114	0	a	dino are too hard to kill buggy menu server button wont refresh repeats itself 2/10 would not bang
8438	1	a	Candy crush &gt; farmville &gt; ORION: Dino Horde
2118	0	a	Saw the devs begging people to give the game another try, reinstalled. Game crashes constantly on startup  0/10 Free is to expensive for this game, they'd have to pay to play it, and even then it would have to be a lot
8440	1	a	OK so the previous review was about how buggy this game could be, and i ♥♥♥♥ you not, for some non sensical reason, restarting your computer has fixed it... IDK. it shouldn't have made a difference, but it did. I beat 10 rounds solo, no crashes.... On the PLUS side, i get to play co-op with my new friends *YAY*  Someone needs to find out why a COMPUTER restart fixed this, that's like unplugging a toilet by flushing the one across the street....  So...  AWESOME GRAPHICS, FUN AS HELL CO-OP, Able to solo on easy or lower, PvP matches for the psychos out there who refuse to murder IRL. Unlocks, LEVELING, oh and weapons... It's Turok Co-Op meets Halo Reach... ♥♥♥♥ing awesome   *FORMER REVIEW BELOW*Formerly the Brutaly Dissapointing Review    I want to love this game so badly, the graphics are great, the co-op survival is gorgeous, the controls are intuitive,it's beautiful, simple and fun.  So why the downvote? BUGGY AS ALL HELL! For 2 day playing it I've been getting freezing and CRASH TO DESKTOPS non stop, like NON STOP! There's only 1 solutions they say, Verify Integrity (done that more then a dozen times, no change) I reinstalled, i changed graphics settings which is BS becaue my rig can run BF4 on max with SSAX16 at 40 fps But it CONSTANTLY CRASHES TO DESKTOP What about solution 2? Send them the Dump File? guess what.. CTD don't make a dump file, i checked....  So what does the all glorious dev say to do? Verify The Integrity....again...and I pass.....again.  If it works for you, this is better then TF2. If it doesn't work it's the most frustrating thing because it's so damn good and you get a huge game 'bock clock'. It's almost as bad as getting friend zoned.  Don't expect them to fix the bugs, if it's broke for you it stays broke, don't expect help or patches. At least it was only 1 dollar. If it works though, you're are one lucky SOB   Derisat the Air Pirate
2124	0	a	So if you kinda have a old computer do not get this. If you have a realy old computer definetly dont get this. I dont know if you have a brand new computer maby get this  but its probely not worth the mony
2125	0	a	The worst FPS game I have ever played.
2126	0	a	Very fun trailer. All negative critic comes from famous game observers and positive comments from some random guys, I just glad i didn't see what it was before, because after 3 YEARS OF SUPPORTING it's just terrible.
2127	0	a	this game is realy bad it doesant even deserve proper grammer
8442	1	a	Worth the 0.99$ :)
8444	1	a	I've been having so much fun playing Dino Horde that I forgot to eat and died!
8446	1	a	I had some nice survival rounds with a bunch of people over the course of multiple maps. Sort of Killing Floor with dinos. Roaming some canyons with a four- or five-man party - on foot, inside tanks, mechs or other vehicles - killing a big T-Rex and seeing his ragdoll-body fall down in slow-motion was a pretty epic and satisfying feeling. The general gameplay looks and feels a bit awkward at times, animations and gunplay aren't as 'tight' and polished as one may know from AAA shooters, but it's decent enough, the Unreal engine keeps it together and gives it an alright look.   People say there are day-1-bugs still left, only obvious bug I've seen so far was a teammate getting stuck in a tree by flying dino tossing him in there. You can surely get some fun hours out if it - for 1,00 EUR a steal, basically. I still need to try the other co-op and PvP modes. Open world with day/night cycle and loot sounds interesting, just as beating up humans with playable dinos. And it seems the game is still being actively developed/enhanced.   The very bad metacritic rating scared me a bit, but it is apparently related to a much earlier, now-gone phase of the game, in it's current state it probably deserves better. No idea how many players will be left after the current free period. I hope it won't die too soon, it looks interesting. And I hope the netcode is stable enough. My first attempts of joining other people's games were greeted either with timeouts or lags. Then I found a good lobby and sticked to it until the host closed it down. It seems to be working with peer-to-peer mechanics; unfortunately - dedicated servers would make it easier to avoid such issues. Peer-to-peer games often trouble me.
2130	0	a	I would like a refund this game ♥♥♥ af and not what i expected wathc gameplay before buying not worth 50 cents
8448	1	a	Lemme tell you a story: One upon a time there was a player who was eager to get the 'You're Redikulous' achievement, so he hosted a game playing with his fellow friends. The group of dino hunters progressed as they withstood thousands of gigantic lizards. Two hours later, when they finally reached the last wave with the near victory in sight, the host started to run into a wall, followed by the message 'server timeout'.  GG  
2138	0	a	Don't get this game. Spend your $1 on a frozen coke at MC Donalds.
2139	0	a	birth controll should have been considered

2149	0	a	Being a dinosuar in this game is cancer... I couldnt even damage the enemy. Mega thumbs down from smeagol.
8454	1	a	What the hell do you even want more?This game is freaking amazing.For 0.99?!Do the devs even earn something?Or is it more developed towards the players than profit? It's worth the money.It's fun.Buy it.
8456	1	a	Halo... With Dinosaurs.
8458	1	a	  Is It Bad That My PC Cant Run This Lol
8460	1	a	OMFG, ok so to start off the metacritic review is flat out wrong and either needs to be updated or removed. This game is downright amazing to play with friends, its like every childhood dream, its requires skills and is super fun to play with friends as you can do large survival missions, the vehicles are epic and the gameplay lothough repetative never gets old i highly reccomend it and tell you to ignore the ratings!
8462	1	a	Best Game I've Played in a very long time!, In the league of Battlefield 4, Crysis 3, and beats NS2 and most of my other FPS games.
8464	1	a	Nice game
8466	1	a	ya can't go wrong with a 1 dollar game. Over 60 updates, awesome and a large array of guns. What do i mean by all this? GET IT ITS ONLY 1 DOLLAR IT WILL MAKE YOU ADDICTED TO IT
2160	0	a	dinosaurs had feathers  this game has no feathers
8468	1	a	this was surprisingly worth the dollar i payed for it
2161	0	a	Looks and plays like a Roblox minigame.
2162	0	a	This is just....
2163	0	a	The game is still crap even after all the updates its not user friendly and has texture loading and connection problems it doesent give you hints when playing. I TELL ANYONE WHO DOESENT HAVE THIS GAME {DO NOT BUY IT} i will give my copy away in a trade menu for 30 cents for anyone looking to buy.  This game should be bought by absolutly no-one. The amount of time making level's in this game should be the amount of time a player playes it for.  When you push sooooo many people away buy making a game that cost money that should be free you push away player's because of NON POPULATED server's this game is multiplayer but there is no one online to play with congrates because this game sucks.
8470	1	a	i love this game
8472	1	a	Its only a dollar or in england 0.79 I mean its soooo worth it as 0.79 or a dollar is nothing for this amount of fun im surprised at the cost. BRILLIANT
2168	0	a	So I started playing and looked at the wall because I was checking my surround. a dinosower slid up the wall doing the walking animation then began to slide sideways on the skybox while sliding it did not have a animation so it flew like a angel on sunday 
2169	0	a	Silly gameplay occasionally glitchy with floaty controls,wouldnt recommend
2170	0	a	Wasted money on this bug ridden game 1/10 would not buy bugged games again
2171	0	a	Ordinary, recycled, and just plain confusing as there is no tutorial. Wasted a $1.09 I could have spent on a chocolate bar that would have been much more satisfying than this game.

It's like eating sushi from a 711 but something in the sushi makes you forget show ♥♥♥♥♥♥ it tastes so you keep eating it. Glitches and broken mechanics usually ruin a game but not this one. This game is so bad that it's good.

2181	0	a	Despite the developer's numerous attempts, Orion is still an unwhelming game at the end of the day.
2182	0	a	This game is a ♥♥♥♥ing piece of poop pooo i mean the creators can just shove this ♥♥♥♥♥ game up their poop shoot and jerk off each others asian size weewee's and just ♥♥♥♥ this and guess what.......♥♥♥♥ U MOTHER ♥♥♥♥ERS this game can suck all the dongs in the world because it's a horny ♥♥♥♥!!!!!!! s............l..................u...........t.........and it may be the jews fault white power im rotting in hell. You're all a bunch of female dogs and u know what i mean. screw you adam thien suck a ♥♥♥♥♥♥
8482	1	a	this game has taught me to never give up in what you doing. this game went from a %35 aproval rating to %75 in 60 updates. the special thing about this game is the devs never gave up on what they thought would be a good game!
2184	0	a	I love a FEEL GOOD story, especially one where there is an underdog involved. I always root for the underdog. In this case the story of an underdog has nothing to do with a storyline that you follow in the game, but has ONLY to do with the developer(s) of ORION: Prelude. It is sad. Very Sad. Not because of what they went through as you would expect, but because their story about making a better game over time is ' more fictional' than the game itself. They may have worked hard but it is still TERRIBLE. Just because some people are willing to dig through the trash to find a half eaten donut does not mean it is good does it? How about a little day old meat? mmmmm.... that is what you get with this game at best... day old meat found in the back of a butcher shop on the ground next to the dumpster. If you like that, you will like this too!  MY COMPLAINT: They suckered me in to buying this game thinking that I was helping someone overcome a financial debt of time and love that they put into the shooter gaming society. As it turns out, all they did is waste my time and money. The only achievement they have truly accomplished is in getting a million plus people to buy something a million times for a buck... when it's not worth a penny! To me, that is the same thing as robbing people. They are problably laughing their butts off all the way to the bank while innocent people are paying them for trash. They are essentially bums on a street corner asking for a dollar. That's fine... I can accept that. But don't tell me that they have succeeded at doing anything except stealing innocent teens (and adults) money.  Bottom line: They say they fixed it, but it does not compare to anything else you will have in your library because nothing else LIKE THIS would have ever been released. It's that bad!
8484	1	a	RAWR IM A DERPY DINOTARD RAWR FEAR MY FANGS AND MASSIVE DINOCOCK I WILL CRUSH YOUR PATHETIC LIFE WITH IT  somethings wrong with me, I should stop typing now
8486	1	a	wow wasted 50 cents on this game and its f2p now lol 
8488	1	a	Holy ♥♥♥♥ i bought that game so give my back my MONEY!
2186	0	a	Step 1 make a game thats good and fun. Step 2 make money off of it. Step 3 make the game free to play.  These steps describe this game.
2187	0	a	this game is needs improving they should make the graffics better and make the game openworld survivel.
2188	0	a	I bought 4 keys... how is this game free?
2189	0	a	I didn't think they would make a game off my favorite novel Gay T-Rex Law Firm Executive Boner but they did and man that just gets me so flaccid like on a scale from 1 to wet noodle id be angel hair spaghetti.  But for real this game is an anal shipment of crap and I hope no one suffers the same fate as i did.  3 out of a George Forerunner.
2190	0	a	This is horribly optomized dont trust the requirents this game is literally a piece of ♥♥♥♥ Tbh tho, 4/20 ♥♥♥♥♥♥
8490	1	a	Similar to Killing Floor.
2192	0	a	i have more then 1 reason why this is not a good game (bad game)  1: i playeed this 8 hours then a long time not played and then when i want to play it (today) it doe not start so i look up forums aint standing me problem so i deleted and installed again and it said missing file but it stopt the download when it said missing file -_-  2: you need a good grapihc card and or good PC
8492	1	a	I still enjoy it. For the price of one freaking dollar per copy this is insane.
2193	0	a	dont buy this game evn if its for 1 dollar this game lags everytime. THE WORST GAME OF ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2194	0	a	Sucks. Game it self is fun but it is very hard to find a match that is not full, does not lag, or boots you. Fix that issue and game will be great.
2195	0	a	In this game you can play as a dinosaur who has to protect eggs and eat spacemen, or a spaceman who has to steal the eggs and shoot dinosaurs. I don't think much planning went into making this game, in fact I think this is just two different games, from teams who had zero communications with each other, shoved together and released for 75 cents. This is a game that Ed Wood would release if he made video games about dinosaurs. This is a game that Strong Bad would think of after drinking too much Mountain Dew.
2196	0	a	Buy this game for someone you do not like!
2197	0	a	terrible isay terrible game terrible i say who lieks dino's people that like dino's are IDIOTIC dino's suc k my ♥♥♥♥
2198	0	a	This game had a fun idea but failed completely in realizing it, its poorly optimised (runs de same amount of horible on whatever setting), the enemies are juist plain boring and the 'special abilities' of your class are just plain pointless.
2199	0	a	As far as shooters go, zombies and people are the only thing I like killing!  It's fun for a while, but when you've tried all of the modes, it gets pretty boring.
8494	1	a	Turok meets Halo. Good fun.
2201	0	a	Don't even bother buying this game...
2202	0	a	Meh, the game is O.K. i guess. If it kinda appeals to you, buy it. It's only 0.99$. But I wouldn't recommend it. I would rather spend 0.99 on a TF2 ticket. Right now it's just holding up space in my library. Kinda fun with friends.
2203	0	a	Crap game.
2204	0	a	MUST HAVE: fast pc in order to play right! very slow game, bad graphics. crashes when you least expect it! extreme lag, if you fix these thing would be a great game! (like tf2 but with dinosaurs)
8496	1	a	At one dollar, I would highly recommend this game.
8498	1	a	this game is so fun! i could just shove it up my butt yaa its that great!!! :)
2209	0	a	I played this game for 1.2 hours total. I feel so dirty, There isn't a shower that can wash away my regrets for accepting this game on my steam list.
2210	0	a	If you have an AVERAGE pc DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Very unoptimized to the point where it's not even worth the $1. But I guess if you have a pc that is Above Average, then get this game if you must. But why would you get this game instead of playing WAAY BETTER Free To Play Games?
2211	0	a	strated to get really ticked off bought the game it worked the first time i tried playing it and now it doesnt even load when i try to play it def waste of$1
2212	0	a	50% terrible 25% hard 25% nothing 0% need to buy this game
2213	0	a	why does the dev suddenly want money for this game? i know its low priced, but to me its not worth it. uninstalling now.
8500	1	a	Futuristic weapons Prehistoric enemies Turok meets Halo, absolutely blast of a game!
2214	0	a	I paid for this game and it got for free. How dare you people do this kind of thing?
8502	1	a	Its a single dollar buy it, you kill dinos and its fun.
8504	1	a	  my grandma had an aneurysm and instead of helping her and calling 911 i played this game instead and to be honest it was worth it because my grandma is an absolute nincompoop xdddddddddddddddD
8506	1	a	A quick pro/cons list of this game:  Pros: -Looks decent -Tons of game modes -Tons of character customization -Runs well  Cons: -Not the best graphics or animations -Not a huge playerbase -Really weird UI that reminds me of an arcade cabinet  The game is definitely fun, isn't too involving, easy to jump into a game on a moments notice and have fun. Great if you have a few friends.
8508	1	a	Very fun with friends
8510	1	a	this game is very fun if you have a decent computer.
8512	1	a	Why the ♥♥♥♥ did I buy this?  
8514	1	a	nice game worth 1 €
8516	1	a	could be better also could be worse 7/10 would bang againe ;p  EDIT: YALL BETTER FIX THIS BROKEN MACHINE CUZ AINT NO LIGHT THREW THE BROKEN SCREEN HONKY HONKY HONK  ANY OF YOU CRACKAERS WANA PURCHASE SOME OF MY METH
2226	0	a	There is a reason this game is $1  Firstly, for a multiplayer game there are rougly 20 servers at any given time, oh and about 18 of those are above 200 ping.  Secondly, the graphics are awful, they would have been acceptable about ten years ago. The game mode balance is hoorendous, some modes being ridiculously hard for the dino's, some the other way round. The gameplay is slow, clunky and badly designed. There is nothing good about this game, go and play ARK survival evolved as it is a much superior game.
2227	0	a	I highly recommend that you do not buy this game, because it's just a complete re-release of the previous game. The dinosaur AI is so bad, I'm sure that I could do better and the bugs oh don't get me started on them. This game is riddled with small and irritating glitches. I understand that sometimes it's very fun to play crappy games especially with a friend, but this is just too boring, broken and downright ♥♥♥♥ to play. The game has one of the most clunky and buggy menus I have ever seen in a video game and I've played kinect games which usually have shocking menus. ORION: Prelude does it's best to make sure that you do not know what the ♥♥♥♥ you are doing, and if you somehow work out what to do it kills all of the fun with bugs and ♥♥♥♥ AI. I had to think hard to find a good thing about this game, and all I can say is the graphics aren't terrible. But to even play on these settings you need a really good pc, because I swear the developers did not do anything to try to optimise this mess of a game. From playing the game, I have concluded that this game is just a load of small bits of other games glued together with ♥♥♥♥ (the warthog and ghost from Halo, the wave defense mode from Killing Floor and the gun shop and base defense from Empires). I swear the game feels like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mod or a terrible indie game cobbled together really quickly. All in all this game is a piece of ♥♥♥♥, do not buy it even though it's cheap you could spend that 80 pence on another game or something.
8518	1	a	Its really fun when you arent feeling a competitive mood and you dont feel like playing Counter Strike xD Super fun game with friends, really chill if you dont feel like doing anything
2234	0	a	First problem is... This developer makes you pay for the game, but then makes you pay mictrotransactions if you want to have any of the customization options with your carachter. Are you serious? A bit greed don't you think... pay for the game, and then pay more for base line options.  As for the game itself, It's fun enough for about a half hour... but then you realize there is no campaign, no story mode, no depth.... its just 'Survive X number of waves'.... over and over. Meh, I can live with that... but then you realize there isn't much depth to the gameplay either. The classes don't feel different enough from each other... and the weapons lack any distinction either.   Then there are the REALLY irritating issues like.... when you die, you have to wait 45 seconds to respawn.... and when you do, you are nowhere near your party, or the gear that you dropped when you died. Good luck making it back to the group before the wave is finished. On top of that, you lose your upgrades.... sigh,
2235	0	a	I want my $0.99 back
2236	0	a	Uninstall simulater 2k12

2239	0	a	Bought it on 2012 by the name Orion: Dino Horde and is a 4man pack too ! Played it once and left in my Library till today.  December 2015 Review.   How far Orion it has improve since this game sit untouched many years after my first gameplay. I would never imagine myself to touch this game again. It leave me a very really bad impression after my first gameplay but today Orion has make a difference in comparison to heyday.  I came back after I found out the reversal of the review been gaven, it goes from Negative to to Positive.One gotta see to believe. What can I say after a try out then letting this piece of game sit unattenended?!  Well... first of all, Do not expect any fancy or detailed graphic on this games,soundtrackwise is pretty decent and good to go with; to this you will find yourself TODAY Orion:Prelude is kind of Pretty-Cheesilly-Wonky-Onehella of Fun shooting game !! Seriously this game is FUN ! You will get alot of gun,ride a jeep,steer a tank,handle a Goliath and fly a heli-hover-plane-thingy. Not to mention there is lot of skin and hat to be applied from.  This game get really cheap when on steam sales. Buy 1 for yourself maybe a 4 man pack too as well. Sit back,enjoy the laughter and shooting frenzy with your friends. This game does earn a worth to be in your library. Give it a try today. It was insanely cheesy fun.  Well I feel like I'm the Marine in The Avatar and fighting that Blue Monkey and Toruk Maktor ! We are tryin to take over their planet after all !!!
8530	1	a	Worth my last 50 cents
8532	1	a	I love this game, best like 50 cents ever spent.
2240	0	a	You say the game is fixed? let me tell you, I have not been able to play the game without any lag! and I have a Intel Core i7 NEW! this game also seems largely boring, all my friends regreted the buy so did I, 4/10 (Broken Laggy Mess with some funny moments) this is a personal opinion if you liked it, then im very happy for you but for me its very broken.
8534	1	a	very cheap lots of bugs
8536	1	a	This is great game that is also cheap.
8538	1	a	You kill dinosaurs, whats not to love.
2247	0	a	Congratulations. This is the only game that I have ever seen to be the worst game of 2012, AND the worst game of 2015. They should get an award. 
8540	1	a	better than dino city tenoutoften hotornot bestgamepizza
8542	1	a	This game is really good. To me it play well. But I suggest seeing for yourselves.
2249	0	a	This game is a trainwreck
2250	0	a	Is it worth $.99? Sure. Is it worth your time? No
8544	1	a	The game is decent for the cost. The only problem I have with it is that is was gifted to me, now Steam is telling me I have to buy it in order to play it.
2251	0	a	I really wanted to play this game unfrotinately i get disconnected every time i try to join a server even when i get into one instant disconnect. i was looking foward to playing this but i made a mistake buying it.
8546	1	a	from what little i played of this it was fun but i didnt get much time into it 
8548	1	a	This game was so crazy awesome! with just the right amount of glitch and insane dino killing that i rate this game a 11 out of 10 for 1 dollar games!
8550	1	a	i love this game the feel and desin is uique and awesoe (not good at spelling so dont judge and my keyboard sucks)
8552	1	a	This game is to C.O.D. what Adult Swim is to The Simpsons.  If this makes sense to you then you DESERVE to own this game.  It's a Buck. What else are you gonna buy for a buck? A Candy bar? You'll get FAT. A Soda pop? You'll get FAT. A Cheeseburger? You'll get FAT. Don't get FAT, get this instead.
2252	0	a	Was a really fun game untill they wigged with everything...
2253	0	a	Its as bad as the title suggests.
8554	1	a	I Absolutly Love Fighting Dino's in Space! This is my absolute favorite steam find and i am looking forward to their up and comming sandbox game from Spiral. Keep up your Indi Gold.
2254	0	a	ABsolute piece of ♥♥♥♥. Would not recommend to my friends. This game is so glitchy and the gameplay is just absolute ♥♥♥♥. It's literally just a ♥♥♥♥ fest of awkward dinosaurs running towards you and you shooting them with you no recoil when hipfired gun. This is possibly one of THE WORST games of 2013/2014. Completely fix the glitches before you release the game. If there are a few glitches, I wouldn't mind. But there is one literally around every corner. Don't release a game that is still broken and is in progress. Even if it is on Earl Access or not. So yea. Enough of my rant. ♥♥♥♥ this game. Fix your ♥♥♥♥. Spend your money on something better. Like, Natural Selection 2. Or Maybe even a classic like Star Wars Battlefront 2. But seriously. ♥♥♥♥ this game. 0/10 would not play again. Waste of money. Peace.
2255	0	a	would never recomend (no teamwork)
8556	1	a	Played once and it crashed my computer. The Metascore is misleading.
2256	0	a	Won't run very well on my mediocre computer. Put the visuals down as low as possible and it didn't help much. The game seems fun but I can't play it.
8558	1	a	Boy do i feel sorry for you if you didn't get the early games hwen they were free. You would have got ths 100% free, and boy it is fun.  9/10 Would Slow-mo Shoot a Trex in the face again.
2257	0	a	really good but lagg to much idk why but its a really cool game to get on and play XD
8560	1	a	The best game ever made.
8562	1	a	Best game I ever played for $0.99.
2260	0	a	Not even worth $0.49
2261	0	a	This is an all around disappointing game. I spent $0.99 on it, and still got extremely depressed after playing it. ORION: Prelude is an FPS dinosour survival game, that focuses on simply shooting dinos before they eat you.   When I first entered the game, after playing five minutes, I knew it wasn't anything great- but at least at that point it was still worth spending one dollar to see what the game was like. Yet after each minute passed successively, it just got worse and worse. I realized that the graphics were pretty terrible, and that if you wanted to really obtain good gear, you would have to play for at least 30 hours, which I just wasn't willing to put into a crappy game that was not fun at all after 10 minutes.   Since then I've played a little more, only to realize that very few poeple play it, making it hard to find specific lobby of your choice.   ORION: Prelude is NOT at all worth the $0.99 it charges. It is disappointing and just plain stupid.
8564	1	a	it's freakin BIG and run so fast but FUN!
8566	1	a	OKAY game, people behind it seem like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s though.
8568	1	a	Very awesome game for less than 1€.So much action and the enviroment is just astonishing
8570	1	a	good game but not the best single-player experience 
2262	0	a	Unless you enjoy playing endless rounds of killing dinosaurs...then I guess this game is here for a reason...but if not, as usual, then don't even bother to look into this game, even when its on sale for 99% off, becuase trust me...its still not even worth it...like seriously, I am still doubting myself of purchuring this game...I want my $0.99 back fow
8572	1	a	Killing dinos is what i do :D
8574	1	a	The graphics for this game are amazing. On the highest settings you can see the detail put into the maps. The AI in the game is pretty well done, there are only a few times where a dinosaur will get stuck in a wall or rock. guns are fun although the sighs are all the same so hip fire is the best option. overal a really good and fun game.
8576	1	a	Theres no faking,I love this game its one of my favorite indies on steam!
8578	1	a	Amazing and it's even free to play now!
8580	1	a	A worth it dino horde game of all time
8582	1	a	One dollar, why the ♥♥♥♥ not?
8584	1	a	Amazing game bit laggy but isn't every online game other than that i love this game
2270	0	a	this is more disapointing than my son
8586	1	a	If you have some friends willing to play, it can be some mediocre fun. If you don't, you'd have more fun playing Warframe.
2271	0	a	I don't remember where I heard this but 'You can judge a fps by it's shotgun'. I tend to find this to be true at least in my case. Which is where I'm sad to say the shotgun sucks.
2272	0	a	I buggy $0.99 game. Lost nothing, gained nothing.
8588	1	a	:)
8590	1	a	this game is great
8592	1	a	I believe that we all had a dream of fighting or being a dinosaur. ORION: Dino Horde brings this dream to reality... well, at least they did it visually. True, Dino Horde may not be the most beautiful game out there. The characters you and your comrades control, run and perform their tasks in impractical and awkward manners, and giant dinosaurs break the laws of physics once their health points reach zero. Simply speaking, this game has a lot of flaws.  Though, I can't really say these flaws killed the joyous atmosphere when I played the game. The humans have amazing technology, which somewhat resembles that of the Halo Universe. On the other hand, despite their primitive traditions of chewing and tossing rocks, the dinosaurs proved themselves to be a challenge.  ORION: Dino Horde is not meant to be taken seriously. It's a game where everyone plays with a smile on their face. With a huge variety of weapons and abilities, followed by a decent number of game modes, Dino Horde is a game that offers a lot of alternative styles of playing the game.  Right now, as of the date this review is given, ORION: Dino Horde has the price of only $0.99. It's fun, hilarious, and suitable for both casual and hardcore players. If you want to give this game a try, now's the chance.
2273	0	a	THank God its only 0.99$.....  do i have to say more??? The game has no direction....Just dont waste a single penny on this game....Graphics is not good enough...dinosaurs looks like its made of clays and crayons....Gameplay is aweful
2274	0	a	No. Just No. Not even for 99 cents.
2275	0	a	how has this game been released three times and still isnt done 4/10
8594	1	a	the unintstalling process worked great.
2276	0	a	laughing just at the fact that they put random (fake? who knows) people comments on theyr video to show how good theyr game is..  'this game is ♥♥♥♥' randomguy25 'never hated a game so much' trollaccount4ever
2277	0	a	The game is a mediocre shooter, but the devs are the main reason I'm giving this game a negative review. I do not want to support developers that partake in asset theft. You can google the developer for more information, there is so much shady going on there.
8596	1	a	this game amazed me for 0.99 Euro! TRICKSHOTTING DINO'S 4 EVA    9.5/10 -IGN GOOD GAME WE ONLY DONT LIKE THE FLYING ♥♥♥♥.
8598	1	a	this game is gud

8604	1	a	Hainanese Chicken Rice Never Tasted This Good Before?! Good Price, Kappa Gamers.
2280	0	a	Very laggy and slow. IDK if it's my computer or not.
2281	0	a	its not very good its on par with or slightly better than browser based games
2282	0	a	I saw the metascore of 36 but the game was on sale for a $1.50, so I figured I'd take a chance. Well, I gambled and lost. Let's just say that giving it a metascore of 36 is being extremely generous. It's an incredibly stupid and poorly-made game; I can't wait to un-install it.
8606	1	a	I got it when it was expensive
8608	1	a	It's like a Counter Strike,with dinosaurs,and pressing Y will generate a FATAL HIT :) I love this game.
8610	1	a	Great game,  to idle for cards.
8612	1	a	Remember that this was $1? Now don't waste a dollar for this ♥♥♥♥ :D
8614	1	a	After getting a buff PC I can say this game is completely worth the .99 cents.  I honestly love this game, I wish more people would play it, I mainly have to hop in 100+ pinged servers.
8616	1	a	Great game!
2283	0	a	Just.. don't support them
8618	1	a	-10/10 Would get slapped across the map by a dinosaur again

2289	0	a	This game is only really worth it to play with friends. Even then its way too glitchy for my taste coupled with poor gameplay. I only put the number of hours I did because me and a friend turned the difficulty high up and laughed at the newer players getting slaughtered by an ocean of meat and teeth.  Would it be worth trying out? Maybe. But I would not recommend it unless you want to play a game with cartoon stupid enemy ai, cartoon bobble-head accessories seen on players, and a musical number that repeats itself so much that I have to listen to heavy metal to get it out of my head.  Oh yes and the Rex himself likes to throw giant boulders at you with his mouth
8626	1	a	make the dinos extinct again in a glitchy manner but sh:t it was (nearly) 99cents 10/10
2292	0	a	This game is not worth whatever it is put on sale for ever. Just not a fun shooter. If you want dinosaurs get primal carnage or dino d-day, anythingnother than this. SHAME, SHAME, SHAME, SHAME.
8628	1	a	Fun game, really. I love the Halo-like feel of it and the various classes are a nice touch. Some of the maps are repetative (and no I'm not just talking about the day/night maps), but are overall fun. I just really wish people played more of the other modes other than survival.   Them ost SEVERE problem with this game is the crashing and lagging.. the developers of this game really need to watch the 'Leroy Jenkins' video and find out what happens to a computer when you have too many enemies spawning at once! Hard to shoot dinos when they are lagging the Hell outta my computer! That and coupled with random disconnects makes this game almost more of a frustration than a game.   But Hell why am I complaining for $1?   This game is fun and if your computer won't take a dump while trying to play it, you're in for a serious thrill.
8630	1	a	Got 10 USD worth of coins in it for buying a 1 euro game.  666/10
8632	1	a	halo wth dinosaurs just epic

8638	1	a	if you like killing things then this is game for you  :)  
2303	0	a	Unlike the trailer said, the steam reviews are right. The only thing nice in this game are the art assets, pretty much everything else is garbage. You truly get the quality you're paying for.
8640	1	a	One of the funnest dong hopping gaems of all time. If you like dino-based autism and want to kill fugging dinos while smokan weed and circlejerking with your gayass ♥♥♥♥♥♥ friends, then this is the game to get. The leader of the company however is a greedy sociopath however.

2312	0	a	Like a poor man's Evolve. A VERY poor man. Just terrible connectivity, the menus are a mess, the dinosaurs are all glitching across the field; It's near impossible to shoot a pterodactyl. This one is an AVOID game.
2313	0	a	Dinosuars, guns and vehicles: The Game.  That's about it, unfortunately.
2314	0	a	This game is ♥♥♥♥in' ♥♥♥♥. Even the dinosaurs it has doesn't make it even remotely playable. Overall Rating: -4/10
2315	0	a	It committed the cardinal sin of having flying enemies in an FPS.  0/10 no just no
8644	1	a	This game has a bad reputation from previous and outdated builds. Its a ton of fun to pick up and play for a while.
8646	1	a	STAY AWAY FROM ME DINO!!!! &gt;:V ILL KILL YOU!!!! 10/10 would run from the dinos again!!!!
2320	0	a	this game sucks it lags way to much
2321	0	a	Not worth at any price. Steam service is horrid anyway.
2322	0	a	yeah, bought a full game several years ago and now i have a f2p moneygrab game instead that doesn't even show up in my libary anymore! i call this a huge scam and a facekick for everyone who ever spent their money on that game!!! i demand a compensation other than some ingame crap i can't even access for this -.-'
8648	1	a	A better dinosaur game than ARK: Survival Evolved
2323	0	a	This was a very quick review, because there doesn't seem to be a lot to the content. This game feels like an arena-styled, Jurassic Park meets Quake. You encounter waves of Dinosaurs, which get progressively more difficult. Killing these waves and surviving earns you points, which can then be spent to purchase new weapons and upgrades. Large Dinosaurs appear which you can fight and then assist in the capture of as side objectives for additional points. The game has a solo option where you have computer controlled NPC's assisting you as a team, or a multiplayer version where you can battle in a group. The graphics are slightly below average for games coming out today, the map board isn't very large and the game is very repetitive. Unless this is your cuppa java, I don't know if you would like it. I prefer better graphics, some kind of storyline, and less repetitiveness, but this game is more about Dinosaur Body Count. I wouldn't recommend it.
2324	0	a	There's a magic potion you can buy, that makes you forget you ever played ORION: Predule it's called bleach
2325	0	a	Making this free2play is a problem
2326	0	a	Oh god... at first I thought I was going to be able to write some hilarious review about how it was the best Dinosaur Survival Simulator of all time... but it's not.   To be quite blunt with you all, this is the worst game I have played in my entire life. And I have played a lot of games. This game takes the cake for being the most worthless piece of garbage that I have ever had the misfortune of wasting time on. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE COOL TO FIGHT DINOSAURS - I REALLY DID! But once I started playing, I realized that it just was not going to work.  I was able to make it through the first wave of a survival match, and after shooting down 8 velociraptors, I realized that this was not the game for me; or rather, this was not the game for anyone. Anyone who tells you this game is decent is a child with absolutely no experience with any other games, because I'm pretty sure this deserves the title of not only Worst Game of the Year, but Worst Game of the Decade. The only thing I was impressed by was how bad it was...  Graphics: 0/10 Gameplay: 0/10 Sound: 0/10 Fun: 0/10 Premise: 10/10  0/10 Would not reccommend to a friend.
2327	0	a	YOU KNOW A GAME'S BAD WHEN THEY TRY STEALING CONTENT FROM CALL OF DUTY
2328	0	a	Not worth a dollar. These people have ripped off other companies assets and are going to get a Dino Beat Down soon enough.
2329	0	a	So this game was earlier known as ORION: Dino Beatdown and ORION: Dino Horde, but it's not mentioned anywhere in store page and haven't exactly found any other reason for that than making it harder to find bad reviews. Thankfully I only spend under euro, but I already knew that I disliked Dino Horde and as game wasn't expensive I just bought it before realising this.   To summarize: even though it has every desireable PC options included thanks to Unreal 3, it's pretty unoptimized and looks hideous. I can't count how many times dino spawned right in front of me even when I haven't played that long, guns look, sound and feel really powerless toys, menus and hud feel like mess, filled one game with bot player and they are simply brainless and coop doesn't even seem to matter as long as you simply shoot even more brainless dinos.   Only thing making it worthwhile is price at this point, but I still wouldn't buy it. They should've just let this thing die ages ago instead of trying to rename it every week.   - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  Eli tätä peliä on aiemmin myyty nimillä ORION: Dino Beatdown ja ORION: Dino Horde, mutta sitäpä ei mainitakaan kauppasivulla enkä ole ainakaan itse löytänyt tälle mitään parempaa syytä kuin tehdä huonojen arvostelujen löytämisestä vaikeampaa. Onneksi en tuhlannut peliin edes euron vertaa, mutta tiesín jo vihaavani Dino Hordea ja koska peli ei ollut yhtään kallis niin ostin sen ennen tuon tajuamista.   Summa summarum: vaikka peli sisältää joka ikisen perusasetuksen jota PC räiskinnältä voi haluta kiitos Unreal 3:sen, jostain syystä peli näyttäisi olevan tosi huonosti optimoitu ja näyttää järkyttävän kauhealta. En enää pysty laskemaan kuinka monta kertaa dino spawnasi suoraan eteen vaikken ole edes pelannut niin kauaa, aseet kuulostavat, näyttävät ja tuntuvat erittäin voimattomilta leluilta, valikot ja hudi tuntuvat hieman sotkuisilta, yhdessä pelissä käytetty bottipelaaja oli täysin aivoton ja tiimipeli ei tunnu edes sen kummemmin olevan tarpeen kunhan vain tappaa vielä aivottomampia dinoja.   Ainoa asia mikä tekee pelistä enää pelaamisen arvoisen on hinta, mutten siltikään ostaisi sitä. Niiden olisi vain kannattanut jättää tämä tuotos kuolemaan sen sijaan että muuttaisivat sen nimeä viikottain.
2330	0	a	not even worth 99p its the worst game that i have  
2331	0	a	I think this is one of the worst piece of sh*t games i have ever payed for i want my .79 cents back. The graphics are horrible, the game is a laggy piece of trash. 0/10 War Z is better-IGN
2332	0	a	ORION: Dino Horde (DH) is an updated version of Dino Beatdown (DB) despite what many users claim.  Originally copies of DB were retitled as DH after an update, claiming that they are different games is similar to claiming that TF2 became a new game after they added item updates.  Onto the review.  Dinosaurs + Sci-Fi soldiers + Coop + Giant maps should equal unmitigated fun, yet DH doesn't seem to rise above tediousness, for the longest time you could connect to servers despite opening ports, stable connections or close proximity.  I will say that I have not played this game recently, and maybe the game has changed for the better but given my past experience I am not compelled to try it again any time soon.  Check other reviews who have played the game lately.

2334	0	a	its worth 1$ thats about it.. crappy sounds... crappy play.. crappy gfx and crappy controls.. but for 1$ its okay.
2335	0	a	This is one of the worst games I have ever played. Even at 99 cents, it is a waste of your money and time. In fact, I wish I could pay 99 cents to remove it from my Steam account.  Edit: I have since asked Steam Support to remove it from my account. Goodbye forever, Orion.
8650	1	a	Why can't I have a game in which I kill dinosaurs with ♥♥♥♥ing LIGHTSABERS WITHOUT CONTROVERSY
8652	1	a	bought this today after ORION was taken down, ♥♥♥♥ activision
8654	1	a	The best developers, the best community, the best dino-killing game. You just to hear that and watch a fast gameplay, so you can buy it.
2345	0	a	It's pretty bad
2346	0	a	American Servers only. So pretty much sucks for the whole world unless you can deal with 300+ ping
2347	0	a	I bought this game when it used to be called Orion Dino Beat Down, it is hands down the worst purchase I've made on steam. If only steam had their new refund policy back when I bought this game I wouldn't have this horrible piece of trash sitting in my library today =(
2348	0	a	dont buy that game, just dont. bugs like hell, flat storyline and gameplay. just dont buy it!!!
2349	0	a	the joke sale of the day -10% on 89 cents of total 'value' they say once they did a CONSTANT 90% off on the game.. in hopes it will get people to actually play this ♥♥♥♥♥
2350	0	a	What you would expect from a cheap game. Buggy but simple fun. I would only recommend this game if you and a couple of friends just wanted something to goof around on and not take seriously.
2351	0	a	Don't waste your money on this one, the devs went over to another title... again.  We will probably see more re-releases of this game in the future.

2356	0	a	this game is very laggy
2357	0	a	Like skyrim but without a development team.
8656	1	a	dont even. no. just. stop. no. dont. no. it isnt good. yes, i bought it. idk why. just let me go cry and wish i had used the money to buy a large rope and rickety stool instead.
2359	0	a	Everytime I shoot my, gun is delayed, but it did cost me just one buck. I wish I had never played (this crap), but I can't be bothered to give a ♥♥♥♥ (because it did cost only one buck. Still not worth it)  Just in case you wondered, this was an 'alternate rhyme scheme'. (ABAB)
8658	1	a	  rely gude
2365	0	a	One of the only games on steam that is not even worth a single dollar.
2366	0	a	I'm glad i tried before i buyed, the game is only $1 on special and i wont even pay that. It may say single player but there is no real single player story. It's just you in a multiplayer map. I lasted for around 10-15 mins before i got too bored to play.
2367	0	a	  I'd rather get stabbed with a Jagdkommando tridagger than recieve this piece of ♥♥♥♥ as a gift.
2368	0	a	I thought this game was going to be good because who doesnt want to ♥♥♥♥ up ♥♥♥♥??? Well no not at all this game is really boring and I wouldnt waste another second on it. This review is trash but I don't feel like listing everything wrong with this game because it would take me an hour
8660	1	a	Got it at 93% off and its well worth the dollar spent. This game reminds me of Turok the dinosaur hunter from back in the day. Graphics, animation and fun are all decent enough to have a good time. I recommend it while on sale!
2373	0	a	THIS GAME OMFG!!! THIS GAME FORCED ME TO MOVE MY HAND ON MY MOUSE AND CLICK BUY! IT COST ME £0.79 WHICH IS NOW GONE FROM MY ACCOUNT AND THAT IS £0.79 I WILL NEVER RECOVER! THERE IS A CHEESEY VOICE TELLING ME '2 DINOSAOWERS RIMEIN SNIKGDHM' HONESTLY... COULD THEY NOT AFFORD MORGAN FREEMAN TO VOICE OVER THIS. AND FINALLY, WHERE THE ♥♥♥♥ IS HARAMBE??!!! WOULD NOT RECCOMEND TO A GORILLA FRIEND.  I R8 -8/8 WHILST I FINGR MY PROST8.                              JUST A PRANK HAD £0.79 SPARE..........    STILL ♥♥♥♥
2374	0	a	ummm... uuhhh... why this game become F2P? ._.
2375	0	a	Don't believe what the others say. It is not a good game. I promise you. It is okay, but seriously, pick up Killing Floor instead.
2376	0	a	Good game, but the problem can hurt each time you starting ERROR.  Personally: I really like, I am very pleased with it.
2377	0	a	only had a few quick games but so far nothing to shout about, gaming seems boring and dull. The only apspect that impressed me was the size of the dinosaurs..some are MASSIVE. one to avoid for me personally.
2378	0	a	its good but a lil bit not ... you know the graphics and the movement try it your self and you will see
8662	1	a	It's alright..
2379	0	a	Maby a yes if you didnt steal.
2380	0	a	I only have ~40 minutes logged on this game - make of that what you will, but rest assured that I don't want to log any more time on it. Good premise, could have been fun, but the priorities are ALL wrong - a very pretty frag-fest with no atmosphere and nothing to hold the game together except scoring points. Dinosaurs don't behave convincingly, the maps are tiny, and despite having 4 Gb of ram and 1 Gb dedicated Vram the game doesn't run all that smoothly even with nerfed graphics settings. I picked this game up for 79p in a sale - I suppose it was vaguely worth that, but I wouldn't reccomend it to anyone at all. It's a poorly implemented set of bad decisions with no polish - they've left the fecking xbox botton markers in the menus FFS!
8664	1	a	for me i think the game is ♥♥♥♥. its not good at all but hey what can you expect for a 1 dollar game? Nothing!
8666	1	a	This game is wonderful. Buy it, you wont be sorry. 9/10 best FPS I've ever plated
8668	1	a	awesome game, awesome devs that stuck with the game for three years straight although everyone hated it
2392	0	a	poorly optimized
2393	0	a	could have used a dollar somewhere else
2394	0	a	Why is the T-Rex so loud
2395	0	a	This is a mistake.
8670	1	a	like a free much better version of evolve.
2399	0	a	Horribly Optimized Game That Looks Like It Was Made In 2003
2400	0	a	Whenever I talk about this beautifully crafted game I get emotional. It's just so wonderful and everything I've ever wanted in a video game. Huge alligators. Unrealistic dinosaurs. The amazing almost pixel like graphics. Wowza! This game is fantastic.
2401	0	a	This is a semi-good review.   it has great replayability but the core game needs some 'fixing up'   first of all if you look at the system requirements, you will notice that as soon as you start this game you will not be getting good FPS with the kind of computer it 'recommends'.  if they optimize this then I will give a better review.
8672	1	a	a 36 rating??? DAFUQ METACRITIC
2405	0	a	You know, I somewhat enjoyed this game. Cant really beat this kind of game for .99. I could rally a bunch of friends together and just go shoot dinosaurs. They didnt even have to have good computers. Just adequate ones and were on our way. I recently got my gf a gaming PC, and was going to get her this game.  I apparently had been living under a rock for the past year, as I had no idea the sequel was coming out back in December. I was excited. A better version of the .99 game that I had been playing with friends and loved ones. I decided I wanted to try and buy this game for her so that she could join in on the action. That is when I saw it. That is when I saw 'Mixed' for the recent reviews of this game, when it had generally been good. I had to check out what was up. I had to see what would make so many people badly review this game. Was there a game breaking patch? Nope. Worse.  After reading a myriad of reviews for the game from the recent fall, it became clear that this developer was not as wholesome as they would like to appear to the public. I dug into the recent debacle over the Activision DMCA, and what I saw was mortifying to say the least. A man, the owner of Trek Ind., playing victim and engaging social media wildly, starting far more fires than he could put out. To completely rip off guns from other games, and then blame the artist is shameless. Once is bad luck and I could see that being on the artist. But more than once and I no longer see coincidence. I see involvement. Either it was his idea, or they brought it too him and he gave the go ahead. Whats worse is that the artist likely cant even come forward with their side of the story as this a**hat has threatened to sue everyone for 'slandering' his good name with 'wild accusations'. Probably has some legal team ready to sue the moment he steps forward as they likely made him sign papers that would make him the fall guy in the very likely instance of this happening.  One things for certain: Trek Industries sure has earned a LOT of sheep. Reading through all of the posts defending this is aweful. Yes, Activision handled this poorly. But that DOES NOT excuse the owner of Trek Industies, or his handling of this matter. And then there is all of the other sketchy stuff this man has done... For instance: Funding your own indiegogo campaign to the goal just to get money from suckers. Sad. I dont know whats worse, the practice of this, or the suckers that fell for it.  So with all that said, I wish it wasnt too late to get a refund for this game. I will definitely not be buying the new Orion. And David, if you are reading this, please.... Please.... try to sue me for slander. It would make my day. You dont have a very good case becuase when you do stuff over the internet it is never forgotten
2406	0	a	unless this game has been updated its a huge garbage factory
8674	1	a	The dinosaurs are just too easy to kill. Except for those god damn flying things. Worst enemies I have encountered yet. Think you can shoot them? No, they'll just fly out of aiming range. Think you can melee them? No, they'lll just warp through your fists unharmed. Think you can learn to aim and dead them? No, the game will turn to night out of nowhere and start raining so you can't see ♥♥♥♥. These ♥♥♥♥s are the bain of my existence and should be eradicated from existence. Thank ♥♥♥♥ they were along with all the other dino ♥♥♥♥s millions of years ago. They can all ♥♥♥♥ off.      Buy it now. 
2409	0	a	tHIS GAME ISNT EVEN WORTH 1 DOLLAR!
8676	1	a	Awesome game but it doesn't run on my laptop :(
2413	0	a	It's like Ark but without everything that makes Ark a 10/10
2414	0	a	Jurassic ♥♥♥♥ up by the devs what were you thinking you cheeky micebummers, ill have you know i once visited an eskimo reservation and they thought i was a god, to bad this game doesn't do the same amirte could've been the new civ 5 2/10 had some good times but never really did find out what happened to jacob degenerate 2 it was my favorite movie because when they fell out of the closet and samantha saw lucy with the gun i think i backwards exploded into the review section of blockbuster
2415	0	a	srly dont waste yout time on this ♥♥♥♥
2416	0	a	After booting my potato machine, I decided to buy my friends this amazing looking game. No doubt, killing dinosaurs will be a blast. After waiting for 20 mins downloading the game we hopped in with high hopes. I will tell you right now, that the trailer is deceiving. The game runs at a solid (revolutionary) 20 frames per second. The game has a wonderful soundtrack if we could hear it without stuttering. What this game needs is to get out of the Dinosaur age technology and get optimized! (Also needs cheezus crust)   'This blows' - hanxshan 1/29
2417	0	a	Please don't remove this negative review. I am but a wee boy.
2418	0	a	.....
2419	0	a	this game sucks like Robin Chuuj
8678	1	a	I belive it used to be $10.99 when I got it. Good game though.
2426	0	a	needs update and help graphics drains to much cpu and speed sucks need more charecters
2427	0	a	Would you like give away 99 cents to steam, thats basically what you are doing when you buy this game.
8680	1	a	i bought the game for 50 cents but then I refunded it so now i'm probably gonna get it again now that it's free. It was a pretty good game but if you want a real masterpiece you should play this:  http://store.steampowered.com/app/362930/ 
2429	0	a	I would rather eat a dollar bill than use one to purchase this game. The name of the game may change but the development time might as well been put elsewhere, and even for a dollar there are better games out there that will allow you to keep your friends and your dignity. My love for dinosaurs is officially as dead as they are.  Overall 9/10 some of the art is 'kay.  EDIT: The two friends I played this with are now lovers and refuse to speak to me.
8682	1	a	i so love this game i hope they would give me a code for this :(
2437	0	a	Absolutely horrible, don't buy this game at any cost... there is a reason it's price has been cut so much, they couldn't pay me to play this garbage. I could forgive a lot of things in it, the bugs, horrible graphics, and boring gameplay if it was a early access to a degree, but this is a FULL RELEASE. Avoid at all costs.
2438	0	a	Im not sure what to say.   I got it for 1 dollar yet I still feel a little ripped off  you can still try it I guess  Maybe I played too little because I couldn't find anyone who would play
2439	0	a	Horrible, horrible game.
8684	1	a	I love it, worth all of the 0.99 cents i spent +50. The gameplay is fun, killing dinosaurs in mechs, tanks, aircrafts, with bows, lmgs, rocketlaunchers, 3 classes.. It's awesome. Don't see what all the hate is about.
8686	1	a	fun game to play with friends
2440	0	a	It seems good in the trailer, and it got a lot of good review but IT MOTHER ♥♥♥♥ING SUCKS PINEAPPLE! Not even worth those 0,49 Euro. You will regret this!!!
2441	0	a	I needed a gaming desktop to play this wtf  that's not why I got the gaming desktop don't worry

2449	0	a	This game was Very Laggy okn my computer and it is a quallity one. Even with it at its lowest quality i still had some problems with it.
8694	1	a	...Broken... This is the most BROKEN game i've ever played! Terrible frame rate, and looks like it is still in the alpha stage. The graphics are very low quality and it looks like something you do as a last minute project in a college game design class. If you are considering buying it... don't... pirate it first because otherwise your gonna be cheated out of money for a game that is just a re-release patch of Orion: Dino Beatdown. ...Broken... just wasted 3.3Gb of data on my computer
2452	0	a	LOL so bad, avoid like the plague. I managed about 5mins in a game before I got so bored with not knowing what to do. Also the dino's don't even look good.
8696	1	a	I am a stegosaurus!  But for real, this game is pure amazeballs. They got ya covered with all the cool stuff: -Dino's -Mechs -Rocket launchers -Overpowered compound bows -Tanks -Helicopters (?) -BABY DINOSAURS -NAZI BABY DINOSAURS (If your imagination is big enough) -Lightsabers -Pizza (Still waiting though...) -Achievements for just about everything  This game is a must try since it's even free now! (It used to be 1 Buck which was still amazingly cheap)
8698	1	a	I pay the game dafuq now its free :v jeeez
2457	0	a	Pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game. Boring from the head start. Didn't even finish one single game.
8700	1	a	  It's very awesome and fun for such a cheap game.
8702	1	a	What a fantastic co-op experience! I played this a while back only to come back recently and they've taken a great game and made it even better. If you miss the $1 week, shame on you, but even not on sale, Orion: Dino Horde is well worth your money.
8704	1	a	ayy why you bustin' my balls uh? I'm walking 'ere
8706	1	a	A glorious game. 360 mageshot a scrub ♥♥♥ raptor.  10/10
2461	0	a	well this game should be free it cost 72 cents? really? make it free plz
2462	0	a	very laggy even i use the recommended system
2463	0	a	I would not reccomend this game becasue the community is ♥♥♥♥. I say this from only needing to play 1 hour of the game. It is basically just a race to get the cheapest vehical and run over the enemy team with it before they do it to you. This game had a great idea however and was fun for the one time it that people didn't just run over the enemy team. If the games community was better I would reccomend this game however.
2464	0	a	This game is just pure trash ...

8710	1	a	Really fun, which wasn't expected. Spent hours playing this with friends.
2476	0	a	played five mins, on the menu that is, worst than cod with its host migration. Got a single player game to go, but it crashed before it got to the loading screen.
8712	1	a	Have a much value than 0.99$. Could get a better score than 36.  Olny problem is they release this game too early. :(  Not a bad game like you think, if you have a chance to play it, I recommend to do.
8714	1	a	when i open up orion prelude it keep saying not responding please tell me
2477	0	a	Not too bad of a game, but unfortunately, the devs are greedy morons who make no effort to treat their staff well nor clean up their product. The game is also incredibly broken.. play cloaker, cloak every now and then, and dinos run away from you... you're invincible.
2478	0	a	I really wish someone would've tagged this game with a 'Horror' tag before I bought it. I bought it today to play with my friend, then all of a sudden bloody raptors come screaming and trying to kill me! I was so horrified I literally ♥♥♥♥ my pants. Please tag this game with a horror tag to avoid such things happening again in the future.
8716	1	a	If you're wondering whether you should buy it or not - it's pretty funny shooter, definitely worth it's price, especially on sale. But the real reason I'm writing this review - maps sucks, they are awful.
8718	1	a	sucka butt poopoo dont buy
2483	0	a	I loved deleting this game !

2510	0	a	I paid 79 cents on sale thinking I was getting a bargain. I ended up camping on a mountain shooting dinosaurs that looked like they were created by a DOOM modder high on bath salts.   Hey devs! Bragging about how much this game has improved since it's release is like bragging you have the best hygenie in every Wal-Mart you go to. You put a bow on a broken toilet and I'm not even mad.   At least I got most of my investment back from selling the cards.

8724	1	a	IGN - It's like Halo with Dinosaurs! 8/10
2525	0	a	Worse game I have ever played!  WhenI saw it was was like 'oh ok, looks pretty good and ok for $3.74. And then when I started to try to play it(Nothing wrong with the game in proformance). It does not have a quick match!  In all only mulitplayer games, there servers are poor, there's no configures like Passward Only, or Not Full Games. Hunting down a game is stupidly hard, heres a game! NOPE! it's full.  The actual game play: If you are a starter player, then you will be kicked out of games.... a lot  Heres an example.  SNIPER! SNIPER SPOTTED! GRAB THAT SNIPER! LOOK OUT! SNIPER!  'You have been kicked from Server'  what the ♥♥♥♥?...   The game play part plays like Call of duty/Halo mixed.  And they only got 2 game modes Team elimation. Horde.  Which are boring because Team Eliminate only is 10 players, and you will die alot because of the leveling system is out of wack. and Horde, it just a tower defence but with Dinosaurs, and you'll be kicked out all the time.  -1/10

8728	1	a	im just a mailman passing through.
2532	0	a	Worst game ever. You stand around and defend a tiny base from hoards of mobs running in. No time to enjoy anything. Once you've done it once, nothing is different the next time. Throw it away and never play it again. Best dolla eva! This game is always on sale for 90% off $10, making it $1.   The only thing anyone likes about this game is that it was a dollar. Thats as bad as saying that it made you happy to give a dollar to everyone at the mall one day. Actually, that does sound like fun! But maybe a better analogy is that its like paying to go into DisneyLand, but instead of riding the fun rides... you start handing out a dollar to everyone. No one says no to your dollar, but no one really appreciates your dollar either, except the young children... who think your dollar is the best thing ever.  You know another anology? This game being a dollar on Steam, where you can get actual good games that are also on sale for $5, is like standing in line for half an hour to get a snow cone, then realizing your snow cone tastes bad and spilling it on the ground. The End.  Other things that last longer than this game, that are also a dollar? 2 snickers bars. a movie at the dollar theatre. a large drink at McDonalds. a can of spray paint. 4 cokes out of a 12 pack. a pack of mini flashlights. a box of paper clips. a rock that someone glued eyes on. your dignity.

2544	0	a	The graphics...
2545	0	a	For whatever reason you may have to get this game, do not. It has worse graphics than Team fortress 2 and runs about 3x worse than tf2. It's fre to play now, but back when itwas 0.49, i would have never reccomended it. It's free now, but my statement still stands. This game is NOT worth playing.
2546	0	a	  idk, got it when it was free, and the game didnt work. so now that it looks like it actually works, it trying to make me buy it, so i guess ill pass on this one.

2552	0	a	Big pile of trash, stolen assets. Terrible devs well not so much the innocent makers of the game who get sacked and replaced every ten minutes, its more the owners who run the company who are liars, cheats, and thieves. Avoid at all costs even if this game was £0.00000001 i would avoid.
8736	1	a	For 99 cents, this game does everything you want it to do. It is fun and you can get a lot of gameplay out of it.
2556	0	a	.
2557	0	a	I am sorry but whoever is writing this game is excellent now after some changes, well I dont know how bad it was before, but the controls are AWFUL, that is putting it nicely, I tried htis game this weekend since it was 99 cents, but after playing it for a few hours, its the worst game trying to play at a FPS that ive ever seen, this game might have had people buy it 20 years ago, the controls are awful , the characters move like bricks, there is no fluid feeling its all fighting contols constantly, the game is so unbalanced its annoying between dinos and humans . PLus there is a cash shop! I dont recall the last time I saw a game I had to buy then have a cash shop to contend with.  Even for the 99 cents I cant recommend this, but for the normal price I would TOTALLY WARD you OFF thinking about buying this, the meta crtic score is generious at 36! The game devs of this game need some serious practice and help BAD BAD BAD feeling game play!
8738	1	a	This is the best game NA.

8744	1	a	I would be more harsh on the game if it wasnt so cheap. This game gets old in 30 mins. feels like a N64 game and looks like one too. Poorly optimized. The list could go on but for under a buck and you are looking for a mediocre shooter that will give you an extremely short burst of entertainment look no further.
2578	0	a	In light of   this article,   I'm afraid I can no longer reccomend this game. It's a real gem, a real fun timewaster, but this is really rather shady. I cannot, in good faith, reccomend a game that has a shady buisiness policy and is run by a company with questionable practices.  All this over three sprites.
2579	0	a	Gameplay is good. Graphics are good. Consistancy of Bugs is good. Bad updates are good.  4/10

8750	1	a	jolly good meme 10/10  
8752	1	a	I think this game has a lot of potential. It could really use a campaign mode and just a few touch-ups. One thing that really buggs me was when raptors get up in your face, your screen is just a blob of pixels. The firt-person view on this game also seems unnaturally close to the ground.. like my character is a midget or something. I don't have a whole lot of time invested into this game, but based on first impressions, overall, I think the game is really fun and I don't regret buying it (although I bought it when it was on sale for .99c, If I paid $14 for this, I would be very dissapointed). I keep reading comments about how buggy it is, and I didn't experience any. Then again, like I said before, I don't have much tiem invested into this game. I'll definitely give it another go soon though.
8754	1	a	I bought the game and now its free $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$44
8756	1	a	The ♥♥♥♥ I never bought this, sooo um review probably a piece of steaming dog feces but probably good so [don't] buy it because is [isn't] good. There review done now to play a [better] game! 
8758	1	a	It was so bad, that I thought Infinite Warfare had been released early.
8760	1	a	this game is ok to buy in sale for £0.39 but if its more expensive then dont as the graphics are messed up no one plays and the game is utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t in mechanics.
8762	1	a	Add dinosaur mating and copulation and it will be perfect. 9/10 would ride some lady dinos again!
8764	1	a	One of the Funniest COOP Games EVER!!!!! Recommended 10/10 (Play with Friends only)
2632	0	a	I stopped playing and lost all interest after being forum perm banned because the devs think the steam forum is not a place to say things about a product in which and where it's hosted to directly download, Banned from the forum for Complaining about the disconnection issue at the end of the round  Disconnected from Host How annoying  Several threads   Really a Permanent ban from the forum well die in a fire. No wonder this game's not so popular.  If this game ever picks up the pace i would say they changed kiddie developers why did i bother with the 50cents in the first place all the signs were there to tell people this is not a good game.   I sincerely hope the person who banned me gets some form of cancer and dies because.
8766	1	a	I commited mass genocide of raptors by running them over with a tank. 10/10
2644	0	a	Is one of the worst coop games I played on Steam. I bought it when was $10. Also Prelude has very very poor performance, worst than Watch dogs and same like AC Unity but with worse graphics. The first version didn't have several optimization issues but still had and lot of bugs. Dino games aren't very good too. I can't recommend this game, absolutely. Is too bad, just play a F2P game or do something else, don't waste your time with this.  Uninstalled and will never be installed again. OVERALL: This game is too bad. 2.5/10
8768	1	a	It sucks
2675	0	a	I Think I Lost For This Game 8$
2676	0	a	Loaded up the game all excited to try out the updated version. Got my video settings set, went to the join game menu and servers loaded up and game crashed. Ok, checked out the workshop, loaded some mods, started the game up and got into a game in progress... waiting for round to end. I spawn, run around for a second. 'You have lost connection to host'. Back to main menu, ♥♥♥♥ this piece of gorilla ♥♥♥♥ game.
2677	0	a	I wasn't paid enough to play this.  From anim files that lose sync of each other to poor optimization, this game takes the idea of a dino shooter and turns it into hot garbage.
2678	0	a	Stay away! Dont give them anymore money please!
2679	0	a	i get kicked from every game just for being a low level? well ♥♥♥♥ this game

I hereby devote my very existence to driving a tank and shooting velociraptors on the ground and failing at taking pterodactyls out of the sky. ORION: Prelude is the pinnacle achievement of humanity.  11/10 would get stomped on by a T Rex again
2693	0	a	If you're thinking about buying this game, take your money and sign it over to your parents, and check yourself into an early 20th century style asylum that specializes in giving colonics made of dried sunflower seeds. 1/8 Handfulls of sunflower seeds

2713	0	a	Glitchy. Makes for a frustrating game. All I wanted to do was shoot dinosaurs. Couldnt find the damn dinosaurs... game crashed, uninstall followed.
8778	1	a	This game is honestly one of the best games I've ever played on steam! Endless hours of countless fun with friends combined with a game which requires great skill and strategy! I would recommend this game to my first born and tell him 'This is the game which revolutionised gaming as a whole! 10/10 would buy again      'NOT!' xDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
2726	0	a	Ive have spent so much time on this game (as seen above) that its truly sad that im writing a bad review for it.  I understand it is a one dollar game but many free games like flash games and warframe top this game. The hard work and time ive put into this game could have been spent with family so the moral of this review is dont play this game for hours apon hours when it is a bad game, ive suffered so you dont have too......91039/12....would play again.....maybe......not.....definitely not....

8786	1	a	Dinosaurs and Jetpacks, what more can i say.
8788	1	a	very exciting gameplay and fun to play with your friends :D
2728	0	a	Some games are quite simple, yet very enjoyable.That happens beacuse they surpass our expectations, proving to be more than just a simple game.In ORION:Dino Horde`s case, it`s the exact opposite: the games promisses too much and ridiculously fails at delivering it.Old looking graphics(not on purpose) , dumb A.I. and constant lagging and crashing problems make you wish someone more competent had developed this.No, the metacritic score is not so misleading as they say.
8790	1	a	NIce game  Really cool with friends
2729	0	a	This game gives the feeling that it was assembled out of models bought off of stock bmodel website. Gameplay is meh. UI is meh.   1/5
8792	1	a	It's a dollar, if you're reading this and its not in your library, you don't deserve to exist... simple as that.
8794	1	a	BEST TREK GAME EVER 
8796	1	a	Epic fun. Amazing game for the price. Tons of fun.
8798	1	a	If we move aside some visual bugs and that the modeling of the characters is not like we used to see in newer games, this game is absolutely worth the money and time.   Very fun to play, excellent co-op game with survival - would recommend to buy!
8800	1	a	Pretty Good game
8802	1	a	Got htis during the steam sale and i am impresesd with it. It's really fun and is definetly worth the 99 cents or if you get it during the winter sale 74 cents. I would pay atleast 2 dollars for a game like this. has pve and pvp modes.
2733	0	a	Its so freaking laggy i don't recommend it. I barely could move
8804	1	a	the game is awesome went it come to the guns you can use. the one thing i have problems with is i always die by t-rexs
8806	1	a	Dinosaur's+FPS+Horde mode+upgrades+vehicles+5-player coop + 0.99$ = why haven't you bought this yet?
8808	1	a	Ran around with a knife stabbing and eating volociraptors 10/10
8810	1	a	Orion is a game worth playing, but is also likely never going to achieve the critical mass necessary to be as big as it deserves. The ambition of the developers is apparent in the massive, multi-level arenas, the scale and power of the larger dinos, and the range of abilities and equipment with which you can kit out your Tron-esk soldier. There's a tremendous variety of game modes as well, including multiple variants of PvE, PvP, and PvPvE. The three classes of soldier (Assault, Support, and Recon) each have their own tree of persistent skill unlocks, and a microtransaction shop gives you plenty of options for purely cosmetic customization. Orion is largely satisfactory in terms of the quality of its graphics, and even surprises with neat environmental effects and an excellent day/night cycle (the night is actually dark, and can add real tension to a match). In short, it is absolutely worth picking up at full price.  So why did I start my review with such ambivalent language, if I'm willing to recommend a purchase? Because I'm skeptical that Orion is going to live up to its potential; the variety of equipment and abilities I mentioned above is present, but in dire need of an overhaul in order to establish clear class roles (or roles, period, if you want to drop the A/S/R distinction entirely). Server caps are set at 10 total players, which means those massive, multi-level maps feel deserted. PvE modes will see you fight a T-Rex with a tank (or a tank with a T-Rex, in PvP), which is cool, but they'll also see you use the same tactics against the dinos over and over again because their behaviour is both predictable and exploitable, which is not.  I want to be wrong about this, but the game came out in 2012, and it still features what I feel are considerable design flaws. It is absolutely worth picking up - I've even bought several gift copies just to encourage people to try it out - but prepare to break out your disappointed father voice at some point while playing.
8812	1	a	Didn't expect too much when I bought it, but this is definitely worth the money I paid for it, and more. A surprising amount of fun in such a small package. I would recommend this to anyone.
8814	1	a	I really like this game. I mean how can you not like a game that is under 1.00 that has DINOSAURS! Kinda glitchy from time to time, but did I mention under 1.00
8816	1	a	For .99 cents, it's a steal. Me and a group of friends have had a blast playing hours for random silly achievements and exploring each map. Lots of different weapons and semi-permaperks you buy with in-game cash per match.  Price/Hour ratio 10/10 Replayability 9/10 Variety 8/10  Overall 10/10
8818	1	a	Game is unfinished and buggy, but wow. I just fired 1000 bullets continuously into a horde of T-Rexes wearing Triceratops masks.
8820	1	a	I got knocked off a cliff and disconnected from the server 10/10 game of the year.  The game play was fun and fast paced yet some dinosaurs glitched through rocks alot.  Yet, I shot a stegosaurus repeatedly in it's ♥♥♥♥ and it died! What more do you want from a fps?
8822	1	a	If Bungee made an 'A Land Before Time' game this would be it.
8824	1	a	This game is game but also hilarious. I would recommend this game if you have some friend to play it with.
8826	1	a	Gotta say, It's a fun game. Super cheap,   if you play with friends in a versus game (taking off all the abilities of the human team) it feels more jurrassic park-y to me. Sure jetpacks are fun, but the real challenge is doing it all without any special help.  9/10
2737	0	a	It had dinosaurs. It was ok, just not great. Could use some more varying of weapons.
8828	1	a	Stalin approved.
8830	1	a	I LOVE DINOS and the game and its only 45 cence but i don't know how to get cc points i recmend this game for 8+
2738	0	a	other poeple may like this but i hate waiting half an hour just for about 3 minutes of little fun :/ 3/10
8832	1	a	Best 59p ever spent 10/10 would buy 4 times more
8834	1	a	It's a real fun game when you have dinos and explosions going boom all around you 
2739	0	a	If you're crappy and you know it, syntax error *glitch glitch*, If you're crappy and you know it, syntax error *bug bug*, If you're crappy and you know it, The Steam front will surely show it, If you're crappy and you know it, syntax error *pfft pfft*.
8836	1	a	I honestly only got this game because it was 50 cents, but I would have paid full price for it after playing it. It is one of those games you play with some buddies on a Friday night. Its really fun, and even though there are in game purchases, it is only cosmetic and don't really affect gameplay. All-in-all, its a 8/10.
8838	1	a	Way too much fun! Except there needs to be a 'Reconnect' button when you get disconnected from a server.
8840	1	a	you get to punch dinosaurs
8842	1	a	This game is actually Fun™.
8844	1	a	This game was released as a buggy mess. After it was rereleased it was still crap. However after about a year of patching, this game is great. BUY IT!
8846	1	a	I can no scope a T-Rex in the face in slow motion, causing it to fly into the air.  1/1 Would dino-scope again.
8848	1	a	What are you waiting for??? You get to shoot rocket launchers at giant crocodile's in the face while flying, in slowmotion!!! 38/10
8850	1	a	If you're looking for a game to have fun for a few hours - i recomend this. You probably wont play it for weeks on end, but an hour every now and then with friends, sure.
8852	1	a	My expectation were low as I bought this game for only 0,80$... But its been a big suprise as I think this game is awesome. Its pretty simple, the learning curve is low and its nothing new. But I found myself getting addicted to simple but yet fun gameplay. If you bought it just because it was cheap really give it a try!
8854	1	a	This is such a great game for such a low price. I would pay more. Pros - like call of duty zombies except its dinosaurs - intense and immersive - I got it for 39 pence  Cons - Can be laggy - Controller is kinda needed in my opinion  A great game to gift to a friend
8856	1	a	Yes this game is very fun. It brings out your inner 6 year old blasting dinos and such.
2741	0	a	Gameplay is nice. But they could make some imporvements.
8858	1	a	Not bad for the price.  Its like zombie game without the zombies. Plus the old school counter strike.
8860	1	a	Probably..... yes.....
8862	1	a	i thinks anyone can buy this game :D (becouse it's really cheap), slay some dinosaurs with your friends :&gt;
8864	1	a	Great Game. I love to play!!
8866	1	a	Got killed by a tiny dinosaur after defeating 100's of huge ones 10/10 would do it again
8868	1	a	Although this game has countless bugs and not exactly the best animation, it is still a very great game. This game is definitely worth $1 or maybe even more. I will admit it is not the best but not the worst. ( If you purchase this game, get the 4-pack because it is 1,000,000x better with teammates.)
8870	1	a	Nice game for low price :)
8872	1	a	Beheaded and carried by a pterodactyl, dropped on the back of a tricerotops, where i rode it across the map too its death, hwile my teammate was thrown into a mountain side and pummelled by a boulder thrown by T-rex. 10/10
8874	1	a	Like dinosaurs? What about laser guns? Or maybe fast and strong vehicles? Yes? Then this is the game for you! 10/10
2743	0	a	Don't play this.
8876	1	a	Don't let the price scare you away! This is actually a really fun game. It might not be a huge game, but it is very well made and a very satisfying FPS romp. The larger dinosaurs take a while to kill so you get to throw a satisfyingly large amount of ammo at them.   You can easily create our own server to play with your friends. With the low price and ease of entry it makes a great game to play with your friends at a party. Each player will need their own computer.
8878	1	a	If you enjoy those 'quarter' arcade games, this reminds me of them, except quarter arcades are now 4 quarters and this game was half of that. I'd say I spent my 2 quarters worth. Its actually rather fun, I was very surprised. The dinosaurs could look better (they have that floppy 2D feel that makes you think they are 3D while on ground level) but its still great and I think gives it that charm. Can't complain for the cost.
8880	1	a	A great game the objective of the game is to survive and protect your base from hordes of dinos.  After awhile bosses start spawning and your team has to work together to defeat them.  Your earn money by getting kills which you can use to buy weapons.  With 3 unique classes I could spend hours on this game.   Would I reccomend: Yes
8882	1	a	This is less than a big mac, and it last longer. Buy it
2744	0	a	Game might be fun but all I get are errors when trying to connect to a game...too early to say it's a waste...but don't really know how much more time to wait to play a game.
8884	1	a	This game has the premise of being a killing floor but with dinosaurs.  This game is fun , but it falls short a bit later when all you see is dinosaur blood, then you're all like:  Why am i playing this? It is very cheap tho, if you don't have it buy it it has an hour or three of fun then it is all grinding. I give this game a 5/10
8886	1	a	This game went through a lot so I'm rewriting my review after the big prelude update.  So let's get directly to the point : for 1$ this game is great.   You have a huge variety of weapons and perks with which you can shoot dinosaurs, there are 3 classes each one with a special ability (even if the one with the jetpack is the most fun to play and therefore might be the only one you'll be playing) and you also got a couple of vehicles.  And that's it, there are tenth of game modes, but most of them aren't that interesting and conquest or survival are the only ones worth it. There is another playmode where you play human team 1 vs human team 2 vs dinosaurs which is really interesting but there are just not enough players to play this. You can also play as a dinosaur, but once again you need to find a rather full server which can be difficult (at least in EU)  And bring a friend to play this because this game is I gotta admit very quickly boring in Solo, but if you can just convince a single friend to play this you will be entertained a couple of hours. I've spent about 26 hours in this game and I don't think I will relaunch it any time soon because I did everything that was possibly fun with friends (survival, conquest, workshop maps, trying all classes and weapons, playing as a dinosaur)  Finally let's talk microtransaction. Well they are not interesting, you can buy a couple of skins for your weapons, characters, dinosaurs and that's it. You can also buy hats which are quite ugly ^^' So I see no interest in paying for this. But at least the microtransaction do not make the game unabalanced.  So Orion dino beatdown is a 1$ game offering something like 20 hours of fun game before it becomes repetitve. But that's a good deal I think. 7/10
8888	1	a	I have to question how much a person really likes videogames if they've never wanted to fight dinosaurs. Here you can do it cooperatively and with outrageous weaponry. Disregarding how ludicrously low priced this game is, you should get it 'cause it's fun.
8890	1	a	Very fun to play with friends
2746	0	a	i want my 49 cents back
8892	1	a	This game is pretty awesome, I love it.
8894	1	a	I won this game in a giveaway, at first it didn't seem like it was going to be fun. Then i connected to my first server...  Its great fun a great survival wave based game (if that makes sense)  Its like Call of Duty : Zombies but without the Call of duty, and with dinosaurs... Plus Halo  Its actually a fun game i do reccomend buying it becuase for a cheap game its very good, because most 'cheap' games are £1+ and don't include much fun or effort. but for such a low price this game is by far the best on on steam! why not give it a shot :D  10/10 would win again
8896	1	a	With very basic controls, and an all-to-familiar gameplay style, I still have to like this game. Very good price to pay for a fun FPS with dinosaurs thrown into the mix.
8898	1	a	for the price, just play it. it is a crap ton of fun.
8900	1	a	i likie this dame it smells good and is fast paced
8902	1	a	Great game, but it needs more video and graphics options.. for $1....Definitly worth it though.. 7/10
8904	1	a	it's cheap, it's fun, it's something that you would want to bring to a party with friends or play by your self, and who doesn't like dinosaurs.
8906	1	a	You can kill thousands of dinosaurs with a bow and a grenade launcher
8908	1	a	This game is pretty awesome. If you are a fan of the Halo feel and dinosaurs, love muliplayer slayage, then you would really like this. It is easy to learn and adapt to, and it is very fun to kill the dinos. For a game without a campaign story, this is defintely a game that exceeded my expectations. Besides, for the price, you can't beat it. ($.53 at the time I bought it).
8910	1	a	This game is so bad.
8912	1	a	if you can get it cheap buy it, the game its fun to play with friends and it's dirt cheap.
8914	1	a	This game was actually alot of fun! It suprised me
8916	1	a	Killed a T-rex, it glitched into the earth and then flew 1km into the sky.   10/10
8918	1	a	Well, it's a dumb game... but it is a ton of fun! What could u like more? I mean, how many FPS out there are $1 where you get to shoot dinosaurs?   It's awesome.
8920	1	a	Gameplay like COD/Halo + Vehicles from StarCraft 2 + ArtStyle like Borderland = THIS AWESOME GAME and its more awesome with friends!
8922	1	a	14/10 Would pay mere cents to gut a T-rex with a lightsaber
8924	1	a	It is honestly alot of fun. I enjoyed the old Dino Horde as well. It is funny how the joke enemies were added, like the Pirate Compy for example. I would suggest they could add some new dinosaurs. I just wish they add the Argentinosaurus that actually has a million health, the stomp ability, and capable of causing mutiple fatalities. Also a few other types of dinosaurs like one that acts like a Velociraptor but can spit purple venom could be the Cryolophosaurus, a rham-sized pterosaur, the Tapejara, an Oviraptor, faster and deadlier than the Raptor,an Allosaurus that acts similar to the T-rex but can run faster, and a Carnotaurus, a carnivore half the size of the T-rex and can charge at great speeds, running over players. Since some dinosaurs cant heal in PvP modes, some ambient prey that can spawn almost any where you go on any map can help them alot even players who are lost in conquest maps by healing them (if they can cook it) and give them credits. Here are some ideas of the ambient prey: Pterodactylus- reward $50, heal strength 10-30 Orodromeus- $25, 5-10 Dodo Bird- $10, 20-25 Gallimimus- $60, 40-60 Pachycephalosaurus- $70, 80-95 *fights back* Dimorphodon- $50, 10-30 Moetherium- $100, 60-80 Deltatherium- $1, 0-3 (a large brown rat the size of a compy) Protoceratops- $150, 70-100 *tamable* Ankylosaurus- $500, 800-1000 *fights back* Meganeura- $5, 3-5 (comes in 2 colors) Lepidoptera- $5, 3-5 (a large butterfly that comes in 3 colors) Psittacosaurus- $25, 30-50 Parasaurolophus- $1000, 500-750 Arsinoitherium- $500, 250-475 Tupuxuara- $80, 40-55 Brachiosaurus- $3000, 5000-10000 (found in large maps, such as conquest) Hylaeosaurus- $150, 70-100 *tamable* Diplocaulus- $5, 5-10 Coelurosauravus- $5, 1-5 Glyptodon- $30, 10-30 Icarosaurus- $5, 1-5 Karaurus- $5, 1-5 Triadobatrachus- $1, 0-1 Eudimorphodon- $300, 100-142 *fights back* Archaeopteryx- $10, 5-15 Nomingia- $5, 5-10 *common nuisance* Caudipteryx- $5, 5-10 *common nuisance* Sinosauropteryx- $5, 5-10 *common nuisance* Along with these other ideas, they should also add in the enemy team we have seen in the other version of ORION Prelude on  kickstarter.com . If they allow these ideas to go on the game, I would recommend this game, but if they cant, I understand. But I still enjoy this game even when it was Dino Horde.
8926	1	a	best Coop for 0,49€ ever *_* lots of fun
8928	1	a	it's good and cheap it's really fun online but i havn't been able to hav too much fun as both my school laptop and my 5 year old laptop are crap so i can't really judge the bugy parts cause it's probz my cpu
8930	1	a	Costs next to nothing, but all the fun of games 10x, even 50x, its price. Buy it if only to have a game to play with friends. Drop-in, drop-out, play for 5 min, play for 5 hours. Great muliplayer. I mean you can fight a T-Rex in a mech. Do I really need to say anything else?
8932	1	a	Sold!  For a buck.
8934	1	a	It doesn´t seem a complete game, it has a lot to improve. But it´s cheap and funny, worth the price ^^
2748	0	a	THIS GAME ISNT WORTH THE SECONDS OF YOUR LIFE TO DOWNLOAD IT.
8936	1	a	It is so bad, it is good.
8938	1	a	Best Game on PC loving every minunte would pay 50 times the actual price for it
2749	0	a	Keeps freezing tried everything but nothing works
8940	1	a	Halo with Dinosaurs for 49c...i'll take it.
8942	1	a	One of the funnest multiplayer games i've played
8944	1	a	I paid 49 cents, killed some dinosaurs, had some fun.   Can't do much else with 49 cents these days.
8946	1	a	50 cents. Wow you guys are desprate
8948	1	a	Straight to the point: This is a fairly fun silly little game for the price.   It has some novelty. There are vehicles, and throwing a boulder as a TRex is kind of satisfying. You can fight off waves of AI or you can play competitively arena style. It has a variety of modes so you can mix things up a bit.  You probably won't be playing this game every day. I recommend buying it with a few friends, and you're probably going to get more than your money's worth of a good time out of it.
8950	1	a	Best lag simulator stil available for a low purchase.
2753	0	a	You should not buy this game, your caracter is hard to controle, dinos are everywhere and moving too fast. This is not fun.
8952	1	a	piece of ♥♥♥♥ 10/10
8954	1	a	This game was worth the $1 that I paid for it! I have only played it a couple of times and they were really fun. This is a very good game to play when you feel bored of the other games that you have.
8956	1	a	Its aight
8958	1	a	Surprisingly fun. 7/10 only for the bugs, visual glitches and the stupid rain.
8960	1	a	It's pretty sketchy if you have a laptop full of crap but works nicely for Desktop.  not much conplaining but if you play with a laggy friend that has  a slow laptop, on top of that a whole party (plz for your sake don't ask!) with laggmiksagqarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr all over there laptop.   (.nur dna lla meht lliK)      Desktop: 8/10 play then  laptop: 6/10 kill your friend.....
8962	1	a	♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥es
8964	1	a	Really, really, REALLY fun game. Gotta buy it, great with friends!
8966	1	a	Hands down best 99 cents you will ever buy on Steam. On whim bought for son and his friends and I am blown away how fun this game is. Hope the developers can earn some money on this because they deserve something. Co-op or single player with bots only, but very well done. Get it now.
2755	0	a	o you ever feel like slamming your face into the wall, whether due to frustration or any other reason? This is the game for you. Everyone should play this game. If not just to appreciate every other game you've ever played pretty much. Maybe you just spent a period of time witnessing idiocy to the extreme and feel like slamming your face into the desk. Perhaps you just came from the cesspools of the internet. Just play this game. Results may vary.
8968	1	a	You're basically Boba Fett with a light saber, thrown into the world of Turok. 10/10 would keep killing Dino....**** I just died...
8970	1	a	This is an absolutely hilarious and entertaining game, it is way better than I thought it could be. Lightsabers, tanks, and dinosaurs!
2756	0	a	the AI is ♥♥♥♥ in this game
8972	1	a	10/10
2757	0	a	Last time i played game i just entered in had no idea where to get weapons no guide at all it was rly messy no tutorials graphic sucked those pictures they show on fb community group are far from this game and will never be good.  All at all it not $0.something with no reason....
8974	1	a	Dinosaur game for $0.49, why the hell not?
8976	1	a	cant go wrong for the price ^.^
8978	1	a	It's not the deepest game in the world but it's hard to complain at that price.
8980	1	a	About 3000 cloaked dinosours attacked our squad ... We fought for hours trying to defend our base. But the inviz. heads won . ( did i mention that these cloaked dinosours had cloaked only their body ? wierd right ? ) Because there was a second wave .  Second wave which had 6000 more dinosours than the last. 10/10 Would get attacked by second wave and revive our generator every 10 seconds .
8982	1	a	pretty rad shooter for a budget
8984	1	a	
8986	1	a	Highlights include: Sniping a Trex in the face as I jetpacked to safety Mowing down dinosaurs with a jeep like vehicle Beating velociraptors in the face Battling several very large dinos  Cons: Graphics are a bit on the simplistic side, especially for UI and player model Controls not configured to ideal setup on get go Different modes other than survival not as enjoyable (opinion) Some content must be purchased in game (not required for game to be fun, but still)  Very well worth the price, especially with friends
8988	1	a	Get some friends, kill some dinos; at a very very cheap price. Too easy? Try playing on Insane. Now go kick some ♥♥♥!
2761	0	a	Worst shooting I've ever tried out in gaming.
8990	1	a	Really fun game where you with your team need to kill tons of dinosaurs, big and small and you need to do objectives like check the point or somethin ! You have about 10 weapons for each class and some special weapons for each class only, but you can buy in-match perk that gives you acces to all weapons in-match. You can cuztomize your character look and camoflague of your dinos, but only for these you are playing, not for those that are attacking you. You have many perks o buy in-match and there is a lot to do ! Its one of best Co-op game and its still updating and giving you even more of these things. It have steam workshop too where you can download even more maps and game modes ! The graphics are not the best, but they are on really high level, my pc that handled Skyrim on ultra, nearly handled this game on low-medium. This game is really interesting and fun to play with other people AND ITS ONLY FOR 0.99€. I recommend it 7,9/10
8992	1	a	I really like this game, I honestly can't believe how cheap it is for the quality. It has a lot of replay value also IMO since you can level up to 70 and you unlock stuff along the way. There are 3 classes and in some game modes you can play as the Dinos! Lots of different guns and perks (Augments) that you can buy for the match with money you make from killing dinos in that match. There is also cool armor, hats, and blade colors you can buy outside of matches to make your guy look really nifty. For what it is, this game is awesome and I highly recommend it.
8994	1	a	For the dino killers
8996	1	a	8/8
8998	1	a	I don't know why the ♥♥♥♥ anyone would want to play this game. Dinosaurs are awesome but after you play this game, you'll think that all dinosaurs are homosexuals.
9000	1	a	This is a game which you can play in Noob or Easy mode to get awards, or just when you don't want to try too hard, or you can play in Medium or higher mode when you want a challenge. Great to play solo or in a group and plenty of PvP if you like that, too. Best .99 Euro Cent game I have ever bought, in fact better than a lot of other more expensive games. This game is not perfect though as there are a few bugs, but nothing that would make me stop playing: bots getting stuck against rocks (happens in the larger maps when they have to travel cross country). One of the few games which it's fun just to play for 15 minutes, before you go out etc, or play for a few hours. There are plenty of weapons to choose from and NO weapons can be bought using real money, only in game money which is reset every match and not too hard to get, at lower levels ;) . The only things that can be bought with real money are cosmetic, like hats etc.  The graphics aren't cutting edge but they are good enough and the weather effects I really like. Try spotting a flying pterodactyl(?) at night when it's raining and the rain is running down your visor (I love to hate pterodactyl as they mob you when your hiding in the rocks shooting dinos with one of the sniper rifles). The snowing effect is great, too! And if you don't buy the heated visor opion, lookout when your visor freezes over (on the snowy maps), shoot the blurrs, LOL.  When I'm tired, after playing a demanding fast paced game, I usually end up playing this at Noob or Easy level just for some relaxing fun and to gain a achivement or two. If I want a challenge I play in Medium or Hard, although there are two harder level: Insane and Redikulous!  If one of the main boss dinos is killed the game goes into slow-mo for a few seconds and if you shoot a Raptor in the head, at this time, it looks great when it explodes in slow-mo, too. :) One last thing: watch out, the Raptors will swarm you!  It's on sale 0.59
9002	1	a	nice game for a quick and fun play
9004	1	a	I got this game for free from a friend who bought a 4-pack.  Unfortunately it lack content, you play a couple of rounds and explore, try the weapons, have some fun and that's about it.  At it's current price 0.99 it's a good deal for one nights fun, but don't expect much more than 5-6h of enjoyable playtime unless you reeeaaaally love dinosaurs.
9006	1	a	I saw this game on sale for 1$ and being as cheap as I am it sparked my curiosity so I searched it up on youtube to find some hilarious gliches like the front fliping t-rex. So I bought it xpecting to walk into a hilarous brokem mess that would be worth it for the laughs alone. Instead I got a genuinely good game, I would recomend to anyone to buy it because 1$ isn't much to spend on a game that is good. In fact this is the only game that I have spent under 4$ on and had it be good. If the pvp was more active I think I could have gotten into it a lot more because the pvp wasn't a broken camper noob tube filled shot gun spamming sound whoring mess (*cough cough 'cod'*) The pve was pretty nice too, it kinda reminded me of firefight on halo but better in almost every way. If you don't have it get it, for 1$ you can't really go wrong
9008	1	a	Great game when you just want to kill stuff. You can also up the level and comense rage ;)
9010	1	a	If Ed Wood were a game developer for our generation, this is what he would be remembered for and not Plan 9 From Outer Space
9012	1	a	Screw you, Dom.
9014	1	a	AMAZING GAME!  Defenately worth the cash and very cheap may i add, Great fun and good to play with friends, The feel of shooting dinos in a FPS futuristic game is amazing, get this game if your looking for a laugh and  something to do in your spare time!
9016	1	a	Joined a game lagged so much my computer blew up 10/10 would play again
9018	1	a	For what it's worth, it's pretty solid. It still needs moderate amounts of work. The price tag isn't half bad either, but I wonder if this hurts development. I've also not come across many players, and yes I've only logged 3 hours total. Learning curve is steep enough to engage you, but easy enough to master. Is it worth it? Only if you have patience, and you're willing to engage the developers in perfecting the title, they won't know unless you let them know. But it has enough to keep you interested for a casual encounter.  Pros: -Concept -Variety of Dinos -Abudance of achievements and trading cards -Borderlands art style -Action-packed, hardly a dull moment -Price Tag -Learning curve -Gamepad Support -Augments look promising  Middle Ground: -Vehicles (Solid, but have slightly clunky functionability) -Weapon Selection, limited, but not totally lacking -Environmental effects, rain, frost, etc -Gamemodes (showing promise, fairly solid, needs more depth)  Cons: -Servers are a bit unstable and lag spikes can be frequent (Might have been a clunky night, or a European server, even still, nothing overwhelming) -Limited Costumizability for weapons -Public reaction/community/support (Perception after 3 hours, can change)  Suggestions: After playing this title, I've observed that a lot of it has to do with cooperative play with close friends, or otherwise, gaming buddies. Now, I think a good approach for further development would be to emphasize more on this fact. All other issues aside. A little backround story, maybe some comedic voice-overs like that in Killing floor would give this game a much needed cult-like status. Adding a few story-driven modes, and perhaps even another class type or two. Also, I'm not sure if this is already the case, but sharing credits with others should be possible.  Overall assesment: I'd say it's promising leaning on above average, I'd give it a 7.5/10 for now. I'm looking forward to seeing steam automatically try to update the game over the coming months.
9020	1	a	Now i Know how the dinosaurs disapperd :3
9022	1	a	The Quick Brown Fox , i mean i - recommend this game to you if you really like playing co-op games with your friends, that game could be your favorite game. It has a good game engine and cool HUD. Nice weapons to shoot some dinosaurs or cut them all. Following objectives and beating this beasts is really cool. Nice graphical quality also feels you good when playing it, almost a perfect game for it's tags. #Dinosaurs #Action #FPS #Multiplayer #Co-op so thats it all, see ya on game guys.
2764	0	a	Good and fun game, after a while it gets boring though.
9024	1	a	it is cool 
9026	1	a	I killed a T-Rex in slow motion with a longbow. If that isn't worth your dollar, I don't know what is. It's a litle glitchy, but what game isn't? Graphics are very good for $0.99 cents worth, and the gameplay is just great, especially if you have friends. Buy the 4-Pack, and play with your friends. It's such a great game.  There are other games out there for the same price, but I'm confident that none of them will get you this much enjoyment.  8/10
9028	1	a	my first payd game on steam and is BEST!!!
9030	1	a	A rather wacky game where you shoot dinosaurs in the face with guns.  11/10
2765	0	a	This is one of the only Steam games i own that i wouldnt reccommend buying. When I first bought it, I was super excited, but whem i lunched the game, I found that the graphics were terrible (and slow), and that the overall idea of the game was kinda stupid too. Some people might enjoy it, but it certainly wasn't for me.
9032	1	a	This game is fun any easy to play. Also it is very cheap. What I am saying is ever one should get this game and at least try it. I just wish it had more vehicle to play with in game most air.
9034	1	a	AWESOME! Dinasours, TANKS, Choppers, Biks, Lightsabers, &amp; JETPACKS!! WHAT MORE COULD YOU WANT!!?!?!?!?
2767	0	a	zero skill involved in the game. Guns have zero recoil which shooting a bore. Fun concept but bad execution
9036	1	a	Orion: Prelude is not terrible.   Not Good.  But not terrible. Its a game that you know is kind of bad, but you can have fun with it with friends.  It has very satisfying controls, okay visuals and pretty good gameplay. But screw all that, its dang cheap. Pick it up for a few hours of fun. Its worth it.
9038	1	a	Really fun game, plays like halo1 on pc but has dinosaurs. You can jump out of helicopters and land on tpteranodons.   10/10 game of the year.   Make sure you have friends to play with cause community may be dead.
9040	1	a	A game this cheap with potentially hours of fun with multiplayer?  Don't think! get it!  Ps. You get to kill a Trex that throws rocks.
2769	0	a	you get what you pay for. The game is about as confusing to play as if I were making the game myself. That being said, it does have potential. BUT, if the developers do not clean the game up it's going to just be Call of Duty with dinosaurs. with just as many 'spinoffs' if the rumors are correct.
9042	1	a	A lot of love was put into one dolla
9044	1	a	you can shoot dinosaurs to hell with such varied weaponry that it doesn't matter how much you mess around 10/10
9046	1	a	this game is only 0,89 cent . For that kind of money this game is really good i've seen a lot of games for 30\40 dollars that are way worst . This game is really fun to play with friends so i reccomend it a lot and it still has a lot of poeple playing it
9048	1	a	Quite good but so lag when in lobby!
9050	1	a	I PLAYED THE DEMO AND LOVED IT !!!
9052	1	a	My friend said it was a bad game......but it's alright if you have friends to play with
9054	1	a	Expected more but I guess I got what I paid for lol
9056	1	a	This is a must have for your game library. You will get countless hours of enjoyment out of 99 cents. There are other game modes besides survival and great online community.
9058	1	a	amazing such good graphics my comp can barely handle it lol
9060	1	a	Can't argue with the price, and I killed a T-Rex with a revolver.   10/10
9062	1	a	♥♥♥♥... I mean I got a card but ♥♥♥♥...
9064	1	a	I wish there was a so-so option for recommending this game because Orion:Prelude is a somewhat of a decent Dinosaur game, it's sort of like Primal Carnage but doesn't have as good of graphical quality. The dinosaur selection in this game is ok where you can chose seven dinosaurs, two pterosaurs,and one Deinosuchus which also makes unique because there aren't alot of games out there that allow you to play as a Deinosuchus. Overall its an ok game. Overall score: 5.5/10.
9066	1	a	Jurassic Park in space.
9068	1	a	it's a bit buggy and sometimes not that pretty, but it can be really fun to play!
9070	1	a	Orion Prelude, a game for 0.99euro wich is in terms of fun above most games of 60 euro like really after 2 rounds (and I still didnt know the controls because I was to lazy to look for them) I was already addicted to this game.  Weapons and verichels in Planetside2 style, Dinosaurs, Like ya Dinosaurs guys  if u have 1 euro on your steam buy it right now u won't reget it
9072	1	a	This game... It costs very little and yet I'd rarther play this than some of the triple A titles such as Call of Duty. This game is such fun for a small price, I recomend it strongly to people who love to fight off waves of Dino's or face off against the humans as Dino's whilst protecting your egg! Just a Beautiful game...
2772	0	a	Claims to have full controller support, does NOT SUPPORT XBOX ONE CONTROLLER. This type of game NEEDS controller support. Please remove your head from ♥♥♥.    0/10 (unplayable without claimed controller support)
9074	1	a	Even though the Game is very cheap (1€, u wot m8), its actually fun to play. While its not the best in means of graphics or gameplay mechanics, who cares? You can fight a T-Rex by just hitting him with your itsy-bitsy gun, or shred a small Dino with your Rocket Launcher to pieces.
9076	1	a	This has to be one of the single worst games I've ever played, and yet I cannot stop playing. It's just so entertaining! Being drunk helps, of course, but it is not vital to the experience. Grab a four-pack and three friends, and give it a shot.
2774	0	a	Cool concept could be better
9078	1	a	Loved this game... not much more to say. Ya shoot dinosaurs and its loads of fun  9/10
9080	1	a	Definitely worth the dollar
9082	1	a	i dont understand anything/10
9084	1	a	An amazing Co-op experience for up to (I believe 10 players). Wave based killathon. A large number of gamemodes, weapons, powerups, enemies and vehicles. Highly configurable in terms of both game rule settings and also video/audio. Graphics are superb. Netcode solid (thanks Unreal engine). Tons of steam achievements. Map editor via sdk. Need I say more? Get it. Great job by developers to stick with it until the game shined.
9086	1	a	-Playing by yourself: 8-9/10 -Playing with Friends: 11/10  Really, the only thing that i do not like about this game is that it has no windows 8 support. Even then, it runs OK, but i guess its really up to your computer at that point.   -For those of you who have played CARNIVORES, you always get super bored of hunting and shoting over and over and ogre again. You never have any cool weapons, and hunt the same freakin dinosaurs over and ogre again. You always wish that there was something cool, something where you could play with others, something a little more upgraded than crossbows and forrest maps (with the exception of like one desert map, which is also mainly forrests.) When i saw this game when as browsing the winter sale, i clicked on it and it seemed fun; especially for the price. In the past 4-5 days, i have racked up like 15-20 hours on this game. This game gives everything that a carnivores fan would desire and waaaay more. lightsabers, Compound bows, sentry turrets, jetpacks, invisibility cloaks, healing guns, a revolver, tanks, mechs, helicopters even, warthogs, APCs; this game packs all of a dinosaur fans wet dreams into it.   -Ogre all review: 10/10
9088	1	a	Bought this game only because wanted to know what kind of a game can you purchase for 0,79 EUR. The first time I turned it on, I understood that you play what you pay for - outdated graphics, very simple physics, small maps which don't differ much from each other...  After a month gave it another chance. I must say, that even considering all the cons mentioned above, it still can be pretty fun. Not sure If I have been very lucky, but the community is good (At least in all of the servers I've played in).  Final verdict: The best fun I've had for 0.79 EUR!!!
9090	1	a	It's way cheaper than it should be
9092	1	a	This game is awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!
2779	0	a	I can't recommend this game, even though I got it for less than a dollar. True, I feel that I got my money's worth of enjoyment, but this game overdelivers on concept and far underdelivers on gameplay.
2780	0	a	I really wanted to love this game but the mouse delay was way to intense. Lag city ♥♥♥♥♥ lag lag city ♥♥♥♥♥.... 4/10
9094	1	a	this game is fun as coop. game . i like its grafics . it suits game too. its pice is good too. i think more ppl could give it a try :D
9096	1	a	Perhaps the 3rd steam game i got.  Pros:  + The game costs $1 + Very unique gameplay + Dinosaurs  Inbetween pros and cons:  = Slightly confusing controls(there IS a lot of keys that it uses aswell) = No storyline  Cons:  - Gets boring after a while - Only good computers can run this game - I assume it has about 1 months worth of gameplay  Graphics: 8.5/10 Singleplayer experience: 8.5/10 Multiplayer experience(PvE): 9/10 Multiplayer experience(PvP): 7/10 Overall Rating: 9/10
9098	1	a	Very unexpected joy coming from a game that costs less than a pack of gum.  10/10
9100	1	a	I like shooting zombies with friends. Dinosaurs is not that far of a leap I guess.
9102	1	a	this game is a result of star wars having sex with jurrasic park their son having sex with farcry their son having sex with Call of duty their son having sex with Killing Floor there was so much sex needed for ORION: Prelude to be born 10/10 ORION: Prelude will have sex with GTA
9104	1	a	You can run around as a dinosaur in some modes.... eough said XD Pretty damn awesome fun, for the cheap price! A must play with friends.
2782	0	a	Got the game from a friend tries to join lobby 3 times ends up playing with russians 10/10    not
9106	1	a	When i first started playing this game i was like 'what the hell is going on here?!', the moment i walked outside the spawn was like entering a hell, but then with dinosaurs. I had one word for it..'Whoa...'. Everywhere you look dino's walking, screaming, running, flying it was amazing! Even better is the Rampage mode where you can actually BE a f* DINOSAUR! One tip, to change the class you play, press 'N' to change it next time you die. Also i want to say the people i played with were very nice, and i think that there are way too less games of this. One bad thing is the clipping and hitboxes. My dinosaur could not get through a space where i had 2 M left on both sides, but then again, it's still making me laugh if i see how they magically walk side of the clif edge if you manage to get lose xD
9108	1	a	as long as you don't mind losing, this game is great. When a T-rex gets ahold of you are most likely toast. It is a bit hard to win you may have to turn it down to noob. Come on you are fighting dinosaurs with a tiny gun. What do you want? You are crunchy and taste good with ketuchup.
2783	0	a	DONT BUY THIS DESPERATE PIECE OF CRAP  Notice how no actuall CRITICS leave messages in the trailer, that's because they got random users to say unbelievable crap about this decieving ♥♥♥♥ bucket of a game,  I know it's '99c' It doesnt mean you have to buy this game Just go buy a piece of paper, draw a dinosaur on it and you will have more fun doing so then you would playing this garbage
9110	1	a	This game is top. Buy it now
9112	1	a	OK i dont care what anyone says this is one of the best games for $0.99 cents after i started playing it i even forgot that i only paid $0.99 cents
2784	0	a	I didn't get this game. Nice graphics though.
2785	0	a	Not good. Just not good. Don't buy it.

9114	1	a	played for 2 hours, got a lightsaber, did less damage than my knife. 10/10
2787	0	a	Buggy, decent graphics, and repetitive gameplay lacking variety and weapons. The maps are dull and playing as a dinosaur isn't nearly as fun as it seems it would and probably should be. Also the controls for controlling a dinosaur are unclear, unstated, and a lot of the times do not even work. Not worth playing - it is a waste of time and not nearly as good as it should and could be.
9116	1	a	I bought this game for $49 - oops, I mean $0.49 - you fight waves of dinosaurs. You can use a pistol to kill them. Or two pistols. Or machine pistols. Or shotguns. Or sniper rifles. Or LMG's. Or SMG's. Or a grenade launcher. Or a rocket launcher. Or a bow and arrow. You can place turrets. Gun turrets, rocket turrets or flamethrower turrets. You can drive over the dinosaurs. You can shoot them with rockets from aerial vehicles. It's bloody brilliant, and for 1 dollar you cannot get better value for money! I've only played co-op with a friend, and it was insane amounts of fun! Buy it, this game is a steal!
9118	1	a	  To start with.
9120	1	a	My god it is fun with friends. You will need friends to play this though, it's better to have someone to help you with this experience. It's like an even more indie version of Killing Floor, but with dinosaurs, mechs, tanks, and (helicopters?). Good for how cheap it is, if you can get over how indie it is.
9122	1	a	You can't beat the price, and it seems like the devs are always putting out stuff for this. The game was kinda unplayable at one point, but it's made a big turn around. Check it out.
2788	0	a	Still doesn't work. Waste of money. Steam should remove.
9124	1	a	So I don't know if this game is bad or sorta ok. I'm conflicted. On one hand this game is not really polished and there are a lot of iffy things about it. You can't buy ammo for guns you run out of, the kill cam is weirdly stuck on the enemy's face, the music is incredibly heroic for some reason and I find things aren't particularly well explained.  HOWEVER you can play as the dinosaurs and eat humans. That's fun. It's not fun for the humans because the dinosaurs are too stronk.  I'm giving this game a posivite review because it's given me some good ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles but if I could give it eeeennnhhh I would.
9126	1	a	I got this game from a friend of mine and we played it for a tad over 24 hours total. It is actually a horrible game if you start thinking about it (bad sound ok grafics and gameplay but quite some bugs and stuff), but for the low price it's actually ok, since you can have quite a lot of fun plinking around with friends. Oh speaking of which: DO NOT play this game ALONE, it completely and utterly SUCKS alone! Get at least 1 friend to play with you, otherwise fun=0 I also disagree about the micro-transacion thing in the game. I think this is the realm of free-to-play stuff, not games you actually have to pay for, even if it's just 1€! If you want a more serious and complete game i suggest you take a look at Primal Carnage, especially when it's on sale (since it's a little priceier) but I haven't played that one so I cann't comment on the quality. But as far as Orion goes: 1€ for 24 hours of fun gamelay? Why not? :)
2789	0	a	Don't buy this is game is a troll
9128	1	a	Great game if you enjoy to play FPS games. Has a few minor bugs.
9130	1	a	the game lags to much but its still worth the money
9132	1	a	Jetpacks, heavy weapons, and dinosaurs.  It could be more polished. But until you beat a raptor to death with a rocket launcher while flying.. you dont know what true glee is.
9134	1	a	This is what happens when a stupid idea is amazingly fun.
9136	1	a	I'm just going to give you the specifics in 1-10 ratings. Game smoothness - 6/10 (Meh) Class variety - 3/10 (3 of them) Weapon balance - 2/10 (Sniping with machine guns) Dinosaur AI - -4/10 (Hilarious) Bot AI - -∞/10 (No) Vehicles - 10/10 (Killing machines) Game Hilarity - (1.6 x 10^8)/10 (My god yes) And last but not least... Is it worth the price? It has had more free days than i've had showers. Yes. Just yes. 
9138	1	a	i always thought this game could never be better but i hope more people play it but i would still play this than titanfall i would give it 1000/10 points i mean this game could be better but i like it this way i stil think that players should be able to choose what dino to be but the boss battles i would give a 5/10 and the rest is just fine accept please higher the price's for some equipement
2792	0	a	This game is buggy, there are bugs such as doors remaining closed the whole game. The melee weapons are also useless as they are outmatched by the heavy weapons, such as the minigun. This game also has terrible graphics and the game has random lag spikes (the lag might just be my computer).
9140	1	a	Not Bad
9142	1	a	The perfect drug.
9144	1	a	A lot of fun, but has frequent framerate issues. Sometimes to the point of gamebreaking (may just be my computer though), but hey it's only a dollar. If you are playing with a controller, it can be unresponsive at times during the gameplay.
9146	1	a	This Game is very fun. first point: It teaches people about the jurrassic  second point: Its FPS , who don't like FPS third point: You Can play it online or play with your buddys and family  Most Important Point: The Game Is Cheap
9148	1	a	'Lets have anal'-A MAN
2794	0	a	It was fun before the 'Prelude' title came about. Now the game feels like a generic P2W / F2P title.
2795	0	a	Dinosaurs? More like DinoSORES! Hah! This game is terrible. Just awful. If you play this game, you're scum. If you made this game, you're scum.
2796	0	a	Shoot Dinosaurs as they skate towards you.
2797	0	a	I wish i could sell games on the steam market...
9150	1	a	Great game. Love to play it with 4 other people. That way it's a full party and we can own. If you want to play with me just message.
9152	1	a	looks great i would recommend this to those who like halo and dinosaurs
9154	1	a	its a fun game and i reccomend it makes me feel like a bad ♥♥♥ 
2799	0	a	I gave the game an honest shot, I really did. I just could not bring myself to liking it, it felt far too generic and shoddy. I can imagine the game being good fun for a couple of buddies on LAN but that's as far as I would go. Accounting everything from graphics, game mechanics and accessibility i'd give the game a 5/10.
9156	1	a	Turok meets Halo in this jump in jump out game. Initial thoughts were that this game was going to be boring but it is one of those games that remains a hidden gem. Get it, play it, and see for yourself.
9158	1	a	You shoot dinosars and it's co-op, what more could you want?
9160	1	a	Neat idea. However the gameplay gets boring fast.   Since the update, this game has become actually playable and enjoyable. It still needs some work/balancing. The most unfortunate part being that each game is a fresh start, so you can never truly enjoy character building. Also there is no storyline, just killing hordes of dinosaurs until you succumb to a t-rex.
9162	1	a	killed a T-rex by stabbing it in the head with a lightsaber-type sword.
9164	1	a	Drove head-on into a stegosaurus, exploded into a ball of flames. 10/10
2801	0	a	I AM CHOKING ON THE QUALITY OF THIS GAME JK
9166	1	a	Super stupid fun, worth the I think.... 2 bucks I spent on a sale? Would not buy full price, there is just not enough content here. It is best played with a bunch of friends doing stupid stuff but don't try to play the Dino Vs Human, the dinos are so overpowered its no contest. A dino player can choose the massive dinos like the T-Rex and just maul a human with little effort while having a health bar that takes literally 6 mins to chew through, and the human objective is to collect eggs that every dino can just camp. Playing a small dino is pointless however, it is the compleat opposit with the exception of the exploding compy (a dino that somehow has a bomb strapped to it's back?), you get killed so fast from any weapon you have to get very lucky just to get an attack off. The flying dinos.... I don't know, I never figured out how to even attack with them. The Human vs CPU dinos is fun though, you have to go to objetives, get in vehicles, protect buildings, ect. There are jeeps, tanks, mechs, and I believe ATVs. Do not get stuck as a gunner on the jeep if it gets stuck in a wall though, there is a bug where you can't get out. It feels like a quirky unreal tourny vs dinos and you can pick perks to upgrade your humans.  Overall its a fun game if you can snag it on sale, play with friends and don't take the game serious at all.
9168	1	a	So much co op fun ignore the meta score!
9170	1	a	A few cent's to experience how truly the dinos died C:
9172	1	a	Good game, has some issues with control but the game play itself is good. The graphical scenery is almost AAA title level in places. Great game if you can get it on sale
2802	0	a	4/10 gets boring quickly i dont know how maybe the atmosphere of it. only get it if its on sale
9174	1	a	Orion Dino Horde is fast and furious (Hectic in fact). It is fun and adrenaline fuel at it's best. Gameplay is smooth and the conrols are superb. This game has evolved from a motley dog to a supreme gaming experience. Hat's off to the dev team for salvaging this as the concept was solid. There are also 250 steam achievements ...
2804	0	a	This game blows. Trust me.
9176	1	a	Only played for 2 hours so far, but this game is very fun. I'm not sure why the metascore is so low, but it was def worth the on sale price that I payed.
9178	1	a	This game is awesome. Shot a stegosaurus in the face with a grenade launcher then shot a pterodactyl that was diving at me out of the sky while backpedaling.
9180	1	a	Just one problem with this game.    It feels cheap and unfinished
9182	1	a	Its not suppose to be a award winning triple A game with amazing graphics and story. Just a simple, very fun horde mode sci fi fps with dinos. Its all up to how much fun you have with the game. Playing with buddies is a blast for me. If you are intrested, wait till the price drops and get it for you and your buddies.
9184	1	a	realy good game
9186	1	a	honestly at first i tought this game's graphics where a bit on the bad side but i was having so mutch fun i didn't even think about ghraphics 
2805	0	a	well I got the game to try out and let me say I DO NOT LIKE IT. The grafics are slow and multiplayer is bad. Its not worth the mony, I rather recommend tf2 or dota 2 than this. But the game can get beter with updates and help so what im saying is put some work into it and I'll recommend it but not now.
9188	1	a	An FPS where you can actually see your feet. 10/10
9190	1	a	I tentativly would reccomend this to freinds its killing floor with dinosaurs 5/10 for me it has potential but it dosent use it
9192	1	a	Years old and not quite all out action but none the less addictively fun and entertaining running around shooting dinosaurs in an Unreal Powered environment.
9194	1	a	This game doesn't seem extreemly polished at first but for some weird reason it's really, really fun :D
9196	1	a	t rex bit my face off. the bite scores a 5 but the game scores a solid 7.
2807	0	a	Stupid and only fun for a short period of time.
2808	0	a	to play this game you need 2 things beer and lots of it and frineds that are willing to buy this game
9198	1	a	Got a 4 pack on summer sale for like 5$ (wich is a steal...) this game is worth the 15$ full price IMO but it's probably gonna be on sale again if you want to wait...  It's a nice coop game and relatively easy to understand how everything works (buying system etc.) there are vehicles in wich you can make roadkill (ever tough they could just run over raptors in Jurassic Park? well you can do that) and you have a Jetpack too, so in resume you get to drive vehicule and shoot dinosaurs with rocket launchers and machine gun, what more can I say...  didn't play too much since I just bought it but I like it soo far, buy it :P   
9200	1	a	This might be the weirdest game I've ever played. Well... maybe not the weirdest, but certainly odd. You can play some sort of marines, or dinosaurs... and fight. It's simple. I mean... that much info about the game made me buy it, so maybe that's enough. Great game.
9202	1	a	Awesome game, quit heavy on your pc and sometimes a bit laggy when playing with other people but everything else is awesome!
9204	1	a	15 out of 10 stars.best game i've ever played!whats better than lag, bugs, and dinosaurs!worth the fifteen dollars.
9206	1	a	So glad I tried this....easy learning curve and fun.
2810	0	a	I bought this game for one euro.  Still felt robbed of my money.
9208	1	a	dinosaurs vs humans. interesting concept and very un. Can't wait for there august update.
9210	1	a	IT'S SO STOOPID IT'S GOOD
9212	1	a	This game is really interesting! its a game whereby conventional fps would seem very lacking in. Basically this games can at take at least 10 hour of your time. to actually test everything out! However its recommended if you search up for guide about the control , because this game is not newbie friendly! so its something the developer should keep note of! as well as the repetitive of the maps! as well as objective!.. other than that you should find the game quite interesting! =)
9214	1	a	High tech and guns + dinos = AWESOME
9216	1	a	If you don't have a proper team or group of people, then prepare to get eaten. Surviving against waves of dinosaurs (big or small) is not easy nor is it a boring chore. The graphics suck and the character designs for the player are bland but at least the dinosaurs look good. Pick this one up on the cheap.
9218	1	a	It's a pretty good little game. I got it for 1 euro, and that's about the best value for it. The survival mode can be really fun if you get some decent teammates but really, that's a problem that all online games have, getting matched with stupid ♥♥♥♥ing kids. Other than that, the Versus mode is a bloody nightmare, I was getting 200 ping on the servers, couldn't get a lower ping for the life of me... Because of that ping, in Versus mode, I had one of the lowest K:D ratio I have ever had in ANY game, EVER! Lol... Graphics are pretty decent. It has the occasional glitch but nothing too bad. Like I said, not too bad. Take it with a grain of salt.
9220	1	a	Well worth the price, still buggy and a work in progress but a lot of fun!
9222	1	a	i liked this game because the dinos are very colorfull and that the guns and melee weapons are very powerfull
2815	0	a	I got this game for free and I only played for 15 minutes. What a waste. The graphics are awful, the animations are terrible, and the combat is a Halo ripoff. It's a really bad Halo ripoff with ugly dinosaurs. Avoid this game.  0/10
9224	1	a	Best $1 bill I've ever spent. I've logged several hours now in to this game and it's fun. It has it's bugs and minor glitches, but if the devs give attention to this game it can only get better.
9226	1	a	Spent $1.50 to kill some dinosaurs and have some fun. Left satisfied for what I paid for.
9228	1	a	Only when it is on the 99cent sale
9230	1	a	This game is definitely still in beta. Some server functions don't work, and there's still a fair amount of glitches. All that aside, this is one of the most fun games I've ever played. If you're looking for a team-based shooter with a fairly fast pace, this game is for you.
9232	1	a	Very fun game if you have some friends to play with!!
9234	1	a	Much better since the last update
9236	1	a	This game is a mixture of Call of Duty:BO 2, with killfloor, Haloesque themes combined with Jarassic park! Somehow it works. I mean survival is fun the game modes are fun. Hey you could say it has a bit of battlefield. The neat thing with this game is they can combine all of the various shooter modes into different game modes and keep them there. Like counterstrike style or halo style etc. It's a pretty neat game for $1-3. It's probably a $40 value! All the great things are fairly obvious. Best thing 3rd person first person shooter.  Some things to add note (minor tweaks.) (all negatives.)  I wish each of the characters were male-female. The shop purely is aesthetics which is nice if say you wanted a skin. It's a dollar but steam want syou to use a 5. So sells ome stuff for the skins. Another problem is the pvp game modes like capture the flag sometimes are non-halo. I wish you could do one where it's just pvp with the counterstrike style (choose your weapon.) If the animations worked a little better, the game would be more fluid. There are some issues like the vehicles aren't that classy, and the dino's are seethrough if you phase through them.   The main two modes I really want is a pvp where I can choose. I love the free for all with the cryo sword. But they need to expand on the game modes. Make a slightly better UI when interacting to make games and bingo! It's a triple AAA title. The best thing about the game is the graphics scale! My computer can handle halo 1-2 graphics no problem! My friend had on the shaders and it ran fine as well in 400k Perfect! 1080P? maybe, but higher rez great!  Have a 64 person mode with vehicles. and dinosaurs in the mix. IDK!  This game is going to be the next COD! No joke. If they added a few AI trianing players with dinos running around and then had pvp. That creates the best game ever. Thus far there's no real point to leveling up. NONE! It's something that they probably are adding on in the future. 
9238	1	a	Game runs like crap but is fun on conquest with a group of friends.
9240	1	a	Its a fun game that kinda reminds me of the old game called 'Turok' . If your not into the worlds best graphics but you like how the game is set up/gameplay this game is for you .
2820	0	a	As hopeful as i was for this game, it did not turn out so well.  Playability is 1/10 because once you find the groove you can easily win any game mode.  Graphics is decent 5/10  UI is about 6/10 but vastly could do for some maintance with some buggy area's.  Lobby and Server waits/connect is 2/10 because it seemed like the first two times booting up it didn't let me join or respond to click imput.  Overall 3/10 because it doesn't suck you in and has you replaying over and over. If you really want to try it out, wait for free trial periods then if you want to buy, get it on sale because 15 bucks is way to much for a sub par Killing Floor type game.
9242	1	a	When this game first came out it felt like a waste of money and had little content, but after thousands of updates and improvments this game is acutally worth every $! if your looking for a fun coop game with dinos! then this is a must buy :D
9244	1	a	Hilarious game! This is a riot to play with your buddies. I would say don't buy it for single player, but if you have at least three friends that would play with you, just have someone man up and get a four pack (when it is on sale). The co-op against the dinoasurs is too fun to pass up. 8/10
2821	0	a	It is a meh game. At first it is fun, but then it just becomes wave after wave of the same thing and it becomes boring. There is really only one good-ish game mode. I am glad that someone else got it for me at a 93% off promotion because it is not worth $15. I just can't reccommend this game. 4/10
9246	1	a	This is a really great game to play with your friends. It is frantic and fun. Imagine a expanded nazi zombies mode from Call of Duty: World at War with dinosaurs. Really fun
2822	0	a	Alright for shooting some dinosaurs in the face, though the difficulty ramps up a little too quickly for my tastes. The assets are decent enough, but they suffer quite a bit in motion due to an odd application of motion blur.
9248	1	a	Purchased this game on sale and it was worth the buck. It could use more polishing though, there are times when it gets too buggy and the graphic's latency can also improve.
9250	1	a	Pretty fun, got it on sale and it was worth the couple bucks
9252	1	a	This is quite an enjoyable game. From the amount of intense gameplay when your getting mobed by a pack of tiny dinos to the exitment of being in a giant walking mech and mowing down a bunch of dinos. Its fun left and right, The enviornments are very colorful and pretty, Wide open so you feel free in a sence, I highly reccomend this game.
9254	1	a	enjoying the CRAP out of this game. A very great game that is so much fun to sit down in front of for hours and just mow down dinosaurs!!!
9256	1	a	This is basically Halo with dinosaurs. I never liked Halo, But this game is superfun mega challenge fantastic happy blood storm. With dinosaurs!
2824	0	a	36/100 Metacritic is too ♥♥♥♥ing generous.
2825	0	a	Did not like the game, difficult to control, though I'm not a huge fan of FPS versus hordes
9258	1	a	AWESOME GAME even though has a few bugs such as : The pistol floating for a sec after switching.
9260	1	a	decent with a group of friends
9262	1	a	Worth a go if you find it cheap, played for ~5hrs and want to play more.
9264	1	a	Join random server first time playing. Was instantly thrown up and eaten by T-rex. 11/10
9266	1	a	A grand old stupid time.
9268	1	a	Brilliant. Amazingly fun. Have you ever wanted to blast dinoz with friends? This games for you. Simply the best relaxed shooter ever.
9270	1	a	Fun $0.99 game buy it if you want to shoot dinosaurs and what-not....
2827	0	a	It's fun for... less than the time it took me to download the game. Glitchy and un-fun.
9272	1	a	this game is A+
2828	0	a	this game is so horrifly terrible. Not worth a quarter
9274	1	a	awesome cuz you shoot dinos and more dinos, then you shoot some more
9276	1	a	This game is a great co-op game. good vehicals, multiple ways to play all while helping to complete the same objective with friends or strangers. If manage to get this during one of the great deals it is well worth 1-2 dollars. if not then if you enjoy first person shooters and good set of vehicals. would get it. A lot of people are friendly when playing currently so helps learning curve. Not much of one but every game has one.
9278	1	a	This is a good game if you like to kill dino, what else is there to say? Down with the zombie fad and long live the dino!
9280	1	a	Not the most polished game, but I have had a lot of fun with it for the $2 I spent. Good dino shooting gallery game, and coop is fun.  7.5/10
9282	1	a	I went in expecting nothing. Best god damn $1.50 I've ever spent.  You NEED friends to play with, it makes it so much better. I believe the metacritic score was for their old game before they overhauled it. Seriously, I spent $1.50 and ended up not stopping the game for 6 hours.
9284	1	a	It has dinosaurs, more people should play this game. 10/10.
9286	1	a	You can be a dinosaur buy it
9288	1	a	I can pistol whip a raptor in the face  11/10
9290	1	a	are you serious? GET THIS GAME! 10/10 kill dinosaurs
9292	1	a	very good game especially with friends and skype
9294	1	a	10/10 would shoot dinos again, hey thats rhymes
9296	1	a	This is a really good game. Sometimes it can be quite laggy, but what game isn't these days. If you like COD zombies, this is basicaly the same thing, but dinosaurs, and a whole lot more fun than zombies. Great game!
9298	1	a	it be cool yo
9300	1	a	Who is the right mind would pay 15$ for this asinine game?
9302	1	a	A quirky, yet satisfying FPS twitch survival game. Meet new friends, kill big lizards, bring me some pizza!
2839	0	a	Halo styled play with dino's. Meh.
9304	1	a	It' pretty good, but the dynamic weather can get really annoying, but hey, that makes it more 'real', the rain can really blur your vision, other than that, it's a fun game for a decently low cost (on sale)
9306	1	a	This game is very fun, especially if you grab a few copies for you and your buddies. You'll get a few enjoyable hours out of it minimum, and for around a dollar when it's on sale that is an insane bargain. It does have its bugs--clipping and crazy physics among them--but if you can look past those kinds of things you'll really enjoy the game. Personally, I've already put 27 hours into it and I got it for LESS than a dollar. Best value I've ever gotten out of a game. There are several different modes, but the core game modes are Conquest and Survival where you're defending against increasingly difficult waves of dinosaurs. This does get repetitive after a while, (especially in Conquest) so if that bothers you it could be an issue. Personally I don't mind it, because it's fun. Gun game is my favorite mode for PvP. The class skills spice it up nicely.  tl;dr Give the game a chance. It's usually around a dollar on sale and it's a blast. But if you're looking for a polished gem, this probably isn't it.
9308	1	a	A really nice game, especially for multiplayer. High paced action and a lot of chaos is ensured
9310	1	a	It's like Battlefield with dinosaurs.
9312	1	a	Such a good game!
2841	0	a	Thank god I only lost $1.30 on this game. It's cheesy in all the wrong ways, so much so that only a 5 year old boy with devolpmental issues wouldn't find the cliches grating. 0/10  Even on the lowest settings the game is prone to crashing and hiccuping frequently. Too much time to jacking to leaf textures and not enough time actually putting some thought into the game. I wouldn't recommend this to even stalin.
9314	1	a	This is an awesome game good for you and your friends to play or make some new ones its a clean take on FPS horde games check it out!
9316	1	a	Decent game. 7/10 would play again.
9318	1	a	this is a dinosaur game were there are 3 diffrent classes and vehicles inclunding tanks and mechs and gamemodes and a lot of stuff you should go check it out!
9320	1	a	I've only been able to play survival mode so far but have been having a blast doing so. It certainly requires team-work, especially in the final waves, to take down the hordes of bigger dinos before they smash your base.   Credit based weapons and augments are available between waves though in some cases getting back across the map in time can be difficult if you happen to be stuck on foot. There is also a teleport device available by pressing 5, but if you've burned it up and it's on cooldown, hopefully you are paired with other players that realize this and stop to pick you up in one of the multi-seat vehicles.   The amount of upgrades available really let you customize your class uniquely from other players. I played medic in all matches and each time was different. In one case I was able to get an augment that allowed me use of other class' weapons, very cool.  The controls were something I still fumbled over with at the end of the night (even after remapping keybinds). Keys 1-4 seemed to have no visible use for changing weapons, althought 4 does bring up high-cost weapons like turrets once purchased, and 5 brings up a teleport device to return you to base quickly (found completely by accident on my part). Scroll Wheel does little to help with weapon switching as it will only cycle your primary and secondary weapons. For the case of a medic, there is a 3rd healing gun which I had to bind to Mouse3 just to have fast access to it. Quick switch on Q had me repeatedly bombing my team with grenades. Out of habit from other FPS games, I've become accustomed to subconciously hitting this to go between primary and last used secondary which never included grenades. In this game however, grenades are looped in. I'd like to see them removed from the quick switch cycle. These are minor adjustments the devs can make if other players felt the same way I do.  Lastly, the AI of the infantry dinos (raptors) seems like it could use some work. They are way to easy to take down in packs as they come at you line up in a row with no signs of deviating when being shot at. It was effortless to rack up killing sprees and higher on them. There were also times entire packs of raptors would run right passed me with one of my teammates firing on them; not very raptor like. The larger dinos seemed to have more intelligence as they would knock me away from the group often and keep us divided by distances. I would see the T-Rex target snipers by hurling rocks, so I wondered if the devs spent some time tuning them with actual objectives.  Other than these minor encumbrances, this game is fun and I look forward to playing more.
9322	1	a	I LOVE IT, just wish more people played it.
2842	0	a	Horrible load of ♥♥♥♥, I got it for free when they were giving it away. Not even worth the price of free, it's like a really broken and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ version of Halo 1 with dinosaurs.
9324	1	a	good with friends bad when you are alone.
9326	1	a	THIS IS THE AWESOME! I know this comment isn't really the helpfull. But it is true.
9328	1	a	This game is fun if you have people to play it with, otherwise it is rediculously hard to play.
2847	0	a	It's not often that I am left speechless, but today dear reader, I must cut off my voice and gaze upon the glory that is ORION Dino Horde in humbled silence. Truly a masterpiece, perfect in every way, the Citizen Kane of video games. Words cannot describe the joy and pleasure that result from engaging in this program. I must confess that I climaxed not once, not twice, but three times during my first session. If you only buy one game this year, if you buy only one game this century, if you buy only one game ever, I implore you, purchase this glorious piece of art and feel the warm glow of true satisfaction.
9330	1	a	This game is a lot of fun. If you are looking for a co-op game for you and some friends I advise you give this a try. Don't listen to the reviews from 2012 they don't apply to this game anymore, it has came a long way. For the price it's at you can't be disappointed. 
9332	1	a	This game is amazing. I got it in a four pack in the steam summer sale. Me and my friends have so much fun with it, and it cost so little. Tottaly worth getting. Really it is. The metta score is wrong. Don't belive it. Play this game with people. Co-op op.
9334	1	a	First time first person shooter.. and I really like this game.
9336	1	a	PLAY THIS GAME!!!!   That is all.
2849	0	a	I DON'T LIKE POLONIZE
9338	1	a	this is awesome! get this game!
9340	1	a	dam every fun with people :D recommend :D
9342	1	a	.....
9344	1	a	This game is fun xD
9346	1	a	It's mindless fun. Well worth the Summer Sale price. Would love to see some L4D-esque run n gun maps in the future. The almost have it with the outposts, just need a little more thought and it will be awsome! Level editors for the community maybe?
9348	1	a	Never before has humanity faced such a great evil as the invasion of dinosaurs, This series of revalations have shown me the true light of how we must face down the threat of a dinosaur invasion, i have ridden on a dinosaur, that much is true, i am the son of god, that much i hope, but mum could just be covering up for an affiar she had. Back to the point at hand, i reccomed this game, it has shown me how to save humanity from a threat that is like no other, ♥♥♥♥ the nazis they are nothing on this ♥♥♥♥. We need to deal with this threat and deal with it now! BUY THIS GAME AND JOIN THE FIGHT TO SAVE SLOTHS FROM AN INVASION OF SMALL ARM FART MACHINES!
9350	1	a	Not as bad as metascore says. Seriously, it's pretty fun when playing with friends.
9352	1	a	Great game other than being a bit laggy
9354	1	a	For all the money a person throws away on crap... The $1 I paid for this paid for itself! Yes, it's repetitive. Yes it's grapically boring. Yes, it's actually pretty pointless. So is Pac-Man, and people still pop in quarters to play it. If you're at least in your 30s, think back to all the times you popped in money to play Dragon's Lair. Even at the 1014 summer sale price of $3.74, it's worth getting imo if you're looking for cheap random wtfits amusement! If you have a friend to play with, it will quickly pay for itself. It's like going to Jurassic Park with jetpacks and guns! Don't go into this with a serious face! Go at it knowing what you're getting yourself into.  the bad... - very limited ability to customize yourself without the IAP bs. You do unlock a few things by playing a lot. - 1 music track for everything. Turn off the music, pop on some MP3s! - T-Rex 1 bite kills you! - Raptors are NOT clever! - It's not worth $15.00 when you can hit Walmart and get old AAA games for $20.
9356	1	a	A great game with plenty of action. The weapons are nice and the ability to run things down in vehicles is a plus. Challenging and always keeping me on my toes and the A.I. is better in this game than in most that I have played. Overall, a great and challengning game.
9358	1	a	Much better than metacritic gives it credit for
9360	1	a	One of the cooles coop games out there! metascroe missleading ignore plz and watch user reviews. worth every fakn cent 
2851	0	a	Cheap yes but lag ugh so much of it....If you want to play for 30mins than get bored than this is the game for you someone made this in a day just to steal your money dont buy unless you love games that you get stuck or people camp where you cant get them its like really if your going to make a game than do it right thank you:)
9362	1	a	Great fun with some friends, just think your in jurassic park, and fight of waves of dino's !
9364	1	a	I would recommend this game solely because it is fun to kill dinosaurs and how cheap you can pick it up for if you wait for a good sale. The graphics aren't very impressive, but it is very entertaining
9366	1	a	Loads of fun!  WELL  worth 0,99€.  Why haven't you bought it yet! 
2852	0	a	Got game for 99% off... Should've waited for a better sale, was not worth -1/10
9368	1	a	This game is very broken but is very fun if you are looking for a laugh with friends. My rating 6/10 It would be 8/10 if the sounds weren't f***ed up.
9370	1	a	The melee dueling combat is actually pretty fun; it feels Jedi-esque, and the horde mode is pretty fun (especially with friends). It was well worth the 90 cents I paid for it. There are a few glitches here and there, and the vehicles seem somewhat underpowered except for the car with the gun (it is only good because of its mobility).
2853	0	a	Even for 1.50$ this game is a huge waste of money, plain and boring, dont buy
2854	0	a	The Metacritics were right!!
9372	1	a	It looks like it's gunna be rubbish but it really isn't.
9374	1	a	Halo with dinosaurs  343/343
9376	1	a	Haha had a lot of fun with this game.. well worth the couple bucks. I personally played it with a couple buddies for a co-op fps and we waisted a lot of time and dinosaurs!!! :D
9378	1	a	A fast paced romp through a horde of dinosaurs. enjoyable alone, but the game really shines in its multiplayer. working together to take down the dinos is sufficiently difficult to make you chear when you hear the satisfying death screams. I haven't played much yet, but i thoroughly enjoyed it so far.
9380	1	a	Fun game. A little confusing at first but you will get the hang of it
9382	1	a	Ruined to my life!! Buy This Game I LOVE THIS!!!
9384	1	a	You can try to run over a T rex... 'try' 4/5
9386	1	a	Fun game, you get to shoot dinosaurs
2856	0	a	When this game first came out in beta it was known as orion : dino beatdown...It was a complete and utter junkheap then...Hardly anything worked and the gameplay was crap.However with the most recent update 12/21/13 it has slowly started to redeem itself and is slowly starting to become a good game.   * Never mind its still a piece of ♥♥♥♥.
9388	1	a	The graphics were not too bad, the gameplay does have a few bugs and the boss dinos are pretty hard hitting but what were you expecting from a 99p game. In my opinion this game is pure gold, it has fun gameplay and it's almost innovative to the indie genre. The weapon range is large and it has a competetive element inside it. Therefore I would consider buying this not if you just have spare change but if you want hours of fun then it's a must buy.
9390	1	a	This game is one of the best fps shooters i have played in a while. You just can't beat the feel of Halo with bad ♥♥♥ dinos.
9392	1	a	Shot my friend and killed him, then turned into a dinosaur and ate him. 99999 out of 10
9394	1	a	when it was free
9396	1	a	This game is so much fun to play. I like the fact that you can play as dinosaurs. It's a lot of fun chasing my friends around trying to eat them with zombie gator. lol 
2859	0	a	Glitchy, unplayable, boring, not fun, broken, poor ai, bad sound effects, bad graphics, strange physics... there just isn't a positive thing to say about it. Avoid it.  The game has been 'updated' since I wrote this but you should know the full history of the game:  Release week: game literally unplayable. Literally, you could open the program and not actually play the game due to some networking issues. Dev's blamed it on steam.  Week later an update came out 'fixing' the problem but you could only get the game to work by messing with some things. IE: ♥♥♥♥ing with the program.  So now you could kind of sort of play, right? Well, I was treated to one of the glitchiest games I've ever experienced, far worse than Dead Island. Things that happened included: hitting a pterodactyl corpse with a jeep and shooting STRAIGHT INTO THE SKY. The dodgy AI also got stuck inside buildings somehow, so that was entertaining. At one point I saved up money for 20 or so minutes to buy a flying thing, then immediately (like 50/70 feet above the ground) hit the skybox and either took damage or blew up (it's been a while). Also pretty sure I bought a walker, stepped off the pad (maybe 2/3 feet) and fell, taking damage or blowing up.  There's also this:   http://imgur.com/a/G2sts/noscript   This game was broken on release and the dude is super shady. The game was renamed to get around crappy metacritic scores and then the new game had the metacritic padded with fake accounts. After about two years is the game playable? Yeah, sure. It's just not very fun.  There's so much information on this game out there and if you're actually considering it, please go educate yourself on the history to it. Please.  Update as of Sept 13, 2014:  Alright, it's been a few years and I guess this has gotten a lot of updates (and two name changes? To avoid the poor critical reception me thinks) so I had to ask myself: is this game fun now?  Well, no, it isn't. It's been updated a lot, there are a lot of new features and the visuals are better. Hell, I would even go so far as to say this is an actual game now!  But when I join I still don't know what the hell I'm supposed to do (I kill dinosaurs, sure, but I don't understand the objectives at all -- probably because I haven't played enough). The AI is still dodgy as ♥♥♥♥ and can be outwitted simply by jetpacking on top of a building. Vehicles are still op in that going back and forth will just mow down an entire wave. Worst part? All of the new features have just further alienated me from the game. I don't know what the ♥♥♥♥ is worth geting and what isn't, which might not matter since everything just runs out of ammo very quickly anyway.  This game is still a pass. I'd recommend killing floor over it because the mechanics are similar but Killing Floor is actually good and fun. I will say Orion had and possibly still has a lot of potential, and maybe it's fun with friends when you know what the hell you're doing. But then, so are a lot of things.
9398	1	a	So worth the 99 cents. Got tons of laughs, really enjoyable, a bit frightening at time. But overall, a really valuable game to play once and awhile with friends.
9400	1	a	I played only a small portion of this game, though I can say that it is amazing. Despite it being EXTREMELY laggy/buggy (Might have just been the server) I found a lot of promise in it. It is a $0.99 game after all. You should be getting a mobile game at that price, not a game full in every way. Thank you, devs, for this awesome experience.
9402	1	a	well worth the money gve me hours of fun.
9404	1	a	If you have friends buy this game. If you dont have friends buy some. If you dont have money get a job. If you cant get a job rob somebody. if you cant rob somebody well you cant get this game :-/
9406	1	a	So cheap So fun So Simple. Buy the four pack and play with some mates for a few hours. its a bargin. unlike other some other games out there.
9408	1	a	The MetaScore is a LIE. A very if not superbly underated game.
9410	1	a	This game is amazing. The only question is, why the ♥♥♥♥ is the price so low. This is a $30 game. $0.99 for this good of a game. This game is perfect, fun, entertaining, engaging, and action packed.
9412	1	a	Running i7,8GBRAM, Geforce GT 720.  Stars: 1.5 ASSTAR RATING (so low it hurts my ♥♥♥)   -Pros- -FPS Dino Counter Strike -kill dinos -childhood memories    -CONS- -9mins and my ♥♥♥ hurt, so that means (ill be switching to a diffrent game.) -Play to waste time, in between wasting time like usual..
9414	1	a	love it must play
9416	1	a	This has developed into one of the best indi games out there. If you like Killing Floor, this is your type of game. But it has better graphics, deeper custimization, massive maps, vehicles, and rediculous outfits. Very tough!
2862	0	a	C'mon, you know you want it. A dollar. There are dinosaurs, guns, vehicles, melee, all you need. BUT, only buy it if you have a friend to play with you, because this game is coop based. Have fun.  EDIT .: WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED HERE
9418	1	a	its well cheap lad
9420	1	a	 Orion: Dino Horde/Orion: Prelude.  This is a relatively fun game, It has quite alot of customizable options as well as a neat Combat System. Now one of the main objectives of the game is to defend against 10 Waves of Dinosaurs increasing in difficulty which each Wave passed; You have a lot of weapon choices to purchase and use as well as Vehicles you can use to help defend against Dino Hordes varying from Ground Troop Carriers to large airborne Helicopter-Like vehicles that specialize in dishing out damage to the Dinos. While the game is alot of fun it does take some time to get used to and lacking a Tutorial can see many new players dying to the enemy Dinos quickly and severly weakening your team. Putting aside the lack of a Tutorial i really enjoyed this game in the short time i had to play it; It does have a tendency to crash every now and then but apart from that it's a pretty solid and enjoyable game.  I'd rate it a 8/10; Would have been higher if the game had an implemented Tutorial system, I did die quite alot in the first few rounds i played on this game.
9422	1	a	Awesome addicting game
9424	1	a	Very Cheap and Very Good &lt;3
9426	1	a	Its well made, fun and interesting . . recomended for casual gamers. 7/10
9428	1	a	It's Awesome Game
9430	1	a	Worth the dollar but i didnt pay for it so i dont care 
9432	1	a	A first-person shooter that has light sabers and allows the player to kill dinosaurs; I am not sure what more I could ask for. Despite the lag I experience during the gameplay, I still loved the short hours that I tried this game.  A dollar well spent, I guess I could say.
2869	0	a	consolitis. The slew of positive reviews are developer shills.  Do not fall for this ♥♥♥♥ game.
9434	1	a	For $0.99 you will get a TON of Jurrasic fun! Buy it, its a bargain.
9436	1	a	idk much but seens fun
9438	1	a	This game is AMAZING! There, I said it. This is what everyone has always wanted, a mix between Dinosaurs,Halo, and a bit of Borderlands. Not the bad stuff like 3 years olds screeching in their mics when they die, no, like the good graphics and FUTURISTIC VEHICLES! If that isn't enough, how about the ability to be a FREAKING DINOSAUR! Its everyones dream to either be a dinosaur or ride one, so why not both in this game? INFACT, there is an achivevment where you ride a dinos back (preferably T-REX)! If all this fun isn't enough, this game is $1. THATS RIGHT, $1 DOLLAR. And if you are the free-to-play sort of person, these developers actually give out copies of the game! These people care, and I don't think they get enough back, that's why I recommend this game to anyone who loves atleast one of these things on the list:DINOSAURS,HALO,BORDERLANDS, AND HINT OF CALL OF DUTY (minus the bad stuff, and no, its not everything). If you can get your friends to play this with you, maybe you'll finally be able to see how many dinos you can kill with an extra dino trying to eat you! Or just PVP with freaking light sabers, your choice. Final Verdict: 9/10 Would recommend!  (And a tip, maybe more servers that include rampage, rampage is fun.)
9440	1	a	This game is amazing and well thought out. It has not only superb graphics, but amazing music as well. The gameplay is easy to pick up on and its fun to play for hours and hours at a time, even on maps that are worlds to roam around in. Killing dinos is now one of my favorite things to do in video games, thanks to this.
9442	1	a	This game is fun... I was a bit skeptical at first due to the bad rating.. but some of the reviews convinced me to try it.. i have to say its enjoyable... fun for some killing sprees on dinosuars ... its a bit on the basic side, but the devlopers keep polishing it... its well worth its price... i must say i do love jet packing over a T-Rex's head then putting some slugs into it with my dubble pistoles as im dodging flying terrodactos,
9444	1	a	Cool because it has dinosaurs
9446	1	a	Its all about the dinosaurs fools!
2870	0	a	The game get's really boring with just PVE, it's all people play. The is no PVP community. 4/10 Community runied it.
9448	1	a	The lag sucked, and i can't play as Dinosaurs, But for the most part, COMPLETELY AWESOME AND I RECOMMEND IT!
2871	0	a	The games fun. When it works. Buggy as hell.
9450	1	a	Much Dinosaurs. T-Rex, Power Rangers.  Good Game, GG, No- RE, Cluth or Kick.
9452	1	a	Great game. I recommend a lot! At first its hard learning controls and how the game works. Once you figure that out it's a blast to play. 9/10
9454	1	a	Not a great game, but for the asking price, at least the graphics are worth it!
9456	1	a	great game
9458	1	a	not a bad game, honestly if i wasnt utterly flat broke and three months behind on my mortgage paymant id buy this thing in a second. its not spectacular, but for 99 cents its a heck of a deal. I mean, where else are you gonna get to battle dinosaurs online?
9460	1	a	very easy to setup and play ! 
9462	1	a	is rly good
9464	1	a	A lot of fun for 99 cents.
2873	0	a	Survival game versus dinosaurs? Nah,i dont really like this game Because the story and level gap is to determine the game ==
9466	1	a	This game simply blows away those other $10-$20 survival shooters.... I just cant believe this game is priced just 99cents. Killing a T-rex..What more do you simply want from a game? I am gonna be playing this for a long time.
9468	1	a	It's Good More Then CoD Ghosts And Cheapest ! Buy it Cool Graphicks and Cheap !!!
9470	1	a	This is the most fun you will ever have in a game for 99 cents. From the aerial attacks, to the breakdancing T-Rex ragdolls, this game is fantastic with friends.
9472	1	a	its on no bad 
9474	1	a	the best game
2875	0	a	prelude is a downgrade from dinohoard dont buy this game and it lags the mouse alot even with almost everything disabled or minimul
9476	1	a	I recommend, the game is very fun, if you noob play cod you must try this one lol :P
9478	1	a	20/10 this game is amazing i love it 
9480	1	a	Really great and fun game, tons of customization and frenzied action, as well as constant free DLC! Only downside is that you need a semi-strong PC to run it decently.
9482	1	a	Dinosaurs, that is all.
9484	1	a	Its not all that but its fun.
9486	1	a	Awsome game!
9488	1	a	yes this is a asome game 
9490	1	a	very good but he graphics are ok
9492	1	a	best dino killing game 10/10 would buy this for all of the people who dont have it jk
9494	1	a	Ever wanted to play a game where the support class doesn't work? Ever wanted to be utterly destroyed by tons of dinos? Ever wanted to buy useless upgrades that won't affect gameplay at all? Ever wanted to win a ps4? Ever been ready for freddy?  No. This game deserves to be worth 99 cents. pls fix it tho
9496	1	a	Was $15, but they renamed it and changed the proce to $1. ♥♥♥♥ed over whoever bought Dino Horde, but animations game still on point.
9498	1	a	Is it a great game? Nah. Do I feel like I spend most of the time backpedaling as fast as possible to keep shooting dinos in the head? Yeah. Is the weapon and perk buying between waves mechanic decent? Sure.  Am I debating just buying a handful of four packs and giving them out to my friends saying 'We need to get a group together to play this?' Ooh hell yeah.  There seems to be a lot of polish missing, but for 99¢ there isn't the 'I paid $30 for this garbage?' response. Sometimes I know I don't want to play a real complicated game, and I just want to dome some dinos. And given use of the Unreal Engine, and decent selection of weapons, I have to say I prefer this as my mindless dino shooter of choice; beating out Primal Carnage despite it being objectively better in most ways.  Give it a try. If you don't have a buck to spare, what are you doing looking at reviews on Steam anyway?
9500	1	a	This game is $0.99 and amazing, if you don't buy it you're actually ♥♥♥♥ed.  Seriously...  Buy it you ♥♥♥♥.
9502	1	a	I don't like it but with friends is funny. For less then 1 € it deserve a recommended :)
2877	0	a	This game is so terrible that it's hysterical, worth the pennies they're selling it for on sale just to laugh at it for an hour :D
9504	1	a	This game boasts many game mods and playing hours, it's fun for solo but great for multiplayer, SDK coming out soon is crazy and I can't wait to see what will cook up.  Thank you devs for your continuous efforts and good luck!
2878	0	a	its a bad game. i bought on sale 2 bucks and it still wasent worth it and even though its only a $1 now its still hard to justify. the gameplay is repititve and not very satisfying. i played maybe two hours before i got super bored and never touched again. graphics suck as well. the action is decent but it still gets old fast. 3/10
9506	1	a	Ok I clicked recommend but its right on the edge between good and bad. Yeah its only $0.99 but its only ok. The graphics are ok, the effects are kinda ok, and its only multiplayer(so it probely shouldve been free). But it has lost of fast pace action and can be fun. Its kinda worth the $0.99 but it wouldve been better free.
9508	1	a	Good game i like it.The game is costing only 79 cents but it would be like 10 euro
9510	1	a	For the price, the game offers many hours of enjoyment.
9512	1	a	This game is very addicting! Don't let the metacritic fool you. I've played my money's worth with this game a hundred times over.
9514	1	a	Great fun with friends for the low, low price of only €1
9516	1	a	Besides completing some objectives in-game with random people, operating some vehicles, and killing s***loads of dinosaurs, this game doesn't really have much to offer. The graphics are pretty good and this game truly impresses me, but it's just not my cup of tea. That being said, who doesn't like dinosaurs in video games?? If you like running around Halo Reach style and killing many tiny-to-massive dinosaurs with your teammates, then by all means this is your game.
9518	1	a	It's fun and easy to get the hang of. And even if you don't like it, it's a dollar.
9520	1	a	Killing floor with dinosaurs and tanks.
9522	1	a	When i first saw this game I thought 'This looks okay, lets check it out... 79p? Lets try it out, if it sucks then i lost 79p which isn't a great deal' but wow, this game is great! Much better than COD GHOSTS if I'm honest.
9524	1	a	shooting dinosaurs how can it not be good?
9526	1	a	pretty dope as hell. wtb more guns though and a better fov slider.
9528	1	a	I highly reccomend this game. The graphics are very good, the gameplay is very good, and the design is very nice. It's a lot more fun to play with friends than alone, but still fun regardless. And shoot, it's only 99 cents!
2882	0	a	it is a lot like a more kid friendly version of the game evolve
2883	0	a	Atleast uninstal works...
2884	0	a	Wouldn't play it if it was free. Nothing exciting, there's no challenge or skill. Either your class can beat your challenger(s) or not. It's actually pretty frusterating because so many mechanics, ballences, or hitboxes make no sense. Just run around and shoot. There are much more multiplayers for free. If you like the concept of dinos vs humans -&gt; Primal Carnage. Occasional server bugs, but worth paying for over this.
9530	1	a	Ok, so, my previous review was a thumbs down, HOWEVER they have updated it and lowered the price which in my opinion made it a lot more worth it. So, I dont reccomend this game if you are a lonely person with no friends because this game is SUPPOSED TO BE PLAYED WITH FRIENDS! I cant express that enough, this game honestly does not quite fill all the gaps that it had before it got updated a lot *aka glitches, bugs, etc* however its cheap and its a fun survival game to PLAY WITH FRIENDS.  Overall Scores: If you are playing it alone: 4/10 If you are playing it with friends: 7/10
9532	1	a	Hate dinosaurs? Shoot em in the face.  Unlike most games, this game needs a lot of attention. it would be WAY better if the community was bigger. One of my main problems with this games is that when i go to check out all the servers, theres hardly ANY open servers. 
9534	1	a	Oh my! I've played for only 20hrs and already I have had lots of fun. For 99c you get: Good graphics, a host of weapons, and lots of Dinos to wreck! Totally recommend this! 2 thumbs up!
2885	0	a	.99 cents and it still isn't worth the money.
9536	1	a	Very fun game for only a dollar. Just get it
2886	0	a	Lemmie just fix up the store description...  'ORION: Prelude' is an indie Sci-Fi shooter (FPS/TPS) that blunlty blends together half-♥♥♥♥♥ visuals and subpar combat. It puts you and your former friends together into boring, bland battles using some of the most generic weaponry and clunky vehicles in which you must work or compete against one another to accomplish mission objectives, explore modest-sized worlds and survive the devastating Dinosaur Horde.'   I know this game is a dollar but it wasn't originally and this game tried to put out major damage control to try to not look terrible.  'Don't believe the reviews' my ♥♥♥.
9538	1	a	It's .99 cents, if you still have an issue with buying it, you might be jewish.
9540	1	a	...

9542	1	a	I never played Orion: Dino Beatdown so I missed all the hate towards that first iteration. I first played over a free weekend in August of 2013 with Orion: Dino Horde. And now they have released Prelude.  Prelude seems to have added a lot of polish to the game which is nice and appreciated.  Is ORION: Prelude a great game? No. Is it a Bad game? No it is not bad either. What this game is, is pure unadulterated fun. If you like shooting dinosaurs with guns I highly recommend this game to you.  The only downside of this game is that if it isn't a free weekend, the servers can be sparsely populated. With the introduction of bots (that will fill one of the slots for squad members until a human drops in and takes their place (which is brilliant btw)) and lowering the price of the game, hopefully this will no longer be an issue.  So grab this game! It really is a lot of fun :D
9544	1	a	The animations make my sides hurt. Near-static dinosaurs are hurling toward you, and something about the human running animation is so awkward to look at. It's quite buggy, but it didn't really hurt my experience. I was battling against floating raptor heads, for instance. Quite hilarious. For $0.99, it's pretty good.
9546	1	a	I wish iI could use all the weapons that u buy
9548	1	a	Great COOP Game! Success in my LAN House! :D
9550	1	a	This is a very fun game. sometimes lags a bit even on my alien ware PC other than that a great game  - it should be more than 0.99cents  - i'll give it a 9 out of 10, fix the lag  - a few glitches
9552	1	a	can't go wrong for 99 cents. lots of fun to be had here 
2889	0	a	Absolute rubbish do not buy it
2890	0	a	i boht it and 1 week later it vanished from my library.but its a great game.
9554	1	a	Very fun game! Good weaponds, Great vehicles!  I give it a 8/10. Needs a little more polish for the ingame interface, but hey for .99 cents worth every penny! 
9556	1	a	The best game ever
2892	0	a	First game I join. Dinosaurs with pirate hats attack. I then uninstalled.
9558	1	a	very fun. i never played the original, so all i have to go on is what ive seen here. Picked it up on sale, well worth the $1 i paid for it. Cool weapons and augments.
9560	1	a	Killed a T-Rex almost cried. I love Dinosours. But it's a nice game and easy to learn.
2895	0	a	Its like you pay for ♥♥♥♥
9562	1	a	the servers are lagy
9564	1	a	It's actually pretty fun
9566	1	a	Dinosaurs and futuristic weapons.  The first time I played this game, my childhood  exploded  was rendered all over the screen. Many other reviews cover the finer details of the game, so instead of rehashing them, I say just go play it!! Plus it's really really cheap, so you don't have much to lose, yet everything to gain.
9568	1	a	it has Dinos lightsabers and jetpacks and it only 1$ buy it now
9570	1	a	1 dollar for loads of fun* Only if you play with friends, THIS GAME IS THE BEST.  Rating : 6+x of 10 x= amount of friends
9572	1	a	Game is pretty badass but very poorly optimized
9574	1	a	This game is great for co-op, it's like left 4 dead. Nothing much but it's fun if you're with your friends.
9576	1	a	Nice game!
2897	0	a	Great if you like Halo with dinosaurs and toilet skid-marks for graphics. -10/10
9578	1	a	One of the most fun games I've played for 0.99 cents ! Be a T-REX! and eat people! Or shoot em up as a person. Either way you're bound to have fun, best 0.99 cents I've ever spent.
9580	1	a	its great and for only .99 it is too good, if they added a story line it could be even better but still great. if you like halo and call of duty zombie's mashed to gether than download it now
9582	1	a	I knifed a t-rex.  11/10
9584	1	a	Great game. For a $1 ... its worth more
2902	0	a	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLJTAqnmHt0 
9586	1	a	best buck you will ever spend
9588	1	a	Hell of a bargain for less than a dollar. Little bit laggy and altogether not very visually impressive, but a good time killer with friends.
9590	1	a	Best .99 cent I've ever spent. Its stupid fun and nothing is broken.  I shot a Trex with a Flamethrower, it ate me while i was on fire, I went into second wind, it died from the flames. I won.
2904	0	a	there is nobody playing the game and i cant play@!!! 
9592	1	a	this game is the best. all i could ask for is bots in PVP maps
9594	1	a	its k for the price of snickers.
9596	1	a	For the money the game is well worth it. Its fun to play with Friends and make new friends 8/10
9598	1	a	Why isnt this 100% positive? WHAT THE HELL HAS THIS WORLD COME TOO?
9600	1	a	This game is just really fun. I love the concept of it and I love how you can upgrade to different weapons! It's a great game for such a price, a steal really. I recommend this game. It might get boring at times so I will give it a 8/10.
9602	1	a	I have no idea what's going on  But hey it's a dollar.
9604	1	a	so good you cant consider your self a gamer if you havent played it
9606	1	a	10/10 very good for a dollar, but not as good as Bad Rats
9608	1	a	Awesome and cheap game have alot of achieve ments :D
9610	1	a	Best $1 i ever spent. to run on my pc, i had to put most settings to low. Even then it still looks pretty good! best advice, turn settings to low, and keep depth of field. If you're into co-op, horde mode games, check this out. fun gameplay, good game to bs around in for a little while!
2906	0	a	complete utter ♥♥♥♥ do not download, hopefully as people give it ♥♥♥♥ reviews they wont change the name again. Rest In Pestrami
9612	1	a	Killed a T-Rex with a shiny purple bow . 11/10
9614	1	a	Join Shoot Upgrade Die Game Crash Repeat
9616	1	a	At this point dont bother trying to differentiate the Orion games. If it goes on sale, pick it up and play it until you're bored. It's like a $1-5 gumball.  With dinosaurs.
9618	1	a	I like killing dinos not to mention shooting things
9620	1	a	Quoth the Mackelmore;  'But ♥♥♥♥, It was 99 Cents!'
9622	1	a	this game is awesome
9624	1	a	At less than a dollar, you cant afford to not own ORION: Prelude. Not in this economy.
9626	1	a	gameplay nice, play fast
2909	0	a	All the demos are at like, 1/4th the speed of the actual game. The game itself is so incredibly fast that unless you know precisely how it works from the get-go, you're going to be spending a long time just figuring it out.
2910	0	a	It crashed after 9 minutes.
9628	1	a	the most fun i have had for 99cent. Game is great fun to play with friends :)
2911	0	a	Its very laggy i would rate this game a 6/10 the graphics aren't that good and its should be free for the games performance. Tell me what you think in the description.
9630	1	a	This game is awesome. I think every one should play this game.
2912	0	a	Why da F*CK did i buy this game for 0.99,- ? i dont know. 
9632	1	a	I don't play this game. Why do i have this? I looks okay... i think           Nah not really
9634	1	a	This game is a riot for a goodly amount of time, but after a while it gets a little plain. One of those titles you lose interest in and then come back to. But s*** it was 99 cents.
9636	1	a	for 99 cents (thats some top dollar pricing ya hear me homie).
2913	0	a	the trailer makes it look gret but the graphics glitches and driving are terrible and theres not even single player missions or bot matches, i could get better free to play games. Im so disappointed i wasted my money.  3/10
9638	1	a	very interesting fps game, recommended to play, i like when hitting a t-rex with my gun, so say hello to my little friend :3 #bang #bang
9640	1	a	real men dont use guns, they use swords, 10/10 for manliness score, now go solo a t-rex with a sword
9642	1	a	fun shooter game reminds me of halo shooting stiles 
9644	1	a	this is a fun game if your really bored and have nothing to do...
9646	1	a	This game is very fun and i bought it for only 0.79€!
9648	1	a	Buy this game for all your friends when its on sale and force them to play with you. Then you gotta find some more friends.
9650	1	a	The game is about dinoasourse and shooting a t-rex can throw a rock at people i mean honestly what do you people want.
9652	1	a	My system is moderatley-okay, and can run most games on mid-high mixed settings, but this unoptomized lemon gave me 3fps and made me re-think my life choices.  3/10 would not buy
9654	1	a	Don't let the price tag fool you, this game is absolute gold. There are hours of fun to be had with a friendly community or solo. You can make this game extremely easy to kill everything or so hard you won't surpass wave 1. You will not regret buying this game, especially at this not-even-on-sale-price. The only thing this game is missing im my opinion (or, rather, what this game needs more of) are guns and abilities. Namely, class-specific abilities. It is a great game overall and is not an incomplete game, it just needs a few more abilities/guns/dinos/maps to play on/with.
9656	1	a	Borderlands 2 + Left 4 Dead 2 + Halo + Jurassic World + Evolve = ORION : Prelude   9.5/10  Graphic good, environment good, gameplay good, but movement too stiff  I would like to recommend this game
9658	1	a	Very good for a $1 game, if your in to games with dinosaurs and your low on budget this is the perfect game for you.
9660	1	a	Tell me why this game is so cheap?
9662	1	a	1: Watch this  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShQ3GBFI4KQ  (Official video) 2: Buy this game. 3: Profit.
9664	1	a	I am not going to go into depth on this game, but I will say this. The Developer has really done this game justice, constantly updating it, making it playable, and making it enjoyable. For $0.99, this is a steal. If you can find friends to play this game with, it's amazing.  VERDICT: Halo + Killing Floor + Dinosaurs = ORION: Prelude
9666	1	a	10/10  Would play halo with dinosaurs again.    -NGI   wait you mean this isnt halo?
9668	1	a	Choose Recon Buy x2 energy and ninja upgrade KILL ALL SONS OF BI***** with knife = BADASS 11/10 would kill T-rex with only knife again (■_■) 
9670	1	a	ORION: Prelude is fun in some aspects. But, in others its pretty bad. I like it though.
9672	1	a	Very Good Game
9674	1	a	ORION: Prelude might possibly be................ the best game in our solar system. It's advanced understanding of the way human and dinosaur love would really be in the year 1916 is amazing. I had ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic reactions upon opening ORION: Prelude. Dinosaur is another word for gaming experience with a new, captivating, yet sentimental brutality. ORION: Prelude is the type of friend that you could just make love to 3 times before getting bored. i r8 9/8 gr8 game
9676	1	a	i played this game when it was ♥♥♥♥ and loved it with my friend now i cant play it because of a ♥♥♥♥ pc and want to so bad 100/10 omg yes all the time
2921	0	a	I'm glad the 'Quit game' button works.  This game is the most poorly optimised game I have ever launched, you know it's bad when you have to set the graphical settings to minimal with a 4GB graphic card. Please save yourselves by NOT purchasing this. I'm glad my friend bought a pack for us, so I can write a review. Please, do not buy this game. Developers need to optimise this game and fix several bugs to make it worthwhile...
9678	1	a	CoD and Jurassic Park got married and had a child but then CoD divorced Jurassic Park and Star Wars become the stepfather.    0248329 WI5THNAJDBSFBESBEELZEBUB/10 IGN would get molested by a Trex again.
9680	1	a	It's an alright game.
9682	1	a	Did you ever wake up one day and felt the need to drive a jeep into a T-Rex' face? Now you can  Ever wondered what it felt like to ♥♥♥♥♥slap a raptor with the butt of your rifle? Now you can  Ever seen a stegosaurus do the moonwalk on the side of a cliff? Now you can  Do you have the uncontrolable urge to jump on the back of a triceratops and stab it with a knife repeatidly? Now you can.  Ever wanted to play Halo, Borderlands, Turok, Time Splitters, Planetside, Jurrasic Park all at once? Now you can.  This game is absolute mayhem. It doen't win any prizes for its quality but it does what it's supposed to do: deliver hours of hilarity and action. I binned Mass Effect. I binned The Witcher 2. I tossed aside Deux Ex 3.  But this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ shooting gallery? it will make me come back for more. If anything, this game is a guilty pleasure.  Ever wanted to pwn dinos while laughing your ♥♥♥ off for a whopping $0,99 and give money grabbing corporations like EA the finger in the process?  Now you can.  DO IT.
9684	1	a	Quality time unleashing my inner wrath with my friends. Please add widescreen 2560x1080 support.
2922	0	a	Think of owning this game like adopting a troubled child. Sure it'll grow, and sure chances are it'll get better year after year, but at some point when it's revealed that the child is actually a derranged serial killer, you'll wonder if it was born that way or if there was anything you could've done to avoid to. The answer is no.
9686	1	a	Saw this game durring a Sale, was .49 Cents, Thought, 'Hey I got nothing else to spend it on, might just be a boring game'. Boy Was I wrong, Game is very fun and only being a Dollar it's easy to get, Short time Ive played it enjoyed it
9688	1	a	It's a great dinosaur FPS game! The sensitivity of your head movement needs some work, but other than that, great game!
9690	1	a	I fought someone wid yellow light sabers den he told me he is my father  i crieded ;*(  10/10 would cri agen
9692	1	a	What A turn around.
9694	1	a	This is nowhere close to completition, it lacks graphics, combat etc,etc... But if you have friends to play with you, you can play for a few hours and it's cheap!
9696	1	a	Poorly optimized.  EDIT: The devs really turned the game around.
9698	1	a	Great game fast pased shoot em up. would like to see a ambient sound bar and a seperate gun sound bar. graphics are beautiful and the action is real gameplay on youtube. well done really happy with this :)  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIFzwvmFrUtWUVJh19TXkuw/feed 
2923	0	a	Look, just because a game is inexpensive doesn't mean it is worth your time. I thought with positive reviews and the inexpensive price, running and gunning for dinos sounded like an okay time. And it was, for the first hour... maybe two. It isn't even that it is a bad game, it really just isn't a good one, at least not without other players. Maybe they're all on privte servers or something, but pulic ones seem to be pretty sparse and while Bots can fill in, they are incredible stupid and apparently can do nothing other than prance about shooting dinos. Sounds like the point of it, right? Well, they don't provide cover fire if you need to rescue your generator and don't ever seem to work on objectives other than killing dinos. In a word, useless.   I'm not going to complain about graphics because they aren't that bad, though maybe it was my video card or something but I had some wonky glitches from time to time. Game modes are shoot dinos, shoot more dinos, shoot dinos and each other, shoot more dinos, and did I mention shooting dinos? The variations on the theme are not overly interesting. You guard a generator vs waves of dinos. You guard it against waves of dinos and an enemy team while trying to take out theirs. You capture objectives while taking out waves of dinos. I reallky wasn't exaggerating when I said 'shoot more dinos'.  Are there cool things you can do? Certainly. Is it awful? No. Am I recommending it? No way. I just think there are other things that could, would and should be more fun. If you really want something inexpensive and midly amusing to play for a few hours until something else you're aching to play comes along -- Orion may be the game for you. Otherwise, play some backlog, spend that buck on cards and make badges, or find something else and spare yourself a bit of grief.  As with all reviews -- this is merely my opinion and your mileage may vary.
9700	1	a	IT GOOD GAME
9702	1	a	Why is there not a pro scene for this game?!
9704	1	a	Really awful game in a lot of ways, but I deeply enjoyed it while playing with friends. You get pitted against dinosaurs. The devs say it used to be worse. I can believe it. My favorite thing has got to be zooming away on a vehicle and sniping scary dinosaurs from a distance.
9706	1	a	It's horrifically awesome
9708	1	a	Fights dino with ''lightsaber'' always die 10/10
9710	1	a	Really laggy for me.
9712	1	a	This is awesome, have fun with friends.
9714	1	a	This is a perfect example of a bad game turned good. Shoot dinos in the face and get interesting upgrades. Graphics are meh, dinos glitch out (in funny ways lel) and the sound design is wonky, but it's a buck. What more could you ask for a buck?  Honestly though, if this game were free, no one would play it.
9716	1	a	11/10 would play the worst game ever again :D
9718	1	a	Fun game.If only it wasn't for the lag(but that's probably because of distance, not the game). I can't really complain about anything. Got it in a 4 pack for myself and a few friends, glad I did.
9720	1	a	The best worst game ever Play with friends
9722	1	a	A nice combination of dinosaurs and fps
9724	1	a	One of the greatest stories in gaming ever. Absolute disaster turned into a hilarious and fun game with a simple and near perfect premise 'Dinosaurs attack and you have jet packs, rocket launchers, and 4 buddies.'
9726	1	a	its .99 cent. its multiplayer. theres guns. theres dinosaurs  
9728	1	a	I killed a T-Rex with a butter knife and then died to a chihuahua sized raptor. 10/10
9730	1	a	Orion Prelude... What can I say... Fun multiplayer/ Co-Op dinosaur killing mayhem, all for the low price of .99 USD or 3.99 USD for a four pack. Can't go wrong. :)
9732	1	a	great game
9734	1	a	it's great but i didn't get time to play it much. 
9736	1	a	this game is awsome the gameplay is great the game everything about it its awsome keep on what your doing guys keep it up
9738	1	a	This is so addicting especially if you have friends and the Graphics are bearable. Again the gameplay of shooting dinosaurs and the guns are awesome!  Positives: EXTREMELY CHEAP!!!! $1.19NZD and $0.75USD Nice graphics(Unreal Engine 3, I think) Fun gameplay Great gun selection Easy and quick movement 3 balanced classes(Assault-JetPack, Medic-Medigun, Recon-Cloak Device) Good and easy server selection AI is good and bearable(ACTUALLY)  Negatives: Huge terrains/maps; so big and takes a while to get across but creative Some glitchy AI spawns Some server lag but once in your good  Overall: 9/10 due to some bugs
9740	1	a	dayum dis focking cheap 79p BRAHHH
9742	1	a	This game is amazing. Picked it up for about 10 cents.... Best 10 cents I have ever spent. Even if you only get a couple hours of fun out of it here and there, it is still well worth the money.   In this game you fight dinosaurs and defend your power generator with guns and vehicles (mechs, helicopters, cars, tanks, etc.). You can also get perks that increase your survivability. That pretty much sums it up.  The graphics are nice, gameplay is fun and simple, and the multiplayer is great and active.  My rating: 7.5/10
9744	1	a	You can use the FORCE! :D
2927	0	a	Bored. If I could give it away I would.
9746	1	a	bought all of the Augments, Turned from a HALO Spartan IV into a Spartan I
9748	1	a	Hmm, let's see.  Guns checked Violence checked Dinosaurs checked  They have utilised elements from Halo, Star Wars, Turok, Quake and Crysis. Now if they can utilise the Alien franchise, this will be my number one FPS!
9750	1	a	The game is absolutely crazy I really like the game, and it really likes me I was playing it, while drinking my cuppa tea the weapons in this are like fish, in the sea so buy this game it only costs a small fee i've added so many dinosaurs to my family tree we're really close but they eat endlessly  done with the tea, now i'm going for a pee!
9752	1	a	So, Are you guys smoking something? This is worth more than a dollar.
9754	1	a	This is so much better then the original game! so fun and time consuming I would love for anyone to play the game, although hard at first and laggy i still love it.
9756	1	a	Very nice.. need some graphic improvement :O
2928	0	a	This may be one of the worst games I've ever played. I made it through one match before the mad animations, terrible graphics, and the lack of sounds for certain weapons got to me.
9758	1	a	very good game 5of5 stars:)
9760	1	a	when i got this game it looked great now it looks ... i do ... because there are no words to describe this game definitly get it 0.99 is totally worth it
9762	1	a	Legit THE BEST 74 cents I have spent on steam. This game should be worth 10 dollars. It's so awesome. I just played 3 hours straight, It's awesome. 10/10 Great Dev's
2930	0	a	Its not good, like at all. Everybody is praising it because it used to suck but it still sucks. It is very, very far from being a good game. The fact that it used to be worse than this scares me and makes me wonder how it got on the steam store at all. 2/10 - Shameful.
9764	1	a	DO IT!
9766	1	a	Seriously? $1.00? Can't go wrong with this one!
9768	1	a	This is a really awesome game that suits everyone! 
9770	1	a	I actually liked it and for the price of 1/5 kebab, why not?
9772	1	a	I would love to see better graphics and to fix some more bugs. Otherwise it is really fun :)
9774	1	a	My first time seeing this game I didn't watch any gameplay something in me knew it would be an amazing game. The metta Score of 36/100 is misleading it deserves a 90/100. This provides an amazing co-op gameplay you can play hours without getting bored! I would sugest buying the 4-pack and grabing your freinds to play this epic game! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Update 5/5/2015  Since my original review I have to change my rating of this game. Since I first bought the 4-pack back when Orion Dino Horde first realeased up till now I have bought atleast 5 more copies of this game after buying the 4 pack for friends! Instead of the developers abandoning this game when it had horrible reviews they never gave up! They continuously updated the game over and over again making it better and better each time. Untill eventually it became Orion-Prelude the Dino game we all know and love today. Keep up the work with this amazing game! I must change my review from a 90/100 to 100/100!
9776	1	a	It's a no brainer. I felt like playing a new shooter, I bought this for a dollar, it was fun for a few hours. Even if I never play it again, it's a dollar well spent.  Seriously, just get it. If you looked at it and were mildly interested, just get it.
9778	1	a	Bought bow and arrow on noob mode. Shot down a pterodactyl cause he was in my face. resisted urge to yell 'YOU HAVE FAILED THIS PLANET'  would play Arrow with dinosaurs again.  10/10
9780	1	a	nothing to say but i like this game soo thumbs up
9782	1	a	Fun FPS sci fi game killing dinosaurs over and over with sweet gamemodes best game ever!
9784	1	a	Hilarious times. I had a tank and shot a Triceratops about 300 feet up into the air.   Gameplay: You choose 1 of 3 classes, each of which as its own unique ability. You then fight waves of dinosaurs by capturing objectives or by defending your base. In between waves you can upgrade your weapons/abilities. There are also hilariously hard to control vehicles. You will crash into a wall a lot.  Also no friendly fire, thank goodness.  No bugs that I can think of. Smooth gameplay on the unity 5 engine.
9786	1	a	So much fun, I foresee hundreds of great hours ahead of me
9788	1	a	Wow 3 years of work, you know I was going to toss ♥♥♥♥ about it but instead I am going to said GG Gid Gud  I honestly enjoyed the game, and sides it's not that expensive in contrast to every single popular shooter that is out right now, thank you giving me something to do in my free time, if there is one thing I apreciate more than anything in games is being able to blast stuff with grade launchers
9790	1	a	Like Killing Floor, but with dinosaurs and vehicles. You literally can't go wrong, especially for the price point.
9792	1	a	Simply an amazing and addicting game. I spent 60$ on GTAV a couple weeks ago, but when i saw this was free i gave it a chance and holy crap. I have been playing this more than most of the games i payed 20$+ for! It makes me think of a mix of Tribes: Ascend, Jurrasic Park, Killing Floor, and Halo. I love it.  First game i played as a level 1 i killed a trex with an automatic pistol to the face. 10/10
9794	1	a	Complete MADNESS. Instant ACTION. Fixin GENERATOR,for some REASON. No really,why im fixin it?
2933	0	a	PROS:  It's fun It's only a dollar  CONS:  It's laggy on my nvidia geforce gtx 980 It's repetitive It's unbalanced It's buggy  With the double damage upgrade and the longshot sniper you do so much damage it's ridiculous. Not only that but you can only suceed as an assault class for the jetpack. The clipping for anything but a flat surface is dreadul and you'll find yourself getting stuck often. When you fall into the void you don't die, you only continue to fall into the void which will force you to disconnect from the server.  It'll give you maybe 4 or 5 hours of gameplay before you get bored, more if you play with friends.
9796	1	a	I ♥♥♥♥ my pants by the loud intro volume  11/10
9798	1	a	its a dollar well spent
9800	1	a	Can't beat the price for a fun play with the dino's!
9802	1	a	Was free for weekend, saw it was 0.74$, bought it just for lols, and wow, this is so fun to play if you want some satisfaction out of killing dinos and getting 'ARMAGEDDON' voice queues. ♥♥♥♥in sweet.
2936	0	a	I purchased this game when it was released, I don't remember what it costed me then, and quite frankly I don't want to know. The fact that I paid money for this game haunts me every time I see it on the store page, at least the rocks have textures now. 
9804	1	a	Has evolve's monsters and halo's guns and AC:Unity's glitches MOST ORIGINAL GAME  10/10
9806	1	a	Its fun but it need optimization
9808	1	a	This is a very fun game at a insanely good price. Well worth checking out.
9810	1	a	A really good fun quick pace FPS. Though some of the controls are different than most FPSs they are still easy and fun to use.  The only disadvantage is that it stuggles with connecting and it can randomly lose you from the host it seems, other than that great game.
9812	1	a	WAY too much fun to pass up. The combinations that would describe this game are all fabulous apart, but even better when put together like this. Amazing. Just AMAZING. Entertainment for days at such a nice price.
9814	1	a	Today I ran over a pack of raptors with a jeep and rammed it into a t-rex before being tossed out of bounds and then proceeded to slowly crawl back to the map while shooting said t-rex with a revolver. 10/10 would ram again.
2937	0	a	This game is a very poor, POOR game. It runs like ♥♥♥♥ on my PC which was 600 euros a year ago which handles BF3 on high at 60 but nevertheless, I can't understand why this game makes my GPU cry in horror, the textures are beyond ♥♥♥♥. This game looks like an early PS2 game. It looks like GTA Vice City in terms of texture work, and to be honest Vice City is kind of beating Orion: Dino Horde or 'Orion:Prelude' to make people think its not the same ♥♥♥♥.  The game is utterly boring. Wave after wave after wafe after wave of uninspiring enemies that look like they came from a Jurrasic Park movie...that was made in 1950. Its only wave of murdering t-rex after t-rex. The guns are all about the same, I only used the Dual pistols to feel like Max Payne, which didn't really work. There is absolutely nothing good about this game, NOT EVEN THE NET CODE. Me and my friend were trying to play together, we are both in Dublin and I was getting a ping of about 200.  0/10 DO NOT BUY.
9816	1	a	Killing dinosaurs with a lightsaber using a jetpack = priceless. This game = 1€. Your profit= infinity - 1€ = infinity.  And on the plus side there is no voice chat so there are no crazy russian kids.
2938	0	a	The game is basically Halo and Jurrasic Park. It's a good game but it's really laggy.
9818	1	a	ok game. no 60fps. Yet maybe worth the money in this case. $.74 cents.
9820	1	a	I dislike playing it but would be more entertaining with friends. Not my type of game but worth it to just buy it and support the devs for all the criticism they have gotten and the successful project they have created.
9822	1	a	killed off chicken ancestors  11/10 would dino again
9824	1	a	You Can Shoot Dino Birds Out Of The Sky With Mini-Guns 10/10 Stars!!!
9826	1	a	So when I found this game I decided to buy it because it was 1 dollar and it looked terrible and when i played it i may have bought 4 other copies for my friends because ITS SOOOO AWESOME! there was one glitch that was the best glitch ever TWERKING STEGOSAURUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
9828	1	a	God dangit people!!!!! What are you waiting for??? It's 1 freaking buck. But it already!!! There's dinosaurs, multiplayer, good graphics, single player with bots. It's GREAT... Buy it! Buy it! Buy it! The game has seriously evolved over time and now is great time to buy, especially with the updated maps!
9830	1	a	I loved the demo for Jurassic: The Hunted but was sad when I couldn't find the game. Then I got this cause it was on sale for 81 cents! And let me say I am so happy I got it! A total blast, four player dinosaur killing craziness. Worth it even at full price!
9832	1	a	Its ok I guess 
9834	1	a	Very fun dino multiplayer shoot them up game.
2939	0	a	Game plays like a 90s multiplayer Turok + Left 4 Dead with jetpacks and medics. It's clunky, amateur, and very poor overall. There is an element of genius and fun in this game, but that potential is never reached due to the shoddy dev work. This game is one that should've been left in the bin. Some things are better not revisiting.  2.0/10 Terrible. Plays like a HS project, worse than most subpar mods.  Reviewer has played ORION: Prelude as his first outing in this series.
2940	0	a	Silly, not my choice
2941	0	a	This game is garbage, absolute and complete garbage. The matchmaking is crap, it cannot be played in full screen without crashing. Please do not waste your money on it. Here are 4 free game keys if you feel you want to try it, someone may get to it before you, but hey, possible free garbage game. The devs are not ♥♥♥♥♥, they gave me the free keys to give to my friends since the game is crap, but I do not hate my friends, so I am not going to give them crap. The devs say that they have fixed issues, they have not. They seem like decent, but completely incompetant people.  7MJ2P-EH42R-FZRW8 38Y8L-74QFY-A352D MFHAH-F0CN7-4N8XP 8BXK7-0VV7F-GQBX9
9836	1	a	Hey, for $1 its a few hours of fun. c'mon a buck.
2942	0	a	PLAYED IT GOT SOME CARDS NOW SELLING THEM BECUASE NO ONE PLAYS THIS GAME SO THEY ARE WORTH SOMETHING AND IT IS ♥♥♥♥ 
9838	1	a	This Game is Great I would sponsor this game on Youtube if i could.
9840	1	a	Its a quality game, and at this price point, its almost dumb to not buy it. The gameplay is pretty solid, bug free, and fun with some mates
9842	1	a	Fun gameplay! It's really for those who enjoy a quick game with some challenge.
9844	1	a	Great fun, didnt know what to expect and was pleasently surprised!
2945	0	a	If I diden't know any better I would say it's still in alpha. It looks like crap,sounds like crap,and runs like crap. Sry just calling it as I see it
9846	1	a	A T-rex threw my tank in mid-air.  10/10
9848	1	a	Fight waves of dinosaurs with your friends, what more do you want from a game this cheap?  Also, props to the developers who stuck with the game for years and made it better instead of giving up
9850	1	a	this game is incredibly fun. for only 1 dollar i get to 360 noscope dinosaurs. I CANNOT STOP PLAYING! BUY THIS GAME NOW!
9852	1	a	It's ok Definitely worth playing with a couple of friends, can get pretty fun.
9854	1	a	59p are you kidding me??? This game is worth £9.99! Killed a dino with the help of my younger cousin!   10/10 would murder extinct species again with a family member
9856	1	a	look its simple guys: 1) Mother ♥♥♥♥ing dinos 2) Guns and weapons 3) Cool arenas 4) Mother ♥♥♥♥ing dinos  What more do you want?
9858	1	a	Really fun with friends, lots of weapon choice and cool mix of upgrades in a shooter. Fun dino shooter. Definitely worth the money. 8/10
9860	1	a	Well I can use my lightsaber to fight the Dino horde 10/10!
9862	1	a	Cheap and fun.
9864	1	a	Worth playing for just a buck especially with friends
2948	0	a	most garbage outdated game
2949	0	a	1/10  this game may be cheap and it may have come a long way from where it started but still it has a long way to go. the game is unstable, buggy and the graphics quality on the highest settings is nowhere near what you see in the screenshots on the storepage. the character models and animations are just auful and the interface is strangly aranged.   now let's talk about the gameplay...   the consept of this game is good but they should have thought it out more. the game play get's very repetative very quickly.  the whole game is just:  spawn -&gt; activate generator -&gt; shoot dino's -&gt; shoot more dino's -&gt; buy new gun -&gt; shoot big dino -&gt; shoot more and more dino's until you die. then repeat on a (hardly)different map.  untill you get so borred that after a while you find the greatest feature in this entire game: The uninstall button.  so in concusion:  should this game be free?  yes  should this game be version 3.0?  definitly not, it is barely the level of a alpha prereleace.  if the developers update the game would you play it?  no, they have been at this for 3 years and it is still not better that a school project. it is unlikely that they will start to take this project seriously now.  is this review to harsh?  maybee, this is just how i experienced this game. maybee you will love it. but i don't, i took my time writing this so people think twice before buying this game. i know it is only 1$ but that single dollar could help little children in akrika get a proper education.. just think about that for a second before buying this so called 'game'.
2950	0	a	i got thet game free  :P 
9866	1	a	superb game if played online..
9868	1	a	cheap and fun.
9870	1	a	'Your connection to the host has been lost' 2.420 / 69
9872	1	a	This game so cool and funny LOL!!
2951	0	a	THIS IS THE WORST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED! DO NOT INTALL THIS UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES! IT IS A WASTE OF DATA! 
9874	1	a	this game is awsome if u like dinosaures and cool guns with friends to play with get this game
2952	0	a	An improvement atleast
9876	1	a	Shoot dinosaurs with guns. Stab dinosaurs with knives. Blow up dinosaurs with gernades.
9878	1	a	its $0.99 just buy it already
9880	1	a	It's worth your money.  720 no-scoped a dino with a bow and arrow, then used my lightsaber to kill fools. 10/10
9882	1	a	Watching this game continue to improve has been awesome, and they are right. Only developers can fail. These developers have not. If only more developers stuck to it the way these ones have, some wonderful concepts in otherwise terrible games would not go to waste. If I hadn't already bought the game for all my friends, I would now.
9884	1	a	i shot down a T-rex with a rocket launcher while jetpacking 8/8 would m8
9886	1	a	I bought this game through the steam store when it was on sale for .74 Cents !! i figured what the hey 74 cents. this is a pretty good co-op shooter ! no its amazing! good for team play and just all out Blast Fest super fun game ! Its Sort of a Unreal Tournament / Turok combonation everyone should try it !
9888	1	a	You know, I never played it when it was supposedly trash. But now that it's been updated, and the free week has been a thing, I gave it a shot.  Well, that shot became a good 81 cents Canadian spent.  It's not fantastic, but it's definitely not bad. It has a store, but it's cosmetic items. Armor color, hats, capes, that kind of stuff. And... It's $1. There's no reason NOT to get this.
9890	1	a	Really good game for killing dinos
9892	1	a	Co-op dino fighting! Radness.
9894	1	a	I wish i could play the game, But my laptop is crap so it runs at 10 fps rip :( Anyway one nof the greatest games ive demoed
9896	1	a	The ten minutes I played was completely worth the Dollar. Seriouslly, it's a dollar, It has dinos, you have tons of game modes.  Did I mention its a dollar Like 1 dollar I had fun
9898	1	a	Great game, probably the most enjoyable game I have played this decade.
9900	1	a	Just look at the price.
2954	0	a	This terrible game popped up in my library one day. I think a friend gifted it to me.  1. Play for trading cards 2. Sell trading cards 3. Uninstall 
9902	1	a	Very nice game. In my opinion this is worth way more than a dollar. Love it. Never heard of it before and then I saw the trailer that explained how this game came out in 2012 and how it sucked and they kept working on it for 3 years. I have no idea how it was before. But right now, if you have a dollar I think you should buy this game, even if you're not going to play it the guys who worked on it deserve something.
9904	1	a	Daaad there's a dinosawr in the backyaaawd.  *SLAM*  I'm tired of your sh*t Benji, you little b*stard.
2955	0	a	The game, though enjoyable, has its flaws. For one, it can't run AT ALL on any computer that isn't high-end. Therefore, I am unable to write a suitable review for it. If you have a high-end computer, good for you. If not (I'm assuming most of you don't...) don't waste your money. Orion: Prelude gets a 4/10.
9906	1	a	I'm killing about 100 pera however you spell it with a starting round gun. This game is tops.
9908	1	a	Best game ever made for a very cheap price!
9910	1	a	Great game 10/10 you can fight Dino's drive vehicles get weapons perks and play with your friends what's not to like.
9912	1	a	Very interesting, graphics are great. Lots of content. 8/10
9914	1	a	Never reviewed a game before this, all i have to say is this game takes me back to when games were fun for the sake of it instead of being over complicated. I paid £1.49 for a 4 pack and gave it to some friends. its truly superb just endless fun shooting dinosaurs. Plus i killed a T-rex in slow mo with a gatiling gun, enough said. 10/10
9916	1	a	THIS IS AWESUM!
9918	1	a	ORION: Prelude is a fun dionsaur survival FPS game. I bought this on sale for $0.74, but I would buy it for the full $0.99 if I had to. This game is perfect for those who enjoy shooting dinosaurs. My favorite feature of ORION: Prelude is... THE MOTHER FREAKIN LIGHTSABER! Yeah you can buy a lightsaber in survival mode. Did I mention there is multiple modes like conquest and duel? I did now...
9920	1	a	This game is great! I bought it for 74 cents and I've been playing this game a lot (when I should be playing GTA:V which I bought for $59.59). It's nice to see developers that tried really hard to fix a broken game, and honestly this game is great. It kind of reminds me of Halo, except compared to the new Halos this is better (and much cheaper). And I've only been doing solo mode. 10/10 not IGN
9922	1	a	Over 9000% I Recommend this game!  - More Dinosaurs - Jetpack so i can kill those dinosaurs with sniper - camper - hh
9924	1	a	I AM TUROK!!!
9926	1	a	10/10 BEST GAEM. It's like TF2, CS:GO, Halo, KF, and L4D had a GLORIOUS BABY.  For $1, you MUST buy this game! It is TOTALLY WORTH IT!
9928	1	a	Look, the game is cool and all and it would be worth a TON more than $1.00 ( $0.74 on sale ), but one thing..... YOU CAN PLAY IT!!!! I TRIED TO PLAY IT AND IT WAS SO LAGGY EVEN AFTER I PUT EVERYTHING TO LOWEST POSSIBLE EVEN THE SOUND, STILL IT WAS WAAAAYY TO LAGGY FOR ME TO EVEN MOVE MY MOUSE IN THE MENU!   Cool game, needs some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ computer suport ~ lewpro
2957	0	a	I remember playing this a long time ago and thinking it sucked. It has potential, but it sucked. Now for 74 cents, it still sucks. The game feels too 'cardboard'. Guns lack oomph or any muzzle flash. Id prefer it if the dinos didnt actually walk, just glide around at least that would make it funny.
9930	1	a	This is the best game that im played in years. Also very addicting. If you dont have this game get it right now.
9932	1	a	EPIC!  I have numerous top titles and I do my best to try to make time to have a blast playing this game.   For $1!?!? C'mon!!???  9/11
9934	1	a	This game is super cool :D
9936	1	a	This game was the most fun I've had gaming with my friends in a long time! Hours of ridiculous dino hunting will be had in the future.
2960	0	a	I bought it because it was onsale and they said they transformed the game into something amazing, they were wrong.  -half the time the gun animation doesn't even play  -the dinos still spin around and dont have very good ai  -the character holds the pistol like a assault rifle.
9938	1	a	this game is good just needs to lag a little less
9940	1	a	ThI$ Gaem Is sO GoOd 11/10
9942	1	a	Quite a nice game, still some bugs, but all in all a good start for a dine FPS shooter :D
2961	0	a	the game lags like hell and i cant even play it the game iss to laggie and no one cant play it cuzz one small dino kills you
9944	1	a	This game is really entertaining and simple to play You kill dinosaurs and hoard weapons and vehicles As for the story... there is no story. Great for playing with a couple of friends just for fun. Play by yourself if you have no friends, but game is still fun. I mean c'mon it's less than $1! Blew my expectations when I tried
9946	1	a	skeptical of such a cheap game, I went in expecting to find a dissappointment....  I was wrong.  With reminders of Early Unreal tournament and an enjoyable pacing Orion: Prelude is well worth the money. Spend the dollar, it's worth it.
9948	1	a	HELL OF A TIME I JUST HAD 
9950	1	a	THIS. GAME. IS. AMAZING. Its only what 99 cents? BUY THIS NOW!!!!!1!!!1!
9952	1	a	fun to play because DINOSAURS
9954	1	a	Post Edit: The below review was for when the game was fairly new, the developers have taken responsibility for their games shortcomings, for one dollar a pop you could easily set you and your friends up with copies of the game and have a killingfloor-esque bundle of funs. Everything in the pre-edit still applies however --------------------------- Pre Edit This game has a fair way to go. It doesn't perform well on my computer (fairly high end), and it is very difficult to find a match. I got it for 1 dollar and it for me that was worth it, but i'm not sure it's worth the $15 price tag. The game does have positive and negative points to it.  Pro: The support service is excellent, they were polite, helpful, and got my problem resolved quickly  Pro: When you get into a game with lots of dudes, you have some dino killing mayhem to look forward to.  Con: They have a coin system for cosmetics  Con: I couldn't get it to work when I first started and had to contact Spiral's customer support  I may edit it if I play it more, but this was my initial experience. I have high hopes for this game, but at the state it currently is in, I'd hold onto your $15 and wait for a sale to get it.
9956	1	a	Jurassic Park: The Game...  But it's actually good. Seriously, buy this. It is a steal for the price.
9958	1	a	Once upon a time on May 4th 2015, the internet was slow. I knew it couldn't be the provide because I don't have comcast. What do you know, it was steam. I scroll down the big list of games, some great and some well, not so great. I stumble upon this game, Orion: Prelude. Oh yeah I said to myself, wasn't this a dollar, but with all steam games you never play them. This update must be good I say to myself, at 1.4GB it better be. Once done updating I open the for the fisrt time in months. Saw that it was the same gui, but I gave it a chance. Why not, I mean it's not like I have any homework that I left at school. I finally join a game... SAME GAME DIFFERENT MAPS, well not that I knew of, neverd played all the maps, aight 1.4GB update doesnt feel like it. Same weird chat system, confusing upgrade system. Thus I close my eyes and begin to shoot. Killed everything in my path. Won the game. Alt+F4 DONE  In all honesty I thought the update was going to be a graphical upgrade, but I'm sure it added a ♥♥♥♥ tone more stuff. Get the game for a buck, about 3-5 hours of fun with your freinds.  10/10 Probally going to get addicted
9960	1	a	It's a ridulously fun and mildly nice game. To say that it has 'huge, endless environments' is somewhat pointless, because it isn't fun to explore them, for there is only scenery outside of the area where dinosaurs spawn. Though they will follow you.  I would definitely recommend this game. The optimisation is fairly decent, considering that it looks fairly pretty on high settings, but there are always a few bugs here and there. The gameplay is balanced to an extent, but in a more interesting way than a generic fps, instead going for a more classical unrefined approach which makes it much more fun and progressive (in my opinion).  And best of all, the developers are still working on it, so it can only get better from here.  Did I mention that it's only $1?
9962	1	a	Come on Its only    $0.74
9964	1	a	Dino Beatdown x 2
9966	1	a	Honestly, I bought this game as a joke for me and all my friends, but then later I actually started playing it and now love playing it. Its an awesome and fun game for playing co-op and just whenever. Best 1$ spent on Steam.
9968	1	a	From buggy and laggy game turned into my opinion BEST dino game today
9970	1	a	This game is incredibly fun and will fill you with awe and joy. With this said, it can also drive you crazy, the rouge-like nature of the game, causes you to loose your mind over and over. You keep dying to small things such as bees, you set fire to yourself or you couldn't pick enough flowers. Overall it's pretty fun.
9972	1	a	Played this game for an hour and it is already one of my favorites in my library.
9974	1	a	When i first bought this game it had plenty of bugs, some of them game breaking, but it was unique. These developers have done exaxtly what they should have done by continuing to work on the game to make it a very enjoyable game. This is truly a great game and for a dollar you should definatly buy 12
9976	1	a	If this game was priced at $30+ I would say avoid it like the plague.  If this game was priced at $20 I would say don't bother waiting for a sale.  If this game was priced at $10 I would say just buy anything else.  If this game was priced at $5 I would say you could buy lunch instead.  If this game was priced at $1 I would say you have no reason not to own this.
9978	1	a	You cant beat the price. Fun for atleast a few hours, a sh it load more fun if some friends have it too. 8/10 would shoot dino again
2964	0	a	I personly liked the gameplay from the beginning. My only problem with this is game and the reason why i am still not going to play it is, that it has only support for some common screen resolutions but my 1280x1024 is still not supported. And nothing is more infuriating that playing with the wrong resolution. Don't get me wrong. I like it that you have improved and fixed a lot of stuff. But the only thing i am asking for is to get the resolution problem fixed.
9980	1	a	Purchased this when it was still entitled ORION: Dino Horde for 99 cents.  Hands down, it is the best dollar game I have ever bought.  9/10  Did I mention you can kill dinosaurs with a Mech?
9982	1	a	I bought this game because of the fact that theres no possible way i can buy a game for 99 cents and not atleast get my money back in fun and i was right to me this game is one of the funnest games just for survival alone and i recomended for anyone! plus it has freaking dinosaurs....
9984	1	a	This is the first time I have ever changed a review from negative to positive. They did a lot updates to this game, it is still not the greatest but it quite a bit of fun, I highly recommend this game.
2965	0	a	Its not the worst and if your friends just need a break from something else go for it. However, even with the tiny price, there are far better games like it. I wouldn't recomend getting this soley because I haven't touched it since the last summer sale. I just don't like it. I would wait for the summer sale to spend your 2 bucks on, this isn't just worth it in my own opinion.
9986	1	a	This game is impeccable fun, and its only $0.50!
9988	1	a	Played this game for an hour.......1$ well spent! its like HALO,Star wars, borderlands, battlefield and unreal tournament and Jurassic park all mashed up with insane graphics nd some awesome gameplay....unless u lack a dollar there is no reason u should not buy this epic game.....where else can u kill dinosaurs with a lightsaber!!!!!!!?????????
9990	1	a	got trampled various times by triceratops. 10/10 would do again.
9992	1	a	hours of stupidity with the buds
9994	1	a	Most epic 99 cent game! :D  Dinosaurs are awesome!
2970	0	a	After playing for half an hour I guess I know y this game is so cheap. Because it's cheap. Nothing attractive, u can get the best weapon in coop after the first wave.  No challenges and strange task settings. And btw, totally a terrible firing sense. DONT BUY THIS GAME.
9996	1	a	This got my ♥♥♥♥ hard in 2.6 seconds
9998	1	a	This is actually a really goodgame! I have fun playing this. I am impressed with the many variations on game modes and the smooth and fun game-play. There is a massive pile of achievements to strive for also.  I may update this review later after I have played more of various modes, know more about the ins and outs of the game.  I will say that a good set of surround headphones are useful to assist in finding the loot chests.
2971	0	a	im not really into this game it lags like hell so i cant move/turn around witthout doin somat stupid and there is nothing there to kill when i join a multiplayer game so yeah... its crap for me (i wanna get a refund but i dont know how)
2972	0	a	flippin bad the same as the last one
2973	0	a	This is the most terrible game ever. Within 3 minutes of opening, I quit.
2974	0	a	It's still crap. It's a meh horde mode game, it isn't worth the $3.00 I spent on it. Thank you Valve for allowing refunds
2975	0	a	'GAME'S DON'T FAIL DEVELOPER'S DO' -project Orion: Prelude  Seriously? Games do fail because the developers fail, and now you just sound like pretentious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Just wanted to clear that up before I start my review. If this game was so good all of a sudden, believe me, you wouldn't be charging a 1$ for it, I got it for 75 cents because it was on sale. Anyway this game is exactly what I'd expect a 1$ game to be :  BUGGY HALF BAKED TEDIOUS (and not in a fun way like Doom 3, Resident Evil 4, or Dead Space)  The controls are godawful even with a controller, the graphics? HAH! IDK who worked on the trailers but they look better than the actual game. There isn't a good variety of dinosaurs to fight and the ones they have are the bland vanilla standard types (velociraptors, T-Rex, triceratops, and the flying ones). Gameplay is pretty bland and is very broken once you get the right abilities.  AND DON'T GET ME STARTED ON ♥♥♥♥ING MICROTRANSACTIONS!  Because yes, SPOILER ALERT: there are microtransactions to change your character's look, despite the fact I got charged up front. And yes I am aware I got it for under a dollar but still, after I pay you, there shouldn't be any ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ microtransactions because I've already paid you.   Now for the million dollar question:  IS IT FUN?  Yes, for about ten minutes, because after that you've seen everything the game has to offer. The different classes are useless because their abilities really don't add anything.   I wasn't expecting much from a 1 dollar game, but after they make bold statements about how their game had this rag to riches story, I was expecting something decent and worth my time. Instead I get something that isn't worth more than 20 minutes at most.  
2976	0	a	Sucks.  generic fps with dinosaurs guns sound like airsoft sounds are gross vehicles are clunky or overpowered stores are meh its not satisfying  2/10
2977	0	a	I would not reccomend people to play this game as I think it leaks replayability.  To me it is just shooting AI dinosaurs till they die and get some points to buy some weapons. It looked more appealing that it actually was. Very repetitive and little variations on how to play the game.
2978	0	a	Dont buy this game. For $0.99 it's a rip-off.
2979	0	a	i dont care how many updates they had. this game isn't even worth 99 cents in my opinion
2980	0	a	NOT A JOKE REVIEW  One of the worst games I have ever played. The graphics are absolutly trash. THe dino AI is simulatenously OP and dumb. The weapons are all the same and the minimap might as well not be there.
2981	0	a	♥♥♥♥♥♥ but hitty
2982	0	a	IT SUCKS ♥♥♥♥!
2983	0	a	Don't. Buy. This. Game. Think of it as badrats 2.
2984	0	a	It is a very laggy game (needs Improment (Fast) ) 
2985	0	a	Eh... it's a dollar. Grab it, have a bit of fun with it.  Honestly though, I just didn't find it fun. It's still really unpolished and clunky.  The menus are just horrible. Both in looks and in feel. The customization menu is terrible. Like... it all works, it's just not an enjoyable experience.  It's hard to complain about it considering the price, but it's just annoying to look at.  
2986	0	a	Not too good, the game is utterly broken and the animations are cringe worthy. I would buy this for laughs but be wary, you will want your .99 back instantly as you join a game
2987	0	a	always crashes as soon as i open
2988	0	a	its ok but dont think of all those other reviews u see will trick u get it on sale its a ok game but tbh i dint like it i was expecting like zombies but dinosors but it just dosnt work right with me
2989	0	a	Probably one of the worst games I've ever played.
2990	0	a	Tried changing the resolution from 1280x960 or whatever crap it was on to my 5:4 1280x1024. NOPE. The setting doesn't exist. They have 16:9, 16:10, and 4:3. But not 5:4. When I applied my graphics settings, the game went black and my screen was constantly blinking. alt+tab didn't do anything and ctrl+alt+del would bring up Task Manager, but still wouldn't let me use it because my screen was blinking. Alt+F4 did nothing to it as well. Had to restart my computer.  TL;DR  -Stupid resolution settings -Game crashed my computer before I even started playing
2991	0	a	Ark: survival with lasers and without good.
2992	0	a	i want to refund this game.
2993	0	a	Now i know this game improved a lot but it still glitches and crashs,the home menu cursor is not sensitive enough and just dont play because it costs 75p try Halo instead
2994	0	a	boring useless and stupid game , i regret that i bought this crap!!!
2995	0	a	got boring real quick
2996	0	a	So much nope. Don't buy it. This game is a buggy, laggy, unpolished... heck, even uncompleted, mess.
2997	0	a	Probably the worst game I've ever played. But you can stab dinosaurs in the neck with a knife. 10/10 GOTY
2998	0	a	This game sucks my other left nut
2999	0	a	The graphics are mediocre, the gameplay is boring, and the mechanics are clunky. I bought this last year when they at least pretended it was worth something (base price of $9.99). The game now only costs $.99. This is not a quality game. Don't waste a penny on this
3000	0	a	Tried out one server, then hated it. Hard to get momentum in this game. Slow. Sloppy. -infinity/10
3001	0	a	At least the uninstall button is working 11/10
3002	0	a	Don't even bother trying it. It lags and you have no idea what's going on. Just a really bad game.
3003	0	a	'I got the game and it still had really bad Graphics and lag OMG.'
3004	0	a	probably the worst game i've ever played in my life
3005	0	a	not a game for me
3006	0	a	4/10
3007	0	a	Oh my god. Worst game experience ever.  1. The hardware requirements are ridiculously high. I can play many games on high settings. Here I have input lag in the menu and low FPS even on 720p .... 2. 'Connection to Host lost'. Joining a game (with decent internet connection) is like russian roulette. 3. Map design is confusing. Makes me miss battlefield or basically any other shooter. 4. Shotgun: 25-100 Damage. Fists: 4700 Damage. Why the hell should I buy weapons?
3008	0	a	Right,,,  So I got this game during the free weekend, and played it for a little bit, and was lucky enough to get a free key of it by the end of that weekend, I would load it up when I was bored, and would just play for a little bit. And now, after 6 hours of this game, I can safely say that it was terrible.  The game is a mess, even after all the updates. For starters, graphics customization does almost nothing to fix the frame rate, which went from pretty good to PowerPoint levels of slow by the end of a game. The AI is just awful, the Pterodactyls in particular being a major pain in the *** (imagine trying to hit something flying through the air with a PowerPoint frame rate). The game is just littered with technical issues, many of which render it unplayable. I can't think of a single time I quit that wasn't due to some technical issue.  However, I still liked parts of it. Its a good concept, just terrible delivery. The developers know this, and dropped the price down to just a dollar. Even then, it goes on sale all the time. So, to wrap up this crappy review for a crappy game, buy it if you want to, but don't expect much
3009	0	a	Was only able to connect to one server,  
3010	0	a	its a glitchy game
3011	0	a	Do not believe the lies, sucks a dead goats ♥♥♥♥, and the goat died of aids!
3012	0	a	This is a horrible game in every way and should never be touched by anyone. There is a reason it keeps going on sale for over 90% off and it isn't because it's a life changing experience everyone should go through, unless they're you're worst enemies.
3013	0	a	It is laggy and had a bad graphix on my pc but it has great dino-combat series , it doesn't have much weapons so kinda sad
3014	0	a	This is not ARK
3015	0	a	It's a broken game worst game ever it sucks
3016	0	a	They update the game allright...with micro transactions...
3017	0	a	It's just plain boring/not well designed. Fun for about an hour, but no real challenge or reason to come back.
3018	0	a	This game I thought had a lot of promise when i got it as a gift but when i played it it was horrible. it always lags lots of errors and i can never get into a server.Should you buy it?NO Only if the developers fix this will it be a good game in my eyes.
3019	0	a	game is my ♥♥♥
3020	0	a	It's boring, too repetitive, dinos come in waves and that's pretty much it, because I don't even know what's the point of the game or what do I have to do because there's no tutorial or introduction. Thank god I only paid 0.59€ and can get back some of it from the cards. Not to mention it crashes if I try to play it on fullscreen for some reason.
3021	0	a	I can't play this game. Screen will turn black then crash to desktop upon opening the game.
3022	0	a	I can't see many problems with this, but it's simply just... Not fun. I tried to get into it but it got very boring very soon. It was also extremely confusing at first and took a lot of questions in chat to understand what I was doing. Thankfully it didn't cost too much. :)
3023	0	a	this game is still in need of work. i got the game for a dollar so its not a bad deal. just could be better than what it is now and what the game want's to be.
3024	0	a	Multiplayer game where one team fights as humans and the other team as dinosaurs. The human party has various weapons options and the different dinosaurs has abilities, whether is is flying, jumping, strong attacks or great defensive armor.  The game itself is actually well thought through and the game offers a lot of possibility, but the game is poorly optimized, the server lobby has flaws in connecting to games and several things ingame leaves you frustrated.  It's a game in progress, but they have to do much more work to compete with other games. Still, the game is very cheap and if you don't need insane graphics and flawless optimization, then it's a game for you.  Pros  * Originality * Team based fun * Diversity in characters (Dinosaurs - big, small, flying, crawling) (Human - Recon, Assault, Medic)  Cons  * Game needs optimizing * Glitches * Bad dinosaur models (bad handling leaves you with some of them not able to attack) * Bad landscaping (Getting stuck ingame) 
3025	0	a	This... Is one of the worst games I've ever played I would rather slowly die then play this horrible horrible 'game' again for your own sake please don't ever purchase this thing it feels like it should be illegal to make something this horrible
3026	0	a	This game is really bad. And not like Goat Simulator fun, funny bad. Just bad.
3027	0	a	I bought this game because of my love of dinosaurs, and it was only a buck, so I thought, 'Why not?'. I watched all the videos provided above, and they seemed really cool! Until I started the game. Unfortunately, I am not able to join any servers, no matter how hard I try. The closest I have gotten to real gameplay is being on the server list when the game is about to start, and then it just says I have lost connection to the host. I wish I could play this game for hours and hours and recommend it, but with these issues I just can't.
3028	0	a	Almost as high-quality as E.T for the Atari 2600.  do you like devs who boost reviews on their own games? this is a great start
3029	0	a	Why does this game even exist?
3030	0	a	Totally not recommended. Awful graphics and without any tutorial at all. So I just spawned somewhere, without knowing what to do or where to do so.
3031	0	a	Terrible game bad animations to much walking to slow for what it is trying to be...
3032	0	a	It's freexing to death. I don't know why it's popular.
3033	0	a	It is not playable! It has too many lags! I have tried out all the bugfixes but it does not work. So I removed this laggy game from my library. It could be funny, but it was frustrated...
3034	0	a	This game, just given away by our great fella Steam, has proven me that a game can be WORSE with a bit of effort. After 2 normal intro, such as the Unreal Engine and Spiral animations are, we're sent to a small menu with a great music *sarcasm* that will make you think about the Pirates of the Caribbean OST, but it has nothing to do with it *sarcasm again* What if we talk about the gameplay? Multiplayer shooter, with DINOSAURS! It might have been worth the 2,7 GBs of download. Let's look for any server to play... oh wait, right, with over 2600 players on, this marvellous game has only 26 SERVERS, which of those 3 are private, 15 are DLC servers, and 8 are either full or empty, so you can't play with anyone you might not know. Well, single-player might still be good right? NO campaign, NO one-person survival, and of course, the game will load up with NO complete game at all, since it'll keep looking for players. A disappointing experience, and a game I wouldn't recommend at all.
3035	0	a	i cant join or see any lobbies, i can only play solo, can soemone fix this bug please thanks
3036	0	a	keeps loosing connection to games even when i creat my own lol what a pice of garbage.i also have 50 mbps so not my internet problume.
3037	0	a	This Game is all about killing dinos why i give this game a dislike? well.. 1.this game doesnt make any sense for me ( really man shooting dinosaurs with guns?? this aint jurassic park) WTF is the point of this game? 2. Boring Boringgg sooo Boringggg 3.lots of bugs ( what will you do if you see invicible dino attacking your teammate ?)well 'Delete button' Work perfectly 4.nothing special,no cool feature(that's mean this game sucks alot!)  Well if you guys love dino survival  find a better one for example  http://store.steampowered.com/app/346110/  this one ATLEAST better in my oppinion  feel diffrent? tell me your oppinion i love to read other's  work the same way with my other reviews 
3038	0	a	I would advise people not to buy this game, even for 99p or 99 cents. When I bought this game is was called Dino Beatdown, it was glitchy on my pc and my friends pc's. The ingame menu and junk was total crap. Now it has a new title in hopes of getting more money from unsuspecting people on steam. That is wrong. Even now this game is glitchy still looks like a piece of sh*t
3039	0	a	totally unplayable it looks okay but even after knocking every setting to it's lowest point I could barely walk without lag let alone shoot or interact with anything I payed 54 cents for this and that was 54 cents too much really just stick to other Dinosaur games unless you have a perfect computer then it might work for you...maybe
3040	0	a	The trailer for the is game says that it has gotten alot better over time. I have to say 0.50 for this game seems a bit much.... if that tells you anything.
3041	0	a	This game is like the new Jurassic World..... ♥♥♥♥!!!
3042	0	a	this game will constantly lag through out the game 
3043	0	a	No... Just No
3044	0	a	Not worth 1 cent. Don't even bother.
3045	0	a	the worst game i've played
3046	0	a	This game has so much potential o be a fun time-waster. It's inexpensive, it has a fun premise, and it's got a motha-♥♥♥♥in' T-Rex in it.   But it's just awful gameplay wise. The frame skip and lag levels are UNBELIEVABLE and it is utterly unplayable. I tried re-installing it twice and setting the graphics to the absolute minimum to make sure that I could run it smoothly, but it was still impossible to play effectively.   Once (if ever) these issues with lag and frame skipping get fixed, this game will be so much fun. I only hope it does happen, because I'm ready to start gunning down dinosaurs.
3047	0	a	Mutliplayer is garbage, riddled with bugs, no lan support, and dedicated servers are near impossible to set up for private lobbies
3048	0	a	you frekin crashed my computer with your frekien bugs
3049	0	a	Good game. Highly recommended to play it with friends. The reason I didn't give a recommend to this game is because it's poorly optimized. If you can get past it, it's a really damn enjoyable Co-op game!
3050	0	a	this game is lagging alot
3051	0	a	pros:good graphics,no dlc, its fun. cons:glitchy, laggy, broken, unfinished.
3052	0	a	Saw all the good reviews and saw the trailer and expected something amazing. I was greatly dissapointed. Right at the start I noticed terrible optimization and the graphics aren't even that good so it shouldn't take a good PC to run. Very confusing controls and very hard to learn. Lots of bugs I noticed when I used a jetpack and there was a big dinosaur he got me and I was stuck in him. I would not recommend buying this game not even for the $0.99 that it is. Buy a different game either wait for a steam sale to get a cheap game or get a DLC for a game you already have, it just isn't worth it.
3053	0	a	IGRA SUKA
3054	0	a	This game sucks. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! 0/10
3055	0	a	Bought it because my friends and I loved how bad it was when it was free, so I bought the four pack because it's hilariously bad while being semi-fun. Well, it would seem that on not only my computer but my two friends the game will not start. I can click play, I see the small Steam window saying it's starting, and then nothing happens.
3056	0	a	I rate this game 2/5 Nearly Ok but it's actuallly bad.  Sure this game is cheap. Sure this game is fairly free. Yes the online community is friendly. The graphics are okay. But this game is also extremely repetitive and it lacks any great music or sound effects or anything to really keep me interested. You Hunt dinosaurs on alien planets with futuristic weaponry. The dinosaurs die (mostly) and wave after wave of them come at you. There are some other game modes but in my opinion they all lack challenge and are variations on an underlying theme of repetitive gameplay leading to boredom. This might be a lot more fun if you know someone else who is really into this game and wants to play it with you but I know no such person.
3057	0	a	Incredible resource hog. spend your .49 cents else where
3058	0	a	This game literally sucks. Objectives are stupid the graphics are awful and again and again the same dinosaurs
3059	0	a	I changed the resolution of it and the game is flashing down into my desktop and i can't change it back someone help
3060	0	a	I really don't know... I feel like it was better as Dino Horde than this. I'm sorry, but this change made me stop playing the game entirely.
3061	0	a	Amidst the plethora of multiplayer dinosaur games released around the same time as this one, came ORION: Prelude, previously going by a different name I can't remember.   Frankly, I found this game to be a waste of what short time I spent on it and the $1 that I spent on it as well. It is un-original, has some of the quirkiest physics and game mechanics I have ever seen, and in general just really fails to deliver an enjoyable experience outside of the initial learning phase. There isn't anything unique or fun about this game and it really ended up being $1 I would rather have bought candy at a gas station with.  The game got boring quick, with nothing different than any of the other dinosaur games really, and seems to have a fanbase with similar personalities to the people who drool over Nazi Zombies in the latest Treyarch Call of Duty release. The developers seem to be having fun with it, which is good, but I honestly don't see a reason to promote them for this game in the slightest. They delivered a fairly buggy, un-original title amongst a sea of the same genre.  I would not recommend this game, even given its extremely low price point.
3062	0	a	Kind of like old school Tribes, without skiing, and more clunky feeling.
3063	0	a	Gets very tedious very quickly. Even with friends the game isn't nearly as fun as games such as a Left 4 Dead or any other Multiplayer Shooter Siege-Survival. If you need a budget game there are many others but this one has ill-defined objectives, very basic gun selections, and a broken health system (where you can be fully healthy for a few rounds then instantly die to a small mob of dinosaurs which are impossible to hit).
3064	0	a	Game no workie. Tried the only 'fix' posted on the Steam forums; got as far as splash screen. Worst part is it makes my computer practically unusable until I manage to forcible end the various processes associated with the game. I want my time and $.50 back.
3065	0	a	lets just say that i play 1 min and then i just used idle master on this...
3066	0	a	Uhh... No.
3067	0	a	This game is pretty cool
3068	0	a	Gets boring very fast.
3069	0	a	Still one of the bugiest game I've ever played. One sound for all weapons and general chaos.
3070	0	a	Bought this game to play with a friend and when I entered the match, it just keeped rotating non-stop, I restarted the game, restarted steam and the pc, and it was still rotating when I entered any match...
3071	0	a	I should be able to run this, but I'm very,very laggy, lowest settings
3072	0	a	This game is trash 
3073	0	a	This game used to be my favorite but now with all it's updates and stuff it just went down. Yet now it appears to have more lag and Framerate issues. The gameplay is fun but hard to enjoy. So I would not recommend it at the moment
3074	0	a	Really lame, and there's no 'singleplayer'
3075	0	a	lAgs to much
3076	0	a	The trailer happily points out this used to be a horrible game; it also claims it no longer is. Only the first claim is correct. This game is so broken i couldnt be bothered to figure out its moronic game play or control scheme. I bought this game only because it was fifty cents and figured even if it sucks i couldnt lose; how wrong I was.
3077	0	a	If your friends own this game somehow, mayb- Nevermind, don't buy this game. Even though it's cheap, don't spend your precious time with this. Unfortunately unsuccessful.
3078	0	a	It's bad. This game is honestly one of the worst games i've ever played, i only payed $1.50 for it and i'm regretting my decision. Just please don't buy this game.
3079	0	a	Wtf how can I write this review while I don't even own this game. Silly steam.
3080	0	a	The FPS is horrible, and i thought after having this game for a few years and attempting to come back they would have atleast fixed the fps. no its not my computer, i have a gaming computer, its the servers zzz
3081	0	a	This game is ♥♥♥♥ing terrible.
3082	0	a	Bought this game for laughs tried to get a refund and have not got a refund yet. (P.S THIS GAME IS TERRIBLE)
3083	0	a	I'm doing this review because I want a badge.                                   Lol.
3084	0	a	Needs more players
3085	0	a	I'm happy I only bought this game for 55 cents. It wasnt worth it. Not only can you make dinosaurs fly, but you can also be sent flying by them. Unoptomized too, It sucks to play, I probably damaged my eyes.
3086	0	a	Seriously bad, and not 'oh its so bad its good. Its just bad,
3087	0	a	Why i bought this ?
3088	0	a	eeeeeeehhh im playing on a windows 7 but it still has So much framerate drop and lagg i dont reccomend this game i might come back t it soon and try it again though but i reccomend you get the following required before you buy the game
3089	0	a	It's ♥♥♥♥ed up.
3090	0	a	If I could get my dollar back, I'd do it!
3091	0	a	Hideous game easily breakable wildly unbalanced but hey its cheap. Might get a day of fun out of it if youre playing with friends
3092	0	a	Terrible game, do not purshase. BUGs, bad gameplay and historyless.
3093	0	a	Servers are crap, it's always laggy, no tutorial ( so I was pretty much lost), and worst of all i bought so I could play it later, it passes by the return date, i play, and it's bad. These are just my thoughts, if you had a blast with the game, good for you, but these are my thoughts, so I could care less
3094	0	a	I don't recommend this game at all. Should pay the money for the game. You will not like it because the graphics are so bad.
3095	0	a	'In 2012 we released one of the worst games of all time'                         Still sucks 
3096	0	a	this game is not fun
3097	0	a	(Pukes)   I hate this game. It is so laggy even tho it looks crappy. Ive been playing on lowest settings and I got like 2 frames more. And the gameplay doesnt even make any sense. You are a Halo guy that needs to survive hordes of dinosaurs. Wtf im outta here
3098	0	a	I try to join a friend, it crashes. I try to get in a tank, it crashes. I shoot at the T-REX, it crashes. I am the last person alive on my team, we are an hour into the game, I am against every big boss Dinos and my whole team depending on me. My Game PLANE CRASHES INTO THE DAMN PENTAGON, AND EXPLODES, THEN STARTS THE WAR IN THE MIDDLE EAST. (hope I did not offend any body. If I did I am sorry)
3099	0	a	I will never forget the injustices done here.
3100	0	a	1 Dollar was wasted. I can't even launch the game.
3101	0	a	Don't bother. I am not even going to waste mopre than these to sentances for the review.
3102	0	a	It is not a good sign when the game has the graphics of a mid 2000s arcade game and has 15 fps. A game with graphics this average does not need to take up that much of my computer's power. I can run open world games that have better graphics at higher frame rates. i havent even started on the gameplay, which is ok at best, you basically just run around and shoot the little dinosaurs. I chose the assault class and the only weapon i could use was a pistol. Although I am sure this is due to my mental retardation, it still shouldnt spawn the assault class in with just a pistol, especially if you arent gonna use traditional ways of switching weapons (mousewheel, numbers etc.) and that is assuming it even has a rifle.  5/10 Wouldnt waste 5 mins on this ever again
3103	0	a	10/10 my ♥♥♥♥ got chopped of by an toster
3104	0	a	10% luck 20% skill  15% concentrated power of will 5% rage 50% pain 0% reason to purchase this game 
3105	0	a	This so stupid but if you have friends you won't stop playing it.
3106	0	a	Ruined my life.
3107	0	a	Very fast gameplay  Lag even on lowest settings  What more can I say?  Otherwise, a very fun cooperative survival experience, offering unique dinosaur combat, and a great upgrade/weapon system.
3108	0	a	not worth 99 cent
3109	0	a	This game is the reason I cut myself in the morning.   Unquantivable on a number scale of how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ of a game this is out of 10
3110	0	a	For starters, this game crashes more than a ♥♥♥♥ing drunk driver in a bugatti and it runs at 3fps or less even when i have a decent gaming PC.
3111	0	a	♥♥♥♥
3112	0	a	Terrible Game, Don't buy it.. get Primal carnage instead ;)
3113	0	a	It's barely playable but you can make most of your money back by selling the cards.
3114	0	a	laggy servers, no people play this game.
3115	0	a	One the one hand, its a dollar. on the other hand, its a dollar's worth. if you can find some buddies to play with you, sure, but otherwise this game is pretty well dead.
3116	0	a	okay well mabey i have a crap computer but this thing LAGS like crazy even in single player but heres the thing i own primal carnage and it doesnt lag my system. and i dont see dinosaurs having extremly cpu intensive AI here either
3117	0	a	My friends and I were arguing on Steam Voice Chat one day. We were trying to figure out the next multiplayer game we should all invest in. After agonizing deliberation that lasted several days over who was gonna scrounge up the hefty $2.99 sum for the 4-pack, we finally got the game. After all, how could we resist? It had dinosaurs and it was $2.99. How bad could it possibly be?  Prehistorically Bad.
3118	0	a	To laggy cant play idk if it the game but i know lots who are haveing the same problem it ruins the experience and it look like aploute ♥♥♥♥ worth £0.39 at max
3119	0	a	 2/10
3120	0	a	Lag Central. My system is above the recommended requirements, and with every video setting at low or disabled, it still lags when the dinosaurs attack.
3121	0	a	it seems really good but it runs incredibly poorly and the servers are laggy. even with all graphics setting turned to low i had an terrible framerate. The maps look really good and i had fun exploring them its just too bad i cant play a game in them. i suppose if you had an extra beefy computer and an awesome internet connection this game would be superb
3122	0	a	My Pc runs Skyrim on ultra, but for this I had to change settings on low  -Offline mode doesn't have bot -Online servers are often too laggy, my Stegosaur stomps human and they survive
3123	0	a	Super laggy with a decent computer. Graphics are god-awful. Even though it costed me 50 cents, it wasn't worth it. Don't waste your time with this.  0/100
3124	0	a	It was a good game... but the people there are asshats and its near impossible to find a game, on top of that there just insnt enough content to last long.
3125	0	a	Bad graphics, and boring gameplay. Not my type of game.
3126	0	a	Its not bad for what it is, and honestly if deathmatches (and a couple variations) on a few small maps with dinosaurs that die with one shot, limited feelings of progression, and a microtransaction store sound like fun...fill your boots. Hardly anything that even hints at the depth and scope of SC.
3127	0	a	Note: this is before recent changes that have drastically improved the game, still not great but better.  I do not recommend this game. It is literally the worst purchase I have ever made. The mouse sensitivity goes only from Super Extreme to Mega Extreme, the plays worse that Carnivores from the 90’s, there is literally no one else online and it looks nothing like the previews or screenshots that I'm sure you’re looking at. You will get more enjoyment out of your money if you went to the bank and had it all turned into change, then subsequently ate all the change and waited anxiously for the aftermath.
3128	0	a	PLAY THIS GAME IT TOLD ME TO TELL YOU     
3129	0	a	Such a boring, bad made, ugly game.
3130	0	a	Even though it shows promises for an average game. the constant graphic problems that causes is really worrisome.
3131	0	a	♥♥♥♥ING SICK.... ME AND MY BOYS SMOKE FAT BLUNTS AND PLAY THIS GAME. THIS GAME IS A FEAT IN THE GAMING WORLD WITH ITS LIT GRAPHICS AND NON ♥♥♥♥ GAME PLAY WOULD NEVER PLAY 10/10
3132	0	a	Good for an evening of playing with friends but not much else. Once you've had one fun go it never seems to capture that magic again.
3133	0	a	look yes i only played for 30 mins... but i bought this game as part of a 4 pack for me and my mates.... paid like a buck for it.. how bad does a game have to be.. that your m8ts try to return the game... and the dev's.. because of what ever they said.. Gave them more free copies to give away?!?!?!?  so NO.. this game is not worth even the $1 buck i paid......
3134	0	a	Don't.
3135	0	a	10/10 The best game I ever played, with action packed fun great teamwork all around! sarcasm intensifies
3136	0	a	  It is so bad! I had a good laugh with a friend while trying some multiplayer action. The delay between shooting animation and the sound, plus it is just so freaking clonky...
3137	0	a	meee not that great
3138	0	a	it sucks, low graphics and not many players
3139	0	a	1 hour of my life I will never get back! Thanks Mr Majestic!
3140	0	a	Admittedly my time was rather short with orion Dino Horde. In that time during the free weekend I found the game to have had plenty of potential that is sadly lost in a generally bland game. It's sad to say really because the premise is pretty fun really. Running around as a team of soldiers blasting any and all Dinosaurs that you see with a variety of weapons and vehicles sounds like immense fun until you start playing it.  The animations are subpar for both the soldiers and dino's. Men look like they are gliding along the floor as they 'run' while dino's charge around the map with their jaws hanging open but not making any sounds. The large opponents such as T-Rex make roars every now and then but Jurassic Park level sound design this is not.  Weapons are varied but they all look pretty bland. Most weapons have flat textures with blue lights on them and many feel particularly weak when fired, or simply miss half the time. The weather effects for the snowfall is atrocious and overall it just feels bad.  I know this is by a small team who have accomplished something here that I personally couldn't and if you don't mind the general chepness of the title it's probably not going to grate on you too much. Certainly a game best enjoyed with a few friends. If however you are looking to buy this for yourself to game with random people online, DON'T. It isn't worth it as a single purchase.
3141	0	a	Even though it's been well over a year since I bought this and even though I only paid less than it's $10 asking price when it was called Dino Beatdown, I still regret buying this game. When I first heard they were going to re-release it, I didn't care. The only reason I decided to reinstall it was to get the Steam trading cards. I have no shame.  Playing it again (yes, I actually played it instead of idling in the menu), I noticed right away that it was way less buggy than and MUCH better optimized, not to mention all of the new content that was added. However, all the problems I had with the first game that weren't glitches were still present when I played it last.  I'm not sure if they're still there upon writing this, but I honesly don't care since the damage has already been done for me. The weapons lack punch, the animation is a joke, the maps are needlessly big, enemies are brain-dead, can go from pathetically easy to unfairly difficult at a moment's notice even with other players, and is just not fun.   Also, WHY is there a microtransaction store? This is not a free-to-play game.  Despite saying all of that, I will give the developers credit for greatly improving the game over what we first got, but...you already know the saying about polishing a turd.  4/10
3142	0	a	Barely worth one dollar. If you can afford the computer required to run this, you can afford a better game then this. Reminded me of a horribly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ knock-off of halo: combat evolved mixed with dinosaurs. Most of the dinosaur models look like inflatable pool toys and the games motion blur hardley obscures the plastic looking models. Deresolution is so bad that my teammates look like the character from pitfall at 100 yards.  2/10  I would have said buy this if you've got no games on your steam account but TF2 is free-to-play now.  On a side note: HOW DARE THEY USE THE QUAKE KILL STREAKS.
3143	0	a	Probably the worst game I've ever played. Gameplay, animation, design, and concepts are all very poorly executed. In addtion to the actual feel of the game, it is primarily meant for multiplayer but there are no servers becasue no one is playing it. So, I tried to play single player... I played for about 10 minutes and kinda want my $1 back.
3144	0	a	This game held a lot of promise. However, the end result is boring, uninspired, and disappointing.
3145	0	a	wow, this game was free to play for the weekend and never before have I experienced a game so broken while still launching.  I've been attacked by dinosaurs through the ground several times, when thrown, grenades disappear until they hit the ground where they respawn and roll away for 4 seconds before exploding, in the one class I played you just jetpack onto or between rocks and no dinosaurs can get you except for t-rex that THROW ROCKS at you with it's teeth and the pterosaurs that fly around in glitchyness and fly flapping their wings while their nose is touching ground like it's ski-ing face first (when user controlled). I feel like they spent 80% of their time on the textures (which are pretty good) but very little on anything else, the world meshes feel like I'm walking on something sculpted of tinfoil so sharp are the angles (on rocks at least).  If this game were very early access alpha I would criticise it for being released before it was ready but it's been out for quite some time . . .
3146	0	a	won't even start up  just crashes 
3147	0	a	Repetitive, feels bad, looks bad, sounds bad, this game is just bad in every way.
3148	0	a	ORION:Dino Horde is an AWFUL experiance it has AWFUL graphics AWFUL gameplay and it's quite laggy when i played single player there was text on my screen saying WAITING FOR PLAYERS and in half an hour of playing i only saw 2 dinosaurs i went in thinking this will be like halo (good) with dinosaurs (AWESOME) i was partly right but it is just abysmal i hate it i hate it i cant recomend it it's so AWFUL!
3149	0	a	not even worth 0.99€ that i payed don't buy it, it is terrible
3150	0	a	So it seems to me that the map is just way to big and you end up running for minutes on end to get places and that dinosaurs at times can be way to overpowering if you dont have 4 or more people playing with you. Also the bosses can wreck if you are 4 or less. The matchmaking is absolutely garbage, with refreshing sometimes not working and trying to get into a game saying that you can connect but having a giant CONNECTING plastered on your screen. Friends can sometimes join games that you cant. Overall its a 4.5/10 in terms of gameplay quality and could be a meager laugh or too in coop play but there are far better options in terms of this catergory. BUT for a dollar you might as well buy it but for nothing more.
3151	0	a	Even for a dollar, Im not going to waste time or hard drive space on this prehistoric turd. All I want is a New Turok!
3152	0	a	this game was horrible. The graphics were crap, and the gameplay in general was just bs.
3153	0	a	Terrible game with a terrible GUI, awful server browser, unresponsive controls, dated gfx, crappy game modes, awful netcode. Just utter utter ♥♥♥♥♥ not even worth .99p
3154	0	a	Controller support is laughable at most... 'USE' was not mapped out by default and there are no options that allow me to invert the axis or sensitivity. Those alone make this game not even worth .99 to me.
3155	0	a	If you want to waste you time, this is the game for you for 99p as it's on offer you get boring pointless fights with dinosaurs. the graphics are taty and gameplay feels inbalance so expect lots of dinosaurs coming at you like miley cyrus, as the AI tends to just twerk at the nearest player. The game has stupid physics dinosaurs can throw a tank in the air by hitting their head against it where it will bounce of the walls like it was made out of rubber. The guns are ♥♥♥♥ you will be running around trying to hit a dinosaur with a shotgun but only registers if you hit it precisely with crosshair destryoing the whole concept the spread of the shotgun. No wonder it's 99p I read that it has been a lot better since update but you have been mislead, so 99p not a lot of money so if you want to try it go ahead I have played worse games. I give this 3/10 if your obessed with dinosaurs or survival games you might like it.
3156	0	a	the game by itself is good - the problem is with all the bugs it conteins, from windows errors to conection difficulties to servers the game keep disconnecting from servers, usually without any explanation of the reason, and also rase a lot of windows error while crushing. I tried this game on XP and on windows 7 - but results are the same. I guess thats why a good game was sold for 1$ price. (other games on steam never gave me any troubles)
3157	0	a	Glitchy, ulgy, horrible gameplay, seems like a 13 year old developed this, there is a good reason why this has a 36/100 on metacritic
3158	0	a	Dont be fooled by the cheapness of the game. Believe me its not worth the 1 dollar and GB on your computer. People are reviewing this game poorly for a reason and no amount of percentage off the $15 price is going to make it anymore value for money. The game feels like a mod, not an actually game made by a company. Play Killing Floor, as its much more ahead of the genre then this game is.
3159	0	a	Wow, where do you start. I thought this was a re-release or a new Beta or what have you. Turns out, this game has always been buggy and well, kind of bad. And it still is. Where do I start?!  The sound, well, it is just, bad? The voice acting, the quality of the voice recording, the sound levels, the guns, the dino's, the music that cuts in and out. All pretty bad. Not horrible, but it is kind of like they just dumped a bunch of stuff in there, DONE!  The Animations are just plain weird and buggy. Your main starting gun, when you draw it, is drawn before your hands are in position. What?! The scope zooming is done like this is a game from 2007. The Dino's jumping animation is bad, the bites are wayyy off, flying dino's make insane 180's midair, the T Rex takes weird bites from the ground and proceeds to trow these 'boulders' at you... They spin and are only half animated, one side is just flat. Did they ever take a look at this game? Did they even test it and play it themselves?  Physics, well, ehh. Yes, Shoot a 10 ton Stegosaurus with a bow and arrow for 20 times and it dies, but the last arrow sends it flying like crazy. But a tank shell on a minature critter has no impact. Oh and did you know, dino's can pound the ground and send you flying off into the air, but their own kind is just glued to the floor.  And then the actual gameplay. Did they ever test it? What where they thinking? You are teleported out of fortified buildings when the enemies come in. Never heard of using bunkers I guess. You NEED the jetpack, if you don't have it you are just picked up and dropped to death. And fightning from a rock is way to go. So why are there 3 classes? It won't help if they don't get something like the Jetpack. So you defend this generator, that has no healthbar and needs to be recharged. You get random vehicles for liberating outposts but it all has very arbitrary time constraints. These game modes just make NO SENSE AT ALL.  3/10, would not play if F2P. It is now, but even at €1 it is asking too much. This game is bad. Cool concept, nice scenery, but the gameplay and pretty much all else is bad.
3160	0	a	Andddddd. WTF It may have...some...potential. Considering the menu seems to lag a bit, it definetely has flaws, but i'm sure it would run smoother on an enthusiast's rig. APUs don't support much, even in the fabled 'Dual Graphics Mode'
3161	0	a	It's ♥♥♥♥ing weird. Very small lobbies of five.    Its basically a dino versus human. You pick which side you're on... in lobbies of 5. Bigger lobbies would be a very fun game, there would be a lot of room for a f2p model like Tf2.   As is? not worth it
3162	0	a	You'd think a game with guns and Dino's couldn't miss.  You'd think.  but it's only a buck for now so might as well see for your self
3163	0	a	Its an OK game but thats it just OK. Nothing to write home about.   You start off with just a pistol. Really?!? And there is no way to play with just a controller you can fire with the controller but cant interact with anything eithout a keyboard so whats the point.   Visually it looks nice, not the best but not the worst either.   Worth $0.99? Eh, maybe. However, I dont find this to be something I would keep coming back to.
3164	0	a	This game sucks ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T. DO NOT PLAY IT. CONTROLS FOR THE GAME AS PLAYIN AS THE DINOS ARE SO ♥♥♥♥ED UP YOU CANT EVEN KILL ANYONE.
3165	0	a	Still cant find where my dogs at.
3166	0	a	keeps crashing when i try to play a game on it this game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t
3167	0	a	This game really looked exciting. Kind of like a cross between Left 4 Dead and dinosaurs. However, this game was very disapointing for me. It had bad graphics, slow online play, bad mechanics, and bad AI. With all the hype this game had it was a disapointing result.
3168	0	a	ORION Dino Horde is a horrible time to be had and you will remember how terrible it is
3169	0	a	Ignore all the 'community ratings' it's still terrible.
3170	0	a	So good that they give a -91% on it. Please avoid this game.
3171	0	a	I was hoping to see a lot more Monster Hunter style personality and physics - players being circled by cautious predators who preferred to strike from behind, vehicles being tossed around, damaged or even destroyed by vicious looking charge attacks, players having to shoot the pterodactyls off of their comrade's helmets, etc.   I didn't see anything like that here. The smaller dinosaurs behaved like the pink demons from Doom and the large dinosaurs went down fast, seemed incapable of threatening the players and in general failed to express proper giant monster mannerisms. The physics could use more tweaking, the beasties could use more attacks and behavior patterns, and the players could use more danger. Knock them around some!  The netcode was mediocre. Not unplayably bad, but not awfully good, either.
3172	0	a	I have never seen a more buggy game. The menu system is so bad I had to restart the game just to get rid of the lobby select screen. This game is so bad the developers should feel bad for it.  EDIT: After 2 more attempts to join a game and having to restart the game after each failure, I am STILL not able to actually get into a game. Absolutely shameful.
3173	0	a	Guys run like they have a ♥♥♥♥ in their ♥♥♥.
3174	0	a	Don't bother to try to play this game. Dino's super OP and humans eat ♥♥♥♥ all day. -2/11
3175	0	a	tried it on a free weekend. not worth any amount of money. (This is for dino horde, not whatever it was called before)
3176	0	a	The dinosaursurvival is Great. But the multiplayer is crap. You can't shoot anything. Your bullets go over and to the side of your enemies. I rate the multiplayer a 1-10 and the dinosaursurvival a 7-10. But it has great framerate the graphics are outstanding but the gameplay, iffy.
3177	0	a	Sloppy as hell and the network is held together by a potatoe
3178	0	a	this game could be a great ps1 game in 1998, other than that, its not worth a dollar
3179	0	a	All around, based on horrible texture qulity, aweful gameplay, and ugly, low-poly models, this game would hardly be worth free. I wouldn't waste your money, but hey, do what you want.
3180	0	a	I read some of the reviews, and watched the trailer video on the store page before trying this game our for the free weekend event. Let me tell you; Killing floor is fun..Jurassic Park is an alright movie. This game just wasn't what it was made out to be. The metascore is not misleading; it is dead on. This game rates a 3/10.
3181	0	a	Don't waste your money, don't waste any one else's money. Steer clear completely.  You have been warned.
3182	0	a	What a terrible game
3183	0	a	this game is so lagy
3184	0	a	these reviews sound an awful lot like the captions in the trailer. The game is only worth maybe a dollar... and thats all i paid. it looks and plays like a dollar phone app anyway
3185	0	a	THIS GAME IS NOT PRIMAL CARNAGE - bought it for $1, still not worth it. Super boring, super repetitive, and the multiplayer doesn't work.
3186	0	a	I know it's only .99 cents right now, and I know their video says 'zomg, don't listen to all the negative reviews because we typed this message', but... it's totally a .99 cent game. Don't get me wrong, lots of work went into it, the idea sounds awesome, the first round was great (because I thought it would have actual gameplay once I learned the ropes). But... nope.
3187	0	a	i'm glad I got this when it was a buck because I'd be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ if I spend more than a dallor on this trash game. The controls are sluggish, the graphics are a joke and the overall evperience gets really boring after a few hours of playing. during matched you can upgrade your weapons and also yourself but for some reason the weapon area and the augment area are to far apart to get to both curing the cool down timer between waves. Why the hell do we have to return to 2 different building to upgrade our stuff. After a match it should be a menu you pull down and can upgrade whatever you want. I don't understand how this game has so many good reviews. dont waste your money
3188	0	a	It's like comma misuse but worse.
3189	0	a	The trick here is you have to buy the rest of the game.
3190	0	a	this game ruined my computer
3191	0	a	Imagine Halo 2 Valhalla mixed with Nazi Zombies from CoD, that's Dino Horde. And yes, you may be looking at my profile and see that I only played a half hour of the game. Well my friends, this was enough for me.  I really thought the textures and maps were well done, graphically it was a very pretty game. That was..until I heard 'Horde Incoming' or whatever. The Dinosaurs are very clunky and it doesn't feel genuine. This game mode is more of a mini-game in what should be a bigger game rather than the entirety of it.  Benefit of the doubt however lets me tell you that with some huge group of people 5-20, this game would be nuts! I was by myself, the map was way, WAY too big. But if I had 3-5 friends helping it would have been a better time.  This game is going to get a no, because I do not believe it deserves 15.00, I got it for a dollar and I still want my dollar back.
3192	0	a	This game is downright horrible, check the reviews on youtube (TotalBiscuit, Tobuscus) for the reasons why because its g.o.d.d.a.m.n awful. Played for an hour and uninstalled. Wasn't even worth my 0.99 euros.
3193	0	a	I would say this game is just bad. The sound volumes for some things are way too loud, when others are too dim. The character animations are bad, gunplay isn't that bad and movement system is somewhat nice. But still i wouldn't spend even 99 cents on this.
3194	0	a	This must have been an amazing mod back in 1996, but now it is laughable. Even the current offer of 99 cents is a waste of money.
3195	0	a	Halo one graphics mixed with turok's bulky tank like dinosaurs. can't recommend any one play this even for a dollar.
3196	0	a	Everything seems great, graphics, and everything but only problem is that there arent' enough people playing anymore which is a shame
3197	0	a	Cool concept. But very laggy.
3198	0	a	repetitive and dull
3199	0	a	i would get this game if on sale otherwise no
3200	0	a	Flung into a world of war between dinosaurs for apparently no reason, you are given no explanation whatsoever as to how to play the game; very much a 'baptism by fire' mindset. In this game, you wage war against a poorly designed AI of raptors and tiny annoying version of the same raptor... Confusing objectives and difficult to join game lobbies further the inability to grasp any sort of understanding for the game.  An concept game I would like to say were interesting, however, falls short from anything but. With a large ammount of achievements available to be unlocked, I cannot fathom the torment one would have to undergo to unlock all 251 achievements. All in all this game needs a ton of work in my mind to be even considered on the same level as an old time Star Wars Battlefront. 1/5 stars.
3201	0	a	pros: lovey graphics   cons: the game my 24 inch monitor wont fit bad sound effects i have a 5.20ghz but i still had to run it on low graphics  and the modles look terrbal thank god i got it for 99p i would love to reccmend this game but its not even ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ wervay sorry ;(
3202	0	a	'So cool I love it'  Yeah I bet that guy also loves ♥♥♥♥♥.
3203	0	a	Ehhhh. Don't get me wrong. There is a lot this game does right. Mechanics are solid, the way the game lets you choose how to play is nice, however the whole thing just feels so empty. The player models are all faceless robot looking things completely devoid of personality. The dinosaurs feel less like ferocious beasts charging you down and more like carboard cut-outs that aimlessly run towards you in a race to die. There is no set up as to why these faceless robot things are committing genocide on these dinosaurs. The game is just shooting things in a box for the sake of shooting things.
3204	0	a	Game is impossible to play by yourself, there is no scaling for single player when you have a weak pistol. Trying to get into a lobby so I didnt have to play alone tried for ten minutes with no success. Glad I got it on a sale price of almost 95% off.
3205	0	a	Metacritic score is indeed deceptive, it should be lower.
3206	0	a	I figured I'd try this game out seeing as how it's on sale for $1 right now. I never got past sitting in a lobby waiting for a match to start. Clearly a reason this game is on sale for $1 right now. I'm glad I tried the free trial first before wasting a buck.
3207	0	a	Hahahaha.  Is this for real? Did I really just buy 4 copies of this game for 3 USD?  (Lemme know if you want a copy to show your kids one day.)
3208	0	a	while i only payed a dollar for the game and got more then what i payed for i have to say the reviews of improvements of this game are greatly exaggerated. the hit boxes of the dinosaurs are something even red 5 would laugh at. (infamous for hit boxes that counted necks as part of the head). the connection even with a ethernet cable was horrid. the character models are so outdated that even models from star wars clone comando look better in comparison. the store's ui is cluttered and has no way of tracking expenses for items put on a character. the taunts and various animations.... i think even hi rez put more effort into their emotes and they were free. now for the REAL gameplay.  first off i bought the LMG assuming it was a large machine gun... apparently LMG = burst rifle..... thats a simple error to fix in 30 sec.. you dont have an LMG you have a burst rifle. bow was fun but kind of impractical. (however bow weapons tend to be heavily connection dependent to be practical). using the mouse to steer the vehicles when most controls for tanks rely heavily on the wasd keys and using the mouse for turret control was aggravating (but tolerable... tom clancy games have button mapping that was worse) .  settings are set to all optional parts enabled (motion blur, bloom, etc) and high settings. disabling most of the optional settings makes the game playable but connectivty issues and wonky hitboxes are never good for a game no matter how pretty.  the hats.... just.... just no.... i mean if the hat replaced the helmet instead of being on top of it maybe .... other wise... no. even tf2 knows better then to allow clipping of cosmetic items.  however.... this game isnt something from the bowls of hell.... its kind of a fun idea though i was never into being a sci fi dinosaur killer and this game has raised a slight interest. I also have to give props to the developer still putting the time and effort to at least try to make the game better. something we dont see enough of these days in an age where companies like hi rez and activision make a game cash the paycheck for a year then abandon it for a new project in a different genre.  In fact id love to see this game on a new engine with updated charcter models.... and working hit boxes -_-....and a more intuitive UI.  people are arguing its worthy of an 83 or an 80 on the meta critic score... after my expereince that is not the case. the game has definitely made steps forward from the 30 it originally received but not worthy of a 82. this game id have to say a 63 would be a much more accurate score of the game. its no triple A title and with a setting such as sci fi soldiers killing dinosaurs i already had low expectations... which surprised me in good ways and bad as well. there are large areas for improvement just to make the game a 75 worthy score and even an hour of gameplay is enough to see that. it was fun for a dollar and i hope it gets put into their next project. these guys have a nice idea.... just need to do a bit better job of executing it.   if ya got a spare buck give it a shot for a couple hours have a little derpy fun.... and never speak of it again. 
3209	0	a	Ha, not even for a dollar.  You can rebrand the same piece of crap over and over again, but if you don't overhaul it, it's just going to remain crap.
3210	0	a	This game was worth the $0.75 I paid for it.
3211	0	a	This game is the most broken, unfinished, rushed unattractive game ive ever played, the controls are broken and in many cases..just start huffing paint and stop working completely, multiple crashes, barely rendered textures and an atmosphere that makes me want to place a colt 44 revolver in my mouth and squeeze the trigger, never ever EVER buy this game...theres a reason it was 92% off...  Just go play turok, it works its pretty, and it doesnt make me feel like a 4 year old with a disability.
3212	0	a	i am an idiot for spending a dollar on this game, which means a lot
3213	0	a	Dont buy this, not worth it.
3214	0	a	Just another game that doesn't take itself seriously. Could be fun with friends, just to enjoy shooting at dinosaurs and see them chewing on human-made machines (?) Not great, not bad, if you're into Jurassic Park check it out.
3215	0	a	what a boring game.
3216	0	a	I haven't played beatdown, but this is ♥♥♥♥. While Dino Horde has potential, it falls short of even decent expectations. Fighting dinosaurs has never been so dull. A shame, since it's evident that the developers put a lot of time into it... it's just too bad they didn't focus on making it fun.
3217	0	a	For $1, I was pretty disappointed.
3218	0	a	This game is suck don't buy it even for 1$, bad graphisme, bugged, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gameplay, nobody on the servers, run away from this game. I know the team try to correct that, but failed miserably, there are so much bug that i don't want to listed them. If you want dino game play primal carnage. I confirmed is 32/100, too bad, the idea is cool but exploited in better game. P.S: sorry for bad english i'm french.
3219	0	a	Worst game ever. I paid 15p and still feel disappointed.
3220	0	a	Monotonous and boring. Glad I only paid 99 cents for it
3221	0	a	The sequel to Battlefield 3 that we've all be waiting for.
3222	0	a	I bought Pulsar: Lost Colony. It was accidentally released to the public in a non-working pre alpha state. Pulsar was more entertaining than this. The Video says something to the tune of 'Ignore the metacritic score. The devs listened to us and made this game better.' If this is better, I can't imagine the state it was in before. Who designed the levels? What's the point of spawning over a kilometer away from your DEFEND OBJECTIVE? You can't even set up stationary defenses along the way. You literally have to spend 5 minutes makin the trek to your base, or get lucky and stumble upon a vehicle. WHY????
3223	0	a	Dont waste your money on this trash game!
3224	0	a	Horribly unpolished and dull FPS, weapons just don't feel like they are firing bullets - opponents don't really react to being fired at, their AI is horrible and the whole combat feels boring. Map design is pretty good though, large areas, vehicles, mechs and everything - it has the potential to be a great game but it just isn't right now. I don't recommend buying it right now, maybe later when it gets a big expansion pack or something.
3225	0	a	Lags, frame drops, black screen, crashes, sound skipping. And dinosaurs. 30 euro? Are you crazy? This is hardly a beta, I'd say it's an alpha edition, not a final product. Yup, my PC meets the minimal technical requirements.  I do NOT recommend that you buy this game.
3226	0	a	Average not my type of game but .... Average
3227	0	a	I felt i was playing the first halo but with dinosaurs which doesn't sound bad at all. When i actually played the game i realized i was wrong. The game never really seems to go anywhere and after a few matches feels old. Its like heres some guns now go shoot some dinosaurs! But even then, the dinosaurs only rush your position and the only needed strategy needed is to walk backwards and spray. Im glad I didn't pay the full price for this because i would have been seriously disappointed.
3228	0	a	Don't play it, it's bad, trust me..Despite being warned by a friend I thought I should give the game a try..Within the first 10 second my impression was: AWFUL. Textures are far from even an average 'standard' quality for PC...Guns feels weird, hard to aim, horrible sound and also feel weight less..FOV is low, makes you motion sick and nope, you can't adjust it.
3229	0	a	Pro: I get to shoot dinosaurs. Con: Dinosaurs do not shoot lasers back Con: Can not play as laser shooting dinosaur.
3230	0	a	This is very good game,I played and i like it
3231	0	a	Lmao Ill tell you right now the games not even worth $14.99, I was given the game by a friend a while ago when it first came out. After the first like 15 mins I uninstalled because it was garbage. I came back just a little while ago because I seen they changed it since then and what not. No its still garbage. I almost bought it for 2 of my friends for the $ 0.99 however I didnt feel like it would be played much and would be a waste of $2 which i could go and get a soda or something better then this game. It looks amazing looks like it would be a lot of fun and maybe it is? but I just can not stand the graphics, the animations, or the gameplay myself.
3232	0	a	Buggy gameplay, sticky dinosaurs, horrible dino control. 10/10. will never play again.
3233	0	a	Ya know. I was going to buy it. I really was. I somehow got a free trial of it and had a lot of fun playing it. I was going to buy it while it was on sale last night, but since I already had it, it wouldn't let me get it. So I go to buy it today and I conveniently can't play it now because it's back to it's original price. This is absolute bull crap. I was going to buy it! I was going to pay, but I COULDN'T. THE GAME IS FUN! But because of the way this sale went down, I can't say that I'd recommend it. If I had the money, I'd get it before hand. But now?
3234	0	a	though this game is filled with great graphics and dinosaurs, this game is full of glitches and crashes, not to mention if your playing with friends it takes forever to find a server for your friends to play on and even creating a server for the host it lags out , I just got this game and it asks me to buy it AGAIN ! well i wont this is a lesson to all of you dont waste your money like I did !
3235	0	a	This isn't a good game, but for a 99 cent sale I could consider buying it then. But not for 15 freaking dollars.
3236	0	a	It's the most laggyest game ever my friend and I have ok gaming computers but we cant walk 10 feet i don't like it because of the massive lag (ONLY REALLY GOOD COMPUTERS CAN PLAY THIS GAME)
3237	0	a	It's not the worst game Ive ever played but by far from the best. If you buy it while it's on sale for a buck, it's worth the dollar. However don't get your hopes up. The survival mode is a lot like Killing Floor. Kill dinosaurs and earn money. Use the money to buy guns and upgrades. Survive the wave and go to the next one. The dinosaurs are pretty lame but overall, it's ok.
3238	0	a	This is honestly the best game I have ever played. It has a dynamic combination of fps, driving over annoying tiny dinosaurs, and having your ear drums burst from the roars of T-Rexes. Stunning, stunning graphics are complimented by utter emersion. Bloom so intense that you literally can't see anything is probably my favorite feature of this game. GAME OF THE YEAR RIGHT HERE!    Just kidding this game is terrible.
3239	0	a	HORIBLE i dont understand why anyone would bye this game. Its crap on a cracker mixed with soggy bread thats been put on a pancake that has been burnt and then shuger coated to look tasty.DO NOT BUY i got it for free for 4 days and played it for about on hour it realy showed what it wanted to do but didint do it right. BUT IT REALLY MAKES ME MAD THAT I HAVE BEEN WANTING A GAME THAT DOSE THIS RIGHT the FPS wave defens game is like a dream of mine and to see it here kinda makes me want to cry. T_T
3240	0	a	this game blows.. no wonder it was for a dollar..
3241	0	a	Why make people pay for ♥♥♥♥ when you bought this? It is really hard to see that, just like all the servers that I can't join because of a refreshing bug that stopped my game.  Good detail, just needs bug fixes out the ♥♥♥
3242	0	a	Do not find going circles at a high rate of speed entertaining.
3243	0	a	If there was an actual strategy to the game, then I'd recommend it. But this is just a wave of a dozen dinosaurs running toward you or a specific waypoint, and you shoot them. The map looks huge, but since the dinosaurs only want to attack the one location, and there's only a minute between waves, and there are upgrades to buy at two very inconveniently-located locations, I'm not sure how anyone is meant to see more of the map.
3244	0	a	BAD!! not worth the $.99 nor the hard drive space.
3245	0	a	Generic multiplayer gameplay with subpar graphics and awkward animations.
3246	0	a	WoW!!! no wonder this was under $1. This is a UDK game (not the Unreal engine) stand alone, arena PvP game. You stand there and wait for endless spawns of dino's to come destroy your generator....you kill them, repair, rinse and repeat, over and over and over and over.....
3247	0	a	Not even for a dollar will I re-download this game. I played it the last time it went F2P, and... even though I played it for free I hated it. It took me and a friend a solid twenty minutes to even get a match going, and not because we couldn't access any servers. Ohhhh no. The game is really just that slow. The interface really isn't user-friendly at all either. The main menu is buggy.  Once you're actually in the game, you'll realize very quickly that the game is a very dry shooter/tower defense. It's not fun, but in fact it is very aggravating. On the surface, the game looks super fun. 'Why did Metacritic score this so low?' I asked myself. 'It doesn't look that bad.' It's bad. All enemeies basically have the same attack. And worst of all, the game is so blatantly repetitive.   Despite what the screenshots led us to believe, the game's graphics were some of the crappiest we've seen. While I myself do not have a higher end computer, my friend did. And even for him, the game looked like crap.  Honestly, I do like the concept of the game. What's not to love about shooting dinosaurs on an alien world? I really wanted to like this game. I really did. But it was just so boring. If the developers can fix it up a bit, then I will gladly try again. But for now, save your dollar for something else.
3248	0	a	Jesus Christ, why did I buy this game. Now I'm stuck with three other copies that I can't even get rid of.
3249	0	a	Even for 1€ this game is pretty crappy.  - full of bugs - gameplay feels cheap - game mechanics are boring - graphics look even worse than the screenshots on the store page (expect something like Playstation 2) - ugly and unintuitive menus  Consider buying Natural Selection 2 instead - it is far far better than this piece of crap!
3250	0	a	I'm glad I only paid $0.99 for it.
3251	0	a	After trying this game on a steam two day pass I decided even at the sale price of 99p it wasn't worth it, the game is fun to play however you get randomly dropped from games without warning and you spend most of your time in a match making lobby. Very frustrating.
3252	0	a	i think this game is good but he is rly boring after 2 days so from 15 bux is come to 1 bux so i knew that day will come but im no t buying the game hope that you have more good games  
3253	0	a	Bleargh
3254	0	a	sucks. dont buy it
3255	0	a	Putrid ♥♥♥♥ juice courtesy of Spiral Game Studios. This game is buggy as hell, they're apparently releasing another game on Kickstarter- FINISH THIS FIRST FOR ♥♥♥♥S SAKE! They're most likely gonna do the same with their new game, release an unfinished product and squeeze the money out of people. Oh yeah, and the only thing that is functional is the store and payment options...
3256	0	a	A big stinking pile of crap.
3257	0	a	This is my personal opinion but I thought that the game was poor. It might be different for other people but I found that the graphics were not great and some of the animations just plain stupid. I did not enjoy the game as it just got boring after a while and would not recommend it. The only thing that I have played similar to it would be extinction from COD Ghosts and I didn't highly rate that either. I think that one can tell quite a lot about this game by the fact that it has a 92% price reduction to £0.99. Same price as an app on aphone and about the same quality.
3258	0	a	Even at 0.99p and on free week it has barely 20 players on it, Plagued by various issues, lacking support for certain resolutions and half complete game modes. Orion: Dino Horde isn't worth your time or money, it is fun for the first 10 minutes but after that you realise its many shortcomings. Meanwhile overambitious developer is planning more and more things when the foundation of the game is still unpolished.   Also the Playable dinosaur game mode is rarely played and fustrating.   It is a shame, i wanted this game to be great. It isn't and considering how long it has taken + a name change, i very much doubt it'll be anything worth playing for years to come.
3259	0	a	Bought it in 2012, played it in 2012, tried it again today. This game still does not deserve the bad metascore. It does not deserve 36 points. It deserves far less. It still sucks.
3260	0	a	UPDATE: Noticed that horrible netcode is really horrible when not being the host.  TL;DR: Don't bother. Worth the dollar, not worth the full price.  So I thought I'd buy this game as it was crazy cheap, so I wouldn't lose much anyways in case it sucked. Turns out it kinda does, but it's still fun. The game is incredibly trashy, but that's not really a valid point to criticise as that kind of comes with the 'Dinosaur FPS' genre. It's so trashy, it even has bullet time. (You can create lobbies without it though, but why would you?)  Basic Gameplay Elements ====================  Basically, it's a wave-based co-operative horde mode against various types of dinosaurs. Waves are not all of the same type though, some are simple survival, others require you to capture an objective. (You will be rewarded with vehicles for doing so)  During the wave, you'll collect credits for killing dinosaurs, and killing them in rapid succession gives you a multiplier, so getting good streaks is actually important to earn money for upgrades and weapons. Upgrades appear to be interesting for the most part, there are some boring 'do twice as much damage' upgrades, which I don't think should be there.  Inbetween waves, you're able to purchase upgrades at your base. The time between rounds is pretty short though (one minute), and the buildings are not always placed in a way that allows you to purchase weapons and upgrades during that short interval. You have a teleporter to beam you back to the base, at least, but in some maps, the base is pretty spread out. Furthermore, some dinosaurs seem to spawn inbetween waves.  Apart from smaller, easier to kill dinos, big ones will occasionally spawn, and as long as those live, more smaller ones will spawn. However, the game tells you when it does so, and also informs you about the health of the big dinosaurs, which makes things a bit easier.  There are three classes in the game, and two of them seem to be completely useless because the first one has a jetpack. The jetpack is pretty useful to avoid getting eaten by Dinosaurs, and is more of a lifesaver than any medic gun ever will be.  Teamplay is not all that important. Having someone repair the generator before it goes offline is nice but barely an issue most of the time. If you manage to die, you'll go into a borderlands-style last-stand, where you can revive yourself by killing an enemy. Teammates can revive you aswell, either by holding down E for a while or healing you with a medic gun.  Criticisms ========  There are things in the game that are legitimately crappy, which do affect the enjoyment. Guns feel ♥♥♥♥♥♥, mostly because recoil is unbiased and pretty much random, but also due to bad sound assets and cheap animations. The latter two are probably due to budget constraints, but the former is not really excusable. Vehicle guns have such a huge cone of fire that they're pretty useless altogether. Most guns seem to not be hitscan, however, which is a good thing, as it adds some much needed depth to the gunplay.  Furthermore, the game has plenty of glitches. While the Dinosaur AI is not completely braindead at times and tries to make it hard for you to hit them, they occasionally get stuck, or just run at you in a straight line while you're running backwards, making it easy for you to shoot them. Physics seem to bug out at times (buggy physics seem to be a common trope in dinosaur games, remember Trespasser?), but not in a way that really affects gameplay. It's mostly limited to corpses breakdancing on the ground.  Graphics seem good for a budget title, that is until you take a closer look at the textures, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ animations. That is, if you can even see those over the ridiculous amounts of bloom and occasional motion blur. I'm sure those can be toggled off, however, but that means you'll see more of the low-res textures and weird animations.  Dinosaur animations seem to suffer from the same quality issues, and they ♥♥♥♥♥ out a bit when you sit on a cliff that they can't reach. Speaking of cliffs that they can't reach: This is where the jetpack really comes in handy, because it allows you to escape from anything that isn't a pterodactyle, or doesn't have a ranged attack.  The netcode seems to have some issues aswell. Other players rubberband around almost always, as there seems to be almost no movement prediction for players. Unless you are the host, the game will be extremely laggy, and not much fun to play.  Conquest gamemode appears to be a more boring Survival gamemode, so I have no clue what that is all about.  The microtransactions don't seem to interfere with the game and appear to just be cosmetic, but I still think they shouldn't be in the game at all.  Conclusion ========  Definitely worth the price during the sale. If you've been waiting for a game that lets you hunt T-Rexes with a bow while flying around with a jetpack, then this is your game. I'm not sure if it's worth the full price though. Most likely not. And the bad netcode ultimately kills it.
3261	0	a	This game is really bad, dont even bother downloading it
3262	0	a	Why do I even own this?
3263	0	a	The idea behind the game is good, but when the game crashes all the time while the interface doesnt work it makes it a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game. Time and time again i tried to get in to the game but crash after chrash makes it realy hard to like it. And when you have to empty your guns for ammo to obtain the last kill, because the AI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and has lodged itself on a cliffside 500 meters away, it kind of fells like you have been had.
3264	0	a	Gets boring very quickly, no variation when re-playing a particular game mode. Just the same every. single. time. The new conquest gamemode is pretty much the same as survival.. kinda a let down.
3265	0	a	This is the game was the first I can recall where got the worse case of motion sickness.
3266	0	a	Um... It's uh... ok? Kinda buggy... um... yeah this game isn't so great. It's funny to play though.
3267	0	a	buggy. Free game for this week, but you cannot connect to any of the games in progress, nor can you start your own game. Poor game, poor execution, no connectivity. Why is this game even here?
3268	0	a	Its Terrible, I had it when it was orion dino:beatdown. It is one of three games i would happily request steam to remove of my library but then i see it as an example to use to ensure i don't buy crap like this in the future.
3269	0	a	Game sucked BAD.  I wouldn't buy it for a buck.  First off *texture pop in*, Gun animations don't work, terrible AI, vehicle controls are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and its a rip off of killing floor just with dinos..
3270	0	a	It's a fun game, at least that's what I've lead to believe from the trailer. The matchmaking is so terrible that I haven't been able to play in.
3271	0	a	Unadvertised multiplayer only. Nope.
3272	0	a	I paid a pound.  That was too much for this 'game'.
3273	0	a	The Metascore was a little too nice for this putrid excuse for a game. I thought 'Oh, a dollar? Why not? All the reviews are good'. Never have I been so mistaken. I should have listened to the Metascore and avoided it at all costs. But no. I managed to find 2 reasons why anyone should play this game. 2. It has dinosaurs. You can shoot them. That is it. The game is buggy, poorly optimized, ugly, confusing, and utterly broken. The textures look like pixel art, the models look like somebody cut a bit out of a metal tube, your characters feet are square, the frame rate must be locked at something really low because no matter what graphics settings I put them as, it still looked laggy and unresponsive, the guns have no feedback to them, menus barely work, game crashes most times I try to join a multiplayer game and from what I saw, I'm not the only one with this problem, trees look like trash, dinosaurs look like trash, UI looks like trash, vehicles are weak and the turrets do no damage, massive server issues, NO CONTROLLER SENSITIVITY, poor M/KB controls, long ♥♥♥ walks, useless augments, overpriced weapons, and I can just go on and on about how terrible this game is. DON'T. BUY IT. DON'T! THIS GAME IS BROKEN. Steam needs better quality control. I really hope someone reads this and knows not to buy this waste of time, money and hard drive space.
3274	0	a	Paid .99 cents for this I still feel ripped off.
3275	0	a	honestly for $0.99 cents its not terrible if you only play the horde mode were you and a couple others mindlessly shoot dinosaurs. game is very buggy, the recoil from shooting a gun is FAR from smooth, almost gives me a headache. Like others said the concept is great but not worth more than $0.99 cents (on sale right now). Very repeatitive too.
3276	0	a	I wanted to like this game. It looks fun, and it looks like the developers put a lot of work into fixing all of the things that were previously broken. Unfortunately, it just wouldn't launch. I tried everthing - twice. I respect a dev that can recognize that their game is broken, and take steps to fix it, but it looks like they've still got problems to solve.
3277	0	a	This game is laggy, overall was a poor experience.  Wasn't worth the dollar I paid.
3278	0	a	Worth exactly a dollar. Though, the game has many tweaks graphics wise, there would be more fun in having different game modes and some mods for jeebus sakes. 
3279	0	a	Played it for about an hour a few months ago. Uninstalled because it was boring as hell and there was only 1 active server. Might try it again with the new update at some point.
3280	0	a	What a stupid game
3281	0	a	THIS GAME IS AWFUL NOT EVEN WORTH 99 cents , the animations are awful almost all of the weapons , vehicles and structures are blatent halo ripoffs (how did they not get sued over this) gameplay is laggy at best , the best part of this game is laughing about how bad it is, an the trailer for this with all the fake quotes and reviews , pathetic , Dont support this s#*@
3282	0	a	I feel like i bought a 1$ packet of chips WIHOUT CHIPS IN IT!  Quite simply: I CANNOT PLAY IT! ... It's BROKEN! I haven't been able to connect to any servers and when I do, the game crashes!   Why do they even try to sell this game?! Do they seriously expect to make money this way?! Have they even tried the game before selling it?!
3283	0	a	This is the worst game I have ever played. It's just terrible. I can't even imagine how awful it was before if this is the greatly improved version.
3284	0	a	wow....everything about this game is just poor.
3285	0	a	this game is poop. i would write a longer review, but i lost brain cells playing it.
3286	0	a	The Metacritic scores are wrong, the trailer is correct. This game deserves MUCH LESS than a 36 out of 100. I spent one dollar on this game thinking that I was bound to get at least an hour of positive gameplay out it. I can't even muster that. Do not buy this game, please, for the sake of all that is sacred please believe me. The game is broken in every sense of the word. Do not pass go, do not collect 200 dollars, do not spend one dollar on ORION: Dino Horde.
3287	0	a	No, I do not recommend this game IF it is above 0.99 USD. Let me start by saying this, this game ♥♥♥♥ing sucks BUT i enjoy the hell out of it because it has always been my fantasy to kick dinosaur ♥♥♥ with guns. The grenade physics are ♥♥♥♥ poor, the Dinosaur attack animations are very stale and awkward. The list of reasons why this game sucks is too long for me to put here but if it's 0.99 cents and you like kicking dinosaur ♥♥♥ and don't care wether its a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game or not, buy this game.  If not, don't.
3288	0	a	This game is really good. Don't let the bad reviews fool you it's just as good as a game about shooting dinosaurs sounds. First of all the game has dinosaurs, second, there's enough to be a veritable HORDE of dinosaurs. What more do you want? Gameplay? Check, there's definitely something you could call gameplay here. Music? Okay so I don't remember whether or not there's any music but if it's there, I'm sure it's fantastic. What more could you expect from the developers of such classics as... Okay well they haven't made anything else, but if they did, I'm sure it would be just as good as this. In conclusion, if you weren't aware, this review was satirical, and you shouldn't play this game, except as a joke. Seriously this game blows.
3289	0	a	kinda got buyres remorse and i only paid 0.99 usd. really lame graphics and terible in game controlls aswell overall game play
3290	0	a	I played for 2 mins, mostly with the Game's options. The only thumbstick layout is default. You can invert the thumbstick by reversing the mouse, but there's no way to switch to legacy which is my control setup of choice. For me, this is an automatic fail for any modern first person shooter.
3291	0	a	RUN RUN, WHATEVER YOU DO, RUN! WHERE IS THE MECH? NOT HERE! THIS GAME ISNT EVEN WORTH THE $1 THAT IT COSTS AND THE TIME IT TAKES TO INSTALL. WHAT EVER YOU DO, DONT BLINK, BLINK AND YOUR BORED.
3292	0	a	Wow this game is a mess. It won't run. I've spend 45 minutes of 'play time' and have never been able to play the game.
3293	0	a	This game may have been really fun when I bought it, as it felt like a mix between Halo and turox, but it just doesn't have enough content to keep me, or my friends, interested. Only buy this if you know you are going to like it.
3294	0	a	This game is terrible, it has massive maps with nothing in them. Spawning you, at times, 5 minutes away from the objective (the only point where hostiles spawn). it is also extremely glitchy.
3295	0	a	Its like halo but with dinosaurs and hats etc. 4/10
3296	0	a	Good graphics but gameplay is too bad :/
3297	0	a	I did not like it at all. Wooden animations + bugs = massacre
3298	0	a	Good concept; sorry execution. Played for an hour and wanted out for an hour. Not recommended.
3299	0	a	costs money, bad
3300	0	a	Lousy! Difficuly to play! don't waste your time!
3301	0	a	Constant conection problems. no tutorial. I very much regret ever playing this game.
3302	0	a	While I appreciate their 'Hey, it's not as bad as the reviews say!' trailer, this game is pretty much as bad as the reviews say.
3303	0	a	cuase its ot free anymore jk
3304	0	a	not really worth it except during 90% sale
3305	0	a	Bought at release. Still garbage.
3306	0	a	Ah seh NO!!! Just like Marvel Heroes! you decide to release an update and expect me to download the aWHOL EFREAKING 2 GB INSTALL FILE AGAIN?!?!?!   AH.... SEHHHH.... NOOOOOO!!!!!!
3307	0	a	This game is abysmal. Even at $.99 its not worth it. Your better off clogging your arteries with a dollar menu cheeseburger with that money.
3308	0	a	♥♥♥♥ THIS ♥♥♥♥ IT LAGS ALOT ♥♥♥♥ THIS
3309	0	a	It doesn't seem to be a finished game, it isn't worth the price (I got it for less than a dollar).
3310	0	a	Don't buy this game, it's terrible.
3311	0	a	Ugh...
3312	0	a	Since i bought this game, like 2 weeks ago, i try to played it for the first time when i finish buying the game. Then when i try to played it it just stuck in loading and i think when its stuck its become not responding, So i waste my money for this game. that time the price was $15
3313	0	a	I wanted to like this game. i did. but the poor explanation of game modes, the very unbalanced gameplay and generally lack of any resource to explain either has made me have to not recommend this game. If the devs actually do something to help new players get into the game, i may change this but for now i have to say DO NOT GET THIS GAME! even for 99 cents its not worth it till they make a effort to explain this game to new users.
3314	0	a	This game made my physically ill, the camera is godawful.
3315	0	a	Do not believe positive reviews of this game. Nothing works right, nothing makes sense, you get stuck in between the largest of gaps, and it sure as hell ain't nothing like Turok OR Killing Floor.  It is awful and it only survives from sales.
3316	0	a	Sadly, not worth the $0.99. The positive reviews are misleading. Rely on the metacritic score.
3317	0	a	Horrible design, Takes too long to reload while being swarmed, Not a game anyone should play a rip off of Killing Floor. Killing floor is better then this in every way
3318	0	a	it is bum
3319	0	a	Would not be a bad game if you could turn the ♥♥♥♥ing t-rex roar down! I have the game damn near muted and it still is too fing loud.
3320	0	a	I got through eighteen minutes of this so called 'experience/game' I am now throwing up and was perscribed zanex, my liver has failed and my heart stopped 8.72 times. Please for the love of god save some eergy from the defribulators and skip this peice of crap title. 3/9001
3321	0	a	Supposedly vastly improved compared to how it once was, but based on the number of glitches I've encountered in a short space of time, and the garbage AI, there's still a lot this game needs to improve upon.   I wouldn't recommend this game as it is right now, but the developers seem committed and, given time, this could prove to be a very solid game.
3322	0	a	All I can say is wow! If this is an improvement, I would hate to see what this game was like before they 'fixed' it! Laggy, clipping, terrible game. Believe the bad reviews.
3323	0	a	what can i say about this pile of dino feces uhh i see why it was 86cents
3324	0	a	It's nothing spectacular. Not much information about the weapons and upgrades, barest amount of direction in what you're doing. For the base price, it is not worth it but if you can find it on sale, it's worth a few hours of entertainment if you have some friends.
3325	0	a	I didn't find this game appealing. Even for a buck.
3326	0	a	If i had a bag of T-Rex poop and this game, i'd probably eat the poop.
3327	0	a	Dude Malic. Why are you inflicting this aids on people?
3328	0	a	its ♥♥♥♥
3329	0	a	DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, its awful. I'm guessing the reviews are fake accounts from the developer. This game is one of the worst I've ever played. It is a laggy low resolution mess. The controls are unresponsive, probably due to the laggy game play, and its just well terrible. The audio is generic, the guns don't have any feeling to them, the vehicles don't feel right. Nothing has any impact, and I mean nothing. Even being stomped by a huge dinosaur just flings you across the map. You won't know when that will happen because you won't see any animation for it, so just don't get close...Also, like big guns on vehicles, well be perpared to not shoot them for about 10 seconds and then have them start shooting after you clicked your mouse button 4 or 5 times.... Basically this whole game just doesn't feel right.
3330	0	a	Lulz this game is garbage. Only cost $1.00 so there is that.
3331	0	a	meh a boring game and barely any empty survers ugh bured
3332	0	a	Don't Buy it Don't Try it!
3333	0	a	Absolutely not worth a dollar because I would never play this more than the once. There is no way the game even indicates when you damage the dinos. It seems like they released this after it was 50% complete in the dev process. DO NOT BUY THIS. Natural Selection 2 is a much better alternative to ODH with better gun and monster play that feels like a fast paced shooter should.
3334	0	a	Absoluteley terrible, but a good laugh.
3335	0	a	the opening video is the best thing to this game
3336	0	a	I can see why this game is so cheap. Its freaking horrible.
3337	0	a	Poor, thats all i have to say. The reviews looked good until you actually play. Everything is mixed up, you run out of ammo way to fast. Dont listen to the trailer or watch it. It builds you up to take you back down. I didnt play the original one so I cant imagine how bad that was. If they made any improvement it wasent seen. while i was playing proplr where just raging on how bad this game is. Once again poor game. Now I understand why it was 93% off on steam... terrible job.
3338	0	a	So,  I really wanted to like this game, I really did, however there are some blatant gameplay and design issues that made this game one of the most frustrating and least enjoyable multiplayer games I have played.  TL;DR: controls were unbearable, FOV(1st, 3rd person cameras were rough, even worse playing as a dinosaur), Some of the maps we (my dinosaur team) were getting stuck on TREES and BUSHES, completely frustrating, maps had poor gameplay flow and design, Just over all i feel the game play mechanics need a lot of love before this game should even hit the market, there's alot of things going on in this game that makes me feel like either the studio didn't playtest this internally to address obvious issues in design and gameplay, or they simply didn't follow through with fixing it.  Sorry Spiral, but please playtest the crap out of your game, and figure out your game play mechanics to support the game you're trying to make and sell.  Long version:   The first run was through a 5 man survival mode, the FOV felt wrong for it being an FPS. After a round i got somewhat accustomed to it. At some point during the second round, i got booted out to the lobby- no feedback as to why...it just happened. I immediately reconnected back to the same server (as it was still listed on the server list) and loaded to my camera/screen looking at the level..underground. The game wasn't locked up per-se, but i entered a bugged state, where no controls were responsive leaving me with to terminate the program through my processes menu.   I then tried 2 rounds of the Rampage game mode, and was surprised to find out i could play as a Dinosaur. Unfortunately i was immediately greeted upon spawning as a stegosaurus that the 3rd person Camera while playing was covered by about 2/3rds of the dinosaur character model. I literally was mostly seeing spines. I was slow as ♥♥♥♥, and had no idea where i was going or where my opponents where. I could go on and on about the issues with this game both gameplay wise and design...Even for a dollar, i could NOT convince myself to buy it, and within that time i removed my FB post to my friends seeing if they wanted to pick it.  
3339	0	a	Super buggy. Super boring. Seemed like a good idea drunk, but even at only $0.99 I weep for every lost penny.
3340	0	a	This is still ♥♥♥♥, played this a couple times, its plays nothign like the videos, save your time
3341	0	a	I went in expecting little and was not surprised.  Gameplay: One-sided. Humans are often spawn-camped because the dinosaurs can 3-shot you. The only class worth half a breath is the recon, where you can use stealth to confuse your enemy. Otherwise, consider the dino's kits (8 or more classes compared to 3) more useful. Though, you can count on the dinosaurs to handle like a tennis ball coated in Elmer's glue. Even the raptors turn like a buick. Also, no built-in auto-balancing for teams. It would make sense if, say, 5 humans vs 3 dinos, but there's no regulator. Interface: Okay, I guess. Everything can be found somewhere. Not amazing, not terrible. Works, though. But it should... it's technically a 'release'... right? Graphics &amp; Sound: I read somewhere on another review that the guns sounded like shrill shreeky something somethings. Yeah, they're kind of obnoxious. I had 'hit marker' sounds turned on and I couldn't even tell when they were going off. Really felt kind of low-grade from the sound quality. Graphics? Nothing to shake a stick at. Environment is 'arena-esque', but plenty of foliage. Sprinting 'depth of field' is horribly proportioned. and overall, smaller things can get lost in the background 'haze'. Multiplayer: Imbalanced, clunky, and unpolished. Lack of damage feedback or immediate training/descriptions left me more to explore and see how horribly ineffective anything was, rather than go in with at least a baseline understanding of strengths/weaknesses. Stability: Yeah, servers are crashing randomly (don't know if it just means the host left or something) and I tried to play solo play and immediately crashed. I decided at that point that it wasn't worth my time.  [[Would not recommend.]] May be worth looking back at when it gets patched a few times, but I don't believe in supporting game companies that ask their player base for a high amount of coping with shortcomings at release and then making up for it later. There's no need to play with an emotional investment as well as a financial one.
3342	0	a	Honestly this game is bad, I played 2 games and whilst i had some fun and some aspects like the vechiles or large gun selection but ALL that is meaningless when the game has HUGE holes. Visually this game has loads to love and they have added a lot of content but the weapons don't feel good and animations aren't smooth, try standing still and you will see the raptors slowlly go for a munch when they stand infront of you and then all that happens is the screen gets a little red. Compare that to a game like COD or maybe a good COOP survival like Killing Floor, the gun sounds in those games feel meaty and powerful and when someone sttacks you the whole animation flows, people don't stop moving and then move one arm with a knife whilst the rest of their body stays perfectly still, that is what the dinosaurs do. When you take damage in COD the screen would shake, you would hear grunts and a quick splash of red on the screen in the form of blood would appear. this is why this game feels so dull to me, no wieght to actions. Also mechanicly its dull, with dino's that just run at you and then a couple tanky ones where is the strategic puzzle? I dont know, it just seems to be shooting or driving.
3343	0	a	this game is so so so bad!!!
3344	0	a	this game is decent, not good though. there are some glitches i'v seen on the first online game i did, and it was so ♥♥♥♥ing bad that we had to quit the game and restart. i only can recommend this game if it is on sale.
3345	0	a	Saddle up for the mediocre experience of a life time! Round up some friends, hunt some mentally challenged dinosaurs or compete with friends to see who is better with the staple gun.
3346	0	a	Please dont waste your money in this game. The mechanics sucks...if playing as a soldier sucks, playing as a dinosaur really...REALLY SUCKS. Save your money!
3347	0	a	Terrible ♥♥♥♥ing game. Worst ♥♥♥♥ing game I've ever ♥♥♥♥ing played.
3348	0	a	Worse than bad rats.
3349	0	a	I have not seen a game with such bad animations in a while. Also the menus are glitched for me, so any model of my character/etc is vertically stretched and mostly offscreen. The HUD is entirely unintuitive, and I have been constantly disconnected. I can't critique the gameplay, since I have only barely been able to interact with the game, given the issues.  That being said, I've only played this game for a very short amount of time, so maybe with further attempts I will find redeemable qualities to it.
3350	0	a	you will get more entertainment from burning money than playing this ♥♥♥♥
3351	0	a	Played this game while it was free. Only got as far as level 8. For a free game it's not too bad I suppose. It sports very dull environments, buggy textures, weak vehicles, repetative gameplay, and not really anything redeeming about it. While it's on sale I think $0.99 is asking too much, there are better free to play shooters on here. For the full $14.99 price you would be better off passing on this completely. I assume the free time and dollar price is to attract people so they can advertise that they are going to be kickstarting a new game. They probably should put more work into this one before going on to another one.
3352	0	a	This game...gave me cancer....soo very very bad.
3353	0	a	It's so bad it's good. It really could have been so much more, but it just fell short of most of those goals. Also an SOS to anyone out there: I have 2 copies of the game sitting in my inventory looking all filthy and stuff. If anyone, ANYONE wants to get the game for free, it's better than spending $15 or even $1.
3354	0	a	What??? You have to buy even your basic gear. Not even once.
3355	0	a	awful glitchy animations maps are too big and repetitive i would even say it isn't worth a dollar which is the price it goes on sale for every few weeks AI is terrible i got stuck in objects
3356	0	a	ME: 'Yeah, it has some negative reviews, but for a Dollar how could I go wrong....'  I could justify with a reason for every single cent of my dollar, why this game IS NOT worth it. I don't know how I can look my friends in the eyes again after buying a 4 pack and giving my other copies to them, I would have been better off ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in a box and giving it to them as gifts. Even for free, the few minutes of your life this game will take away from you forever is too great of a price to pay.  Assuming, like me, you DON'T like clunky piece of ♥♥♥♥ games with terrible graphics, no AI, horrible maps, bad glitches and a terrible concept that offer NO enjoyment for the player on any level, even as a joke, I am going to go ahead and recommend you DON'T GET THIS. If I hadn't already wasted too much of my life on this game, I would detail all of it's shortfalls here for you, but I dont have the hours or patience it would require.  If you do like any or all of the things mentioned above, then get this game, it has all of them in abundance and you will not be disappointed.
3357	0	a	i love the dinosaurs and the jetpacks also
3358	0	a	laggy, cheaply made, and poorly designed gaming mechanics. it still deserves its metascore.
3359	0	a	Do you like seeing Dinosaurs?  Well if you're going to play this game you better ♥♥♥♥ing like seeing dinosaurs because literally everything else about it is ♥♥♥♥.
3360	0	a	It feels liek one of those shoot em up games at an arcade. The graphics are definatly NOT next gen. But I will give it the credit of being an independant game. Its not bad, it just needs some work. first priority should be graphics. Then work on the enemy AI's.
3361	0	a	There's a reason they let us play this game for free.......
3362	0	a	WOW. What a steaming pile of ♥♥♥♥! I mean... WOW. As I write this, It's on sale for a dollar, and I can't even justify 100 pennies toward this mess. Just a hot mess. Garbled, unattractive textures, really ♥♥♥♥-poor gunplay, the least threatening dinosaurs you can imagine (save for the Compsognathuses which are impossible the see until they are nibbling at you knees [and, IRL, you could just stomp on these things and kill them by the way]). It is an amazing hot mess. Do not be suckered in by the low price; the game is garbage of the highest echelons.
3363	0	a	This Game is ♥♥♥♥  Graphics are bad, gameplay is broken, don´t waste your money on this game not even 0.99 dlls.
3364	0	a	This game is really buggy for me, I won't even pay $1 for it, LOL. Also when I played as a dinosaur it really sucked, I just kept dying. The game was confusing too, I didnt quite get it.
3365	0	a	Games garbage. I clicked to find a game, and it couldn't find any servers. I clicked play solo, it wouldn't stop waiting for other players...
3366	0	a	This would be really fun as a 90's arcade rail shooter. But it's not.
3367	0	a	From what I've played on the free weekend, I wouldn't buy this game, even for a dollar (I wonder if their Robocop reference was intentional). It may have been playable before this event, but now and probably later, given that it's $1 (and 1 whatever everywhere else, because devs can't work out exchange rates) the community will die. The controls as a dinosaur are nuts and really hard to master, because it's 3rd person and has very lengthy attack animations. As a human, the controls and gameplay are simple class and perk/upgrade based sci-fi FPS, with jetpacks and healing guns and cloaks and all that stuff. The guns are pretty fun but don't FEEL very varied in their own class, one pistol is like another ect. The powers are really fun to use, especially the jetpack, which got me out, and into, a lot of scrapes. The game itself is pretty hard, and it makes sense to be like that. If you're up against raptors or whatever, you'll easily take them alone, like it were a zombie game. But if you're faced with anything bigger, it's VERY hard to solo them, and (on the server I played on) dinos were crazily unbalanced, most were going for T-Rex with a few as pterosaurs to provide aerial support. For some reason, even when I'd jetpacked up a mountain to hide from the T-Rex jaws, the two ganging up on me could still attack me, despite a large gap between myself and their faces. The biggest issue here was the lack of teamwork. Like I said, most creatures are hard to take down above the size of a raptor. Here you NEED to work as a unit. This makes sense but the game itself isn't very conducive to teamwork, and what little support there is to rally your teammates goes ignored while they camp and fail the objective. Dinos don't have this limitation, though, because they can solo almost anything because they're ♥♥♥♥ing dinosaurs.  The human classes are cool, but the dino classes are dreadful, with little variation on the ground based dinosaurs, going only from small up to big.  All in all, this feels like Tribes, Halo, or some other sci-fi FPS, but then the devs threw in dinosaurs, because the dinos are really badly implemented.  If you want a dino game, I'd recommend the superior Primal Carnage (when it's on a sale, though, seeing as it's got a slow dev cycle and only has two game modes).
3368	0	a	NO NO NO This is one of the worst games i have played on pc. it lags so bad that it was under 30 fps on a hinght end pc. no dont buy it.
3369	0	a	The game doesnt even work, and when it does it seems to demand more specs that what the creator and steam page suggest, boring piece of garbage not worth even a dolar, unplayable even if it was always free
3370	0	a	cant belive that ppl are buying and playing this game
3371	0	a	Just,no. I played fo about 2 minutes to realise that this game has the worst animations in a game i have ever see(considering the technology avalable) aswell as there is not one thing in the game that hasn't been done in other games better such as the fight to survive(borderlands 1-2) just don't waste your money or time on this i got it for 99p and I'm dissapointed! I've reviewed some games that are bad, but not bad enough for me to give them a not-recommended rating but this has nothing positive to redeem its self.
3372	0	a	Tried the game. graphics are ok. mechanics are decent but overall was disappointing.
3373	0	a	Played this today with friends cause it looked interesting. I'd like to say it was fun, but this headache I now have wouldn't approve of it. The game gives the premise of having to fight dinosaurs with futuristic technology(mostly guns). I guess there are other things you can use too, but who's got time for that when you have 5 raptors magically spawning from your ♥♥♥♥♥♥? The A.I. controlled dinos vary in how intelligent they'll be, from packs of raptors lining up to be point farmed, to the exceptionally gifted artillery t-rex. Also, raptors cannot jump. Being a raptor, you should be able to climb a not very steep wall to get a camper, but no, eat some bullets. I think they're aware of how bad some dinos suck, because they threw in a flying one with a bomb on its back. Whoopedy doo. Now that I think about it, a t-rex probably put it on it, seeing as they're so precise. Sucky as they were though, playing a human was 10X worse. There's a confusing downing system where you shoot dinos to get back up like you're some vampire of dinosaurs. The best part about the down system is when you get eaten, and I'm not being sarcastic when I say that. Oh and, on top of everything, as a stegosaurus (the giant thing with spines on it's tail) you can't even smack things with your tail. Seriously?   I'm sure there will be people who've played this game since release and they will list all the things that are good about the game. But if you're considering paying money to play this, I'd suggest saving your couple bucks for something better.    tl;dr: Playing as a dino is the most fun you'll get out of this, and even then you'll wonder if the developers did anything more than look up the pictures of the dinosaurs they included.  
3374	0	a	I wish i had spent the 0.99€ on anything else. Really. This is not a good game. Do not buy it.
3375	0	a	Such a stupid game.THERE ARE NOT EVEN RECOIL,AND THOSE GUNS ARE JUST AS TERRIBLE AS IT COULD EVER BE.WTF is a M40 magnum?If you wanna make a ficitional game,then make it all fictional,WTH is actually in the devs' stupid mind?And those tanks,those vehicles just look fxxkin' stupid!And it feel ALL THE SAME when you drive it,the only difference between those vehicals is they have different appreance!The graphic and the special effects are also terrible,it look like tech from 2000!Don't ever buy this game!
3376	0	a	Steam sales can be dangerous. Bought it for 0.99 and still it isn't worth it.
3377	0	a	 Orion:Dino Beatdown  recieved alot of negative attention during its opening week; connection woes, crashes, hitboxes that didn't fit the models, lack of longevity and just overall janky-ness in gameplay and menus. Spiral Game Studios rebranded to  Orion:Dino Horde  some time ago.  Today(Feb 2014, some 10 months after the release) the connectivity and menu problems are still here just intermittent. if you have attempted or achieved to connect to one server already and return back to the menu, the refresh button does not seem to function. Connecting to a server is mostly an endless  Waiting for Server  nonsense -- even if the player count is at max. The game still waits rather than timing you out or proc'ing a  Server is Ful  error -- Killing the app and re-entering seems to be the only way to get more recent server data. Killing the app also resolves the issue of the endless waiting or the  Server is Full  error not proc'ing.  The preformance on the other hand, has been considerablely improved. The off-chance I connect to a server the frame rate starts high and stable, beyond wave 6 the framerate drops by progressive margines, though it is to be expected with so many entities at once on one screen. Not encountered one  Ran Out of Memory  scenario or crash.  The latency tolerance and the general operating of the game servers was improved, they are more consistent, shots hit and miss more reliably. No more shooting at a Dino on your client and on everyone else's you are shooting at scotch-mist or a little to the right of the Dino in front of you. Dinos, other players and yourself no longer warp around.  The longevity is the meaty issue.  Less than 30 game lobby/servers at what I consider peak times, namely after 7PM.   Not much content or game modes that feel distinct or fresh. Some of the game modes have been lifted whole-sale from L4D and because of the janky nature of Dino Horde they are less satisfying. The one that I enjoyed is Survival, which is your standard Horde-mode with a few twists. Rounds are finished by killing certain Dinos and every so often completing an objective, but they boiling down to  Go here for a bit  or  Interact with X object , when they are completed it snaps back to kill X amount of Dinos. Ending a wave is similar to Killing Floor, what with the money and shops.  Finally, the Janky-ness. Jank is inevitable in software, in games they sometimes add to the charm or even comic relief for a title. In Dino Horde, however, they exacerbate the poor/odd design decisions and delivers a raw, unpolished experience. One notable oddity is the interplay between class roles and map design: The Support has a medic tool, Recon has a stealth ability but the Assault has jumpjets. The Assault is easily by far  thee  go to role, just jet up out of reach of the Dinos or even perch on otherwise out of bounds terrain. No point in having a medic, noone gets hurt and no point in cloaking, noone needs to run away. In addition the AI and their pathing is a joke -- They will pursue one player through a crowd of players that aren't running away. They'll tottle off in weird directions or clip their heads though rocks trying to get to the players ontop instead of trying to kill players still on the ground -- These three things form a mind-numbingly, dull game, with little fair challenge. There have been situation where I was surronded by ~6 velociraptors and my health went from full to nothing in no time at all. Other situation where I was stood under a TRex with dozens of velociraptors being unable to take a slither of health off me. Generally players are happy perching on rocks to aviod these issues. So Orion:Dino Horde breeds complacency for one's own kill count from terrian out bounds to the Dinos.  Player movement is fairly slow, there is little of interest between the bases (so alot of dead space) and the maps are fairly large. These three things make sprinting from one side of the map to the other aggravatingly tedious -- Just a side note, there is also no sense of being hunted. There will either be a complete spawn-spam of Dinos in a small area which looks very gamey or not a Dino in site. When some Dinos do catch up to you, while sprinting, they form an orderly queue one by one. The one lead Dino will not leap or over take you, it will just tickle your back -- You will need to sprint those distances to get your Objective or secure a vehicle. There is a personal teleport to the spawn zone, but it goes unused as it  only  takes you to the spawn zone. Giving us a choice of pre-set locations to teleport to would be a better solution. Spawning a bike on my head or a hoverboard under my feet,  Unreal Tournament 3 style , could be other possiblities.  The vehicles drive weird. They're no GTA4 wonky driving physics but they're not as robust as something like Halo (which seems to be the  inspiration  for Orions vehicles). When you are on foot, you will sometimes clip through speeding vehicles that drive toward you, sometimes you'll be gently pushed aside and other times you'll go flying. The Vehicles are a necessary evil due to the fire power and lack of ammo considerations, I say 'evil' because the driving physics in gerenal are too inconsistent and minimalist. In addition they have papar armour and present at bigger target. Being in a vehicle can be more hazardous than its worth.   FINAL GRIEVANCES  +Multiplayer only with  a tiny population.  +No instructive information and counterintuitive - Nothing is explained, the rules and systems are learnt by trail and error. Using vehicles to ram the large Dinos, for eg. If we can damage and even kill the smaller Dinos logically we should be able to deal damage to the bigger ones, that is not the case however, they seem immune to collision damage and only serves to get the players inside killed instantly. Other eg's: How many peaks can we have at once, which weapons fit into which slot, many new players ask how to replenish ammo. It's quite suspect that one of the  hints  on a loading screen is 'If you see a new player, help them out', to me this says the Developers can't be bothered explaining their game.  +The guns have no substance - They generate little recoil. Reload and/or firing animations make the weapons seem lighter than air. Sound like you are firing baby pop-guns or banging a wooden spoon against a tin can.  +No sense of impact - The Dino's and Player's melee is just a tickle that ripes off health. The larger Dinos have a stomp ability which sends players flying but they animate like they are idly lowering their leg.  +Nothing visceral - Which in a Dinosaur franchise  should  be integral, the moments that we  should  remember is the time that the clever girl out foxed us and riped open our ribcage, not whipping their noses on our armour like they've come down with a fever. +And so, the final nail in the coffin for me. There is no theme of this Dinosaur game being a Dinosaur game. No gore and gruesome sites. No sense of scale from the large Dinos as their tonnage of biomass stomp around. No sense of fear or impending doom. No cunning or sneaky behaviour from the smaller carnivores. No natural enemy states, the TRex and Velociraptors should want to eat everything not just the marines in tin cans.   ORION: Dino Horde  is essentially a Sub-par First Person Shooter. Filled with brainless zombies in different shapes and  sizes. With no meaningful Co-op systems or mechanics. There is potential, not going to lie there were some fun moments   (because playing with friends)   to be had but the janky, unpolished nature would pull you out of them. Just needed the past 10 months to refine rather than stagnate. Not recommended!
3378	0	a	These Positive reviews have got me perplexed. This game is flawed in too many ways to have a good time. Truely, the animations are bad, the gameplay is sub-par. The only truely good this about this game is playing with friends is fun, and the graphics are nice and sleek, but truely not a game I recommend, it will get boring and really not worth a positive review.
3379	0	a	the server conection times take forever and the gameplay isnt all that, the weapon system kinda sucks as well
3380	0	a	This game is a piece of ♥♥♥♥ ok.
3381	0	a	FOV locked under 90 degrees, the apparent 'Antialising' options do nothing to prevent the jagged lines nearly *everywhere*, lack of servers, and while attempting to join any open servers it was impossible (it wouldn't even bother to give me an error message unless it was a full server.  People say it's less buggy, and it doesn't seem buggy to be honest, but there are some extremely annoying 'features' of the game that make it hard to play- You're given 60 seconds between waves in one mode to get equipment and weapons for the next wave, but the equipment and weapons are placed over 30 seconds away so you have little or no time to choose what you want. The UI is fairly confusing and almost ugly in comparison with other titles that are *free to play*.  If it's full price, don't buy it. When it's $1/£1 then it's your choice. It's a good thing they made the game free to try out this week because I was tempted to buy it.
3382	0	a	Meh. that's how I felt playing this game for a while. Controls felt a little loose. oh-hum powerups and weapons. and seriously.. I need a whole clip of ammo to bring down ONE mob? So the balance isn't their either. Just a lack-luster game that's gonna try to nickle and dime you to death. 
3383	0	a	Game is very buggy while even just trying to get into a game cant connec to servers buttons not working nothing but buggy crap.
3384	0	a	This game sucks balls, and let me tell you why, 90% of the game is about sprinting to the reactor, sprinting to the implants station, sprinting to the armory. It's just running and running and running. Quite honestly, nothing like halo, where there was clear objectives, a cool Cortana Narrator, and a map that made sense.  The graphics are blurry, even at the highest settings, and the weapons take forever to reload. Not to mention, you can't sell weapons, it just unlocks a dozen of 'em that you can use. Maybe I was wrong? Right.. right? Nope. Still right, once you get vehicles they move incredibly slow, probably designed for granny newb players who've never played a racing game to save their life.  Is it worth $15? Is it worth $1? You decide.. they'd have to remake a ton of things to balance the game, and re-texture all the enemies, and add in more sound clips. Unlikely. If you want a good video game I suggest you drop this one, and go for Far Cry 3, much better in my honest opinion.
3385	0	a	Stupid and barley worth the $2.99 I paid for the 4 pack. Buggy, feels like a bad arcade game with the stupid voices, controls suck, in game purchases, nothing good really.
3386	0	a	This game is suppose to be much improved... Its terrible STILL!!!!! Not worth .99 cents. Couldn't get people to join my game they just sit in my lobby unable to do anything. The generator wouldn't even activate because the area to activate is buggy. Not sure who posted those positive reviews... Must be the devs or friends of the devs.
3387	0	a	To be honest.. this game is ♥♥♥♥.
3388	0	a	You wont like it if you're a dinophile (like me). You will like it, however, if you love sci-fy weapons, surviving in team against near infinite hordes of bad guys and shooting stuff while defending a generater that's about 300m away from the rest of the base.
3389	0	a	No, don't buy this game. Broken mechanics, Bad Graphics - This game is just crap.
3390	0	a	terrible game quality plays as if its stuck in an alpha dont even waste money on the sale price its just a bad game in general there are so many other good options go with the other ones this is a bad game the metascore did not lie. 
3391	0	a	
3392	0	a	I played it for free and still feel ripped off
3393	0	a	don't buy it
3394	0	a	It definitely wasn't at all what I was expecting. I thought it was going to be something like Natural Selection. And the BIGGEST PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THE GAME IS THE FACT THAT MY SCREEN RESOLUTION ISN'T AN OPTION IN THE SETTINGS. I find it annoying since the game doesn't look as good as displayed in the videos. And right now, I don't believe it is even worth the $1 it is being offered for.
3395	0	a	Awful just awful not even worth $1.00
3396	0	a	This is an OK game
3397	0	a	Crashes, doesn't terminate on exit, fails to connect.. looks like a kindergartner pieced it together with construction paper and glue sticks.
3398	0	a	I was excited to play this game but once I started playing I was very disappointed. The game has a awesome concept but lacks in many ways.  1 . The que to play with other players takes along time. People often drop off and you are left sitting there for along time. I waiting for over 30 mins and still did not get to play with other players. 2. The control functions are not laid out very well. Very inefficent for combat.  3. The pictures that shows the games seems to be glossed over to make it look better than what it really is.   
3399	0	a	Its not that great of a game graphics suck and so does gameplay
3400	0	a	BAD BAD BAD BAD and don't buy it, EVER.
3401	0	a	Not fun at all. Too many bugs.
3402	0	a	If you like Halo 2 graphics, terrible menus, awful HUDs, and terrible animations then this game is for you.
3403	0	a	This game is a broken peice of garbage that isnt worth its 99 cent pricetag. DO NOT BUY
3404	0	a	Just boring, uninteresting, and not worth 1 dollar
3405	0	a	Better than COD Ghosts, still ♥♥♥♥ tho
3406	0	a	I didn't play it for very long. That should tell you somthing.
3407	0	a	Gave it a try... Just too low quality for me. Reminds me PlanetSide 2 . But it worth the money if you love the genre.
3408	0	a	God, what a frustrating experience. The game has a terrible difficulty scale. You go from running over dinosaurs with no trouble at all in one round, and then you find yourself struggling to stay alive against a tricerotops and a T-rex on the other side of the map, meaning that the stuff you bought after slowly building up your funds over the course of several rounds is all gone. Once you manage to survive one of those rounds, you go back to mopping up little dinosaurs.  The weapons are not bad, but aiming down the sights is pretty much useless, as I've experienced. The AI is also pretty stupid, as the dinosaurs mindlessly run at you as soon as the game starts. This is the sort of thing I'd expect from a game that was released ten years ago. The game is obviously old fashioned; the graphics look like something from 2007 that got touched up a little with some motion blur.  Overall, there's very little to say about this game. It's very forgettable, and once you've played it for ten minutes, you've seen it all. Mann vs. Machine from Team Fortress 2 is better than this, and it's free. My friend bought this game for me, but I still couldn't imagine spending $1 on this game, let alone $15. If you have 99 cents burning a hole in your Steam funds, give this game a shot. But once the sale ends, do not even think about shelling $15 dollars on this game. It is simply not worth it.
3409	0	a	its a really cool game just online only and supper bugy if you run a movement script it will run for 2 seconts and then if u pause it will never stop running also no tutorials for this game :( if none of these bother u its an awsome co op game might be fixed later
3410	0	a	Its meh... definetelly better than the given meta score, but not by much. It is really repetitive but would be fun with friends. Like most games, i would recommend buying when it is cheap since it probably is not worth more than 5 dollars.
3411	0	a	Playing this game is like sticking your ♥♥♥♥ in a blender.
3412	0	a	wow, absolutley terrible framerate, even with all settings set to low. I want my money back.
3413	0	a	I tried this game just to see how bad it was... and i have to say, it would have had some great potential if the develpers worked more on it before releasing it ( -feels *very* Unfinished/Rushed).. plus the servers are awful and the lag sucks big time.. but in my opinion, most of the rumors are true: this game is rather awful in its current state. hopefully one day there will be enough patches added to it to make it somewhat playable. (wouldn't doubt if it went F2P soon)
3414	0	a	This game can crash, it didn't work on my laptop, but it works on my desktop. It's pretty temperamental. It's not a really good game. It's a grindfest for achievements, there's no dino AI to make it more exciting or forcing you to change your tactics. It's pretty mindnumbing but at least it's better than X-Blades (yeah, don't bother with that crap). The graphics aren't good. It could have been better. It leaves a lot for improvements.
3415	0	a	This game is horrible in every aspect. The gameplay, sounds, graphics. The game its not fun in anyway. Game lags like hell, you can't even play properly its like you're playing with 500ms ping with your character rubberbanding. Very weak sound effects. You don't even see the muzzle flash coming from the weapon to the point that you ask yourself 'Is it firing?'.  
3416	0	a	the game is lacking some key aspects that being..... graphics from the last 6 bagillion years and game mechanics from the past 10
3417	0	a	Damn, if this is the new and improved version of the game I'd hate to have seen how bad it was origially. A mess. don't bother
3418	0	a	I'd rather play Brink than this game ever again.
3419	0	a	Like Skyrim with guns! or Halo, with dinosaurs! and lo-res textures...
3420	0	a	As of 23/04/2014, ORION: Dino Horde was in offer in Steam for 0.99$. Still. Don't. Worth it.  I had my doubts because a lot of people is saying ''After the update it got better!'' and ''Metacritic changed the 3 score to 8!''. If they did I think it should have stayed in 3. The game is full of bugs. Characters getting stuck, problems at shooting (With the important fact that when you shoot there are no signs of knowing if any single bullet hit your target OR anything at all. No lights, no bullets, you just hear you are shooting and see your gun move as a dying chicken). Chat user interface is in primitive state.  You may want to risk in buying it for ''further cool updates''. But sadly, it just don't look like it's going to evolve. If this game is worth 15$ And you are planning on buying it on 0.99$ anyway. I ask you to take your time and download the demo so you can see it with your own eyes. Otherwise take a look on a gameplay review.  It look's like a win deal. It's not. This game is not even half-way and it doesn't seem It's going anywhere.  
3421	0	a	Let me handle this. This game is just... the worst. The metacritic score of 30 is even too generous. I was tricked by the other people writing positive reviews about this game. I picked it up when it was just $0.99 and I still feel ripped off.
3422	0	a	Don't buy this; can't connect to games and even if you can, gameplay is terrible.
3423	0	a	Tried if from free week... Animations are very bad, and sometimes the dinosaurs (the other team) cannot hit you when you are below them.  Does not feel polished at all.
3424	0	a	Horrible. Terrible graphics. Annoying gameplay (sprinting for 30 seconds just to go get an upgrade between waves, only to have no time to look at the upgrades and make a comparison). And when I tried to exit the game it stuck running in steam. So badly that even after ending the Steam process (the only way i could close steam at that point) and restarting it, the game is still stuck running.   Not worth $.99, or even $.009.
3425	0	a	The worst thing I have ever played! Take Killing Floor, then put it into a really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Halo setting and mix in some dinosaurs. After one hour in a basement with a 1987 Apple Macintosh, you get ORION: Dino Horde
3426	0	a	This game is trash, sorry im sure this game has improved alot compared to what it used ot be. The fact there is no tutorial and you have to learn as you go is bad for new players. or how about how unresponsive the dinos are i played alot of this during the free weekend. the humans just dominate the dinos i feel this game has alot of potential but its not using it i do not recomend at this time
3427	0	a	Wow this game is total ♥♥♥♥e! I wasted $3 on the 4 pack. No one would ever play this game with me and if they were sad enough to do it I think i'd have to unfriend them.
3428	0	a	I have to admit it this game is among the worst game ever DONT BUY THIS GAME there are almost no server in multiplayer when you try to join a server it will say 'failed to connect' and this game physic is terrible
3429	0	a	With graphics that seem to be decades out of date, the gameplay is choppy and boring. It was impossible for me to join a server, I went to the website and could not even make an account. I think 0.99 for this game is about 100 times what it is worth. Will not play again, would of been a great game 15 years ago, but times have changed and this has not.
3430	0	a	I like the idea, I mean who doesn't want more games with dinosaursin them, but the programming is just horrible. Haven't tried lan yet but online it has awful netcode issues so it feels like you're playing with a medium or high ping, no matter what hardware or connection you have, and the dinosaurs move very static.
3431	0	a	I know i played the game for a short amount of time but god the game is terrible and a reasone i played it not that much because it kept crashing alot over 25 times to me dont buy it i thought it would be a nice dino game :/
3432	0	a	Got this for $1 on steam and felt it was an absolute steal. After playing a good days worth with some friends, I couldn't help but feel that there is so much more missing... I absolutely enjoyed having a trex rock up and try tip my vehicle over (reached to my JP nostalgia) and then having to deal with a trex and a spinosaur, it had me convinced that it was definitely worth the buy. I couldn't recommend this game to a friend for anything more than $5-$7 dollars as it still feels like the game was only partially fleshed out. In saying that, the concept is great, the combat has a nice flow, the first few fights with large dinosaurs are exciting, however it becomes very limited in the dinosaur diversity after a while.   Although I've read into the criticisms against ORION, I believe that my enjoyability in the game isn't based of the designers themselves but instead based off the product that they push out. I hope the developers take a positive approach to the gaming communities reaction and produce a game that I could safely recommend to fellow gamers and know they would enjoy it as much as I have.
3433	0	a	Don't buy this game.  Gameplay is bad. Graphics is good, if you can max it, but the game is so badly optimized. The metascore does not lie.
3434	0	a	This game would get a better review from me If the gameplay wasn't so incredibly bad. Everything from the weapons having 3 sound effects from each class, either sped up or slowed down. to the AI that has zero tact at all. Controls are hiddeous. The list goes on and on. Don't trust the screenshots, this has been super doctored, looks like garbage even for 2012 standards. Fantastic concept, terrible execution. I give it a reluctant 4/10 waste of HD space.
3435	0	a	While it has Dinosaurs that doesn't save it from being a bad game.
3436	0	a	I don't know what else I expected for $1
3437	0	a	
3438	0	a	This game is ♥♥♥♥
3439	0	a	Pros:  -Nice looking atmosphere  -Easy to pick up  -You get to play as a dinosaur!  Cons:  -Boring and repetetive combat  -If you've seen one dinosaur, you've seen them all. They act they same just different sizes  -Glitches a plenty  -Weapons feel weak   -Game is way to easy to pick up, if you can aim you can win  -T Rex flipping a superheavy tank over a mountain with it's nose  -Vehicles are useless once the enemies get too close  -Dinosaurs in the snow would freeze to death; they should have added something different  -Several versions of the same weapons are not cool just lacking in creativity  -Devs know nothing about dinosaurs  My rating would have to be 4 / 10
3440	0	a	♥♥♥♥♥iest game to ever be on steam
3441	0	a	Despite the generous sale, that brought the game down to 99 cents for quite a while, this game isn't even worth that.  The horrendous gunplay is the one thing that will really put you off. Shooting anything is just not fun, especially when this weird effect makes the models look like 2D sprites upclose. Throw in the fact that the kick is either non-existant, poorly animated, or out of control and unrealistic, and you're not going to have much fun. This game is about shooting dinosaurs, and shooting dinosaurs in this game isn't something that you can do for a while before wanting to play something else with solid gunplay, like Insurgency.  The guns just feel so weird, nothing makes them feel powerful or fun to use. If you want a wave-based survival game, play Killing Floor, it is a lot better, just without dinosaurs.
3442	0	a	not as cool as it looks
3443	0	a	It's as bad as you've heard it is. Hilariously, poorly optimized graphics, clunky controls; the AI is spectacular, though, and do a great job of single-mindedly hunting you down like the dog you are. Definitely a team game, but good luck finding someone who'll play it with you.
3444	0	a	Rather boring game, doesnt worth the price
3445	0	a	2/5 stars, and I'm being generous with that score just because it has dinosaurs in it....   Not a great game, I had high hopes for this one, but it was frankly a dissapointment, $15 was way to much, wish I'd gotten on that $1 sale.  Human gameplay is meh, nothing much really to say about it, controls feel weird to me, they feel like COD. The dinosaur gameplay in my opinion leaves much to be desired. When playing as a dinosaur you may aswell just use either trex, triceratops, or deinosuchus, any other class just dies in a couple hits or is a remodel of one of the above just with less abilities. Playing as a dinosaur in Orion Dino Horde it isn't fun, if what your looking for is playing as a dinosaur than I wouldn't recommend this game for you, something more along the lines of Primal Carnage or DinoDDay is more dinosaur gameplay oriented.   All in all its a reasonably funny game, especially running over dinosaurs (and occasionally teammates) with vehicles, but that being said this game is really only good for a laugh or two with friends. If you don't find going into a broken game with friends and goofing around for lols fun, than go buy Primal Carnage or DinoDDay for a dinosaur FPS/TPS.
3446	0	a	It isnt the best dino survival game online is not very good , online servers are laggy as hell so sadly no i do not recommend this game :P
3447	0	a	I had such high hopes for Orion since I first saw it back on the Source engine.  Since then, it has changed to UE3 (to my dismay) and has gone through a perpetual cycle of lies, deceit, and failed promises.  Some of those broken promises have been delivered upon, but myself and many others feel it is too little too late.  The game still suffers many flaws and just simply isn't what it was initially teased to be.  Can it be fun? Sure, get it on sale and it is worth a few dollars.  Will I buy from Spiral again? That is something that only time will tell.
3448	0	a	There are bad games.....Then there is Dino Horde......Whole new level....
3449	0	a	only one reason i bought is the price was only 0.99 or 1.99. i don't suggest ou but it for the original price, cause it's kind of boring and not good for the picture. I feel disappointed for the models of the dinosaur.
3450	0	a	just the worsts
3451	0	a	Terrible game , dont be tricked into buying this.
3452	0	a	No.  When you rip animations from Halo 1, you know there is going to be a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ problem. It's pathetic, lazy, and downright ugly just to look at.  0/10.
3453	0	a	The only reason for me to play it is collecting the rest of trading cards ...Don't buy this game!】
3454	0	a	I am probably going to get ♥♥♥♥ on for this review but i feel like this is needed  This game is just bad.
3455	0	a	Who would pay 14.99 for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥ game such as this???!?!?!?!
3456	0	a	there is 10 mins that I can never get back.... such bad game.. wow.....much hate....
3457	0	a	this game is a finaky 1 thats for shur this review is 2 parts 1 i like the game and the mechanics it employs its fun for what it is like a dinosour killing floor but with how meny bugs there are and the fact that it crashs a lot no i would not recamend it at this time if the dev can see this i would recamend he try to fix this game asap its more buggy a game then some of the pre alpha test games i play this is a good game its just to buggy to be thoroly enjoyable at this time unless forse closeing games and restarting them is fun to u .
3458	0	a	You know, I'm not surprised it went on sale for one dollar, it is that bad.
3459	0	a	Just so bad... thats probably why it was $1 for so long
3460	0	a	Do NOT buy this game!   The gunplay is horrible the dinosaur A.I is messed up and even though i have a fairly strong computer, it still lagged whenever I did anything  In short that Metacritic review is spot on, and this is utter tripe.
3461	0	a	Never again
3462	0	a	Great game for $0.99 not for 14 bucks... 
3463	0	a	:/ not worth for 15$ unless you fix this f*cking crash from the start! i don't recommend this ♥♥♥♥!
3464	0	a	The main idea is great, I mean you could pick a T Rex or a Pterodactyle and attack humans. That's fun. But, despite nice graphics for the end of previous century this game have an horrible gameplay. It's really a pain in the *** to fight in it, even with human faction. Weapon are not good neather. The maps configuration and possibilities are not good, but not that bad. I'm used to CS, maybe that's why i don't liked this one, but honnestly if you like good FPS, GO FAR AWAY!  I know this is a small or a independant game, bla bla bla but it's a shame to waste such a original idea whith that gameplay. Devloppers should work harder next time.
3465	0	a	Its like having a high ping the entire time... Dinosaurs are not fun to fight like you would think..... THIS GAME IS TRASH...... I wont play it even for free......
3466	0	a	Purchased it during the $1 promotion. I can't say much bad about it for being a dollar at the time. I wouldn't really pay $15 for the game, though.
3467	0	a	Its pretty bad. I couldnt figure out how to buy ammo, and it constantly goes into slow motion. But ♥♥♥♥, it was 99 cents.
3468	0	a	don't buy this game its gawd horrible, waiting over a year or longer to play the dinos look like they are projections graphics are horrible.
3469	0	a	ugh. i bought this as a low cost shooter, with no expectations beyond the 'single-player' feature listed on the Steam page.   It might be single player if you like wandering around a multiplayer map alone shooting the same six dinos over and over. With dated graphics, poor sound, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI, and no single player campaign nor players to play against....   3 thumbs down - stay away
3470	0	a	This game has so many bugs it's not even funny.
3471	0	a	LOLOLOL I bought this game for less than a dollar and it's still not worth it. Terrible voice acting. Terrible dinosaur mechanics. There's random dinosaurs that are extremly overpowerd that just ruins the fun. I'd have to write a lot more to explain how much this game sucks. Worst game I've ever played.
3472	0	a	I spent 99 cents on this game and I still feel ripped off.  And before anyone says 'you haven't spent enough hours in this game to give it a negative review' please realise that when a game feels this broken and crappy logging any real time into it is a serious chore. It's easy to spend tons of hours in a great game, but if a game can't even keep my interest for more than 15 mins then I consider that a flaw with the game, not with my attention span.  My first complaint is the controls are complete garbage. I'm playing with an Xbox 360 controller. There is VERY NOTICABLE latency on any button that I hit, no matter which server I join. This alone completely destroys the experience and qualifies the game for a negative review by it's self.  Also, when I move the left stick my character continues moving well after I release the stick. Moving around in this laggy game feels like slipping around on ice.   There is very little to no explanation as to the game objectives, and when I join a server other players of course don't want to coach a noob and will kick me out of their servers for even asking how to play. And of course there are no turorials that I could find to help me acclimate to this game.  The end result is a game that feels barely functional, lags horribly, controls horribly, and a confusing play style that puts new players at a severe handicap.  Ohh but on the plus side, THERE ARE DINOSAURS!!!! Derpa derp!
3473	0	a	Stops working after starting a solo game.   When I first got this game, it worked after tweaking with the graphics settings. I would have reccomended it. Now it doesn't start up a solo game.   Do I get a refund?
3474	0	a	Its fake halo... with dinosaurs.  yeahh...
3475	0	a	I have played this game for a bit now and here is my impression: While the core gameplay is fun and didn't get boring yet, there are a ton of problems with this game: - It isn't very polished; for example the menu has no animations at all and feels very clunky - Not many people playing - there are little servers you can join and you are lucky if you find one that isn't survival. You also have to be careful with the ping as someone from australia can play with someone from germany I believe. That brings me to my next point: - No offical servers. Every server is hosted by someone else playing the game. If that persons decides that he doesn't want to play anymore after half an hour, you too have to stop and join another server while loosing all the progress you made on the last one - Classes are kind of pointless. The best class is the jetpack one because you can get up onto rocks and snipe dinos while you cant get hit. Recon is fun but pointless as you loose your invisibilty when attacking unless you use (weak) silenced weapons. The medic just stands on the ground and can heal others which is boring - Dying wants to make you quit. If you die in this game and there isn't an ally around or, which is the case of the time, the allies just don't revive you, you are stuck waiting in a spectator mode until the next objective is complete. That means waiting for up to five minutes sometimes which is ♥♥♥♥ing horrible. - There is an in-game shop where you can customize your character for real money. That alone not being horrible enough, the stuff there makes your already horrendously looking character look even worse but at least give no better stats. But an in-game shop for a game you already bought? Not my taste.  But if you are alive, amassed some credits and found a good lagless server with a person who isn't planning on leaving it is a fun game if you have nothing else to do. Was worth the buck for me as I got it on sale, but I wouldn't recommend to buy it for the full price.
3476	0	a	Dino what? I've played about five games online now and haven't seen a single dino. In fact I haven't seen much at all except about 30 seconds of gameplay before someone with a better gun and a thousand hours blows you away from behind. Didn't realize it was a frag fest, and as such it doesn't compare to Unreal Tournament 15 years ago. Disappointed.
3477	0	a	Do not waste your money on this game.
3478	0	a	kind of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game. not worth the time
3479	0	a	I was excited at first - who wouldn't be? Shooting dinosaurs in the face, jetpacks, bigass swords, etc... it sounded too good to be true. Unfortunately, it is so buggy, so unfinished, that it leaves the player frustrated and annoyed.
3480	0	a	Graphics: average 5/10 The dino are ulgy but the landscape is acceptable Audio:Poor 3/10 Music does not fit the game The shooting sound is not realistic and the narrator is so annoying  Gameplay:average 5/10 Find it boring after a few rounds as dino only go stright to you and they dont have lots of different skills Sometimes I think that it is just like left 4 dead with zombies replaced by dino. (left 4 dead is better :D )  Maybe it would be interesting when it comes to multiplayer  but consider it is only 1 dollar on sale. It is acceptable Overall: 4/10
3481	0	a	Good game but doesnt even let me finish a match bfore it crashes.....
3482	0	a	There isn't really much to do, you just shoot dinosaurs, rinse and repeat. It becomes boring after a few rounds.
3483	0	a	Trash. Not worth a single penny. Would not play it if it were a free half life one mod.
3484	0	a	this game is bad lol
3485	0	a	Only 11 servers, one of which had a ping of under 100ms. Tried to connect; connection was reset or timed out and the game crashed. Hate writing bad reviews because I know how much blood, sweat and tears must go into making a game like this, but come on guys...
3486	0	a	This game just sucks, to be honest.
3487	0	a	This game is a huge waste of time and money. every mission is the same. nothing never changes and it very buggy and oftenly found my self regretting even buying this game even though it only cost me £0.99.
3488	0	a	i bought this as a gift and couldnt send it till my friends trial was over. after remembering i had it i no longer have it in my inventory. steam owes me a new game or a refund ASAP!!! Double thumbs down and a middle finger
3489	0	a	Worst game I have played in the last 10 years... Horrible controlls, movement is clunky as hell, the combat is half ♥♥♥♥♥. This game is so bad, that I regret that I wasted a DOLLAR on it.
3490	0	a	I don't know why all this fuss is here about, the game, but i do know the game is alot of fun. Patches really help this title and hopefully the game can comeback with a sequal to show people this isn't a terrible series. I don't recommend buying the game at full price, but when it is on sale, pick it up for a good time and laugh with friends.
3491	0	a	Extremely repetitious without the feeling of advancment. Needs more diverse gameplay mechanics. Feels beta. Worth the dollar i paid for it.
3492	0	a	This game is bad, unbalanced, tiresome and the engine is awful. I didn't buy it and neither should you.
3493	0	a	Did u forget about to fix some bugs?
3494	0	a	I payed full price for Aliens: Colonial Marines and felt I got my moneys worth. I sometimes buy a lottery ticket and even if I don't win I think it's money well spent.   This game wasn't worth the dollar I payed for it.
3495	0	a	Good Game but not Computer Shop Friendly.... unlike Dota 2
3496	0	a	this game is utter crap. sure it was fun the one time it worked, but thegraphics, controls, and sounds were horrible. i would play it again but for whatever reason it wont download the update. my final score: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. and by the way, ignore the amount of hours of allegedly put into the game, that was just some sort of glitch or bug that steam has right now.
3497	0	a	If this game added better animation for dinosaurs and smoother gameplay I would recommend it. More game modes than you could want and plenty of massive maps, worth trying on a free weekend or getting on a sale
3498	0	a	This is not that good of a game not well made do not play it
3499	0	a	just no, couldnt find anything i liked about this game at all
3500	0	a	Pretty fun to play with friends. I can't say Im going to play this a lot by myself however. The developers were obviously influenced by games like Halo, Killing Floor, and Team Fortress 2, and those elements make this game even better.
3501	0	a	Terrible animations, dumb ai, terrible performance, and flying tanks. These are some of the very few problems with this 'game'. I put game in quations because a game is a form of interactive media, and more than 7/8 the time the only form of interacting you do with this 'game' is quiting it. This 'game' isn't worth the 89 cents I paid for it.
3502	0	a	This game. It's not even worth the buck I bought it for. If you consider buying it, don't. You might think: it's halo with dinosaurs, how could it be bad? Well, it is. Halo is a nice game, and it looks like they copied it, but left the good things out (why would you need fun in a video game). It's all the bad things of Halo combined WITH badly designed dinosaurs. There's one or two gamemodes where you can play as a dinosaur, but it makes no sense and the dinosaurs only have one (maybe two) attacks. The weapons make no sense either and the game sounds like a goat being ♥♥♥♥♥ by a T-Rex that just chopped of its leg.
3503	0	a	If I could get into a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game I could review this peice of ♥♥♥♥.
3504	0	a	complete and Utter Garbage game No new user guides no clues on what going on , not to mention the dino animations are complete trash ... Avoid this like a Zombie apocalypse
3505	0	a	This is one of the worst games i have ever played.I bought it when it was on sale , at 1 € ,i regret it so much..
3506	0	a	great game to play with friends but by yourself it is quite boring
3507	0	a	pretty boring, not balanced. the maps are big. accuracy is not very good. the concept is awesome just not polished.
3508	0	a	Had problems finding a server, only 9 servers ever showed up and most of them were empty.
3509	0	a	Don't even buy it
3510	0	a	This game is terrible. The A.I is poorly programed, the hit detection can be buggy, the whole world in this game is glitchy. Do yourself a favor and NEVER PLAY THIS GAME
3511	0	a	Don't buy this game or at the very least don't buy it full price. The waves become repetitive, the enemies are uninteligent, and there is something wrong with the mouse sensitivity.
3512	0	a	Halo + Jurassic Park. But there's a catch: it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥.
3513	0	a	Virtually unplayable. The concept is really cool, and it looks fun, but they drop you in the game with a pistol that barely does anything against the dinos. You are required to buy time-consuming upgrades while the dinosaurs come at you. Then you're dead. Fortunately they give you one of those 'kill to survive' tropes, but as you rapidly shoot at the dinos, they quickly run away before your weak gun can kill one.  3/10  Three points for dinosaurs.
3514	0	a	well so far is good but less player
3515	0	a	This game may be fun for some, but for me... it was pretty lacking. The concept of an open world dinosaur hunting game, with vehicles and great visuals and adventures and fun times is a great idea in itself, but this game didnt really offer much fun to me. I also experienced a decent bit of performance issues on my rig. I dont have a crazy gaming computer, but I have something decent, and I can play some pretty decently resource-heavy games (Borderlands, GTA IV, Just Cause 2, BF3, etc). But I had issues with this game. Overall, I'd give it a 3.5/10 ... which sucks, because I like the idea.
3516	0	a	I don't dislike anyone enough on my friends list to give a gift copy of this game to.
3517	0	a	Waste of time 
3518	0	a	When I look up in to the night sky, I ponder - as i yearn for a majestic experience regarding raging dinosaurs. The answer my friend is Orion: Dine Horde. This game is the most fantastic, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic relevation that I have ever experienced.   11/10 because why not.
3519	0	a	I tried to think of a first person shooter worse than this, but I can't at the time of writing this review.
3520	0	a	This game... What can I say? This game is glitchy as hell and has absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t moments. Now you may be saying. 'What game doesn't have it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t moments?'. And while this is true this game pushes it to an extreme... I would say this is basically killing floor with dinosaurs but that would be disgracing killing floor. It's more like it tried to be like that but failed, there are vehicles, gun stations, and ammo stations which all and all is cool. But not every base in the damn maps have these which is utter stupidity. Anyway off of that you have an AMAZING 3 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ CLASSES all of which seem utterly useless to anyone besides yourself. And what an amazing variety of guns about what like 12 tops. WOOOO! I'm so pumped... (Completely sarcastic). So is this game worth the money no. Should you buy it if friends did, maybe. But only for the ♥♥♥♥♥'n'giggles it gives you when your not raging because you wasted your money on a vehicle that dies too fast. I digress make your decision.
3521	0	a	I wish I could un-purchase this 4-pack. It really sounded fun on paper to me, and I didn't see any issues in the video, but it really turned out to not be any fun at all. It just feels janky and old.  DO NOT PURCHASE
3522	0	a	Eh, its okay. not the best. Primal carnage is ALOT better, though.
3523	0	a	I would like to preface this review by saying that I was honestly fairly excited for this game. Not because I was disillusioned by some gimmicky gameplay grandeur, but because it has dinosaurs in it. Dinos are the ♥♥♥♥, and they're my favorite monster/animal. It's a shame that ORION couldn't live up to anything particularly special, or, good for that matter.  The Co-op is finnicky, the horde mode is too easy, the gun balance is terrible, the graphics are horribly optimized, and the textures are of a low resolution. If you can slog through most of the game on the surface it looks awful, but after playing with it for a bit, you can clearly see some decent (even good) ideas thrown in.   The vehicle options are cool, some of the guns are awesome, and playing as some of the dinos is fun. It just doesn't feel thought out and the execution is exceptionally poor. Some of the dinos are glitchy, and don't play or attack correctly. Some vehicles are nothing more than road kill simulators, and the weapon imbalance stated earlier gives me zero incentive to try-out or use any of the other more interesting guns. All-in-all, ORION: Dino Horde was a poorly developed game with some cool ideas just feel dropped half-way through. It's unfortunate for us dino-lovers. Perhaps we'll get a good dino game one day, but it's not today.
3524	0	a	 ORION: Dino Horde certainly delivers hordes and hordes of dinosaurs.   Pros: Dinosaurs, Music, Multiplayer Cons: Repetitive, Balance, Community   ORION: Dino Horde entertains for a while with its virtually endless number of dinosaurs. The soundtrack to the slaughter fits well, though the sound effects and narrator less so. Multiplayer, especially with friends, adds much to the fun.  However, the gameplay itself is boringly repetitive after the first hour or so. Dinosaurs' simple AI will only ever rush players and every vehicle seems to have the same turret.   The game is balanced poorly in many different respects: long respawn times in Survival and Conquest modes, infinite instant respawns of powerful player-controlled dinosaurs in Rampage mode, and other issues.   The number of online players reaches about fifty on weekends at most, so most other gamemodes are never played. Grinding achievements will require a buddy and quite a bit of time for completionists.  ORION: Dino Horde offers a little enjoyment slaughtering waves of mindless reptiles.  5/10
3525	0	a	It's not bad for it's price, but it's simply too boring to get into. You get a gun and shoot dinosaurs, that's it. Not enough gameplay for my taste, but it can definetely apeal to a lot of other people.
3526	0	a	I played this game for about 35 minutes. The controls felt pretty poor, the voice acting is subpar, and the graphics leave a bit to be desired. There's not much about it that makes me want to go back.
3527	0	a	Waste of money and time.
3528	0	a	I cannot play this game due to major lag. I am pretty sure that its not my fault that I cannot play it as my friends have the same problem. I spent many time on it trying to understand what the problem was but I didnt manage to change anything. Bought it for nothing...
3529	0	a	A waste of $$$  So many glitches in this game. Don't waste a cent on it people.
3530	0	a	This game is ♥♥♥♥ :)
3531	0	a	Mediocre at best. 5/10
3532	0	a	I picked this up in the steam summer sale, it was VERY cheap and i thought what the hell. I have to say it can be quite enjoyable, it was a laugh to run around and shoot dinosaurs, but you wont feel too engrossed in it.  I dont recommend this game for any considerable price, but pick it up if its super cheap again, and give it a go, it can be quite amusing, even for only a short while :)
3533	0	a	Possibly the worst online game you can buy on steam. The textures are from a ms-dos games; the annimations of the dinosaurs are laughable and the vehicles are complete rip offs from halo.   If you can get a 4-pack in a steam sale for £1 each then do it as it will provide many laughs due to how trench tier this game is.
3534	0	a	This game is close to a good game as a t-rex is close to rubbing its ♥♥♥♥ with it's hands. Dont buy this underdevopled modern piece of dino turd!
3535	0	a	Not worth it.
3536	0	a	Orion: Dino Horde is not worth your money.  While the game makes it out that jetpacks and dinosaurs are a good idea (and they are), the game poorly executes this. Games generally are you and a bunch of your friends shooting at 3 t rexes. Your weapons are practically worthless, the trex has boat loads of health, and the trex can throw rocks at you. The problems get worse. DInosaur animations look horrible to the point that they look like horrible mods. Areas look sparse and lifeless until one of these poorly walking dinos appear, at which point the game ends up looking like a mod. There are better games like this one, like Dino Dday. Orion is not worth you time and money.
3537	0	a	This is a beta-quality title. I bought the 4-pack for $2.99 and I still regret it; at $14.99 I would consider this a scam!
3538	0	a	is this some kind of teenager joke?
3539	0	a	Isn't even worth it with 90% discount, got it for 1 euro and now I regret it. Empty servers, cardboard dinos, ridiculously low FOV. Wouldn't recommend.
3540	0	a	Bad game, just bad.  Well it was 90c.
3541	0	a	Worst game, by far, I've ever played...
3542	0	a	Can heal your own ♥♥♥♥ with the support class medic gun.  11/10
3543	0	a	always low memory in my Rig   hufffff
3544	0	a	Im actually loving this game, its fun to watch and play. Only two things i have issues with, the revolver acts strange when you try to fire it quickly, and lag in servers, i need to aim,shoot,bash, way ahead of the dino's in some situations. Overall I would recomend this game to my friends. _____________________ EDIT LINE _______________ pros- guns, dinos, cars... explosions, etc  cons- pay for the game... just to find out that there are ingame credits that can buy cool hats and colors  I just paid money for this game... do i really have to pay more for colors and skins?  ^ you can not earn these special credits. Greedy dev's Hid the fact that 'misc' are unearnable.  Im still going to play this, just not happily.
3545	0	a	This game... not much is to be said about it. Ill just say that you shouldnt buy the game, it doesnt work. It has the potential to be a pretty good game, but you cant play it because half the time it wont let you join a server. and right now i bet your saying'but it has single player also!' indeed it does, but this component of the game doesnt work either.  
3546	0	a	Do not buy this game this game sucks it lags alot and its ♥♥♥♥
3547	0	a	Heehee thanx for the game crabcake ... but it's horrible ;D
3548	0	a	hmmm how to start this review ........ oh screw it this game is a boring and lame steaming pile of horse crap and whether it is on sale or not huge waste of time, and money. garbage garbage garbage
3549	0	a	Don't buy this game if you like your money. Don't pay $15 for this ♥♥♥♥.
3550	0	a	Worst game I have ever played.
3551	0	a	This game feels very awkard and somewhat undone. The character I chose kept repeating the same voice lines randomly, and the dinosaurs are ugly. The balance between dinosaurs is very, very weird. For example, The medium generic dinosaur takes 5 shots to kill, the tiny one takes 2, and the big one takes over 30. Customization is extremely limited and was way too small to capture my intrest, and this game will probably ask you for $ in exchange for cosmetics that are just reskins. The cars are straight from Halo, as in their turning, brakes, mounted turret, are exactly like Halo. In fact, the more I think about it, alot of the player's character feels like Master chief from Halo, in terms of their mechanics. The in-game maps look ugly too.  4/10: It has a very indie feel, and not in the unique charming sense, more like in the 'I didn't finish the game and I have ran out of ideas, buy DLC' feel. If it intrests you, get it on sale or as a gift. Other than that, don't purchase it.
3552	0	a	Killing Floor, with dinosaurs and bad animations.
3553	0	a	The Antichrist's parents would probably be as defensive of their offspring's faults.....  I'm going to make a list of the people who gave this a positive review, just so that I know who not to trust in future.... Someone actually gave it a 10/10.... I'm gobsmacked  Perhaps the multiplayer is good, but the single player mode is a complete waste of time.   In this case I agree with the Metacritic score
3554	0	a	Compys take 4 headshots to kill on easy mode 2/10 would not play again  Only an hour into this game, I've found that I can't heal up my character unless I get downed and kill something in Last Stand or whatever it's called, Shields seem to only restore when you have most of or full health, and as far as I'm aware, you need a Support to heal yourself period. In other words, Solo mode is garbage and the button should be removed altogether. What worried me the most on solo mode is finding out about the larger dinos for the first time, and watching the amount of smaller ones steadily increase the longer it took me to find the larger one. The ammo on my primary is virtually gone, and if I'm guessing correctly, you have to run back to base to grab more. It's a large map, and if your vehicle blows up, good luck running back being chased by flying ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, hoping one of them doesn't grab you and drop you from high enough to kill you with fall damage.  This is very clearly a game meant for you to play with friends or other people, and only that. And, quite frankly with my horrible router, that's not going to happen anytime soon.
3555	0	a	this game has too many errors 1.when i join a online server the game will freeze 2.when i run the game, she will take a lot of time to open
3556	0	a	Rewrite  This game has just barely improved since Dino Horde. The character models have been redone and that's about it. It's still the same terrible game. Easily worth the $1.00 I spent on it, but that doesn't mean it's actually any good.
3557	0	a	Worst game I've ever played.  EDIT: That was until I played Dizzel, now this is the second worst game I've played.
3558	0	a	Dont buy this game its a total fraud. Its buggy , barely playable, repetive and worse than an alpha version of basically any other game! The Meta Userscore is 2,7 out of 10! And 10 out of the 11 positive reviews where made from accounts that all where created between may 4th and may 8th, and never rated any other game, so one doesnt need to be a smartass to see what has happened here... Avoid that game like the plague!
3559	0	a	Boring and confusing generic shooter with only the 'hook' of dinos to shoot.
3560	0	a	This game is a joke. Wouldnt buy it even for 1cent (A friend gave it to me)
3561	0	a	Awful. It looks like Halo 1 on low settings.
3562	0	a	Eh, It's OK
3563	0	a	I can't connect to my friend's server. Game is awesome but connection sucks
3564	0	a	in the advert this game looks brilliant in every way but as soon as you get it you soon realise that its not the best game ever like said in the add but the worst game i have played in my entire life i definatley do NOT!!!!! recomend this game.
3565	0	a	dude i payed for it when i came out and i didnt like it it was not like dayz or battlefield just not the type of thing i like it doesnt have ZAMBIES 
3566	0	a	Sadly another no so polished may have had some good ideahs but strickly multiplayer without a point. Yes games don't need them. You can hack and slash, tank and spack, and shoot your foes too a bloody mess with no more point then meh I'm bored. Seriously though this is just graasping at straws for ssomething new when there's so much out there as cheap as this and better. But, if your grasping for the something new and got nothing better to do then try this then fine. I found the world to be rushed to be made. Effectss that others made and came standard, WHICH YOU CAN ALWAYS NOTE THE DIFFERENCE DUE TO HOW BEAUTIFUL THEY ARE COMPAIRED TO THE WORLD AROUND YOU. Sadly it lacks me caring about the objectives and just being lead around in a world that leaves me questioning why bother. Killing dinosoars sure, but then can't I just do that in turok???
3567	0	a	I can't even call this monstrosity a game, so just don't even think of buying it. The fact that it's broken isn't even what bothers me, but the fact that it's chock full of stolen content does. Bottom line, don't give this person money.
3568	0	a	A New Beginning tries to share a positive message about climate change, our future, and our resistance to change, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired. The game is not terrible: it has its good points, and if you've ever wanted to play a dimwitted token female with a seemingly quite severe case of scoliosis who wears a sweater that covers only her boobs, then this definitely is your game.  Pros: +Good message +The art is quite nice +The ruined future setting that occurs near the start of the game is very compelling +The support team answered my emails quickly and were very helpful when I encountered a game-breaking bug  Cons: -The English voice acting is atrocious. If you want to play the game, set the sound the German with English subtitles - the German voice acting isn't too bad. -The English translation is not very good. There are a lot of grammatical errors and problems with colloquialisms that really should have been caught by a native English speaking proofreader before the game was published. -There are a lot of bugs. Mainly I encountered translation bugs: various items popping up in Russian or Spanish. I also found a game-breaking bug, however, which required a replacement save file from the support team to get past. -Everyone moves so slowly that I found myself screaming at the monitor a few times. Quickly, we must hit that switch before the facility explodes! Now, let me just take a leisurely stroll across the room. Wouldn't want to work up a sweat. -The game is extremely resource-heavy, and I can't figure out why. My computer heats up while running this game as much as it does while playing a modern shooter. -Many of the puzzles are absurd. Several of them require knowledge that the average person just wouldn't have. I needed a walkthrough to get through most of it, and many times I realized I would never in a million years have thought to try the thing that ended up being necessary. There's also a fair amount of pixel-hunting for tiny items that blend in. -Between the slow movement speed of the characters and the seemingly never-ending cutscenes and dialog, by the time I was 1/3 of the way through the game I just wanted it to end. -The ending isn't nearly as clever as it's trying to be, and felt rather anti-climactic after all those hours of listening to people talk and watching them crawl across the screen to the sound of suspenseful music.  If you can get the game cheap, enjoy ridiculous puzzles, and have a lot of patience for slow movement and long cutscenes, then feel free to give this one a try. If you're used a faster pace or just want something you feel you can solve without a walkthrough, I'd pass this one over.
3569	0	a	 'Steam. Not smoke.'    A New Beginning  is one of Daedalic Entertainments' 'pretty good idea, done nonchalantly' games. Thus, it is a great potential story wrecked with many bugs, bad translation and a half-baked ending. I had really some major expectations from this game, with themes such as time travelling, environmental pollution and mass awareness but... No, it doesn't cut. This is not how it's done. This is not how it should be done. All this tension, all these ominous warnings, all this thrill and this action... and this ending? This is not a climax! Are you mocking me?  Sorry, my annoyance gets the best of me sometimes. It's storytelling time. Here, we have the elderly Norwegian bioengineer Bent Svensson who spent all his life working in the laboratory to produce energy from algae for the production of safe energy in hopes for a better future for the planet. After a breakdown that he suffers due to exhaustion, Bent is sent to retirement - the purgatory of a workaholic. He now lives in a small cabin in Norwegian Fjords, away from work, away from stress and away from responsibility. 'Calm down, Bent' says his psychiatrist. 'You are not responsible of saving the world'.  Oh, she couldn't be more wrong! Bent Svensson's silent misery in retirement is suddenly interrupted by the visit of Fay, an odd young woman who claims that she time travelled from the future to find him. According to Fay, she comes from a future where the mother earth is at her limits and about to perish for good due to years of pollution, violent climate changes and toxicity. As part of an operation called 'the Phoenix Plan' she is sent to the past to prevent a disaster from happening to alter the course of time. 'Only you, Bent' says Fay, 'Only you can save the world!  I know I was intrigued after the brief introduction to the game. The environmental theme, financial conspiracies, bioengineering, time travel, ecoterrorism... What else I can expect from a sci-fi environmental adventure? Right? Sadly there is a truckload of bugs and irritable mistakes within this game which will simmer down your enthusiasm. There is a common bug that makes your inventory unreachable, thus unable to complete an action to progress which triggers a couple of times, starting with the end of chapter 2. You should either ask Daedalic support for a save game where the bug isn't triggered, or pray you got plenty of your saves to try again.  The graphics are beautiful, this is already a trademark for Daedalic. Cinematic cut scenes are arranged in a comic-style manner where comic panels are presented with speech bubbles over characters, alongside voice acting. The comic style character artwork is a great idea of presentation, but my issue comes with the translation. As Daedalic being a German firm, I assume for original voice acting and script to be in German. So the English translation is... well, horrible. Word puns and scientific explanations are totally lost. There are many, many spelling errors within texts. The speaking animations do continue long after the voice acting is already stopped. With all these errors, it becomes really hard to get into mood and take either character or the story seriously.  About the gameplay itself, it is your basic point and click adventure. Item combinations do make sense, and nearly always they go along with an engineering view point. Lots of things to fix, physical reactions to mind, machines to manage and operate. Thus, it becomes obscure sometimes for you to be able to think of needed ways to progress. Puzzles themselves are very realistic, to a degree of - yet again, becoming obscure. I am usually very good at solving such puzzles without a walkthrough, but in the case of this specific game, I gave up. I personally think there is no one who would be able to solve all puzzles without the help of a walkthrough for this game.  I do not give up on games with good stories due to bugs, really. If I managed to play  Anna  to the end, and enjoyed every single moment of it, I'm positive bugs do not pull me down. My problem was the negligence in story persistency all together. Some characters made a shallow appearance and remain unvisited and unmentioned for the rest of the story, which prevents us from emphasizing with them altogether. Aside the character of Bent Svensson himself maybe, characters aren't more than some pictures with speech bubbles. There is no personality, no cause-effect relationship in their actions, no reasoning to their thoughts or dialogues. There were some character inconsistencies, like a trained radio operative like Fay being borderline clumsy, just to force the storyline in a predetermined course. Every disaster or twist in the storyline is foreseeable and determined, aside from a really anticlimactic ending.  All in all, this is a mediocre game with incredible potential wasted terribly. Am I sorry that I played this? No, not at all. Gave me some thinking to do on the theme itself of course. But nothing I wouldn't get from reading Greenpeace bulletin or National Geographic. On sci-fi terms, I'll keep reading H.G. Wells.  Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page  here  - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!
3570	0	a	640x480 resolution in 2013 year's game. are you serious?
3571	0	a	Overall - lacking. The graphics are pleasing enough, and the music is nice. That said, the English voice acting is simply atrocious. A reader program is better to listen to, the intonation has nothing to do with the emotional content of the dialogue, and sometimes it's just plain wrong for English. Oh, and the character design. Why does Fay have a uniform including a sweater that ends under her boobs? And does she have a back problem? She stands and walks with her spine bent in a highly unnatural shape, which is just painful to look at. The characters themselves are also shallow, and even though in some reviews I've read about 'character development', that mostly means that they grow from one-dimensional to maybe two. And that's for the protagonists. About one of the main supporting characters, Duve, all I got to know was that a: he's upset with his father (understandably) for sacrificing their family for his work, yet b: he continues his father's work out of some sort of duty perhaps, though he claims to hate it, and c: he's gay. The latter had nothing whatsoever to do with anything, apart from mentioning that Bent 'would have been okay with it', and providing a clue for solving a puzzle. Talk about token minority. The plot seemed forced sometimes, and after the final plot twist, had motivation issues at some points in retrospect. All-in-all, it felt rather forced and didactic, and the conclusion really didn't make much sense to me. Certainly not a game I will ever play again, and not one I could recommend, as much as I'd like to promote eco-conscious games. Only reason I played it through was that I hoped for satisfactory ending. I didn't get it.
3572	0	a	[WARNING. SPOILERS]  this is the first Daedalic Entertainment game i've finished and... actually regretted playing.  This game has the potential to be a fun, enjoyable game. Puzzles, tricky areas that would not be the automatic response and even an additional level of depth to point and click that allows for pop-up actions (more about that in the negatives.). As always with Daedalic Entertainment, it's beautiful to look at and tha characters are... more or less believable. They make sense and seem easy enough to relate to. Daedalic Entertainment have also coined a 'hold Space to show Items you can interact with', this has made me so much more likley to buy one of their games just for that aspect alone! the character animations, although simple and repetative, always seem mostly in place and with exception of a few moments (if you want to pick) usually look perfectly fine and don't break immersion at all.  However... the entire game paints the image of 'the world is ending, it's climate change but you can fix it'. at no point did I feel hopful for the characters. We're dealing with an aeged man who has ruined his relationship with his family, estranged his son and apparently made very little effort to fix that. you're also playing as a person who, during the entire game I was expecting to turn out to be lying to me and was unfortunatley not dissapointed. The 'good guys' turn out to be... well... kind of pathetic, sad and myserable people that I didn't want to even think existed, let alone play them for the whole game. The antagonists were rather unbelievably over-evil (MWAHAHAHAA! I WILL PAVE OVER THE WORLD TO MAKE A GLORIOUS SEAL-SKIN CAR-PARK!) and the storyline rather felt overly preachy... The entire cast were unpleasant in even degrees... in fact, the person I liked the most was a doorman with an anger problem and a complex about his baldness!  The general gameplay is point-and-click with the occasional puzzle. The puzzles were good and mostly self-explanatory, but the point-and-click was point-and-hold-aim-and-click for everytbing... that took extra time that was not needed when right-click-to-examine and left-click to walk to, pick up, adjust etc. would have sufficed. The right-click for inventory was not actually needed at any point and could easily have been removed entirely and replaced by having the inventory there all the time. the only time it became needed to quickly open your inventory is if a game-event had closed it for you.  I did not feel like I had anyone on my side in the entire game. When i'm playing as him, i'm waiting for her to ♥♥♥♥ him over. When i'm playing as her, i'm waiting for us to do something strange and un-kocher. The son, he was downright unpleasant. The old-friend from work was needlessly suspicious and came across as kaniving in places. The best-friend seemed... well... i don't know all that well beause i was honestly expecting him to mess us over too! he was too nice compared to the rather unpleasant crowd we were already in! I can't complain enough about the worst of humanity in this. We have cheaters, liars, mercinaries, needless aggression, paranoia, disbelief, angst and all the other shades of things you don't want to spend an afternoon immersed in.  The storyline of 'time travlers come back to fix the world' is great. I was all for that! the idea of them coming back from a climate-desolate wasteland is a perfectly stable platform... what fails however is that they drop a plot-twist on us that... well, let's face it was rather un-needed! 'we came to this reactor to stop it blowin up!' becomes 'we came here to blow it up'... umm... why? Honestly, it boiled down to 'grab that stuff and run for it!'. the machevilian 'let's tell the goodie all my plans' was old before this game was made and really made the ending of this... a total mess! I've seen twist endings, back-track endings, not-as-you-expeted-it endings, the-goodie-is-the-baddie-is-the-goodie endings... but the sudden change of heart makes your one character seem totally heartless or a derranged sociopath, the baddie is... let's face it, totally insane for his plans and the other baddie is desperatley in need of a lead-lobotomy! 'it's ok, we reconciled this kid with his father and even managed to bring his sexuality into it almost out of the blue without any apparent reason'... umm... yay? what have we resolved here? One character we were really not that set up to like has got fame, another character we probably should not dislike this much is going back to killing himself with over-work and his son, who needs to get a grip for most the game, is all right now? you might as well have written 'and they all lived happily ever after'! Oh, but it's ok, that person who let themselves get baked in radioactive steam instead of getting into one of the many easy-to-access doors on that level left you a picture to remember how she and all the other people you met from her time betrayed your trust, nearly got you and your family killed, killed off one of your oldest friends, destroyed most of your life's work and... should I go on? The ending felt forced, bolted on and almost irrelevant to the rest of the game. The problem was that whole areas of the game had the same feeling. 'this is a great big conspiracy' why? everything points that way. Everyone says it's an accident and refuses to talk more about it... soooooooo? Why was everyone acting needlessly suspicious? No apparent reason. One person takes it to their grave and the other betrays you brutally without any kind of apology.  I actually felt miserable finishing this game. The gaming completionist in me refused to step away, but I was damn close! had the ending not appeared when it did, i would not have finished the game. 'No matter how beautiful the weapon is, it will hurt no less when turning against you'  Technical bugs were rife in the game. Many areas had options that were not translated. clicking on one item to examine blinked the subtitle and played no audio so if there was any useful information there, i missed that There are parts where the subtitles run off in the FMV but the audio has not even started. The dialogue overlaps itself, jumps pitch and volume mid-sentance, often lacks the correct inflection for the mood it's used and sometimes comes across as just plain wooden and eerie. One moment, i'd be listening and the voice sounds warm and involving... while describing an inane object... then to describe something important, it sounds cold and emotionless? the mixed signals in this were easy enough to overlook, but when it changed pitch, volume and feel mid-sentance? split-personalities or bad dubbing... There were miss-spelt subtitles, incorrect words and sometimes, the wrong used entirely.  Top it all off with the common feel of mid-eighties cartoons where the baddie just wants to make a new motorway or spill oil into the sea and realising that they might as well be brow-beating you for having the light on. Honestly, i would not have been surprised to find that this was endorsed by an extremist wing of a climate change activist group! Yes, we get that nuclear power isn't the best, let's all feel damn sad for this. now, how dare you have multiple monitors on. We all poison every living thing in the woods for no particularly well-explained reason. Deforestation, fossil fuels, melting ice-caps... Anyone remember this from school?  I DO care about the environment, I'm happy to recycle, I proudly turn off lights and electrical devices not in use and rarely use more than what I need... I don't need a game to make me feel guilty for the environment change.    I would urge point-and-click enthusiasts to buy ANY Deponia title instead of this. If you want somethin a little more serious, buy 'night of the rabbit'. Daedalic Entertainment deserve all the support they can get, but this game is going to a special place in my 'games I regretted playing' list.
3573	0	a	Firstly a note on the voice acting and how I got past it.... it's bad. I knew it would be based on the majority of the reviews here, but my god I wasn't prepared for how painful it actually was. It's as if they grabbed random people off of the street and made them read lines of dialogue with no context. It's so poorly done that it just doesn't make sense. I was so turned off by it that I was going to give up after an hour. I did find that I was able to continue by switching the language back to German. While not perfect, they at least tried to emote and it synced up with the mouth animations on the panel scenes given that it was the native language of the game. Just go into it as if it's a foreign subtitled game. I know that turns a lot you off, but it's still better than the English voice track.   that said...  A rather disappointing outing from Daedalic. I tried harder than I usually would to give it a fair chance to impress but it never actually came through.   Screens/Backgrounds are well done. The biggest compliment I can give here.  Story was lacking in my opinion. Written too loosely and eco-preachy to the point of borderline annoyance.  Characters were weak and two dimentional. Many of them so unlikable (looking at you Bent) that it was hard to care or empathise with them enough to desire any kind of resolution on my end other than soon forgetting them.  Puzzles are challenging, but fair. To be honest, I was so tired of it all by the third act that I power FAQ'd.  It's currently $2. Hard to say 'Don't Buy' at a price that low, but I sure wouldn't recommend paying more. I'll remain a longtime Daedalic fan for what they've done to reintroduce and support P&amp;C genre adventures in recent years, but this is an effort that can easily be swept under the rug.
3574	0	a	An interesting climate change story, with time travel, dual characters, nice graphics, cool comic strip cut scenes and a nice take on point and click mechanics make for a fun game. But oh ,, my .. lord .. of .. pants .. the voice acting and dialogue is dreadful. Its as if they recorded each word individually and you've dialled an automated call centre for the conversations. I normally enjoy exhausting dialogue trees, but this is so jarring, I would find the path of least resistance most of the time.  This is a real shame as you feel there is some humour hiding behind the poorly translated dialogue and some characters come off as real ♥♥♥♥♥, making you cringe at some of their lines. Thats possibly the point for some characters, but it comes across poorly done and in some instances, just plain wrong,  The problems don't end here, plenty of bugs are scattered throughout, repeated text, scenes out of sync, characters pop around the screen and cut scene crashes. A tip here, if you do get stuck at a crash, you can skip the problem cut scene by hitting escape. These bugs are not frequent enough to be game breakers, but they do break the immersion.  But.. I played til the end, the story and puzzles kept me coming back. It would have been a thumbs up if the dialogue had been implemented better. However, I cannot recommend the English version at full price, so a wobble to a thumbs down for me, but point and click fans should consider it if its in a deal or part of a better package..
3575	0	a	Like classic point and click adventure games? Well, if you can look past the awkward audio timing, mediocre voice acting, and bugs, then you can still look past this game for something better. The story is pretty predictable and none of the characters are believable. The puzzles are either obtuse and illogical or just stupid. The San Fransico section is particularly bad. The animations are choppy and awkward throughout. There's a subplot that I guess they just forgot to conclude along with the unsatisfying ending. But at least the suffering doesn't last long as you'll reach that ending much faster than you might expect. 20 hours of gameplay is promised, less the 10 was delivered. I managed to stretch it to 13 by leaving it minimized to cook dinner, search the internet for a solution to a game breaking bug, and rebuild a server.  So, if you bored and this is on sale for less than a dollar, go ahead. Just do yourself a favor and turn off the voice acting. It would be a better game for it and there's no audio for the subtitles they forgot to translate anyway. Oh, and hitting the spacebar is your friend. Not that the game bothers to tell you that.
3576	0	a	The comic style and the art is beautiful! The music fits perfectly on the story too. The puzzles were well balanced, not hard but not too obvious. I really like adventure games with a good story, but when you focus your game on dialogue, please put some efforts on good voice actors because english voices look like robots, it destroyed the experience for me.  If you are not a great fan of adventure point and click games, avoid it, otherwise youll get a good experience.
3577	0	a	Imagine a game written by a bunch of teenagers who are eco-activism fanatics, and also fans of sci-fi. No need to imagine, this is that game, right here! Complete with a plot which doesn't make any sense any way you slice it, the cheesiest lines delivered by the worst speech actors and all the cliches in the book.  The graphics are sort of okay, and that's the only thing okay with this game. I'll give it one out of four future catastrophes.
3578	0	a	So....this is a game I really wish I could enjoy. Conceptually, it is worth consideration even though the story is fairly cliche (world is mostly destroyed by nuclear disaster and the remnants of humanity travel back in time to try and stop it from happening). Outside of the obvious issues that the topic of time travel always carry with it (poorly thought out ramifications to actions being foremost on that list), the real issue with this game is that, since the sotry is so cliche, it really needs strong gameplay and voice acting to make it worth slogging though. The puzzles are in fact decent. Nothing too mind bending, but on the low end of Daedalic par for the course. The voice acting, however, is simply atrocious. If you are going to spend 10 or so hours with an adventure game, and the story is sub par, the voice acting better be on point. It isnt in this game, and as much as the completionist in me wants to retire this game under the 'finished games' folder in my library, I cant bring myself to listen to the actors anymore. IDK if you will enjoy the game, but me personally, it goes into the never finish files.
3579	0	a	This game was not terrible, but to be very honest, I expected more from Daedalic.  Pros: - Art style is aesthetically pleasing - Interesting graphic novel style retelling - Good thematic concerns - An effort at a plot twist  Cons: - Storyline is very draggy - Characters not entirely likeable, which prevents you from becoming fully invested in what happens to them - Some very strange and unintuitive uses and combination of objects - Awkward English voice acting - Errors in translation (to English)  Generally, this was a rather slow and unexciting game. Even if you're a big fan of point-and-click, I'd only recommend you this title during a sale. Or just go play the Deponia series.
3580	0	a	I really really really wanted to enjoy this game. I really did. Unfortunately, upon starting the game and playing through the very first puzzle, the chump that designed it decided it would be hilarious if they hid one of the items that you needed to solve the puzzle inside of the most illogical and horrifically stupid places possible. The methodology in which the first puzzle was completed was pretty much the way that a human being would have solved it after drinking a gallon of bleach while boiling their head in a vat of prune juice. First puzzle aside, the second puzzle was more enjoyable and the storyline progressed interestingly. However, it was at this point that my sound suddenly stopped working. I checked to see if I had accidentally hit my mute button, I triple checked the in-game sound volume, and I restarted my game about six times to try to get it to work. Alas, the sound did not return and the game decided to add further insult to injury by somehow eradicating my autosave and all of the progress that I had made so far. So yeah. I really wanted to play this game. Unfortunately, I could not play it in the end and I would rather watch someone else play it on YouTube so I don't have to experience the frustration of not only solving irrational and illogical puzzles but solving technical issues as well.
3581	0	a	I wouldn't recommend this game, at least at full price.  To begin, A New Beginning is a point and click adventure that has some decent strong points. It has great music and background set pieces. Oftentimes, it is lighthearted and doesn't take its ridiculous premise that seriously, and there are even some decent introspective moments interspersed throughout. It has a very likable main character in Bent Svensson. Its best points during gameplay come in the form of straightforward puzzles that require heavy critical thinking but do not require you to, in the words of another commenter, 'have a telepathic link with the developer.' A New Beginning is at its strongest when its newest puzzle doesn't require heavy backtracking but still asks you to put in some decent legwork to find the solution.  Still, I wouldn't recomend this for a person looking for a casual, more cinematic experience. This game can get real hard and real specific, sometimes overly so. Sometimes the solution will be hidden in one line of dialogue that can easily be skipped over, or just require you to figure it out with no context. This can get exhausting and frustrating, ending up in lots of unnecessary backtracking and head scratching. The really obscure solutions serve to drag the game down into tedium, and stacked on top of the many non-logic related flaws of the game make it hard to reccomend this game.  The minigames are almost all maddeningly difficult, and they are just purely standalone logic puzzles you'd expect in a puzzle book. They do not require any knowledge of the plot and can be skipped (at the price of foregoing an achievement), but attempting them for full completion can serve to ruin any momentum you've had advancing the game. It doesn't help that some of them offer really no clues to completion. For two of them, the answers were so difficult to figure out I just looked at a walkthrough so I could nab the achievements, which left me a little bit bitter that my wins weren't legitimate.  Then there are the optimization problems, which are the worst aspect of this game. For a game which is mostly sparsely animated 2D sprites walking around static backgrounds sometimes there will be random frame drops and freezeups. The game's coding is heavily unoptimized in the sense you can straight up break the game. During some event sequences, if you click where youre not supposed to it will run another event simultaenously, which can break the whole thing. One time, clicking one thing triggered an event that was supposed to be triggered by another. At one point I think I accidentally triggered an event that caused an object to be drawn onto my character, which locked up the controls and made it impossible to advance. Good thing I had saved.   On top of that, the english voice acting and translation brings issues as well. Often times it is not fully synced to the characters lips, which meant they just slapped the voices on top of the sprite speaking the original language. There are random text and dialogue skips, times where the subtitles are just completely different than what is being said, some actions are untranslated and left in Russian, and the subtitles can lag behind the dialogue. The subtitles cna go haywire in particular if you glitch the game accidentally, and let me emphasize you can glitch the game just by clicking through dialogue. Also, some of the voice acting is a bit awkward, not fitting the situation.  Finally, the story. It makes no attenpt to hide its criticism of free market capitalism and exploitation of the environment, and at some points implies that the end justifies the means in regards to ecoterrorism. Thats the major gist of the story, and when its not lighthearted, it is either ridiculously convoluted or preachy and obnoxious. The other main character is an accomplished radiooperator and can solve complex puzzles but still manages to come off as ditzy (she's still one of the stronger female characters I've come across.) It probably has one of the most abrupt and disappointing endings ever as well.  I wanted to like this game. I put in all the time I could to get 100% completion, and at points I really enjoyed specific aspects of it. Sadly, as a package it fails to deliver.  5/10
3582	0	a	Finding a new favorite band with a wide-ranging catalogue often presents the early works question. What to do and say about the things the band recorded before finding their own style and making a breakthrough? Listening to that may present new perspectives on their best work but is that reason enough to actually try and enjoy it on its own merits? This is the question I thought often during my hours with A New Beginning, one of the first titles from my recent favorite, Daedalic Entertainment.  Many key strengths presented later are already here, particularly those related to craftsmanship. The whole of the story is well laid out and plotted, with twists all in place and the whole progressing logically throughout with interesting puzzles challenging the brain. Another trademark is the orchestral soundtrack covering a wide range of moods and emotions. And finally comes of course the hand-made art showing once again that no tesselations can ever replace the human touch.   Making parts and assembling them is one thing but then breathing life into the result is another and this is where the game sadly does not succeed. The eco-conscious bent of the story is laudable but the tone is too educational and the contrasts are simply much too black-and-white. There was no room to disagree about anything or anyone or make alternative interpretations to what the writing told me. Consequently there was an airless quality to the entire experience. No characters had enough detail to give them life beyond caricatures with calculated positions in the story (and the message). Dialogue contained many odd phrases that smack of poor translation. A grim security officer shuts off doubt with 'Fiddlesticks!' and in more than one life-threatening situation 'Good grief' gets used too.  These lecture-like qualities are made even drier by problems in presentation. The voice acting was of very poor quality throughout, there is simply no way around it. The entire cast managed to sound colorless as if concentrating on clear pronunciation and nothing else. The worst offender was perhaps the female lead who sounded so shrill and robotically cheerful I yearned for Lydia for the first time in my life. And while the artists did their best with the milieus there is only so much anyone can do with oil rigs and conference halls from 1982 where most of the action take place. The date makes sense from the thematic perspective but wastes the promise in the strong first chapter in the game, which happens in the future and has an interesting storytelling idea that was thrown out for the rest of the game. It is also unfortunate that while the places in this eco-thriller include Norway and Brazil the natural sights are not shown, unlike helicopter interiors or pump rooms. Overall the aesthetics are best described as having a metallic, inorganic quality to them which contrasts completely with the other Daedalic adventures I have seen so far.  Serving as the final coffin nail were many technical flaws and issues. First off, this is a game from 2010 -- without widescreen support. I had to set my screen resolution to 1024 x 768 before starting the game to avoid the black borders. Granted, the game did look good then but it was an odd thing to do regardless. The game is also littered with typos and words from other languages, including Spanish and Russian. 'Grapeseed oil' without the G was the most unintentionally chilling typo I have seen in quite some time.  I wanted to like A New Beginning and it actually feels a bit unfair to lay out so much criticism to an indie adventure made with very limited resources. But no matter what the comparison, the genre classics, contemporary games from other studios or other Daedalic adventures, A New Beginning falls short and cannot truly be enjoyed on its own either. I gained more insight than pleasure from my gametime and would recommend others interested in the genre to look at other options instead. Early demos or shaky debuts from good and great bands may find their way into record collections on the strength on their other albums but cannot truly be recommended to those without fan powers.
3583	0	a	I love Daedalic, so I thought this would be a good one. The voice acting on the english version was so bad I don't even want to keep playing. The first 20 minutes of story line was intriguing, but not enough to make up for that hot mess.
3584	0	a	I love Daedalic I really do, but this game is just bad, I had numerous audio pops, and even encountered a bug where the characters just didn't speak in game, no sound whatsoever... and I couldnt pick up any items so even the tutorial was impossible to beat...  Then I finally got the game to work, and then it crashed and kicked me out about 30 mins in... This is a God awful game...  People are saying the message is good, but most people believe global warming is a hoax, due to tons of scientific evidence that proves it to be a hoax... Just seems like a terrible story plot for a game... Almost feels like Daedalic was just forced to make this game, and that even they themselves hate this game...  Even the first Edna &amp; Harvey, as old as it is, still has better voice acting, and it works! Stay away from this one for sure. This one video I recorded where it crashes shall be my testimony to this terrible game...
3585	0	a	Just no. Sure, A New Beginning - Final Cut looks great, style which I really love in adventure games. Sadly, it's not really interesting and it have some annoying stuff. The story is hit or miss and in my case, it was miss. I could get into this game, so finally after 3rd time installing and playing it, I managed to reach ending. But what's much worse are english voices - during comic sequences it's just sad to watch. At least puzzles were a little interesting but that's all, I don't think that those little things are worth spending your time, and money, with this game. There are tons of adventure games which were made much better, and yes, there are even more games with 'adult' stories than the one in A New Beginning - Final Cut. Maybe if you are some hardcore fan of point and click adventure games then you can try it but if you are just looking for something fun to play - you came to the wrong neighbourhood, look around for something more popular and something that can be enjoyed no matter what.
3586	0	a	Basically, this game is about an ecoterrorist group trying to save the world by decieving, killing people and destroying things, although the main character is against violence. The story was promissing at first, but ended in a rather anticlimatic fashion, though quite surprising.  One more negative point about the story is that if you have some scientific understanding, you will find the sciency stuff in this game very unconvincing. Daedalic should keep making fantasy games. Gameplay is OK, but you will be frustrated from time to time with the 'logic' of the game. In addition, the very fact that this is a Point and Click game makes it sometimes extremely limiting when you need to inspect a certain object to solve a puzzle. Feel free to vist the walkthrough guide from time to time, no need to torture yourself.
3587	0	a	I bought A New Beginning during a phase where I bought a lot of adventure games. I had just played a few good ones and wanted more of the genre. So I got a lot of them queued up when they were on sale.  A New Beginning looks good if you can ignore the dated 4:3 aspect ratio. I especially liked the layered comic book style cinematic sequences. And although some of the puzzles required leaps in logic or pixel hunting that I found hard to stomache they were mostly par for the course.  That's the end of the good things I can say about this game though. The writing is bad and the voice acting is shockingly  worse . Truly abysmal. I think it might take the cake for worst voic acting I've ever heard in a game. By the end I just turned on the subtitles and started skipping through the sequences. If I had to hear either of the main characters deliver even one more sentence I would've thrown my speakers against the wall.  The interface is clumsy and buggy. I repeatedly ran into parts where untranslated cyrillic appeared instead of the English options. Talk about not knowing what to do.  Honestly, all of that pales in comparison to the real problem: the story. I like the idea of traveling through time to save the environment, but the writers got all the possible details wrong. It's like this game was paid for by coal and oil companies. They blame nuclear power for the end of the world. It's the worst kind of naive reactivism. Just to be clear: nuclear power is the cleanest, most sustainable way forward for human civilization. To pretend otherwise and preach it publicly in a game like this is the worst kind of sin. Even if everything else about the game were perfect I still wouldn't be able to support it. But there's plenty else wrong.
3588	0	a	Story is fairly poor with the main message being climate change is bad. Very generic  Bad English voice acting doesn't help the uninteresting story  I would not recommend.
3589	0	a	why did I buy this piece of algae. Decent story, weird 'game'. Good for wasting time. Thinking back on why I bought this game, nvm it's not good don't.
3590	0	a	a thrilling and current theme with some promising artistic comic-like graphics is wasted by unnecessary game length, tortured game play and pointless dialogues and monologues. a waste of time. such a bore...
3591	0	a	I'm really not sure why I played through the entire game. I guess I kept hoping it would get better. I tend to like games by this company, but this was pure awful. The voice acting in it is terrible. There are spelling errors galore. Weird choices in dialog are everywhere. It has a flop of an ending. It would randomly switch to russian subtitles. The characters are often laughably stupid... it's just bad..
3592	0	a	Standard P'n'C adventure. Climate change message a bit heavy handed. Audio can be slightly choppy, i.e. transitions in dialog aren't as fluid. Reminds me of 90's era adventure games, which is surprising since this is much more modern. I'd recommend for children perhaps (interactive story w/ a message), but there are better adventure games out there if you have limited time to play.
3593	0	a	While I'm usually a huge fan of Daedalic and point and click adventure games, this game wasn't really my cup of tea. While I expected from the trailer that it was going to be really heavy on the ecology rhetoric, I expected it to at least be well thought out and more of a basic subtext. Instead, it's more like they're battering you in the face with a rusty aluminum baseball bat than kindly trying to change your mind about the immediacy of problems with our environment.  The villain is lame, the characters you play as are even more lame, and I had a really hard time caring about anything that was going on in the game. The gameplay aspects are semi challenging and I liked that some of the more obtuse puzzles can be skipped past at the cost of loosing an achievement. If the story and characters were better, I would have liked it. But, alas, they were not. I wouldn't recommend this game.
3594	0	a	While I wanted to like this game, with its beautiful art and seemingly interesting plot, the voice 'acting' is awful-- they might as well have used Siri's voice. It was so bad I turned off the sound, it was so distracting that it took away from the story. I had a better time when the sound was off and reading subtitles, but still, that should *not* be the case at all.   The story was not really all that engaging, and personally, I didn't care much for the characters due to their shallow character development and awful voices. This is absolutely vital for a game of this type. As much potential as this game had, it really fell short due to a lack of focus when it comes to the fundamentals of what makes up a great game.
3595	0	a	This one isn't so exciting. It's part of the Daedalic bundle but it's not finely polished. There are bugs and the story is pretty dry. You have the power of time travel and you don't nip the problem in the bud? Most silly.  PROS 1. Not so Sure Not sure what to say.  CONS 1. Dry Story All about climate change and time travelling agents who could control the world but decided to use the most inefficient methods of protesting and eco-terrorism.  2. Gameboomer Well, I don't think a game should be that difficult that you have to check every single detail in the game. E.g. Giving the orange-juice wine cooler. Where did you get the orange juice? From a mop closet.
3596	0	a	I enjoyed all of the time travel pieces, but after three or four levels my save got erased in an update. Apparently it's a known issue. I was told to download some existing savegames and tried to do that with no success. Eventually I decided I wasn't interested enough to try.  I was very interested in the plot and love adventure games, but this one I had to really try to like. Coupled with my save issues, I just can't recommend it. And it's killing me because I want to like it by all of the constituent pieces (Scifi time travel adventure game), but uggghhhh...
3597	0	a	A New Beginning is a traditional point and click adventure which unfortunately suffers from many of the issues common to the genre.   Thankfully the numerous hot spots on each screen can be highlighted but there are simply too many options that elicit dull responses. Why have the options there if they aren’t required and don’t add anything to the game? It just ruins the pace and add to frustration.   To win you over, adventure games need stories and characters that are interesting and absorb you into the world. Unfortunately here the story itself is a rather cheesy affair (unless you happen to think that A Day After Tomorrow was a deep and poignant film) and the voice overs for the characters are a terrible misfire, either blandly monotone or with terrible intonation throughout.
3598	0	a	Mediocre at its best. Not worth it, even with German dialogue.
3599	0	a	Everytime I click something, the dialouge skips or it doesn`t work!  ITS FRUSTRATING  Hope steam gives me a refund!   *refunded*
3600	0	a	Hard to take due to the Shatner-esque in-game dialogue.
3601	0	a	Sorry to be negative, but the game is really slow and boring with flat 2-D comic book pages and clunky animation. I de-installed it after just 10 minutes of tedium.
3602	0	a	I wanted to like it, The voice acting was terrible, the interface was clunky, and the animation was sub par. The backgrounds were great, and the story kept me along for the ride, but that isn't enough to save this from itself. It felt like I was playing a game that was only three quarters finished.
3603	0	a	Maybe these kind of games are not for me, who can say.  What i know is i got really bored after a few hours of playing. I looked for a walkthrough to see how much torture i would get by finishing the game and i noticed i only made maybe 20% of it. So this is it, can't bare more hours of this.  More about the game, conversations are strange and annoying. People don't act natural. I can understand conflict as long as it's justified. However people in this game act like ♥♥♥♥ with no reason, which turns a nice story into a drama worse than Days of our lives.  I'm sorry i paid for it.
3604	0	a	This game has beautiful art and cinematics, and that's about the only thing I really enjoyed. The characters are cringe-worthy and largely unlikeable or unrelateable, and it's a shame that the polish of the rest of the game is interrupted by such amateur writing. Fay is portrayed quite negatively as a highly-strung trope of a girl with idiotic naivety and rampantly uncontrolled emotions. Her looks and good heart seem to be her only selling points; it's as if the only reason she's on her time-travelling mission is because there were simply no others left for the job. (that may have been implied...? Can't recall.) She's scolded frequently by Bent Svensson for her emotional frailty--and I couldn't help feeling that her femininity was implied as the cause for that--and the very mechanics of the game set her up to fail in her own narrative. While playing through her perspective, I found myself only able to continue the story and solve the puzzles by doing something obviously *wrong*, to which Fay seemed to respond every time with giggles and suggestions of 'whoops, oh well, I'm sure it doesn't matter.' (paraphrasing slightly, but that's essentially it.) It's insulting. It doesn't build character, it alienates any players hoping to have someone intelligent, youthful and capable to align themselves with. As for Bent Svensson, I don't even want to get started. The entire start of the game is completely uncompelling, having to play along a boring retiree fixing his motor and shunning all connections to humanity. He stares at pictures of his family mournfully, monologuing about how 'oh, if I wasn't so focussed on saving the world, I might have had time to enjoy my wife before she passed away! I ruined my marriage with my higher calling! IF ONLY I WASN'T SO SELFLESS. Woe is me.' Eeeeeuuuuurgh. Somehow I doubt his job is the reason his wife might have passed away feeling unloved in the marriage. He must also have pretty low opinions of his deceased wife and family, if he thinks they all put themselves before work that could solve problems for thousands/millions of people. His odd combination of self-pity, self-doubt and inflated self-importance/righteousness make for very dreary dialogue. At one point you even have to repeat the phrase 'I am not responsible for the whole world' into the phone to his therapist, before immediately being confronted with Fay telling Bent 'YOu are the only one who can save the world!' The timing couldn't make me roll my eyes more. I cannot even imagine what that juxtaposition was meant to achieve, apart from recreating the typical everyman hero who manages to be important without having any admirable traits whatsoever. Bent is abrasive, slow, perhaps realistic but certainly not the kind of realistic that makes for compelling drama or makes you want to root for the characters. More the type that you try to avoid in day-to-day life. Fay and Bent could have been good foils for each other's characters, but Bent doesn't seem to hold enough respect for Fay for her to improve his character in any way, and instead of Fay's youthful exuberance being played out as a good counterbalance to Bent's dragged feet, the balance between the two doesn't quite match up. Perhaps the teeth-gratingly bad dialogue is due to poor translation, perhaps it wasn't even good to begin with. I'll never know. The voice-acting is pretty wooden, too. There are certainly sections of dialogue that wouldn't have sounded quite as bad with better delivery, but let's be honest; no actors can make a truly bad script sound good. Good dialogue can survive bad delivery, but this is not good dialogue. Overall I haven't even managed to finish the game because the characters and their chemistry are so distractingly negative and cringe-worthy. It's one thing to aim for realistic flaws that add conflict, it's another to disrupt flow and immersion with their problems. It's embarrassing that a narrative-focussed game would rely on such badly written characters to draw players into the story. I'm certainly not impressed enough to pull through to the end, not with all that I've experienced of it so far.
3605	0	a	I played through this game from beginning to end, Steam tells me I've spent 8h.  I like the graphics and the style of the game takes me back to games that I loved like the Monkey Island story, but as a modern game it falls short.  I think the main problem is the format. The puzzles that you can build with a point and click interface are either dead simple or illogical. You end up knowing what the problem is, but struggle with how the game wants you to solve the problem.  All in all this is a nice game, but given what the gaming market is like today I would not recommend it.
3606	0	a	This game is boring , very slow and extremly linear. The story contains many little frustrating holes and is just another way to try make people enviromentaly conscious but only manages to talk about the cliche points we know already. The description says the game is witty but i havent found that anywhere. The characters are very cliche. The game looks very graphic novel like the intention is but it misses dynamics.  I know my account says I only played 0.5 hours but I guess something went wrong because I played for a total of about 3 hours
3607	0	a	The female protagonist is walking around like Donald Duck, the characters are simplistic and one-dimensional, the english voice acting is mediocre, the story is boring and feels sluggish, the controls feel clumpsy. I gave up after the second mayor bug in the game.
3608	0	a	I'm an avid fan of point-and-click adventure games (as evident from my game library), and I have to say that this game is atrocious. The programming is bad and riddled with bugs (audio and text often going out of sync, characters disappearing, text getting replaced with random Russian characters), but none of that would be such a dealbreaker if most of the puzzles weren't completely nonsensical and relied on the old 'try everything with everything' approach. While the adventure game genre generally suffers from the mentioned problem to some extent, some games are better than others and actually rely on logic and don't expect you to get into the programmer's head in order to solve them. Story-wise, it's nothing special and most characters aren't even likeable.  Give this one a miss. Pure disappointment.
3609	0	a	This game looks like a lot of buried potential. It has interesting setting, quite relatable characters, non very common animation style - similar to comic book, but all of this is spoiled by very buggy translation(I played English version) and engine,   Translation problems very likely come mostly from the fact that not all sound content was translated to English. So some dialogs are just fastforwarded without audio and too fast to read.   Couple of times I had to reload to restore disappeared mouse pointer. Not very convenient interface of inventory and gameplay as whole.  Plot holes itself could have been justified by being the plot devices itself    (as we know Fay is terrible liar)  , but not all of them are so easily excusable.   If there were no bugs I would rate this game 7/10 for plot and 6/10 for gameplay.
3610	0	a	I'm generally not a fan of the point-and-click puzzle genre, and this game is a good example of why that is. The user interface is clunky (you have to click-and-hold on everything to get a menu, although the menu often has only one item, or two useless items like 'Look at' which causes your character to make a useless comment, or 'Use' which often makes the character say something like 'nah, I don't want to use that right now'.) You constantly have to solve puzzles with non-obvious solutions, even though there might be an obvious solution. Example: you need a paddle for a 'boat' at some point. You're not allowed to use the broom that's sitting right there in the background; instead you have to combine a rope with a dustpan in your inventory and then combine dustpan-with-rope with a metal rod. The metal rod itself was part of a stairway's normal-looking metal handrail, and somehow you can rip it off from the rest of the handrail. And, there's a large quantity of really boring dialogue.
3611	0	a	Hard to take due to the Shatner-esque in-game dialogue.
3612	0	a	I've never been so bored in my life.
3613	0	a	A decent adventure game from Daedelic, however the absolutely abysmal voice acting ruins it as mentioned by other reviewers. It's seriously that bad; the phrases are spoken with completely random intonations that more often than not do not relate to the situation at all. If you buy it, play it on mute.

3615	0	a	I really wanted to like this game. Point and clicks are not my favorite but once in awhile I get a hankering to play a good one so I did my research in my out of control game library(I know I have a problem) and saw this one. Looked cool, had positive reviews so ok I try this one. I know I'm beating a dead horse but the voice acting was not good. The artwork was good and reminded me of the good ole days when point and click were kings(but better than old days). For some reason I liked the premise of the story but then I felt like I was being preached to like some government infomercial (like refer madness but for climate change). Also it felt a bit ridiculous... Overall I am really sad I could not like this game more I had such high hopes.
3616	0	a	I've yet to play through it completely and I do plan on but keep in mind this is my impression so far after prologe. The art is nice but the characters don't match in the sceanery. THE VOICE ACTING IS TERRIBLE. I HAD TO JUST TURN IT OFF WHEN I GOT TO CHAPTER 1. The story so far is unintresting and unengaging, and our protaganist is a whiney pathetic man who get's annoying really quickly. At least the art is very nice.

3618	0	a	Game is clunky and broken, random crashes, inventory menu stopped coming up.  Terrible voice translation.  Save your money
3619	0	a	The initial puzzles are cryptic.  Worse, this game provides dialogue 'options' that aren't actually options. As far as I've gotten there's always only one dialogue choice that has any impact which removes all player agency. The conversation with the stupid psychologist is especially awfull. Forcing the player to select the magic words to get out of a phone conversation instead of, you know, hanging up and helping the woman coughing up blood is terrible. If the story requires certain dialogue paths, just run through them; don't force the player to be complicit in the tragedy being shoved down their throat.  
3620	0	a	The worst voice acting I have ever heard, a heavy-handed political agenda, and bugs galore. All puzzles are too easy to solve and entirely skippable, Daedalic's contribution to the decline of the point-and-click adventure game genre. The tool wheel is frustrating, and context-sensitive item text will randomly turn into Cyrillic script for no apparent reason. Characters will often become permenantly stuck at room exits, forcing you to reload a previous save: So save often. I'm just glad that I didn't pay full price for this incredible disappointment. 'More than 20 hours' worth of game time' directly translates into approximately six hours and possibly seven if you've decided to solve the puzzles yourself. Do not buy this game.
3621	0	a	The irony is in the name - 'Final Cut'......... it would've been better calling it 'Draft Copy.'  The premise is ok being an original storyline. Also, the cut scenes in graphic novel format are a good idea except it was poorly executed. There was no voice sync at all and if you had subtitles switched on they obscure 90% of the text.  Worst of all was the voice acting. Clearly, the actors had no idea what they were reading. It was so forced, stilted and often with out the correct emphasis I spent half my time shouting at the speakers, it's just so painful to listen to. The translation, grammar and vocabulary was also very poor.  Overall, the game has the feeling of being a rushed product which is a shame as the visuals are pretty good. But when faced with such terrible voice acting it really detracts from the good stuff and for that reason it has zero replayability.
3622	0	a	This game starts out with a bang and the fizzles out at the start. Its the end of the world and they are sending some one back to the past. So we start with a sad sack of a man who mostly wallows in self pity at his life. We start with him trying to fix a fogger machine. So the adventure starts for 10 to 15 minutes you have to work on getting a fogger activated. Wow. Heavy stuff. You later need a part in a locked up shed. Does the sad sack know where its at? No because he got drunk and hid it. Spoiler its behind a picture on the wall. Now you would have to be very dexterous with you hands to put a key behind a picture in a framed photo. However this guy was drunk and some how managed it.   I found this game to be very tedious and nit picky. Example for the key to work you have to select said key and then direct it to the door. If you try and click on the guy to open the door you will get a I dont know where the key is I got drunk.? Ugh. So its very tedious like that. Graphics are fine. Sound is good. Gameplay bored me to tears.   I watched a youtube to figure out where the key was hidden. The game is an exercise in tedium. The game might be for some who want to take a hands on approach. Me I was bored from the moment I had to fix a fog machine.
3623	0	a	looks the part, but the story is too preachy, idealistic and cheesy, some of the dialogue is downright cringeworthy. the puzzles feel unrewarding to complete and are pretty easy. not that i disagree with the message but stories have to be more than idealistic preaching.
3624	0	a	Can be recommended for scaring the ♥♥♥♥ out of 10 year olds with dangers of global warming in the future, nothing more. Cliche, boring, repetitive, not interesting, poorly drawn environment. If people will continue to create games like this, I'm totally fine with environmental problems dooming us all.
3625	0	a	I'm not sure what the reception for its original release was, but as is, the game is archaic and drags behind in today's standards. It would be difficult for me to recommend this game for any adventure game enthusiasts without mentioning the names of at least 5 or 6 games that are superior to it, unless you're a tree-hugging green energy nut who believes that videogames are not addressing the subject of global warming enough. If that's the case, then by all means put down your cash and jump for joy, but don't expect me to stop twiddling my fingers and yawning.
3626	0	a	Time traveling hippies are trying to save the world by begging a grumpy norwegian scientist to help them. The story really isn't too interesting, it's the kinda I started reading it, now I have to see it through until the end, as it would bother me not to know. It's pretty predictable with a standard cheesy bad guy involved.  As for the characters, there really wasn't anyone I particularly liked or stood out to me. Fay could have been a very interesting character by telling of her time and how she grew up, but you only get a few ideas of how her world is like. Appearently she is supposed to be so clueless about the world as she doesn't even know what coffee is, yet she knows how to use a fax. She seems to swap knowledge throughout the story. The main character Bent is unlikable. Grumpy man who can't admit being wrong and doesn't really try either even though the plot gives him several oppertunities to make things right between himself and his family.  I do give the game credit for featuring a gay character.   The game is extremely buggy and utterly clumsy at times. The main problem being the cursor and how you interact with things. To interact with something, you have to leftclick and hold, then steer the mouse towards the option you want and then let go. Many times I found myself struggling to select the choice I wanted. The control feels extremely unresponsive at times. Sometimes it's also hard to interact with the objects on the screen. I had to look at a guide on the internet to advance at one point, because I really couldn't make the cursor register a pair of keys unless I knew exactly in what area to click. Other times I followed a guide and I still had problems activating certain items. The game can be annoyingly picky at times. Certain times you need to open every drawer, other times you only need to click on one drawer to open them all. Due to being forced into this awkward click-hold-and-steer combination, I often find myself being unable to deselect items without having the character comment on it. Sometimes the dialogue can be quite long, so missclicks becomes tedious.   Secondly, the game wasn't obviously throughouly tested. One part of the game, the dialogue skipped completely and the objects I interacted with were so unresponsive, that I missed the whole dialogue in one of the important scenes. And it wasn't just some random talk, it was a key plot event.  Sometimes certain objects wouldn't trigger any reactions at all, making me wonder if I failed to click it. Other times, it caused the character to suddenly speak german! There are options in the games that are not translated at all. One door only has two russian options, neither which I could understand what they meant.  The end credits are bugged, you only get to see half before the game skips and loads something else.  The subtitles in the game don't always match up with what the characters say and sometimes the text loads long before the dialogue is even spoken.   The voiceacting in the game was horrible! Almost every actor in the game has a wooden, monotone speech. No matter the situation, they have the same level of emotion. During critical situations or emotionally charged scenes, you really notice how terrible it is. It's obvious at times the actors aren't even trying. The main characters are unfortunately among the worst actors.  I don't know whether it was a fault of the translation or because I just couldn't follow the plot, but more than half the time I had no idea what the characters wanted me to do. The characters don't give any good clues when you use objects, just some random nonsense like No, Um, Nope, Hm, Nah. I don't feel like I have had this problem before with these kinds of games, usually you are provided with a clear objective. There are also times where I was quite baffled as the game seemed to skip out on it's own plot and advanced anyway. As an example, Fay decides to go looking for a person, but then she just... forgets about it? And that's even after making a huge deal about finding the person.   It's unfortunate the game is riddled with so many bad things, because the artwork and style is amazing. I loved how the game plays out like a comic and the characters look drawn in every environment, blending in perfectly with the background. Visually, this game is so pleasing to the eyes. The way the comic styled art is drawn during the cutscenes is interesting to watch and feels very unique. The whole game feels like reading a comic book rather than just playing a PC game.  Unfortunately, the horrendous voiceacting manages to ruin it. You see Bent or Fay expressing a strong emotion, but the only thing you hear is the emotional investment of a decaying zombie.
3627	0	a	The only good aspects of this game are the graphics and, a little bit, the story whereas the gameplay is awful and illogical (the kind of illogicality you usually find in games like monkey island or sam&amp;max, ect.) and in light of the themes involved (pollution, extinction and similar, dealt in a serious way above all) you find yourself confused because it's not a humorous game neither thriller or horror game, so what? It's a mild game?! And due to this I get stuck a lot of time because I couldn't figure out what should be the 'action' to let move along the game (I had to use the walkthrough too many times, very too!). I think the gameplay need to mirror the type of game is adopted to; so, for me, thumb down.  Buy it, only if it's on really low discount
3628	0	a	'I need your help!' 'I don't want to.' 'But it's important!' 'Well, ok then.'
3629	0	a	Bad Storyline and bad voice acting ill give it 3/10.
3630	0	a	I bought this when it was on sale, so I'm not out a ton of money for the game, but had I known what it was about prior to buying a package deal, I would have saved the cash.   The storyline is depressing and centered around uncompelling characters. The game has a tendency to beat the player over the head with environmentalist issues. However, the bugs and unintuitive nature of the puzzles are what make it fairly frustrating to play. I've only gotten through maybe half of Chapter 2, but the game avatar is now stuck and unresponsive to movement commands, meaning I won't be bothering to play it through in the future.
3631	0	a	Hello earthlings. We love video...games and we know you....would love this one.  Now this may in fact be due to the translation, but this is stilted and unnatural writing and voice acting even for a robot. And not only is the message preachy but also misguided at best or horribly intellectually dishonest at worst. The game starts off with you repairing a machine who's sole purpose is to kill all of the wild life in the forest in order to keep the wood fresh, whatever that means. So I don’t know about you, but I use a wood burning furnace to heat my home during the winter and I don’t poison all living creatures in order to keep the wood fresh. No what you do is chop a tree down (normally a dead one or one that needs to be moved) and then you split and stack it and depending on the wood you have leave It for a year to be burned later. I’m sorry I just lied to you because in order to burn wood you must use a poison gas emitter in order to kill (as the game shows) or smoke out (how this would work if you’re ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ enough to actually do this) all living things, because when you run out of wood to burn you need to chop down the next tree, one at a time, in ten below weather and in the middle of a snow storm. This is in the first few minutes of game play and it doesn’t get better. This isn’t even preaching, this is as if an alien traveled to earth and decided to make videogame who just choose to make a game based off a popular topic and he is painfully unaware that everyone can tell he is not human.  
3632	0	a	Some of the puzzles are so weird that even after reading a FAQ on them, I still didn't understand what was going on. My feelings for the characters varied from mild disdain to out-right hostility (Salvador) and the twist at the end felt like something they shoe-horned in because it had to have a twist. In fact they hinted at a better ending *Spoiler alert* with the discussion of 'did our travelling back in time cause the accident' and then never spoke of it again.
3633	0	a	I wish there was an option for like an 'eh' feeling for game reccomandation. Everything seemed good, but my game keeps crashing near the end of episode one, in the same exact place and it doesn't save. So I have to go through all that same crap again.
3634	0	a	Very glitchy. Full program aborting on many levels. I've also been trapped in the Brazilian bar level whichI havent currently been able to circumvent yet. It can really try your patience at times. Unfortunate because weak programming aside, I actually enjoyed the overall plot, levels, illustrations, puzzles. It really had some strengths that kept me playing. The puzzles are quite hard at times but not impossible although it would take Batman not to look up a walkthrough at least once during the game. The voice acting is comically bad for the most part and is highlighted to spectacular effect by the leading character who sounds like he is being played by a computer generated program rather than a real human being. It's dialogue is too blatant and preachy when subtlety would have been more effective in getting the audience to enjoy the story first before thinking about ecological issues. Overall it was heading to a 6/10 but i've got no forgiveness for a game that crashes repeatedly this far after its original release. Now its looking at a 4/10 and im feeling deflated and defeated. I'm currently weighing up a deep philosophical debate about whether I can be bothered to open this up again; i feel that is an important emotion to leave on record...
3635	0	a	Well, it's hard to rate it, but I will lean towards 'NO' because although the story and riddles are solid the whole game lacks the excitement factor and it seems rather flat. I completed the game, but did not feel any urge to do so other than that I need to finish it and move to another. So, all in all, if you are a fan of point and click, I think there are better titles out there.
3636	0	a	Art style is good, and puzzles are alright, but the (English)voice actors are very robotic, and the storytelling is very poor. The game tries to tell the story from a first-person POV, but it doesn't seem like I'm actually playing as him, just talking to him. Rather than saying what he actually thinks, he reacts more like he is being questioned. Art style is good, and puzzles are alright.
3637	0	a	I thought this would be cool because of the comic book style and whatnot, and I just...I don't know what I was thinking. The English voice acting is atrocious. I tried to play it in French but I am not proficient enough. I had to switch back to English and then I stopped playing entirely because I couldn't play through the pain of listening to it.  Sorry, production team.

3640	0	a	If you are looking for a point and click adventure game, then this is an enjoyable game to play. So if that is all you are looking for, then get this game.  However, the rough english translations prevented me from enjoying this game. It's quite obvious this game was translated into english, as some of the phrases that were said just kicked out enjoyment that I had. I'm pretty sure that the story was quite enjoyable and believable when it was written in it's native language, but the horrible translation made everything so stupid. If it had been translated better, I'm pretty sure the game would have been much more enjoyable.  The game was fun but the poor translation prevents me from recommending this game.
3641	0	a	This game is a fairly average point and click adventure. Some people love to hate on it simply because of its story; an environmental 'save the planet OMG' tale. However, taking the game as a whole, I'd just say it's ok. Not great, not terrible. The voice-acting is mostly passable, the story is moderately interesting despite feeling like an EPA advertisement, and the graphics and environments were pretty nice. The game also, unfortunately, falls into the same traps that many other point and click adventure games have: obscure (and I mean OBSCURE) connections between items that are necessary to complete puzzles, etc. in order to progress. I had to use a walkthrough to complete the game...the puzzles just didn't flow naturally to me. Most of it I could figure out, but I wanted to finish the story, not revisit the same place over and over again to find out I needed one guy in a room watching a microwave in order to steal something.  It's worth it I think if you get it in a cheap bundle or on sale. $4 or $5 at the most.
3642	0	a	The graphic novel style is cool but that's about all this game has going for it.  On the other hand the list of cons stretches on:  Voice acting often sounds computerized Messy story that does a lot of jumping around Puzzles that ignore basic logic Out of time and misspelled subtitles Mouthes of characters move out of sync with the dialogue Requires a lot of running from one end of a level and back again without achieving much Lots of bugs that mean things don't work as they should and the game will randomly crash  It was a struggle to push myself to finish this game and I urge you not to do the same. Even if the game is on special for a few dollars don't waste your money 3.5/10
3643	0	a	This is going to sound harsh, and its going to sound like I didn't do enough of my research or that maybe this just isn't my game, and although those things are probably all true, there is no way I could have continued after the second hour of the most terrible voice acting I have ever witnessed. It's a point and click, which I have played and have enjoyed previously, but this one just has so little action and puzzle that I sit there eventually skipping through lines to get to the good stuff. I feel like I don't need to say this for anyone who has access to watching some gameplay, but the voices--the voice acting--is terrible. Constantly line after line, the characters lead off into everchanging moods and tones so that one sentence they are mourning the complete annihilation of San Francisco and then the next line that literally overlaps their own voice, they are making a joke about an antenna.  The story is really cheesy too. Scientists are coming back from the future to make people in the past recycle more. I feel like this should be maybe one episode of a children's show, and then nothing past that, I would be satisfied. Keep it in the very front of your mind that I am reviewing my personal experience of the game and someone else might like it, don't get upset that I'm bashing your favorite game (but seriously, your FAVORITE GAME?! What are you, 5?)  It needs more pointing and clicking and solving of puzzles.  Overall: 2/10
3644	0	a	I love point and click games and this ecology story looked interesting to me, but for which audience was this game destined to? Kids only? This game was so irritating to listen to. But how can some main character be so stupid !!! I do not understand how one can come up with such development. I tried to play, but finally uninstalled it because I could not play a game anymore where I just want to slap a character to wake her up to her senses.

3646	0	a	This game has a great premise, a great soundtrack and falls flat on the face due technical issues later in the game and in the last third of the game, the plot falls over itself flat on the face.   Some technical notes:  - don't mix savegames of non-steam versions (GOG) with the steam versions.  - you cannot save after being in the jungle and you have to play through the rest of the game.  - there is some bug where all protagonists are a black shilouette after loading a savegame. 
3647	0	a	The only good thing going for this point and click adventure title is the detailed and amazing hand-drawn graphics. Other than that, everything else is either mediocre (sound/animations/puzzles/story) or downright bad (voice acting/characters).  I've also had stability issues when the game quit by itself and after not playing for a couple of days and coming back, I found out that my save files had disappeared completely for no reason.   Even if you're into adventure games like this, you'll find TONS of better titles on steam alone. Not recommended and very passable.

3649	0	a	PRO: -Beautifully animated -Lushly-painted backgrounds -Lovely soundtrack -Classic point-and-click Adventure Game interface  CON: -Mediocre voice-acting -Badly-translated dialogue -All accents are American, regardless of the characters' nationality -One-dimensional and unlikeable characters -Clunky &amp; non-responsive in-game action-wheel for interacting with objects &amp; characters -Hackneyed plot (eg: the 1989 film 'Millennium' did it better) -Pseudo-scientific environmentalist propaganda so hyperbolic it would make Al Gore and Captain Planet alike roll their eyes.  -Seriously, it's so ham-fisted, overly-simplisitc and alarmist that if you combined 'Waterworld' &amp; 'Ferngully' the end result would still seem subtle by comparison with this game.

3653	0	a	This has got to be one of the worst point &amp; click I've ever played. Apart from the base artwork (not including the average comic cutscenes), the whole thing feels really amateurish. The gameplay is ridiculously messy and tedious (for example, why do we have to hold the mouse button for every single interaction, why?? and why are some elements in big puzzles so hard to click?), which is quite mind-boggling for a point &amp; click game. Add some terrible puzzle designs to this and you get a pretty unpleasant game to play overall. Hell, you just need to go 5 minutes into the game to feel something is wrong thanks to this crazy non-sensical 1st puzzle. For this reason, I ended up using a walkthrough to get through after a few hours in, because I still wanted to know where the story was going.  Speaking of the story, it feels like it's been written by some naive 14 years old who just got into environmental activism. The poor translation and dreadful acting probably doesn't help, but it still feels incredibly cheesy and convoluted, especially near the end. In fact, it felt like watching a really bad 80s movie where everything gets so ridiculous it becomes funny and that's probably what kept me playing till the end! For this reason alone, I'd recommend this game, if the gameplay wasn't so painful.  Anyway, if you like point &amp; click games, don't let this deter you from other Daedelic titles. They're usually quite successful at crafting very nice characters and universes. I especially enjoyed the Edna &amp; Harvey and the Deponia series for instance.
3654	0	a	I played the game for a couple chapters, but eventually decided that I wasn't having nearly enough fun to justify spending any more time on it -- nor, for that matter, to justify taking up 4 gigs of space on my hard drive. It's a point-and-click puzzle game, but the puzzles are seldom of the 'reasonable challenge' variety; they're either painfully obvious, or painfully obtuse where you only stumble across them by trying absolutely every way to be wrong (e.g., boosting a laser's power by adding a lens cut away from the plastic cover for a neon sign, which you may recognize as a technique that wouldn't work). This is often magnified by the puzzles having perfectly logical solutions that the game ignores in favor of going around in circles and repeating the same action several times until it finally gives a different result. (It even gives an achievement for putting up with the 'Quickie' computer character that embodies one of these moments.)  I grew up with the puzzle games from Sierra and LucasArts; I get that lateral thinking is a large part of the genre, and that it's easy for developers to miss the mark and come up with a 'solution' that can only be seen in hindsight. But those games balanced it out by making it worthwhile with good stories. This game does not. It's an extremely heavy-handed story about climate change, bearing a strong resemblance to the film  2012  in its 'We're all doomed RIGHT NOW' approach. It's not that I object to the message itself; it's that the message isn't entertaining, which is the one and only possible purpose of a video game. I'm not really geared up to spend several hours lecturing myself. Coupled with protagonists who are utterly unlikeable (one terminally depressed, one aggressively arrogant, both humorless), and there's simply nothing to make me want to play much past the beginning of  A New Beginning .
3655	0	a	A nice storyline. The male protagonist is sarcastically fun. That voice actor is decent, but not Fay's.  Puzzles are lack of hints, and there are a lot of bugs. Some take hours to figure out. For example: In the exhibition, if you use splice on the desert, and look at the desert while that guy is coughing, he will become tranparent and reply you.  Don't buy it unless you are over-smart and got a lot of time to waste.
3656	0	a	The plot was bad enough but this game would have been so much better without the voice acting. Captain Planet meets back to the future, it isn't pretty. The only reason I played this was because it was gifted and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else.

But unfortunately 'A New Beginnig - Final Cut' couldn't convince me at all. First, the story (in my opinion the most important part about a P&amp;C): at the start the plot sounded quite interesting: a myserious woman from the future asks you to help her save the world but while I was waiting for a mindblowing story to evolve, I was disappointed by a rigmarole that didn't take any step forward until the end of the game when a 'sudden' turning point tried to save my day ... in vain. Not only was the story's outcome in my opinion totally obvious, it also turned into an annoying preaching and made the last cutscene seem to take forever. The difficulty is quite low. I can understand that no one wants to search each and every pixel to find necessary items. That's why I decided to rather evaluate the mini-game-difficulty, and that is really poor: little puzzles in P&amp;Cs are ment to let you enjoy a little, fresh breeze because searching for clickables can be awefully teasing. But 'A New Beginning' doesn't offer any good or original ideas in this case; within seconds you can master all of the riddles and so they just contribute to lengthening the game time without increasing the fun. The gameplay is solid, but all animations take too much time and simply turn out to be frustrating when you're forced to backtrack or simply can't find the essential piece that's missing. Moving-Animations are not of the best quality, they look clunky and sometimes over-stylized (e.g. character postures) so that they almost appear unrealistic and ridiciulous. This might be a possible design-decision that comes along with the cartoonish graphic-style, that - in general - is rather mediocre (dreary color-set, unimpressive location-design, no high-resolution). But even if, I would state that this design-decision was a bad one, because it brakes the sympathy for the protagonists. The replayability is in my honest opinion practically zero. I personally didn't use any guides for the achievements but still it was easy-going to earn all of them in 'one playthrough': I simply saved before every special interaction and when I unlocked one of the badges I went back to see if I could get an alternative answer/question/interaction. Unfortunately, all of the alternatives don't contribute to the story, at all.  ~Conclusion~ 'A New Beginning - Final Cut' is - in my opinion - one of the suboptimal Point&amp;Click-Adventures. It rather confirms some people's opinion that this genre is boring and has no challenges, at all. Additionally, it can't even convince with its story or characters. I personally really disliked the female protagonist, who took a lot of wrong decisions that simply made her look stupid, impertinent and immature; and none of this contributed to the plot in a positive way. If you're looking for a good P&amp;C you should rather consider buying another game that is able to build up tension with a really compelling mystery that keeps you going because you want to know the secret behind the curtain (not because you want to grind achievements :P). But at least one positive thing has to be added: the game worked without any bugs or losses for me; savegames loaded and saved as intended, no glitches were found or other similar broken game-parts that let you crash or get stuck. No technical issues, at all.
3658	0	a	Extremely buggy. Running it in Win 7 ulitmate. It has crashed twice in less than a hour.
3659	0	a	Main character looks like typical pedophile. Horrible.
3660	0	a	Well, all of the women die, The plot throws in a bad twist at the very last minute, and there are far more deaths than are necessary, even for a grim storyline. All of the people treated as bad guys by the narrative are also not white. Coincidence?  The art is good, but I really don't understand why Fay has to swing her hips when she's otherwise always in a strict, disciplined position. It took me out of the puzzles every time. Unfortunately, the art looks creepy when paired with the voice acting, most of which was frighteningly bad. Duve's actor was the best one, and everyone else was either between 'Meh' and 'oh god make it stop'.   The game has this duality in that it's a puzzle game and a story game, and while the puzzles are pretty good and some were real brain-scratchers, the story was so flat, forced, and nonsensical that the whole game suffers.   There are also a lot of glitches. Half of the time I clicked on an item, the selection text would come up in Cryllic letters, or Italian. Some cutscenes never played at all, and the game crashed at least 3 times. This game is not ready to be published, and I'm annoyed that I had to pay money for it. Even if you like the story, I imagine everyone would be annoyed by the glitches.   If the developers want to make another game in the future, I'd say to stick to the puzzle aspect, don't try so hard to make the story so epic, work on the uncanny-valley-ness of the voiceovers and art, fix the glitches, and create women characters who don't have to be sexy every second, because that's super distracting.
3661	0	a	For the 'final cut,' you'd think they would have fixed all the bugs and glitches, finished the translation, and gotten some decent voice actors.
3662	0	a	Survive the voice acting and save the ALGA!
3663	0	a	Atrocious voice acting made me quit before I could figure out if the game was any good.
3664	0	a	The story is alright, but the voice acting is less than stellar. As others have said, there are some mismatches between spoken dialogue and the text, and the biggest offense is the text randomly changing languages. It's infrequent, and usually only happens in the flavor dialogue. There was one instance where I felt like I was losing out on puzzle solving information. I don't recommend this game to any but the genre fans who just can't get enough.
3665	0	a	DISCLAIMER: This is a repost from my blog at  www.stanislavcostiuc.com.  I don't write reviews. I write opinion and impressions pieces, meaning the detalization may vary from just general feelings about a game to indepth critique of particular game mechanics. Read if you're interested to know if I like a game or not (and for what reasons), which parts intrigue me and which parts push me away, but don't expect in-depth description of all gameplay and systems. Thank you.  I am a fan of classic point &amp; click adventure games. And as a fan of adventure games, I want to really like A New Beginning, but I can’t. Which is sad, because the story really intrigues me, but there’s just too many flaws that accumulate and are hard to look past by in a title of this genre.  The interface is very laggy. To interact with objects, you hold the mouse button, a wheel appears, and you select the action from that wheel by moving the mouse around and then releasing it. In theory that’s a nice system, but in practice the way it’s implemented in A New Beginning is very annoying. It takes like half a second to a second for the game to realize that you’re holding the mouse, and then there’s a half a second to a second animation of the wheel appearing. And this really messes with the game flow. You interact with a lot of objects in an adventure game, and check what contextual actions are available, so in a minute of gameplay approximately 15 seconds are just waiting for the wheel to appear.  And speaking of actions, the wheel doesn’t have a set amount of them, it depends on the object itself. Which is why it’s so annoying when there’s a ‘Take’ action on an object which exists for the character to say that he doesn’t need it (the fact that you’ve spent a whole second or two initiating the action doesn’t help). And you get this feeling that maybe in the future you’ll have to backtrack to take this object and you’re gonna be angry on the character for not taking it in the first place (I actually can’t confirm this, since after the location with this example we go to a flashback of the second main character, but if we won’t ever have to use a fishing rod and a fishing net in the game, I’ll be angry). And you know, an argument can be applied that it was an attempt to remove the ‘adventure game logic’, when you take everything with you and possibly solve puzzles before they appear, but considering that in a later section I’ve recharged a battery before knowing why I need it, I’m not sure that applies (also I still don’t know what certain objects in my inventory in later part of the game are for, I took them just because).  When it comes to ‘adventure game logic’, I think that gameplay flow should be a bigger priority than having everything make perfect chronological sense. Speaking of sense, there was a moment in the prologue when I needed to ask a second character for help. I had to ask her to hold a shutter so nothing would fall out from the fogger. But I couldn’t. I knew I had to ask her because as I failed to close the shutter and looked at it, my character said that he needs a second person to hold it before turning the fogger on, but the actual topic of the conversation with said person doesn’t appear until I actually try turning the fogger on (which leads to the exact same thought line, by the way). These kind of specific things in an adventure game are very detrimental to the experience.  Adventure games are usually very story heavy. And dialogue heavy. And most of them are quite linear. This problem is usually tackled in two ways. In adventure games with linear dialogue (without ability to choose topics), conversations are usually relatively short and to the point, so you can continue exploring and figuring things out rather quickly. And in adventure with non-linear dialogue, there’s, well, there’s all the topics to choose from, and you don’t have to go through them all, you might want to just select only the important ones if you feel like it (so even though overall you’re more passive in an adventure game, you’re still active). But there was only just one (and a half-ish) non-linear conversation during the parts that I’ve played. Everything else was just comic-style cutscenes which also really slowed down the pace – you had to wait for the panels to appear in a cool way before a line was spoken. Each panel animation is not too long in and on its own, but, again, it adds up. So A New Beginning felt more like watching a visual novel rather than playing an adventure game. And even then, the conversations are slow due to a considerable delay between each line.  And there’s also the fact that English voice acting is so monotone and boring that I would recommend to just switch to the original German (or maybe other translation that is actually good) immediately.  But what A New Beginning has really got going for it is the beautiful art style (although, admittedly, the quality of animations may vary from action to action) and a story that has managed to intrigue me, and I want to know how it all turns out in the end. This may seem like a very short point, but it’s actually huge, and plays a lot to the game’s favor. It will have to wait though, until I don’t really have anything else to play. Sadly, I don’t think A New Beginning is well designed as a point &amp; click adventure game. There’s too much passivity, and gameplay doesn’t flow well at all. Maybe I’m missing out. Maybe further down the road things get better. And if they do, I’ll make another post. But as it stands, this particular adventure game wouldn’t be on the top of my recommend list.
3666	0	a	Pros - Interesting Setting - Nice Graphics  Cons - Horrible dubbing actors with the temper of a valium drugged tomato! (english) - Badly written Story (starts rather cool but gets worse and worse) - Horrible dialog lines (Did anyone read these?) - Some rather stupid riddles (go there than come back and try again, for no reason it works now)  At any point in the story logic will be ignored, beaten and afterwards burned on bonfire of stupid ideas. I tried to like this game. But it makes that rather hard. Perhaps the translation carries some of the guilt but the writers defenitly shoulder their part as well.  If you can live without logic, one-dimensional characters and horrid stupidity than this may actually be a good game for you. But there are better adventures!
3667	0	a	I enjoy the point and click genre for the pure nostalgia of playing games on Windows 95/DOS computers. However, being a byproduct of late 80's-early 90's television I had the whole enviromentalist agenda crammed down my throat. All I ask is if you want to make enviromentalism a part of anything, PLEASE keep it subtle. With that in my mind, despite my no for recommending this game, I would give it a whirl if something like enviromentalism doesn't phase you.

3669	0	a	The voice acting is so bad I had to stop playing.
3670	0	a	I only played this for the achievements. It's a good point and click with a good story. I just wasn't too interested in it.
3671	0	a	Skip this game. I bought it on sale because I liked the premise, but even then I feel like I wasted my money. While the story itself is sort of interesting, you can't get immersed in it with the really awful voice acting, the choppy animations, and the pixel-hunting, brute force nature of the puzzles.
3672	0	a	I don't know why I continue to buy Daedalic adventure games, the writing is appalling. I'll keep this brief: Pros Beautiful settings and background painting Some lovely soundtracks Extra minigame elements for those who like that (I personally don't) Puzzles are generally simple Overall story is interesting  Cons Really poorly written, I still don't understand half of the conversations from the game The end sort of makes sense but its really not cleared up very well Poor voice acting at times, sounds awkward Buggy click device - sometimes the adverbs are in spanish or russian, sometimes the pointer simply doesnt show up So much unnecessary pixel hunting that halts progress Frustrating characters, Salvador and Fay's relationship isn't explained, he's just instantly a jerk to her. Characters are unbelievable due to poor writing and acting Puzzles are a little too easy.  Nice concept, poor delivery. Just generally tedious, don't waste your money.
3673	0	a	Love the whole 'trying to save the world thing,' but hate (I know, harsh word) how puzzling it is. All the Characters do is talk about the Main Goal, not 'could you do me a favor and try to tear down this debris.' You know, actual dirtctions. This is the reason why I stopped playing this game...It's too puzzling and hard, unless you look at Game Guides or are a Really Brilliant Child or has Played this, all ready. I'm sorry, but this is sadly, an unfinished project that I don't know if I want to come back to and Finish.
3674	0	a	So I don't usually play point and click-adventures, neither am I a big fan of Daedalic's games. But this was on sale and since it's story seemed interesting, I gave it a shot.  The story starts out with an incredibly interesting situation and holds it's tension for the first half of the game - just to then completly fall off. Like seriously, how can they put such an mediocre ending to that beginning? And then end it with such a cliffhanger, even though the game most likely won't get a sequel? The characters you meet are quite different, although most have no real depth to them and don't get much atttention on the long run. The puzzles are mostly easy, and can be skipped. The general interactions are very limited and sometimes obscure, as there is no highlighting for usable elements in the world. And then there's bugs. Not many, but some so severe that you need to restart a whole chapter (which vary vastly in size btw). The game cannot be configured and the drawn world is upscaled in fullscreen, but it's not scalable in windowed mode.  I'll give this game a thumbs down, not because I could not enjoy it, but because I'm sure there would have been better games as an intro for the genre. And because of the mentioned bugs, which shouldn't exist in a game of this size.   So should you buy this game? I'd say it depends.  + Definitely, if you are a fan of the classical P&amp;C genre and/or like Daedalic's stuff.  ~ Yes, if it's on sale and you want a short and simple game with other than the typical 'Good guy hunts bad guy'-story.  - No, if you are used to getting guided by games and/or prefer a story with more (visual) action. You should then rather watch out for some Telltale games on sale.
3675	0	a	DONT BUY THIS unless you're a tree hugging green freak. This game is UP ITS ♥♥♥ IN MESSAGES. Probably funded by an activist group. I kept playing through this game hoping it would get past all the politics - then the game ended. It's like they took 3 or 4 global warming theories made it into a propaganda film, went bankrupt because no one took them seriously, then decided to make this game showing how everyone is going to die to recoup their losses.
3676	0	a	Biggest issue with this game? A language barrier.  The company is based in Germany, so I am sure the German voice acting is spot on. Not so much the English one.  Some serious cutscenes are so laughably voice acted they become funny.  The artistic reditions are awesome though. If you're ok with buying a game just for art then I say go for it.  The other issue is I could not beat the game without a walkthrough. It's very complicated and not straighforward at all.  3/10
3677	0	a	Great story, that would be, if I could complete the game! I've gotten halfway through and it has crashed my laptop, (which is a bit outdated, yes, but can run more taxing games than this) at least five times! I would love to know how it ends because I have gotten emotionally invested, but the game keeps crashing halfway through! I wouldn't recommend it unless the developers bother to make it playable!

3679	0	a	Buggy, some translations are missing, even had a show-stopping bug that kept me from using the mouse at all. Had to use they keyboard to operate the task manager in order to shut the game down. Also, hippie BS.
3680	0	a	Plotline is not at all creative and the voice acting is the worst I have heard.

3683	0	a	Another dud. The story had me interested but the English voice acting is like listening to a robot; I couldn't stand it. The point and click felt really clunky and the load times are terrible for an adventure game.   Good thing I paid as much as a cup of coffee for this one.
3684	0	a	The WORST voice acting you will ever experience for any game. It really boggles the mind how they were THIS bad at it. Go look up some gameplay on Youtube and prepare to have your mind blown over how poor it really is.  There were lots and lots of problems with the translation as well. Sometimes the text would be in cyrillics, and there were lots of grammatical mistakes. On top of that the flow of the whole thing was really quite bad.   As a whole I'd rate it no more than a 2 out of 10 because of the things mentioned. It could have been a decent game, but it turned out to be a huge failure.  This was the first game of Deadalic Entertainment I ever played, and it will for sure be the last.
3685	0	a	This game could've gotten a 4 out of 5 from me but it won't because of the story.   The puzzles are pretty awesome and it brings so much good memories of how adventure games were told before. But that only lead me so far. The story wasn't entertaining enough. It feels like I'm being force-fed into being a hippie by being Eco-friendly and crap. It felt more like a tedious lecture like I was in class or something. And the script felt so weak. having stereotypes of a washed-out scientist and a female protagonist being put-down by a superior officer with gender equality issues (and I live in a country where gender is no longer an issue for work and family). And I'm supposed to believe that these other characters are from the future?!  I'm not even complaining about the voice-acting because of this being 'indie'. I can forgive that.  Again, being 'indie' isn't an excuse for telling a bad story. Adventure games are for me, 90% story and 10% gameplay.  Overall, It's not entertaining. It's not hilarious like most LucasArts Classics. It's not epic as the ones from Sierra's. I really think that the developers did a great job with the items and the puzzles (and the puzzles are actually better than some of Sierra's classics.).   Even if this did just cost me less than Php 40.00 (less than US$ 1.00) I wouldn't recommend it.  
3686	0	a	It's very pretty, I'll give it that. The art is great, and the gameplay is competently old-school adventure style, like the classic LucasArts adventures of old.  There are some major flaws though. The voice acting has some of the worst, most wooden performances I've ever heard. Maybe it's the English translation, but the dialog frequently comes off as incredibly stilted and awkward.  Then there's the plot. Did you like 'The Day After Tomorrow'? Do you enjoy being beat over the head with the idea that nuclear power is evil, and human-caused global warming is a bigger threat than anything else? Then you'll love this game. Otherwise, it's something to roll your eyes at and attempt to ignore so you can get back to the genuinely interesting adventure game puzzle bits.
3687	0	a	AVOID AT ALL COST !!!  CHANCES ARE VERY HIGH IT WON'T RUN PROPERLY ON YOUR MACHINE !!!  (Yes, I know, the graphics look good on screenshots. Forget about them or hate yourself for spending money on this bugfest like me!)  I'm sorry, but I cannot recommend the normal user to buy this sh*t.  Want to know why? Well, read on ...  This game here features unexpected crashes, sound stopping to work at all, overall laggyness out of nowhere and no stretching on 16:9 / 16:10 monitors.  The funny thing is, when you finally got the sound working the levels for the different type of sounds are totally nuts. There really is no better way to describe this. You have to fiddle around endlessly with the in game configuration to somehow get it all working together in a way you could finally sort of enjoy this game and when this hassle is done you're blown away from the next cutscene because the levels in these are crazy loud compared to the rest of the game.  WTF ?!? ... I mean really ... WTF ?!? ... I am no professional sound-editor but I know how to join different sources together so they sound fine alltogether (and nearly every other game producing company seems to know too), but the thing is, that is not my work but the work of Daedalic. The levels are so far out, sorry, but everyone in production should have easily mentioned this.  At least the voice overs in this game are finally sort of enjoyable. In most older games from this company they just did sound ridiculous. So this is a plus for this game here. The graphics viewes as stills look nice to, because they feature nicely handdrawn backgrounds with wisely chosen colour palettes but the animation is horrible. In some way it's better than in other games from Daedalic (like the whispered world for eg.) but in now way are they appealing to look at.  The story sound interesting too, but until now I couldn't really investigate it because the game won't let me to, at least not with sound. I mean, after every restart of the game the sound is gone. And I haven't got a clue why.  Well ... after all ... As said before this game has many issues:  - Sound not working or working bad, - Laggy gameplay, - Devs that won't answer in these forums here only by email (guess why), - Configuration spread over ingame and out-of- game configuration tools, - Horrbile startup loading time - No Background music in the menus - Cutoff Background music in the credits and the intro - No widescreen support (devs don't like it though gamers ask them all over the internet *lol*), - Game-breaking save-game failures - And not reproducable crashes of the whole game at random times.  And those mentioned before are just the errors that I did encounter personally while trying it ot for 2 hours (actually playing just maybe about 1 hour, the rest was problem solving and waiting for the game to load). But there are a lot more mentioned here and over the internet wich include:  - No sound during Cutscenes - Wrong language in Cutscenes - Game reproducable crashing as soon as a cutscene appears  Because of all the flaws I can only hardly recommend this game for lovers of the genre, as long as you can get it to work properly on your setup, but I would never buy it for the normal price. I got mine in a bundle so I think it's ok. But don't pay more for this game than 1,99 €.  And remember to avoid all other games from Daedalic unless they finally get these things addressed, because after searching the internet a little I found out that even in other (newer) games from Daedalic there are many people experiencing exactly the same problems, what leads me to think, that the problem lays in the engine underneath the games. What again is leading me to the question why these bugs aren't finally addressed so presumably a nice and simple fix for every game of the company could be released without much problems.  Maybe instead of releasing one mediocre made game after the other Daedalic should start releasing fewer but well made games so they could honestly ask real money for it? They have damned so many good ideas and concepts in the past it just makes me sad, because back in the days I loved adventure games so much and Daedalic is one of the few companies still (trying to) making them today ...  So the overhelming question is:  Will Daedalic ever produce a fully working adventure title? Sadly chances are very low. I can only hope they don't ♥♥♥♥ up the Blackguards series ...

3692	0	a	There is something said about Point and click adventure games, tht being that their puzzle solutionsa re too obstse or too convoluted. I think this started to happen as we lost verbes, so while in the past the puzzles WERE obstuse, at least ehy were FUN. This game ain´t fun. It IS obstuse, tho. Streesing, obstuse, linear multi level puzzles that DON'T invite lateral thinking. And the plot, ugh. UGH.  Don't get this game. --- I completed ths game.
3693	0	a	SPOILERS - Felt just a little condesending, for a game that has a message about ignoring science (climate change) it sure ignores a lot of science itself. The tone against nuclear power was bad enough, basically the Earth is destroyed in the future by climate change resulting from nuclear power (one of the cleanest forms of energy). The remaining humans survive underground using a clean cyanobacteria electric generator... underground. To hide from the sun, and photosyntisis apperently. The cyanobacteria make energy from happy thoughts. Don't worry though, they can fix it all with time travel anyway. Just don't have a real form of power.
3694	0	a	Story is ok, and i like the graphics. But the voice acting is terrible, and I don't know if it is me, but I don't get the logic of half the puzzles I solved. I dropped it half way to the end, even if I wanted to know the conclusion. I cannot recommend it
3695	0	a	This game is translated from swedish so read over the subtitles in your best swedish chef voice. The main character is a burnt out climatologist who lives at a lake and the first puzzle is to activate a machine whose only function I can tell is to murder birds. The lady from the future cries over a murdered bird and he says who cares about the climate. not me, a climatologist. Then you travel back in time or forward or something to solve terrible puzzles and get nagged about climate change.  Climate change is real we are all going to die there's no question about that but this game is boring and weird.
3696	0	a	very simple, primitive interface. it really reminded me of space quest, or something from the 80's. It seemed like most of the game consists of systematicaly clicking across the screen to click on whatever you can, then basically clicking through whatever interaction comes up. The parts that are not like this are obscure puzzles, which I finially gave up and looked up the cheat for. I couldn't guess all the riddles myself, and playing with a walkthrough in hand is not very fun. Overall, I got more frustration out of this game than entertainment. 
3697	0	a	The one thing any p&amp;c adventure title needs is: a good story....  and i am sorry, but this one was really not my taste.  It is illogical from the start on .... nuclear power plants responsible for the climat change, .... uhm ... since when do they produce CO2? Plus time travel, which basically allways gets strange at some point in any story.  The dialogues are neither funny nor witty ... so it felt just tedious ..... i dont think i can bring myself to ever finnish it ....   not recommended
3698	0	a	A point and click adventure that has plagued my backlog for quite some time as I've tried to promise myself that I would play my library in alphabetical order. Alas I cannot for the TERRIBLE english voice acting and dialogue keep me from continuing to play this game to it's end. I've found a few glitches as well when interacting with some objects which will display russian options, but nonetheless still function. The characters themselves aren't very likable at all and none of them really have much defining characteristics. The gameplay and use of right click and combination is a little refreshing and is a step in the right direction as far as point and click interaction in a game, but could use a few tweaks. Got this in the Daedalic Entertainment Humble Bundle but seriously, the voice acting is really bad, Daedalic should really do something about this as it is one of the most important factors and would frighten people from this game. Maybe one I'll finish it.
3699	0	a	Don't buy anything from this developer. They're pathetic and greedy.  The old version of their game, 'The Whispered World' was removed from the store, so they could put up the 'Special Edition.' See, the thing is, there isn't anything special about the 'Special Edition' because it's just a patch. The only difference between the old version, and the 'Special' version is that there's a commentary track, the soundtrack, achievements, and trading cards. That's all stuff (well, maybe not the soundtrack, but that could just be sold as DLC) that a respectable developer would have in the game, for free.  They've shown their true colors. They're just a sad, money-grubbing developer, who in a perfect world, would never get any business ever again.  Avoid at all costs.
3700	0	a	Came for an adventure game; ended up getting a lecture about climate change and an anti-nuclear power opinion slammed in my face. The 'twist' at the end didn't help; it just made me mad and painted environmental activists in a terrible light, even the ones from the future. The ending wasn't satisfying, either; it left the conclusion up in the air on whether anything would change. The game is also riddled with minor bugs, such as russian language in the english game and the voiceover not matching the written text/captions. The voice acting is stilted and makes me wonder if they had just gotten Siri to voice Fay. I also found myself wishing I could click through the laborious comic book panels; I read at a fast pace and found it frustrating to sit through 10 minutes of panels slogging through the rote of being in front then fitting in 'place'.
3701	0	a	Savegames dissapeared on a unnanounced game update, no sollution or news posted about it. Found it on a forum post on steam no official news. Don't want to bother with the game.
3702	0	a	I played this game for 2 hours and enjoyed it, then the menu/inventory system stopped working and I couldn't continue playing the game anymore. Worthless piece of crap
3703	0	a	Possibly the dunbest game I have installed in my life. Go back in time and save the planet by doing puzzles. Pass.
3704	0	a	Voice acting and story are beyond horrendous. Made me want to stop playing the game immediately.
3705	0	a	It has a good concept, I just couldn't really get into it.   *Many dialogue errors.
3706	0	a	This is described as 'Charming' 'Cinematic' and 'Witty'. Well, it doesn't support anything above 480i, and the voices sound computer generated (literally Microsoft Sam). So yea, looks awful, sounds awful. The gameplay is OK, but nothing compared to other point-and-click adventures. Also, the story is lame. Put it next to Half-Life and what you have is a dirty rag.  Don't waist your moneys.
3707	0	a	Pros: Beautiful art and landscapes  Cons: Poor controls Puzzles that just feel tedious Unrelatable and unlikable characters Horrible script Shallow story  In my opinion this game wasn't worth the time or money
3708	0	a	I played the game up until you have to go back in the house to get the girl some water and after the dialoge with the girl at the table the game just crashes.
3709	0	a	Game crashed within 30 minutes of play without even an error thrown...  Had to resort to online walkthrough to get past the first 5 minutes... terrible game design...
3710	0	a	This is the dumbest ♥♥♥♥ing story I've ever seen in an adventure game. Incredibly hokey, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ voice acting, completely unlikeable and inconsistent characters, logically stupid and inane plot, no sense of pacing whatsoever, with an approach so overly hamfisted and not subtle every grocery store in europe must be empty. The art direction and backgrounds are nice, but the animations are terrible, and the puzzles are all fairly basic and offer very little challenge or outside the box thinking, with every problem and its solution being fairly obvious uses of the the 2-5 items you have in each area, which are only 1-3 screens large, or an obvious giant control panel puzzle which can be deduced in a mere minute or two of effort. I will never get back the hours of my life wasted on this game.  2/10 It's not broken, but don't waste your time, none of the puzzles/gameplay can redeem this piece of schlock.
3711	0	a	i have nothing more to say than I hate it 
3712	0	a	woah, this game sucks a** , apart from blacklines zigzagining the screen anytime you interact with something, the plot is lame. Give this one a wide berth.
3713	0	a	The story has a lot of plot holes and seems like it was re-written half way through. Not as good as other games from Daedalic.
3714	0	a	Some games I don't know why I have... or why I ever played them.... this is one of those games.
3715	0	a	Preachy, obnoxious, environmentalist ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. There is nothing special about this game, and it certainly isn't worth $10. I would wait until it eventually get placed on dumptruck sale for 95% off.
3716	0	a	I couldn't finish this game.  - Voice Acting and Dialog is horrendous. - The characters are unlikable and forgettable - The story won't stop beating you over the head with it's ECO message. - The controls are awful, and that's an accomplishment for making the simple act of pointing and clicking so annoying. - And worst of all, it's BORING!!!  Don't waste your money on this game.
3717	0	a	Even though I don't mind playing point and click games, this one certainly missed its point. The controls are annoying. The game starts slow and doesn't get to me the whole time. maybe a faster paced game with a less negative main character to start wif should do the trick.
3718	0	a	This is a 2D puzzle-adventure game with an eco-nut storyline. It's annoying to play with gameplay reminiscent of old-school games from early 90's (such as Oregon Trail). You must point-and-click on things to interact, and it is not always intuitive what you need to do. The storyline is uninteresting and cliche, and the main antagonist is some solar flare that will scorch the earth because humans ruined the environment. In short, this is a game that tries to establish a sense of adventure and discovery in the player, only to ruin it with an unbelievable story, horrible acting, and a difficult to navigate 2D world. This game keeps the player at a distance and keeps you becoming immersed in the gameplay.  Pros:  Interesting concept artwork  Low price  Cons:  Compeletely unbelievable storyline  Outdated, low-resolution graphics  Annoying user interface  2D  Voice Acting (English)
3719	0	a	Please do not think that since this is from the same company as Deponia it will be a good game: it is not. The game is about time travellers trying to save the future by keeping us from causing climate change. This is going to be done by making a retired Swedish man whose son is apparently his direct clone (THEY LOOK IDENTICAL, IT'S HORRIFYING) invent the energy-creating bacteria from Metal Gear 2, which will solve all our problems because... someone likes Hideo Kojima?  Along the way it's going to nag you that WE DID THIS and paint a world that's so hilariously ♥♥♥♥ed up that remote lakes have constant streams of trash floating up on their shores, and running a single machine LITERALLY MURDERS A BIRD... after making you solve a way-too-complex puzzle to turn it on, and needing a second person who thankfully time-travels in to hold it shut to activate it, because you jury-rigged it with a snapped screwdriver and a bicycle tube.  I gave up right around the time it killed off my wiser mentor for no reason because PATHOS. Perhaps it improves. The chain of needing to break off an iron bar to bust open a door and break open a wall to pick up a pushbroom to pull down a ladder to... you get the drift. I don't think it was going to.
3720	0	a	A New Beginning - Final Cut, is a horrible excuse for a point and click adventure game. Games in this genre are known for story telling, because the slow pace of gameplay really allow developers to flesh out really dynamic stories. Yet this game decided to tell everyone about the horrors of climate change, none to subtly, through an over the top story about humanity is ravaged by the effects of global warming and have to use a time machine to fix it. Really, they could not make this more generic if they tried. The puzzles in this game are irritating too, everything in the game looks like it can be interacted with, yet you cant, heck most of the stuff you DO interact with is some of the only things that look like they are part of a backround. Furthermore, these 'puzzles' I mentioned are really just fetch the item activites, which is obviously what people buy games to do. So yea, I don't recommend this game. It is a waste of money that could be spent on much better games.
3721	0	a	Should have heeded to the reviews. This one is a disappointments among P&amp;C's.
3722	0	a	Blatant climate alarmism. No thanks, not in my games.
3723	0	a	this is so stupid don't get this game.
3724	0	a	The game itself isn't bad but theres a ton of problems.Lots of bugs,you cant play in full screen,and its so laggy its pretty much unplayable.Who knew a point and click game could be laggy lol Not only that but when you enter a new area it takes about 30 of looking at a black screen before it pops up.Sorry but in this state i cant recommend this.Go take a look at the community hub and you'll see what im talking about....oh and i almost forgot about the constant crashing!
3725	0	a	A New Beginning is an adventure game that is an incoherent mess thanks to abysmal translations and voice acting.  One of the most important points of an adventure game, besides the puzzles, is the dialogue. So if the dialogue is difficult to follow, illogical, or plainly incomprehensible, no matter how well put together the puzzles and how interesting the art style, the game will not be enjoyable. This is what A New Beginning suffers from, an incomprehensible dialogue that tries to tell what could have been an interesting story, while providing contradictory insight into how to solve puzzles (telling you to do one thing but you actually having to do the complete opposite), and developing unlikable characters, leaving you to wonder how such a game won the German game of the year award in 2011 (...lost in translation?)
3726	0	a	Environmental waco subject. I liked the puzzles, but that is all. Story line terrible and liberal all the way thru. Don't bother, skip this one. The puzzles were not worth going through with the story line. You can't fast forward through that part either. Yucky yucky yucky.
3727	0	a	An ok point and click game with a weak ♥♥♥ message. If I knew it was about Global Warming, climate change or whatever other stupid name is given to 'revalidate' and prove the lie I would have passed it up. So far the game plays alright but this could be had in other games with a better story.   You could pass this up and not have missed anything.
3728	0	a	This is a game that is flat out average. Gameplay is a-typical point and click, the interface is poor, the voice acting is atrocious (in English) and there are plenty of translation errors and issues as well as a few bugs that are blindingly obvious and haven't been fixed.  But I give it a thumbs up for any adventure fan who likes a decent tale, and I would give it a 'maybe'; if we had that option.   A New Beginning tackles time-travel and all the tropes related to it, alongside Climate Change and Environmentalism. It sounds preachy and the message is rather banal and simple all the way until the very end of the game. There, the plot twist contains the true message of the game, one that is honest and brutal.  Is the game worth buying just for that message? Probably not, it certainly won't amuse anyone who hates climate activism, it isn't going to be a glorious cup of tea for anyone outside of adventure / point and click hardcore nuts, but I think the message it holds is a rather reasonable and interesting one to listen to. Buy it on extreme discounts (It was a low as 0.50 when I paid for it), but don't pay full price as the game simply isn't refined enough.
3729	0	a	A good story overall on climate change with a nice twist at the end, nice looking graphics and overall well balanced puzzles.  The problems I saw while playing the game to the end were related to the translation (sometimes text in German would still pop-up here and there), some of the dialogues were 'broken' (couldn't even read them, automatically skip or too fast) or out of sync, some of the voices were not up to the overall look-and-feel of the game graphics (I would have probably played the game without voice over).  I wouldn't suggest this game to people approaching adventures/point-n-click games for the first time: puzzles were good and well done, but a little bit disorienting at first (sometimes you didn't have a clue of what to do).
3730	0	a	I never really got into the story and the voice acting isn't very convincing. In comparison to the fantastic Deponia series - which was also developed by DaeDalic Entertainment - A New Beginning is very disappointing.
3731	0	a	just from the get go, the voice acting is poorly cut together, the characters are unrealistic and depressing and this game looks to be a bleak way to spend an afternoon.
3732	0	a	Not good, not bad, but I wouldn't play this game again.
3733	0	a	Puzzles are alright, but Christ Almighty the story is the most pretenious pile of crap eco-♥♥♥♥♥♥y that I've ever put myself through.  Haven't experienced any game-ending bugs (yet), but I'm certainly expecting one or two given Daedalic's record. Subtitles go out of sync witht he dialog (as well as the lipsync in some of the cutscenes), and occasionally a command will be in a different language, such as Spanish or Russian.
3734	0	a	I don't recommend the game, but only because Steam doesn't have a 'meh' button. The game is not bad per se, some of the puzzles are pretty clever, and the art is nice overall, but the plot is TERRIBLE, the characters are dull and the voice acting is sometimes hilariously ridiculous (plus some subtitles are wrong and/or appear spontaneously in another languages). If you like P&amp;C, I would rather recommend other games by Daedalic, such as the Deponia trilogy (haven't played the fourth one yet).
3735	0	a	The story and graphics are nice, but this game has some serious issues: dialogues are out of synch, action names sometimes pops up in a different language (like German or Russian), it suffers frequent freeze and sound sometimes goes to zero.  Puzzles are not too difficult (except maybe one or two completely absurd parts), but some situations and item combinations are just nonsense and it's sometimes hard to continue without reading a guide.   One thing I really can't explain is why every character moves soooooo slowly it's irritating, expecially when the game situations need fast decisions and quick actions (as often specified in the dialogues too). Sometimes if you have to send someone from where he stands to the other part of the screen you will have time to make some tea while you wait for him to arrive. Another bad thing about characters is their complete absence of empathy: if your best friend dies it's ok, just keep doing what you're doing, who cares.  Anyway, the story, as said, is good and deep enough, even if I'd have gone deeper with the time travel thing. Graphic is nice and so are the graphic novel style cutscenes (even if they are maybe a little too long sometimes). The game is somehow extremely resource heavy, and I really can't explain why sometimes animations are so laggy.  I don't recommend this game unless you have a lot of patience and many hours to spend figuring out absurd situations, or it's on heavy sale (i bought it for like 60p so I can't complain, but at some point was just a pain and only wanted to finish it as soon as possible).
3736	0	a	started off quite well and has a very interesting plot. downside is that the characters get very dry and boring halfway through, the voice acting as well is totally emotionless. i liked a lot of the puzzles but occassionally they included one that made me wonder how in the hell they thought that would be clever, item placement can be dodgy - hidden next to another, bigger usable item  i really enjoyed the first half and would happy recommend it if they carried on the whole story like that, but they didnt, i grew bored of the plot and detached from the characters
3737	0	a	Too short. I felt like I finished the introduction to a game, but not even a complete episode. It was fun and pretty while it lasted though.
3738	0	a	This is a charming game, however there are a few issues that are a bit breaking and after seeing that it costs 6.99€ just makes me say DO NOT BUY IT. If you do find it in a bundle however (like I did) sure, get it.  Now it's time for an explanation. The game is cute and your character actually walks around 'real' objects, as in, the scenes were filmed with a real camera and then blended into the game.  It's a point and click puzzle game and it isn't an easy one either. Which, again, in itself is fine.  The puzzles are usually either a bit easy to solve or at least to figure out what to do, but there's 1 of them that is really quite horribly difficult to even make sense out of it.  SPOILER about that 'tip' for that puzzle, it's a page of a book with the 'ONE' in 'GRAMAPHONE' underlined, and a #9 on the corner of the page... what this supposedly means is, there's 9 numbers you need (for a locker with 3 digits, therefore 3 sets) and it starts with ONE, then you have to read the text and find either the actuall number like 'fig. 2' being the '2' the second number you need, and then 'three'... then there's a year, 1887, the '1' is the last number of the second set of numbers and '887' the last one. The problem with this is, the game gives you NO CLUE what this book is related to or even what to look for, your character only says 'A book grandpa's been reading, he wrote something on it' and that's it, you really need a guide or an epiphany to figure it out.  Lastly, and this is what made me say NO about buying this for 6,99€ is that the game... only lasted me a few minutes, seriously, there are like 5 different screens (not counting small camera transitions) and only a dozen of puzzles or so, it's a cute short 'story' but it's not even an apetizer, sure, in the end it says 'end of lume part 1', but it's a part where you pay 6,99€ to get.   TL;DR  - One of the puzzles is nearly impossible to solve on your own, and crucial to finish the game; - Even if you get stuck a lot, you can beat the game in only a few minutes, not even 1 hour.   Would I recommend playing this game? Sure, it is a bit fun at most and challenging, you will probably need a guide for 1 or 2 puzzles though and it's an interesting new concept.  Would I recommend buying this game? No, unless you're either filthy rich, or get it with a bundle, seriously.   In terms of the overall game and enjoyability I give it a... maybe 8/10 (without my puzzle issue). In terms of the price/quality ratio I give it a 1/10 just because it's visually pleasing and new.  Thanks for reading this (if anyone ever does).
3739	0	a	Your grandfather has gone missing and you need to solve fiendish puzzles with cryptic clues left behind by a madman. The only hope you have of seeing your grandfather again is to solve these puzzles and get the power working again. Lume is a point and click puzzle game. Each puzzle is masterfully done, adding layer upon layer. Its not just typical puzzles, but these are puzzles are off kilter. A is E, a triangle is 3, north is north east sort of off kilter. There are cryptic clues are everywhere. You'll get an inventory of parts to create a power generator and see your grandfather alive.  The truth is that you play as a child and your grandfather has gone to go investigate something. So he left clues for you to get his power up and running again. He's the madman. There is no threat, danger or game over. There is a variety of puzzles. Everything from lock combinations, to spinning wired tiles to connect all circuits. The clues for the most part will be in select pages of books and following instructions meant to get you lost with irrelevance. It is all a brain teaser's dream.  The game itself looks unique, because it looks as if someone made it with construction paper. Then filmed transitions between environments. The real downfall about the art is the resolution is stuck low so its a small screen with a giant dark frame. With such a unique art style, it should be a higher resolution to bask in its glory. There aren't many environments. Just a three interiors, two closets and an exterior consisting of two screens.  The controls are simple, just click things. Since it is a Flash game, just hover your mouse over something and the cursor will change to a pointer. Your inventory is easy to get to at the top of the screen instead of completely switching to an inventory.  At the end of the hour or two game, you find out this is just Episode 1. These were some difficult puzzles, but without the unique art style it would have gotten lost in the shuffle.
3740	0	a	LoL, took me 7min to figur out what to do and 30min to complete the game. It is a nice 'Demo' (no, the whole game took me 30min) but it is so short, that I would give it f2p as a Demo. It's a pitty there are people giving away money for this...
3741	0	a	I cannot recommend this game. There are insanely hard puzzles, so I had to use a guide for some puzzles, as the clues for them were confusing and frustrating, and I felt I was just wasting my time trying to solve them.  The game is not complete, as they state in the end (Lumino City is the complete game now, so this game is like a prequel to the main game), so I'd only try getting this if it' part of a bundle.  Pros:  - Cute graphics - Some easy puzzles  Cons:  -Hard and confusing puzzles - Annoying music - Restricted to one place, with few scenes - Incomplete
3742	0	a	A not-so-complete review for a not-so-complete game. So bulletpoints:    The game is as bad as it's beautiful.    Puzzles are either ridiculously easy, or stupidly and insanely hard. Most of them don't make sense. You just get loose clues and have to aimlessly try things out until you get it right. I checked a guide and I'm glad I did. I doubt there was any playtesting.    Pro: fits the purpose of teaching people how not to design a point-and-click adventure game.    Low res, making the text really hard to read.    It's VERY short. Still I feel like I've wasted my time.    Cheap and still overpriced. I got it from TG for 195 coins and I regret it.  DON'T BUY IT! If you already have it, DON'T BOTHER PLAYING IT!
3743	0	a	If you want to try this game, I would suggest you to skip this and go straight for 'Lumino City'. Lume feels like it's but only a short demo for 'Lumino City'.  The art style is no doubt a great beauty but... definitely over priced for such a short and incomplete game. (My play time is 2.5 hrs due to save file problems)  My save file disappeared and I had to replay from scratch.  This appears to be a common problem posted in the forums. (Seems to be related to clearing browser cache) But no warning or patch was done, left with only the solution of finishing it in one sitting. (which isn't too bad as the game is very short)  The puzzles aren't that hard but a couple are pretty darn confusing. I've spent more time being confused than actually solving those two. They have some of the most confusing hints I had ever seen.
3744	0	a	I thought i would re-play and re-review this before i start the sequel to this game 'Lumino City'.  This is a nice little point and click adventure game with a beautiful visual style and interesting puzzles. Although, with that said, it's very important to mention that this is almost an introduction/demo into the world and the style of the game. This would definitely not pass as a full length game.   I am yet to play Lumino City, it has great reviews and i'm willing to bet that you skipping 'Lume' before going straight to that would be of no loss to you.  I first played this a while ago and i can say that it was definitely a disappointment as a game at the time. I was very impressed with aspects of the game but it's barely an hours worth of gameplay, it has no real story and as pretty as it is, it isn't worth the price. I would only recommend buying this if you can get it really cheap or even just free.  The only reason i have come back to it was to remind me of the world, style and the setting before i started on the sequel. As a stand alone game It's definitely not something i would recommend.  However, as a 'taster' of sorts for the next game, my short time in this game did definitely manage to grab my interest once i found out a full length game was being released as a sequel.   The art style of the game is wonderful. A hand-made, miniature model, stop-motion and animation mix of a game. I love the extra care and attention that are put into these sorts of games. It does really manage to make them unique. The game is made to feel very homely and cozy with this kind of technique and creates a warm and relaxing feeling.   The puzzles were fun and quite interesting. There was one that was kind of hard to find the logic behind without resorting to a guide, but that was the only one I had trouble with. The others were interesting but do-able. I hope to see more puzzles like these in the next one.  As it goes, i think i will have to down-vote this game on the basis of it being a stand alone game.  But with that said, i am looking forward to writing a very positive (hopefully) review of it's sequel.  All in all, It's decent for a demo or taster, but not as a game. Play it if you can get it free or just really cheap. Otherwise, just take a look at the sequel instead.   TL;DR : Just buy Lumino City. 
3745	0	a	Point-and-click puzzle game with a unique and good-looking art-style. It is sadly too short (I completed it in around an hour), and is basically episode one (wich they mention at the end) of an apparently longer series. My guess is that the sequel is Luminose city. I can't recommend a game that feels like a demo.
3746	0	a	Disappointed. Overall this game is not bad, but the puzzles are extremely difficult and the gameplay is entirely too short for the $7 they are charging. I purchased this game on sale for $3, and I still don't think that amount of money was worth it. If this game were $1 or less, I would be writing a much more positive review. If you love point and clicks with great artwork like I do, then you'll find this game to be just ok. Instead of this game, I would recommend the game 'Tiny Bang Story'. I got that game on sale for 80 cents and have played it through 3 times. It's similar to this game, except way better.
3747	0	a	You wouldn't steal a bike. You won't break into a car. You wouldn't rip borrowed CDs. You wouldn't make people to pay for a game you had no intention to finish.  But yeah. These things happen.
3748	0	a	Too short. I finished in less than an hour so I really don't think it's worth $7.
3749	0	a	For $6.99 there is an absolute abysmal amount of value to be had with this game. I beat it in 52 minutes. You could rent several two-hour long movies at that price. Apparently this is part one in a series, unfortunately the developers seem to have given up after episode one. It's cute, has a great aesthetic... it's just so incomplete. Some puzzles aren't as obvious as they should be. Poor design. Don't bother if you don't want to feel let down or suffer from buyer's remorse.
3750	0	a	while i enjoyed lume, i would have trouble paying money for it.  the art style and animations are excellent, and i could happily spend some time in the world of lume. while it would have been nice to add a what-am-i-looking-at indication somewhere other than the cursor changing to a hand when you can interact with something, the interface was easy to use and never really got in the way.  the main problem is there just isn’t enough here. it’s probably over in about an hour, depending on how much you’re able to think the way the game designer did. if you didn’t figure out a clue, you pretty much need to look up a walkthrough because there’s only one clue for each puzzle. a lot of the puzzles feel like they’re trying to teach you simple math, which feels like maybe it’s intended for children but at the same time is probably too difficult for that. the music loop is a little short and it’s written in flash which means right-click brings up a flash menu instead of having anything to do with the game. it had big black borders on my screen instead of stretching to fit.  it’s worth your time if you pick it up as part of a bundle, but i wouldn’t recommend it on its own.
3751	0	a	It pains me to say it, but as charming as Lume is, it doesn’t offer much else to back it up.  Looking back, it probably didn’t help that I played it just after Machinarium, For one, apart from one particularly obscure solution, Lume’s puzzles are rather simple.  But I think what really ruins it is how short it is. I finished it in an hour, and that’s because I played around a bit. I can certainly tolerate short games, but Lume doesn’t really have much going for it to compensate being so short. Even weirder is that it’s supposed to be episode 1 of a series, which not only was never released, but makes you wonder why they chose to make it episodic in the first place.  Now, the game has pretty visuals, really pretty indeed, and if you want to see that yourself, wait for a sale. But really, if you’re just looking for an adventure game to play, pick another one, Lume is light on content and will probably disappoint you.
3752	0	a	Silly me, I assumed this was a complete game! The end credits state this was just Chapter One, but I don't anticipate we will ever see any more. In this chapter you get about half a dozen puzzles which take about an hour to solve, depending on your skill level. At $6.99 this is a complete rip-off. The music and art style are charming, but they do not justify the full price nor short play time. If you're really curious, wait to get it for cheap in a bundle.
3753	0	a	Alright, let's talk a little bit about Lume. To give a short answer: do I recommend that you purchase it? No - go pick up Lumino City instead. It's the fully fleshed-out version of what the developers were more-or-less experimenting with here. It's absolutely beautiful, and I would recommend it in a heartbeat. For most people, that's probably all you need to know. So go check out Lumino City.  If you're still reading, here's some slightly more in-depth thoughts. Lume is effectively an early experiment for what would become Lumino City. Here, State of Play got a good sense for how this 'animating on top of a paper world' idea could work for a fully-fledged game. That being said, this is not that game. It is very short, there isn't much of a story developed, and some of the puzzles are not presented in a way that gives the player any clues as to how to find the solution. It is very much the little brother of Lumino City. It's clear that the team had dreams of larger environments and a bigger story, and some of the puzzles (the wiring and the music lock) were improved upon and included in the larger game. And of course, they used Lume to experiment with this fantastic art style. Basically, Lume serves as a historical artifact of how Lumino City evolved from an idea into the amazing game it is. So here's my recommendation: Go play Lumino City. If you enjoy it (and I think you will) and are interested in seeing how it came to be, pick up Lume when it's on sale for $1-2. But you have to come at it knowing that this isn't some astounding game, but a stepping stone towards one.
3754	0	a	It took me about 30-40 min to complete this game, and oh man - it felt like something important was missing at the very beginning already, but I managed to continue playing. Most of the puzzles are a bit too vague but it's 'do-able'.  I wouldn't say Lume is worth 6.99, just because the game is very short (not completed) and only contains 'Part 1'. On the other hand, the only positive thing I can think of is that the artwork/animations are astonishing yet so simple, which made me want to try out this game in the first place.
3755	0	a	A very pretty and short point and click adventure game, almost worth buying just for the graphical style. Except that its puzzles are super unintuitive, there's no game-internal hint system and the story doesn't go anywhere.  Cute, but ultimately not worth your time.
3756	0	a	Dont buy Lume it a waste of money for $6.99. Life to short to enjoy game like this.
3757	0	a	Twenty minues of point and click Flash fun. Why did I buy this?
3758	0	a	This was WAY too short. I felt ripped off.
3759	0	a	This game is just... what? I'm happy i didn't buy it for original price. Too much information, too little playing, they just give you key to puzzles, but makes it difficult by imprecission and i really don't like this type of puzzles.... i played much adventures, but this one is one of theese bad. Graphics are something between 2D and 3D, making the final effect... ...weird and chaotic and the resolution is just... too small.  If you wanna spend your money, this isn't best choice
3760	0	a	I bought this at 70% off, and I still feel ripped off.  It's cute. The graphics are pretty and charming. It makes a nice set-up to a bigger story. That's pretty much everything positive I have to say about it.  Half the puzzles I liked, but the triple combination lock stuck out as too illogically-placed - the clue to solve it is buried elsewhere in the house, and didn't occur to me that they were connected for a long time. The story was abrupt - you solve a number of puzzles to turn on the power in your house...and that's it. The trailer suggested to me that it's longer or more mysterious...but it's not.  I'll admit that the graphics and getting the game to run are difficult, and that's something I admire. But for something you can complete in under an hour, it isn't worth the value.
3761	0	a	This game is so not worth its price! I really enjoy puzzle games but this one is extremely small. If I'm not mistaken, this was part 1 and, overall, you can complete it very fast. It has a small amount of puzzles for you to do and I can't say they are very hard; the problem in my opinion, is that I feel the developers didn't provide enough or even helpful clues/info for one to complete the puzzles in a fast and easy way. I had a bit of a struggle with a few just because I couldn't find any logic in them whatsoever (I'm not the only person that feels this).  As for the aspect of the game alone, it is very simple but it's still 'cute' for a flash game. However I don't feel it's appealing enough for one to spend 6,99€ on it. It almost felt as if I was playing a demo.
3762	0	a	It's a nice game, but it's also waaaay too short.  The setting is nice featuring a new and unique way to tell the story ... but the story ... well ... if you know what to do it lasts for maybe a fifteen minutes ... and that's if you're playing it slow ...  When clicking through you can easily finish this in three minutes!  Get only on a laaaaaarge discount to enjoy the unique feel, but don't expect to get much game out of it.  And with laaaarge discount I mean don't pay more than 0.10 cent or so ...  There are free flash games featuring longer lasting playability. If I hadn't got this out of a bundle I would feel ripped off.
3763	0	a	I think I hated this game so much because I actually loved it at first.... I thought the art was great and the little puzzel games were pretty good to start out with and then all of the sudden it ended. There was nowhere else to go and no more puzzels to solve. It just ended before I felt like I had even gotten to the end of a level, let alone the end of a game. So dissappointing for a game I started out thinking I was going to love.
3764	0	a	Lume has a novel appearance and a mildly devious twist on the usual sorts of puzzles in games like these. That said, it's really only very mildly devious - ooh, the compass is twisted 45 degrees and north isn't up, oh so tricky! - and I completed the game in half an hour... oh yes, it's very short. For the $7 I paid for it, I'm incredibly disappointed. Don't bother.
3765	0	a	English:  It is a game for 5 minutes. But one or two of the puzzles are absolutly NOT doable! Really. In every Walkthrough I had to watch, they also said that those puzzles are not possible! And after ( about 5 puzzles ) the game ( well. 'part 1' ) is over.  Really disappointing! I really wouldn't buy it for 7€! Thank God I paid only 2€.. that is too much either .. sadly!   Deutsch:  Ein Spiel das nach gefühlten 5 Minuten zu ende ist! Dennch sin ein bis zwei Rätsel absolut nicht zu lösen! Also wirklich nicht zu lösen! Selbst die Walkthroughs ( Komplettlösungen ) die ich mir anschauen musste ( um im 'Spiel' weiter zu kommen ) sagen sie selbst, das dies absolut unmöglich ist! Das Spiel beinhalten ca, 5 Rätsel danach ist das Spiel ( nunja 'Part 1' ) zuende. Absolut enttäuschend und keine 7€ Wert! Zum Glück habe ich es 'nur' für 2€ gekauft... Immernoch zu viel.. Schade! 
3766	0	a	Lume is a puzzle game with a very cool art style. The game's structure is simple: solve puzzles to find the components you need to power the house. The game's art is beautiful, and the sets were clearly filmed with an actual camera. The music also fits well with the game.  The compliments end there, however. The puzzles are arcane, with no help. I solved the easier puzzles, but others give you frustratingly little info. One required interaction with an object I thought I'd interacted with already. Another assumes that turning around changes which direction 'northwest' is, which is simply wrong. I got frustrated with those puzzles before finishing them.  Lume is incredibly short. There are about 6 puzzles, then the game ends. If you look up the answers, or even hints, expect to finish the game in under an hour.  If you like the art style, then maybe you can find more value in Lume than I did. If not, even if you like puzzle games, you should skip this one.
3767	0	a	Saying that I recommend this game is somewhat misleading; I recommend you play it if you happen to pick it up with one of the Indie Bundles out there, but I wouldn't go forking out the money they ask for this otherwise. Worth £5 this is not.   Very pretty game, yes. Has some potential in the realm of puzzlers, but the solutions to a couple of them are annoyingly obscure, to the point where it's out of sheer luck you figure them out. Game lasts up to an hour, but most of that is down to slow walking speed of the main character and going back and forth trying to work out what on earth you missed.  The single-track soundtrack starts to get tiresome after a while, nice as it is.
3768	0	a	Imagine if Professor Layton had absolutely crap puzzles. Welcome to Lume.
3769	0	a	If 70 minutes of gameplay for $7 is your idea of good value, then Lume is the game for you!
3770	0	a	Well, this game is cool, as a flash game, which it is. But, to be honest, it is nonsence to take money for a flash game with 2 locations and 30-minutes-gameplay.
3771	0	a	Avoid this waste of seven dollars. It's a fifteen minute Flash demo. I want my money back.
3772	0	a	I just lost the charm for this game. It did not hold my attention at all. I wish I could get my money back.
3773	0	a	The game has nice visuals, but that's about all there is. Rather boring 'story', a few puzzles, and some melody in the background. It's more of a technology preview than a proper game. Play it only if you can get it for free or for a few cents. Definitely not worth more than a dollar.
3774	0	a	The puzzles were lame. Most were extremely simple, though I couldn't figure out when there was supposed to be a number in 'Gramoph one '.  The game began a story, showed me the village and the path to it, but then abruptly ended with a 'thanks for playing episode 1'. The entire game wasn't even a full intro, it felt more like a demo.
3775	0	a	tl;dr Short, overpriced, boring, pretetious. Also buggy on Linux. Avoid.
3776	0	a	It's a nice looking game, but not particularly challenging. If you're lucky you'll get an hour of playtime out of it. Not worth $6.
3777	0	a	Puzzles are obscure and not very well communicated. Very short. Ends with a 'to be continued' but there hasn't been an update since.
3778	0	a	Lume is graphically interesting, but not an entertaining game. The supposed puzzles are quite silly.   For Linux users  There is a Linux build available, I'm not sure why it isn't listed on the store page.
3779	0	a	Pretty but short and with one or two super ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t puzzles.
3780	0	a	As much as I like point and clicks, this wasn't all that nice. It is also incredibly short.
3781	0	a	Variety of puzzles presented in real cardboxes.
3782	0	a	Cute little Flash puzzle game that kept me occupied for half an hour. But since it doesn't have $6 worth of gameplay, I can't recommend it at that price.
3783	0	a	Very, very short, shorter than most flash games. It is supposed to be the first chapter of the game, but the second chapter is still missing after this game's release (almost) three years ago, this turns every good bits of this game into disappointment. I won't even suggest grabbing this on a -75% sale, just wait for the bundles.
3784	0	a	Interesting concept. Way too short. Thank goodness I got this on HumbleBundle with 3 other outstanding point and click games, or I would never play it. Great demo though... I wish I never claimed this game...its just a wasted space in my games library
3785	0	a	Pretty, but it's so short there's almost no point in even playing.
3786	0	a	While pretty, the game is so incredibly short, it's almost insulting. This review is in the spirit of the game.
3787	0	a	waste of money
3788	0	a	Half-♥♥♥♥♥ Flash game, press tab to win.
3789	0	a	Nicely done, but really too short. Seriously.
3790	0	a	Very nice intro for a real game.
3791	0	a	I am giving a no vote to Lume as it is too short to be worth the money. And the 'to be continued' at the end of it just added insult to injury.  Other than the length, I liked it, but some of the puzzles are unintuitive.
3792	0	a	Very pretty with some interesting puzzles, but far, far, far too short. If you know what you're doing, you can finish Lume in about fifteen minutes. I don't usually like rating games based on duration vs price, but in this case... yeah. Sorry. No.
3793	0	a	TL;DR: Way too short, puzzles are fustrating and incomplete. Not worth the money. I guess the sequel is better but this 'demo' did not make me want to buy it. (If you look at the played time, then don't, I completed the game HumbleBundle version)
3794	0	a	I came to this game after playing Lumino City. The reason for this was that I bought Lume via humble bundle for my gf she lost interest quickly and I shortly after got the sequal cheap thinking I'll play Lume when its cheap again. Well! I payed someting like 49p for it and all I can say is that I still feel completley ripped off. I feel so sorry for those who payed full price for a demo. Theres really no reason why this should even be here after the release of Lumino city.  under no circumstance should you buy this, buy the actual game (lumino city) and leave this demo to rot!  and yes 49p is nothing but I could have bought a cheap ♥♥♥ beer for that!
3795	0	a	I refuse to recommend this on the basis of how short it is for the price, but the game itself is not bad. Aside from one obscure puzzle it's fairly straightforward, the plot elements are kind of pointless and the game itself incedibly short (as of writing, at least, though there are more episodes promised?). Even then though the only real draw is the art style itself, the game itself is certainly very interesting to look at if nothing else. The one music track that repeats over and over would get more tedious if the game was longer, I suppose, but yeah, only one music track, enjoy. Like I said though, the game itself is fine except for its length, nothing spectacular and it's probably wiser to throw your money at better point and click adventure games either way, but for the price tag, no, don't even think about it. Bundle or sale, nothing else.
3796	0	a	I would only recommend this game if you can get it for free of maybe a few cents. Its so short, you can hardly call it a game at all. Looks pretty though.
3797	0	a	The most ridiculous game i have ever played.It is a flash game and the puzzles are too easy.I didn't even try to beat the game.If i didn't get this for free i definitely wouldn't buy it.The price is too damn high.
3798	0	a	cute but short and dosnt really go anywhere
3799	0	a	I don't believe i've bought this ♥♥♥♥ for almost 2 bucks....but my son (4 y.o.) like it...
3800	0	a	A beautiful, charming and very well-made game. However, it seems most people, myself included, finish the entire game in less than an hour. Buy it on sale if possible, it's not quite worth the full price.
3801	0	a	Some clever puzzles, but at least two are infuriating with their logic. Less then an hour of game play.  Wait until it's free.
3802	0	a	I can't say that I enjoyed this overly much. It looked great, the graphic style was off the charts, but a couple of the puzzles were so obscure, I had no idea what I was supposed to be doing next. Even with the help of a walkthrough, I was like  'whu,wha,what?'   Still, it was REALLY short, which was a good thing!
3803	0	a	If it weren't for the summer sale I wouldn't have bought it and after reading the Jay Is Games comments on it, I'm not sure if even that was a good deal. Apparently this is just chapter 1 and takes less than 2 hours to complete, and that's no good at full price.
3804	0	a	Lume feels more like a Demo than a full game. When you first play the game your first impression will be of the lovely visual style but then you will wonder why you cannot play this in actual full screen (The game is presented in a small box with no options to enlarge it what-so-ever). So the game looks lovely and you start to explore, you see a city in the background and I truly thought that was meant to be level 2 or that I would get over there and have more puzzles to complete... NOPE.   You complete barely a few puzzles and the game ends. The puzzles are not very hard, I think one or two were just annoying but thats it. I think there was 7 puzzles in total and that is the whole game, don't expect anything extra.  So finally do I reccomend the game? YES....... If it was free or a demo but to actually PAY for this is absurd. The game had potential, I would forgive the easy puzzles if it was just level 1 but no, it was the full game.  Luckily I got this title as part of a bundle so I sorta paid for it but sorta didn't.
3805	0	a	Too short, feels incomplete and puzzles are either too easy or way too counter-intuitive and unnecessary complex.  But, yeah, the main thing is... this game is just a demo. Not a 'Part 1' - maybe a half-decent prologue. Maybe LuminoCity is a more complete experience. I haven't played LuminoCity and don't intend to anytime soon.   Who knows maybe LuminoCity is a 'part 2' of an even 'larger ongoing story' - brrrr.   The art style is great and you can tell that it takes a lot of time and resources to prepare these in-game scenes. So it definitely is worth some of the positive press it got (though, some of the press I 've read might have been way too positive for what the game actually is).   Perhaps Lume could be appended to (read: included with) LuminoCity because on its own it stands poorly.  So, maybe it's worth picking up at a sale, provided that you are aware that you are buying a short-even-for-a-demo of a game.
3806	0	a	Bought for 50% off on sale. It was extremely short. Small resolution, easy puzzles, and a decent game for the 50% off price. Definitely would not buy for the full price.
3807	0	a	That’s a basic Flash game where I got stuck very quickly on a puzzle that didn’t make much sense. I definitely don’t recommend spending money on this.
3808	0	a	Cute but short. It was mostly meh.
3809	0	a	As others have said - beautiful game, done in 1 hr.
3810	0	a	I don't even know what to say about this game, I didn't make it very far in. The way it starts off, the story seems to have been an after-thought, and point-n-click games are mainly meant to be story driven games. This game also appears to have simply been done in flash, and as such, you can not right click as you can in most point-n-click games.  Overall, I would not recommend this game.
3811	0	a	Lume has a very nice graphics, but still, $6,99 for a game which has 6-7 puzzles and you can complete all of them in 30 minutes is definitely not worth! If you want to play, wait until it on sale.  By the way, this game is the first part of series, which mean the story in this game isn't completed and you'll have to wait for the sequels.
3812	0	a	The music and visuals are great, that I have to say, but they will not save Lume from being boring, short and a part of a multi-episode game. I paid for this in a Humble Bundle sale, so no big loss for me. But don't get this game, it's not worth the time, money and bandwidth on downloading this hunk of junk.
3813	0	a	I played a little bit of Lumino City before i discovered there was a game before that. I love Lumino City so i went and bought Lume. SO disappointing! The puzzles makes no sense at all. I had to look at a walk-through while playing. If the puzzles had been logical 'as they are in Lumino City, it would have taken 10 minutes to finish which is not worth anyone's money. I do like the art and the characters. It's very cute and very well made.
3814	0	a	Mixed feelings, similar to a number of other players. Nice, cute, original, but SO EXPENSIVE - it should come for free with Lumino City.   When I bought it a four years ago, I remember now that I was very upset by this game : a regular point &amp;click with no possibility to see where are the hot spots (OK...) ; puzzles are either simple or very confusing (SPOILER : how to you locate the House on the map puzzle?) or very very tough (the infamous 9# one).   So, the playing time may be very short (15' if you give up on the map and 9#) or indefinite for wrong reasons.  I looked again at this game when stumbling upon Lumino City, which of course I decided not to purchase, as I had the feeling I participated into the funding of Lumino City by paying a lot for a mere demo (you learn at the end that the game is 'Lume Part 1'). 
3815	0	a	I really wish I could recommend this game, but I cannot. The overall feeling was that of frustration, disappointment... and for a payed game this isn't right.  I have hopes this company they can make it better on their next title.  + Visually, it is a beautiful and creative approach to game design, everything being hand-made. There is a feeling of authentic and of passion put into it. + The music is soothing and well composed.   - Some of the puzzles are hard just because they don't make sense. They rely on some kind of private logic which feels like a mixture of random tricks and it's frustrating. Basicly testing our ability to guess. - The game is very very short and leaves a sense of having achieved nothing. It's brief story didn't captivate me. - Usability issues: the dialog boxes auto-fade too fast, the mouse cursor is just the default pointer or hand, the resolution is low and to get full screen we must use the Flash-player's default menu to Zoom in.  This game should be considered just a demo, and should be for free.
3816	0	a	Lume is a short, simple and linear story with several puzzles to solve in order to get to the end.   The game runs on flash. The graphics are children-book-alike and the animation is a nice effort on 2.5-D. Gameplay it smooth (simple point and click). The music is nice and calm but if you spend too much time playing the game, the loop can result a little bit boring. The puzzles are rather difficult for a game whose looks seem to be children-oriented and the game gives you almost no-clues. The lenght of the game is, to be honest, too short.  The studio behind Lume (State of Play) is working on a longer and more complex sequel to this game, but unless you catch Lume on a bundle or at a great low price, I would recommend you to buy this first game on the series only if you really love to contribute to small indie teams or if you hate long games (Lume really, really feels too short).
3817	0	a	the state was beautiful, but the play failed. There was a script, and the actors did their part, though the puzzles were far too complex. And, it was really really short. I felt ripped off.
3818	0	a	VERY short and not worth $6!
3819	0	a	Visually beautiful... but that is where it stops. A total rip off. I finished it in all of 15 minutes and then it was over. Chapter 2 never came out and to be honest I wouldn't bother, nor recommend buying it. A total let down.
3820	0	a	The sequal to this is worth the money. This version while cheap only last about 30 minutes to 1 hour. relatively boring.
3821	0	a	Beautiful art style and music. The first two puzzles were fairly simple. After that, they are practically impossible without a guide. I would not recommend this (unless you are really into puzzle games and can see patterns in an instant).
3822	0	a	The game is very beautifully made but there were no hints on how to solve the puzzles. So i needed to find walktroughs on the internet.. And just when it started to get a bit better it seemed the game was already finished. How can you call this a game? Its just a demo! I would have bought the 2nd one instead if i knew how short this one would be! If you want to buy this game then buy it only when its on sale!
3823	0	a	Bought it because I wanted to experience the first chapter to Lumino City.  Game is short and not fundamental to play the (AMAZING) sequel. I'd recommend to skip this chapter, as its not worth it (unless you get it under 2$, in which i'd say to buy it just for the atmosphere)
3824	0	a	Bought for 50% off on sale. It was extremely short. Small resolution, easy puzzles, and a decent game for the 50% off price. Definitely would not buy for the full price.
3825	0	a	Too short for $6.
3826	0	a	It's a nice game, unique graphics and challenging puzzles. It could be a little longer, took under a hour to play. It's not worth the price, feels incomplete.
3827	0	a	rip off where is the rest of the game?
3828	0	a	I found this game disappointing. I bought it ages ago in a Groupees bundle and was intrigued by the unique but fine quality art style. I'm the type of person who puts off playing games, but I played this one right away.   It was very short and I didn't feel like the puzzles were very satisfying. There was one puzzle that I had to look up how to solve, (this seems to be a common issue) but the rest I solved before even getting their clues. I would find items that were completely useless for me. I kept expecting to leave the house after fixing it up, but the game just... ended.  Right now as it is I can't recommend it. I feel like it's definitely unfinished storywise and the difficulty is baffling to me. If it at least had steam trading cards I could say, 'play it if you get it in a bundle' but as it is, I can't even say that. I'd say just look at the pictures or watch the trailer because you'll get all the charm of the art, but none of the disappointment of the actual game.  Note: I am NOT one of the people who criticize this game for its length. I love Hamlet (also on steam) and it's only thirty minutes long. What bothers me is that it feels incomplete and the puzzles weren't fun to me.

3830	0	a	It's a beautiful game and I love the concept, but the game is far too short. Additionally, this is supposed to be episode one of a larger series, but it's been three YEARS with no new episodes. If you like to collect games with new art styles or you don't mind spending a few bucks for an hour or two of entertainment, go ahead and get it. I wouldn't recommend it otherwise at this time.
3831	0	a	The game is way too short, and rather unfulfiling in what little playtime it offers. The visual style is cute and adorable, which was what I went for when I bought this. There's a mobile version of Lume for smartphones too, and in my opinion it's probably worth $0.99 or $1.99. Sure, price isn't comparable between mobile and PC platforms, but honestly though, only get this game when/if it's on sale.
3832	0	a	Don't buy this game. You'll waste your time looking for the right pixels to click and it's very short (if you don't get stuck). Some puzzles are way too easy, while others are simply inconsistent, illogical and thus very fustrating. Worst puzzle-game i've ever played!
3833	0	a	It's certainly a lovely game, but feels far too short for the price it's at. I'm glad I got it at a severely discounted price, but despite attempting to replay it a few times I still feel like I paid too much. Not to mention they have a sequel hook that has gone nowhere.
3834	0	a	I can't run it on Full Screen mode.
3835	0	a	While this got many awards, and is a fairly innovative looking game as far as design, it is far too short, and devoid of challenges for a puzzle game. Unless you can get it for free, I would skip this one.
3836	0	a	That’s a basic Flash game where I got stuck very quickly on a puzzle that didn’t make much sense. I definitely don’t recommend spending money on this.
3837	0	a	Cute but short. It was mostly meh.
3838	0	a	Lume is a Point &amp; Click adventure with a wonderful artstyle. It's too bad we can't enjoy it full screen, because it's made in flash. The other big thing about this game is that it is really short. All I can say that it is a great bundle filler.
3839	0	a	A cute looking point-n-click puzzle game, but that's about it. It's way too short, and the puzzles are either incredibly easy, or plain annoying. For the default price, it's definitely not worth it. In some sort of bundle (the way I got it), it may be OK.
3840	0	a	Lume has a very nice graphics, but still, $6,99 for a game which has 6-7 puzzles and you can complete all of them in 30 minutes is definitely not worth! If you want to play, wait until it on sale.  By the way, this game is the first part of series, which mean the story in this game isn't completed and you'll have to wait for the sequels.
3841	0	a	I don't even know what to say about this game, I didn't make it very far in. The way it starts off, the story seems to have been an after-thought, and point-n-click games are mainly meant to be story driven games. This game also appears to have simply been done in flash, and as such, you can not right click as you can in most point-n-click games.  Overall, I would not recommend this game.
3842	0	a	I can't say that I enjoyed this overly much. It looked great, the graphic style was off the charts, but a couple of the puzzles were so obscure, I had no idea what I was supposed to be doing next. Even with the help of a walkthrough, I was like  'whu,wha,what?'   Still, it was REALLY short, which was a good thing!
3843	0	a	The art style is lovely and about 10 mins of the game is figuring out what you can click on and then figuring out what you need to do with this information. This is not a bad thing, since most point and click games are like this, but there aren't many puzzles and it's not always clear what you're meant to be doing. The game takes about half an hour to finish and feels incomplete (even though there is a clear ending to the game) because it's short.  It's not a bad game, it's unique in it's style and I like the power theme and the animations are alright, but I would only recommend buying it when it's on sale (under the $4 USD mark).
3844	0	a	Lume's not a bad game. There's really only one puzzle that I feel is poorly designed, which requires you to dig through the same handful of books a bunch until you happen upon a specific one with a very vague clue on it, look through the rest of the page, and then visit the Internet and look up the solution.  Results may vary.  I understand Lume as an art piece. And it's a pretty cool one, having used papercraft dioramas to create a point-and-click adventure game. It works better than you might expect. The game doesn't look bad, either, though the characters turned me away before I even started the game. I don't really like their look, but that's not really the problem with this game.  The issue with Lume is that it's short. Including time spent checking the Internet, Steam tells me that it took 0.8 hours to beat the game. So that's roughly 48 minutes. Now, this game is $7. That's a lot of money for less than an hour of an art piece game. I could understand a dollar or two. I wouldn't be so cruel as to suggest it should be free, I know we all have to make money. But for the content, $7 is steep. It's for that reason alone that I cannot recommend it.  The ending mentions that it is the end of Lume: Part 1. If Part 2 were released as an update to the original game, then the price would make a lot more sense. After all, episodic games have been known to charge for the entire game, and then release over sometimes very lengthy amounts of time. Though it's been nearly three years since Part 1's release, at the time of this writing. Another quick glance at the Internet tells me that the next part is still in development, but after all of this time and considering the flash format, I strongly doubt that such will be the case.
3845	0	a	Upshot: If you love artistic games, and are okay with limited amount of 'game' content, go for it, it's gorgeous. If you want a significant chunk of story/plot, you will come away wanting more. This is the first part of a series, and feels very much like an introduction or tutorial to a longger game.  Absolutely beautiful, with some highly enjoyable and unique puzzles, this still left me disappointed. My two complaints:  1. The game ended after what felt like an introduction. I am aware that this is the first part of a story that is to be continued, but I think too much effort was made to cram a full complement of puzzles into a small setting without enough actual story to go with them.  2. The justification and structure of some of the puzzles seemed overly contrived. Why store innocuous and highly useful items in an undersink cabinet with an incredibly complex lock? That goes beyond the character justification of Grandpa loving puzzles.  It's not inherently a flaw, but this game also has one of my personal least favorite puzzle structures- a seemingly-unrelated document that you must figure out the significance of and how to use its contents to solve an unspecified other puzzle. In this case, exacerbated by the stretch of my suspension of disbelief that the protagonist somehow picks this one document out of an entire bookshelf. Doesn't bother some people, bugs me badly.  I really wanted to love this game, and I will probably get the next installment, despite the flaws, but given the sense of dissatisfaction I felt at the end, I am glad I got this as part of a bundle. I would be very displeased if I had paid full price. I would have been happier with a bit more room to move, and either a bit more story, or less hinting that there was going to be more; if I had known from the beginning that literally _all_ I was going to do was turn on the lights, I might have been okay with that.
3846	0	a	There are only 5-6 puzzles in this game. Most are fun, but one is infuriatingly obtuse. Some of the object interactions are also non-intuitive.
3847	0	a	The graphical styling is beautiful and very unique. It's like a little teeny tiny work of art.  Having said that, it's also so ridiculously short that it makes you feel like you've just about made it through the intro and then the game abruptly ends. I picked my copy up in a humble bundle and it was an added extra rather than the thing I bought the bundle for, but if I'd paid full price for this I think I'd be wondering how they justified the sticker price.  If it was a demo for a (much) larger game then it would be a great recommendation, however as a paid for game in its own right it really isn't worth it.
3848	0	a	I picked this up a while ago and was perturbed by its short length. Granted, it was picked up on the cheap, but at this point, even at a discounted price of around $2, I can't find myself recommending it over other adventure/puzzle games on Steam. The visual style is fresh and unique and I like it, but that doesn't offset the short length (only about 30 minutes) and the lack of inspiration/challenge behind the puzzles. You can find longer and better games like this for the same price, and looking into the company, there doesn't appear to be a release date in mind for the sequel. After so many years, that is very disconcerting. Take your money and look elsewhere for a more complete game at a similar price, or put your money on a Humble Bundle.
3849	0	a	As most have posted previously this game was pretty short. I believe there were maybe a half dozen puzzles, suggesting this is only the first level, but most of which I enjoyed. The only thing I didn't really care for was that there were too many clickable areas. For instance in one area there is a whole region of area where you can click on and the character will say 'thats not useful to me' with 1 little section of it being useful. I just got sick of closing bubbles. I love the style of the game, and with some tweaking I could see a completed version of this game being pretty good. As it stands though I don't think theres enough content to be worthwhile. I got this for essentially $.25 on humblebundle, and it was worth it, but a couple bucks seems a bit much for essentially a demo.
3850	0	a	Lume looked intereting, and it was, for as long as it lasted. I played it with my friend from over his shoulder, and it didn't last long enough to make me tired of standing. Half hour to an hour at max. The puzzles were interesting, but the story and gametime left me wanting; I'm all for short, sweet, games, but I've got kind of a content threshold that Lume didn't even come close to meeting.
3851	0	a	I'd recommend this game if a) your plane has a delay, or b) if the game is 90% off.   It's pretty short, barely has a story if you can call wandering around a house a story. I thought it was going to be a lot longer or a lot more fun, say like Tiny bang story or another point and click puzzler. In short, this game barely even qualifies as a demo.
3852	0	a	some puzzles are ridiculously hard, there are nearly no clues and i missed a help function at some points. The biggest problem of the game is his 'length'. The whole game includes 1 little House and a little meadow. Wow! I am very disappointed about Lume...
3853	0	a	Don't buy it. I totally hated this game. I usually enjoy this kind of artistic little indie game but I dont exactly know why but this game is really annoying. Doesn't worth $6.99 and doesn't worth wasting your time and money even on sale. It's about 30 minutes long, it's really childish and and puzzles are whether really easy or impossible. The graphic style is really cool but the overall game doesn't worth playing.
3854	0	a	I can't run it on Full Screen mode.
3855	0	a	way too short for the price paid.. wish I read the reviews below. Wait til the sequel/ part 2 gets developed and patched on?
3856	0	a	This game is so short that doesn't worth the money, it should be a free demo!  I bought it because i find the graphic very nice-looking (and it is) but i managed to complete the game in barely 67 minutes. 
3857	0	a	Far too short for this price. If you can get it as part of a bundle or if it is on sale - do it, but 7€ for about 30-120min of playtime is too much.
3858	0	a	Just terrible controls ... can't work out WTF you're doing clicking madly and randomly around the place in a hope something will be triggered. Regret buying.
3859	0	a	Really enchanting looks (even though in low resolution), but embarassingly short for its price. Wouldn't define it a 'small wonder' too, as the puzzles are few, simple and sometimes annoying. This is a pretty good demo, sold as a solid indie game.  I needed more than an hour to finish this just because the 'save' feature isn't working, thing I discovered trying to reload a save near to the end.
3860	0	a	All the fun of a very basic and tedious Flash point-and-click game, but with the crucial difference of having to pay first!  Congratulations on the 'sumptuously filmed' set 'built entirely out of paper and cardboard' - it really came to life in the tiny low-resolution Flash window!
3861	0	a	'This game forms Part 1 of a larger, ongoing story.'  When I bought this, I expected more parts to be coming. Since nothing has happened for 2,5 years, it seems clear that there will never be any other parts.  It feels a bit like paying for a movie and getting only the trailer. It's annoying because you feel like someone stole your money, but it's also annoying because the trailer was really good and left you wanting.
3862	0	a	I'm very glad I got this while it was on  humblebundle.com  so I didn't pay the regular price for it. Way too short for $6.99, but it was pretty and fun while it lasted.
3863	0	a	I picked this up randomly during a Steam sale. I really wanted to like this game because the art was so cute and I love point and click puzzlers. However, the puzzles are incredibly easy and there are a couple that are just vague enough to be annoying.   There is definitely potential here and I would have liked to see less dialog bubbles and perhaps less of a childish voice which makes the game seem like it's geared towards kids, though I doubt most kids would figure out some of these puzzles before getting frustrated.   Also, as others have pointed out, this is merely an intro chapter in what is supposed to be a longer game. It should be advertised as such and is not.
3864	0	a	really not worth it
3865	0	a	Buy Lume? No thanks...not worth it
3866	0	a	Some nice art, but tiresome and derivative.
3867	0	a	Totally not worth the price.
3868	0	a	A sweet little casual adventure/puzzle game centered on energy and light. I like the quaint cardboard set as graphic style, although it could be even more gritty without problem, and the puzzles are plentiful and varied enough for one to move to another if you don't really get it the first time. Music's a little tedious after a while, but not actually annoying.  A little quibble: It's a Flash game, and that's not in itself a disqualifier but the Flash Player doesn't hide the menubar properly on OS X. I can easily overlook this though.  EDIT: completed way too easily!
3869	0	a	The art style is nice, but the game itself isn't worth seven bucks at all. Puzzles go from really easy to impossible without a guide, and there's only like seven puzzles in the entire game. You could beat it in less than an hour, even if you got stuck. Spend your seven bucks on something else, like one of the dungeon keeper games off of GOG.
3870	0	a	Rename from Lume to Lame.. Lame because it was way to short..  I finished part 1 = check Part 2 here I come = check Then I wait... and wait... where is part 2?? Omg! Was this it?  It was good while it lasted!
3871	0	a	 This game is a disappointment, but I should talk about the pros first.
3872	0	a	Tl;dr: Short low res flash point and click adventure game which could do well with more guides to help you along. Good artistic quality and music.  You play as Lumi who visits her grandfather's place only to find him missing and the house without power. You then go about clicking various items to find clues and puzzles to advance forward in the quest of restoring powering back to the house.   There are about 7 puzzles, of varying difficulty, from matching patterns and numbers, a map with a grid, a puzzle board, to one with a musical sequence. I got stumped at the last puzzle and found it too vague, with minimal instructions and clues. Frustrated and without any further hints in game to move forward I resorted to an online guide. The last puzzle I thought could do with more clearer instructions and/or hints and likewise for the plot device of assembling a contraption which required some items that were not clearly stated. Puzzles and exploring things through clicking around were fine, but it got to a stage where it felt like a wild goose chase, except you are not quite sure what you are supposed to find in the first place.  After the struggles and expecting to progress forward, the game came to an abrupt end with a promise of a continuation. That was about under an hour of gameplay.   The second instalment called Lumino City was scheduled to be released Spring'13 but seems to be delayed, though there are updates on their facebook page as at Jan'14. The sequel seems to involve a larger world for exploration and more puzzles.   Commendable is the artistic quality that was put into the building of the detailed sets and the pleasing music fitted the atmosphere well.  The flash game ran at a small 800 x 535 resolution so it sat in a black rectangular box in the middle of the screen. Overall, the lack of hints or signposts to point you in the right direction along with the short duration and lack of replay value for the game, I find it hard to justify the value of the game, even for a quick one off experience.

3875	0	a	Very very very short. Looks like a demo. Keep your money.
3876	0	a	A beautiful, charming and very well-made game. However, it seems most people, myself included, finish the entire game in less than an hour. Buy it on sale if possible, it's not quite worth the full price.
3877	0	a	Some clever puzzles, but at least two are infuriating with their logic. Less then an hour of game play.  Wait until it's free.
3878	0	a	I don't believe i've bought this ♥♥♥♥ for almost 2 bucks....but my son (4 y.o.) like it...
3879	0	a	rip off where is the rest of the game?
3880	0	a	A visually impressive flash puzzle game. I enjoyed the paper cut out look to this game and the music, but unfortunately this game is too short to enjoy, maybe under an hour to complete; if you use a walkthrough probably 20-30 minutes. There's about five puzzles total, with one puzzle being too vague to figure out on your own (the cabinet lock). Good game, but too short to pay more than a dollar or two.
3881	0	a	Lume is a Point &amp; Click adventure with a wonderful artstyle. It's too bad we can't enjoy it full screen, because it's made in flash. The other big thing about this game is that it is really short. All I can say that it is a great bundle filler.
3882	0	a	I can't say that I enjoyed this overly much.

3883	0	a	If it weren't for the summer sale I wouldn't have bought it and after reading the Jay Is Games comments on it, I'm not sure if even that was a good deal. Apparently this is just chapter 1 and takes less than 2 hours to complete, and that's no good at full price.
3884	0	a	It's a nice game, unique graphics and challenging puzzles. It could be a little longer, took under a hour to play. It's not worth the price, feels incomplete.
3885	0	a	While this got many awards, and is a fairly innovative looking game as far as design, it is far too short, and devoid of challenges for a puzzle game. Unless you can get it for free, I would skip this one.
3886	0	a	Too short for $6.
3887	0	a	Not worth the money paid

3891	0	a	I found this game disappointing. I bought it ages ago in a Groupees bundle and was intrigued by the unique but fine quality art style. I'm the type of person who puts off playing games, but I played this one right away.   It was very short and I didn't feel like the puzzles were very satisfying. There was one puzzle that I had to look up how to solve, (this seems to be a common issue) but the rest I solved before even getting their clues. I would find items that were completely useless for me. I kept expecting to leave the house after fixing it up, but the game just... ended.  Right now as it is I can't recommend it. I feel like it's definitely unfinished storywise and the difficulty is baffling to me. If it at least had steam trading cards I could say, 'play it if you get it in a bundle' but as it is, I can't even say that. I'd say just look at the pictures or watch the trailer because you'll get all the charm of the art, but none of the disappointment of the actual game.  Note: I am NOT one of the people who criticize this game for its length. I love Hamlet (also on steam) and it's only thirty minutes long. What bothers me is that it feels incomplete and the puzzles weren't fun to me.
3892	0	a	Ok, so this is a puzzle game. When I started playing, the first thing I noticed was the very neat graphics. It was a great idea to use the cardboard looking graphics in this beautifly designed game, makes it all feel cousy.  The puzzles are both few and pretty easy to beat, but they are definitely great for younger ages for their simplicity. As the game only took me less than an hour to beat there wasn't a lot of gameplay to it. And I think the reason for me to take that long was the overall relaxed atmosphere that this game brought.  Part of the reason it had a relaxed atmosphere was the very slow and cousy soundtrack that I enjoyed listening to.  I would've loved to say that I'm recommending this game to all puzzlelovers out there, but the lack of gameplay and puzzles makes this game just not worth your money.  Pros: *Cute graphics *Good soundtrack *There was a red line in the story  Cons: *Too few, easy puzzles *Short game  My overall rating of the game is 6/10
3893	0	a	I have bought this game after playing lumino city, which I liked a lot. Although 'lume' has a similar gameplay, I felt really disappointed when it finished after only a few puzzles. The game is definitely way to short, giving a poor value for money (I paid 2.88 Euro against the recommended 5.99 Euro). It would have been brilliant as a 'low-cost/for free teaser demo' for lumino city.  Bottom line: if I had known the game was as short as it was, I would not have bought it.  My recommendation: skip this one and go straight to lumino city, which gives a much higher value for money.
3894	0	a	 ....WUT?  That's it?
3895	0	a	Lol what?
3896	0	a	Hmm. Well that was slightly difficult, with about six puzzles, two of which I had to check on a walkthrough. And then it suddenly ends. I'm not sure how much I paid for it, but I don't particularly think it would have been worth it. Perhaps Lumino City will be better.
3897	0	a	Amazingly creative combination of video of real-world objects with rendered in-game objects, and fantastic music can not save this droll, arbitrary, point-n-click.  I had forgotten why I despised this genre of game. Lume reminded me why.
3898	0	a	This game is indeed really short, you basically just see a handful of screens. The puzzles themselves aren't really designed in a clever way. Sometimes the solutions are pretty strange (i.e. why do I have to apply an inventory item _twice_ to an object?). Overall this feels more like a proof of concept than a polished game. The graphical style is nice, but it's really low-res for today's standard. Overall I wouldn't really recommend getting it.
3899	0	a	This is not a game.  It's an hour long. I thought I had finished the tutorial and the game ended.  It's not even worth $6. I can understand a higher-than-usual pricetag for the art that went into it, but however nice it is to look at the set, it's small. The whole 'set'/game is basically 6 rooms (two of which are closets).   Haven't played Luminocity yet, but I hope it's a heck of a lot longer.
3900	0	a	Oh, no! The power is out, so gramps is off to take care of things, Actually, gramps is off doing who knows what, and it's up to Lume to break into his carefully safeguarded home by solving his puzzle-based home security system. To make this, and the eventual destruction of his bicycle, up to him, Lume and the player decide to restore the electricity, thus emasculating grandpa and taking away his sense of personal validation.  *ahem*  A breathtakingly gorgeous puzzle game, Lume is brought down by a few technical problems and its incredibly short length.  What technical problems could a game like this have? Well, the resolution is (according to the Steam details page) 800x600. If that's not correct, the fact remains that even at fullscreen, it takes up a tiny portion of my screen. Very tiny. Laughably tiny. It was so small, it affected my ability to appreciate its aesthetics and, at times, solve the puzzles. Yes, puzzles -- did you think those last few lines referred to something else?!  *ahem*  Furthermore, and this is a choice made by the developers, the Myst-like screen transitions have got to go.  Finally, the game was built in Flash and is clunky. I wish they had... well, done anything else, to be frank.  All but one puzzle -- perhaps I'm forgetting another -- were quite easy. The other wasn't difficult so much as it required careful observation and recollection as to what we had investigated thus far. Expect to spend most of your playtime wondering what the heck the game wants you to do on this one, or perhaps another. Oh, and by investigated, I mean clicked anything that switched the cursor icon to a hand.  Honestly, there really isn't much else to the game. That's because Lume is a demo for a larger title, Lumino City -- a fact I did not realize until moments before beginning this review. I'm disappointed, and while I really want to recommend this, I don't think I can. Maybe watch the trailer, and if it strikes your fancy, and you don't mind shelling out $1 for a charming one-hour puzzler, pick this up. If you want something with more meat on its bones, check out Lumino City. I have not played it, and... hm. I may not. As of writing, I'm undecided.  Too long, didn't read: Lume is beautiful, and has some decent puzzles, but the mobile-spawned graphic settings will irritate anyone playing on anything other than an old laptop, and the fact that it's essentially a tech demo is a turnoff.
3901	0	a	The visuals are lovely, but the story is generic, almost absent, and there is no logical way to arrive at the answer to many of the puzzles. The clues are there, but there are dozens, sometimes hundreds of ways they could be interpreted rationally, and you just have to *know* which method the developers used.
3902	0	a	This game is stunning and has several quite hard puzzles, however this game is not worth its ful price since it's so short and mostly a demo to 'Lumino City'. Buy it on sale, or just settle for the main game is my recommendation.
3903	0	a	Lume is a pretty simple point-and-click puzzler. I feel like this works to the game's detriment. I have about 4 hours on record, and honestly, most of that was spent recording a video walkthrough. This game is short enough that it feels like a demo, as opposed to an actual game. For $5.99, I'm glad I picked this up in a bundle--I'd have felt cheated otherwise.  That said, this game is breathtaking in presentation. The graphics are simply gorgeous, and the music lends to the atmophere that ties presentation up with a beautiful bow. The puzzles are fairly unique, but I wouldn't call them challenging. Overall, this is something that could easily kill an hour or so, but there's simply not enough content to justify purchasing the game in any form other than a bundle. I'd like to see a sequel, expansion or update with significantly more content. I might change my tune if that were to happen.  UPDATE: I was unaware of the sequel. Given that the sequel is $20 and adds a mere four hours of content to the game (based on the reviews), I feel as though the sequel should have no bearing on my feelings toward Lume in general.
3904	0	a	Lume is a pretty simple point-and-click puzzler. I feel like this works to the game's detriment. I have about 4 hours on record, and honestly, most of that was spent recording a video walkthrough. This game is short enough that it feels like a demo, as opposed to an actual game. For $5.99, I'm glad I picked this up in a bundle--I'd have felt cheated otherwise.  That said, this game is breathtaking in presentation. The graphics are simply gorgeous, and the music lends to the atmophere that ties presentation up with a beautiful bow. The puzzles are fairly unique, but I wouldn't call them challenging. Overall, this is something that could easily kill an hour or so, but there's simply not enough content to justify purchasing the game in any form other than a bundle. I'd like to see a sequel, expansion or update with significantly more content. I might change my tune if that were to happen.  UPDATE: I was unaware of the sequel. Given that the sequel is $20 and adds a mere four hours of content to the game (based on the reviews), I feel as though the sequel should have no bearing on my feelings toward Lume in general.
3905	0	a	I hate bashing on Ozzie companies. ;p And this isn't an evil, unplayable game. My first impression was good, I played it for a bit, expected to play more, had it installed forever, yet every time I fire it up, I close it after 5 minutes.  It's a match 3 game with some 3D tetris elements. The concept is good. The graphics are polished. The music isn't bad. The controls feel annoying at first, but they're actually mostly okay. The problem is, the gameplay doesn't feel satisfying. It expects (and rewards, scorewise) big combos and long term strategy. It also expects you to be fast and responsive. This should theoretically work, in that zen-like way games like this work, but it doesn't. The rythym and pacing feels all off, it feels like the speed jumps from 1,2,3,4,5 to 50 to 150. Once you get into the zone and start planning ahead for later big score combos, it feels like you blink and the game jumps speed, asking you to go for quick, 'just don't make a mistake' placement. That may be totally subjective of course, or it could be that the feeling gets exacerbated by the clunky cube placement process. It simply isn't visually always obvious or easy to correctly target the location you want on a constantly rotating cube, which really hurts the game when it picks up speed. People misplace blocks on tetris too, but usually feel it's their fault, here it feels like the cube jumps place three times before you can be sure it's where it should be. By which time the game has jumped two speed gears and you're basically done with.  Again, not a bad game, in theory. I just never feel like playing it long, because it doesn't feel very enjoyable. The thumbs down is just trying to balance a 'very positively' reviewed game, with an 80 something metacritic score that few people seem to actually play much (notice the curiously short play times of the majority of the positive reviewers?). So I'd suggest to approach with caution, and at least play the demo first.
3906	0	a	0/10 - couldn't get it to run - Visual C++ Runtime Library error, and yes I tried the forum recommendations. no joy.
3907	0	a	Very repetative soundtrack, gameplay seems interesting but really didn't work out for me and was just a frustrating slog. I tried but found no way to get into it.
3908	0	a	Says it works for Macintosh Devices, however it does not! Do not buy this if you're using Mac otherwise you will be sad you lost two dollars.
3909	0	a	Its a small game. Seems like the kind of things that should be free or available in a flash version. Kinda dissapointed I paid for it once I found out how quickly it got old.
3910	0	a	If you're an achievement hunter, avoid. The leaderboard achievements are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and may be nearly impossible to get legitly.  Otherwise, it's a good time waster, but wasn't that all fun for me than what I was to believe. I strongly suggest you play the demo first and see if it's fun for you, but I would avoid this game even if you're not going for achievements.
3911	0	a	As user [FOR]Mica aptly summarized, 'Critical Mass can't decide if it wants to be frantic or strategic, and ends up being neither instead of both.' If you go too long without making a combo, the block structure starts to rumble (go critical). You only have a few seconds then to make a combo, or only enough time to add a few blocks, but there's no timer or other useful indicator before the sudden explosion. There's also no indicator what the next block color will be, so you can't plan ahead much. If you were hoping to build up a bridge between two widely-spaced blocks for a big combo, well too bad, adding all those blocks in between could make the structure unstable. Even though planning for big combos is way more satisfying and yields a better score, it's like the game makes that awkward and instead pushes you for quick easy combos instead.  Worst of all IMO, the entire soundtrack is 8 measures that repeat over and over forever. It's a soothing trip-hop kind of beat, but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ it wouldn't have killed the developer to include an actual song or three. Even Tetris had multiple tracks!  So while the basic match-4 premise of the game and the graphical polish are great (even has a colorblind mode), some of the design decisions need more time in the oven.
3912	0	a	Not recommended for a few reasons, mainly - the achievements. This is because I am a big achievement hunter so when games do things like THIS game does, it really annoys me. At least 5 of the achievements (maybe more, I forget) require you to get to Rank 1 on the leaderboards in each game type as well as the Overall leaderboards. This is impossible through legitimate play as the current Rank 1 players are clearly hackers, so there is no way for anyone to claim those achievments legitimately. If they had weekly or daily leaderboards it would make much more sense. That being the main reason, this game also fails at what it claims to be 'action-puzzle.' Sure it can be fast paced but it's almost impossible to do extremely well just because the game lends itself to being a slow paced strategic game. You can't see your next block color, it doesn't have any indication how close you are to losing etc. Which are all sort of staples of said action-puzzle games. Don't buy it 1/10
3913	0	a	For the 5 minutes that I played, the 6 second loop of a soundtrack ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off to the point of shutting off the game.   And even if they had hired a better composer, it's still just a mediocre match 4 puzzle game that is very difficult to make combos in because there's no way to see inside the puzzle.
3914	0	a	I really want to like this game. Truly and sincerely, it is almost a good game. I love what it's trying to go for. Unfortunately, it is a single-player game with a bizarre and unfathomable reliance on having a constant internet connection, apparently in order to enable the leaderboard. It is physically difficult to play it offline, and the steam forums for it are full of people with various technical problems -- like having the main game interface not load, or the automatic attempt to log in crashing the game.  It could have used a little more polish.  Unfortunately, the lack of polish extends all the way to the game design, too. Critical Mass can't decide if it wants to be frantic or strategic, and ends up being neither instead of both. If you go too long without making a combo, the puzzle swells to take up more and more of the screen, and it gets harder and harder to see what's going on -- which encourages carelessness, which only makes the problem worse. The timer for how long you can go without making a combo is also significantly too short -- rather than adding intensity to the game, it just stops me from being able to build up any kind of a rhythm.  There are so many tiny details that counter-productively disrupt eachother, rather than produce a coherent experience.  All of that said, it's still a really neat idea, and it works well enough to give you a taste for the game they *tried* to make. I eagerly await either a slightly better-polished copycat game, or a patch that might make Critical Mass feel a little more finished. I don't regret buying it a bit, but I also don't see myself playing it more than an hour a year, as I periodically forget and remember its existance.  If there is ever a patch, I will update this review. Until then, don't pay more than a dollar.
3915	0	a	Great idea, hampered by annoying controls and viewpoints - the reasons tetris 3D didn't take off. Firstly viewing in 2D, and secondly controlling using a mouse to point and rotate. All this while the blocks are expanding and approaching a time-limit for self-destruction. It's a game that would work well once you can control and see what you're doing, but ultimately I found the fiddly controls too frustrating.   I do commend the designers though, the presentation of the game is great. It's just a practical issue of selecting in 3D with precision against a timer. It's like playing a 3D game of chess against a timer where you have 10 seconds to make a move each turn. The two aren't compatible unless you're a 4-dimensional being with access to 3D-vision.  I would play this on untimed modes.
3916	0	a	Warning: DPI overscan problems prevent this game from working on modern PCs.   This is a derivative puzzle game which functions like a 3D version of Bust-A-Move/Puzzle Bobble. You rotate a shape made of coloured cubes around three axes, and drop additional cubes onto the structure. When you match 4 cubes of the same size, they disappear. If you add too many cubes, it explodes (critical mass). If you wait too long, you lose.  Not terribly original, but a fair enough attempt at a puzzle game.  The problem is that they did zero testing on modern PCs. Almost every modern PC requires DPI scaling be set to enable text to be readable on retina level displays, like UHD. The people behind Critical Mass never tested this, so they don't know that you can't use the interface because your mouse only hits 1/4 of the screen.  However, they do still want your money, and because of this technical issue which prevents the game from working, I must warn people away. Don't waste your money on unplayable games like this.
3917	0	a	Feels very unfinished, as if they just slapped the 3D element onto match-4 and then released it changing nothing else.
3918	0	a	Buy only if it is on offer !!
3919	0	a	Mediocre puzzle game with broken leaderboards, achievements and lack of support.
3920	0	a	Totally random! If you want a puzzle game involving cubes that's just complete luck, then this is for you. They want this game to be fast paced except you need to be so precise and think a lot about all your moves. The formations to get points are never lines, they always have to be curved. So overallI give it a TEN! Out of 100.
3921	0	a	3D cube matching game where you must race to match colors before the whole structure gets too big and hits Critical Mass. You basically have two options: rotate or place and the gameplay doesn't get any more complex than that. There's 4 different game modes, but they really don't feel vastly different. The game doesn't even provide basic gameplay elements like a heads up about what the next color is so you can strategize accordingly. It's a different spin on the classic Tetris game, but it was unable to hold my interest for more than a couple hours.
3922	0	a	A mediocre match-four block game where the camera shakes when you're about to lose the attempt at the level to try and keep you from digging out of the hole you're in. It has a leaderboard thing measuring how you rank in the world compared to other people bored enough to play this.
3923	0	a	I just can't recommend wasting time or money on this unless you have exhausted all the better puzzle games on Steam. Including the ones that came out after this. In fact, just wait for another one instead of buying/playing this. The modes all seem samey, the scoring seems semi-random, leaderboards and achievements are broken (and this is just what I SPOTTED, god knows what didn't work under the surface) and to top it all off it was never really enthralling like a good Bejeweled or Squarelogic or whatever your puzzle drug of choice is.
3924	0	a	Critical Mass is a match-four puzzler where players place different colored cubes in a three-dimensional space. The player must eliminate all cubes in the game area before reaching 'critical mass'. Scoring combos will reduce the critical mass level and buy the player some time.   This game features several play modes. Classic proceeds through several levels of predefined shapes with randomized arrangements. Rush requires the player to remove all the blocks while the score decreases. Survival requires the player to stave off critical mass for a set period of time. Meditation gives the player a set number of blocks to remove with no time limit or failure conditions.   As far as gameplay goes, scoring a combo does have a good feel to it and the game itself is reasonably polished, however this game fails to get my recommendation. Firstly, the since the game involves a three-dimensional shape, the gameplay often devolves to a guessing game where the player may (or may not) get lucky by placing a cube on a hidden vein of like colored consecutive blocks. Secondly this game's music is quite literally a 10 second, rather generic, clip on loop. Meditation features a different 10 second clip but the rest are the same. Lumines, another match-four puzzle game, changes the visual style and music as the player progresses which keeps things fresh and interesting.  To it's merit the game can be played with just the mouse, so if you're looking for a game that can be played with one hand (maybe with a beer in the other hand). Also the developers were thoughtful enough to include a colorblind mode which adds a symbol to each block.   Score: 5/10
3925	0	a	This game reached critical mass, I uninstalled.
3926	0	a	I like puzzle games, but this one fell flat for me. (Sorry!)
3927	0	a	Meh.  Very short match-4 gameplay that is more quick-twitch than cerebral. Didn't enjoy it.  Only paid ~40 cents for it though.
3928	0	a	Crashes
3929	0	a	I really don't know bout the #1 achievement...
3930	0	a	An interesting idea: you have a limited amount of time to remove all the blocks by matching four or more of the same coloured blocks. The three dimensional nature of the game does mean it can be quite frustrating though as there were numerous situations where a block was misplaced and the blocks you're given to place with are random which adds an obnoxious layer of RNG ♥♥♥♥ery. You would probably be better off playing English Country Tune or Puzzle Dimension before even considering Critical Mass.
3931	0	a	i am going to say no for 2 dollers on sale it is 45 cents witch is a steal for any game. this is a game for i guess puzzle loves but it not really a puzzle it realy just a speed run i guess i do not care for it but if it 45 cents it wourth the buy
3932	0	a	Critical Mass has a good concept, but the choice of color ruins the experience. It uses red, orange and yellow (and a bunch of other colors). The issue happens when you want to place one of the three colors, because when you're choosing a 'spot' for your block to land, it's done with a transparent representation of that block. That means that red will look orange next to orange, yellow will look orange next to orange and red, and orange will look whatever it damn wants between the two.  It sounds like a minor nitpick, but it causes you to make mistakes even if you are not colorblind. It's really inexcusable in a color-based puzzle game.
3933	0	a	Reaches critically boring mass quickly. I was waiting for the game to add anything interesting, but you soon realize that all you get is what you see in the first minute or two of gameplay. I'm not a fan of Tetris, but Tetris is more interesting than this. If you want a 3D block-vanishing game, Block Out did it better in 1989 for the Amiga. Overall a game I wouldn't use a PC for anyway. Maybe ok for a mobile time waster game. On PC there are plenty of more interesting games.  Notable: Crashed after changing graphics settings on first run. / Lost online connection once and never regained it until I had to kill the game because it was stuck searching for some online functionality. Completely unneccesary for such a basic game.
3934	0	a	Could only take this for 15 minutes before getting entirely bored of it. Graphics: Smooth enough, but literally just cubes. Sound: I hope you like one 20-second loop played endlessly. Gameplay: Simple, uninteresting. Probably an original spin on this genre but the genre itself is one of the least interesting things to me.  Maybe not the game for me since there's not much fundamentally wrong with it but I would say there are many better uses of your money even in the genre.
3935	0	a	Wow this game sucks. I made the mistake of getting it for 99 cents on some steam sale; back then I was new and didn't understand that you shouldn't go buying every 99 cent game out there. Lesson learned.
3936	0	a	It's like a 3D tetris sort of game, so in other words not very good.
3937	0	a	Mouse controls just a bit too fidgety for me.
3938	0	a	This is the WORST game ever! DON'T you ever buy it, even if someone is gifting you this game - DON'T accept! And I'll tell you why: You would expect this game to be fun and easy - well it's not - my hand hurts a lot and it's shaking, I didn't get the achievements I was aiming for, my eyes are red and everything hurts... that's due to the fact that I played for 5 hours straight and found this PIECE OF SH*T ridiculously bad - that's in the rare occasion that you actually log in. Yeah - for years the developers of this are making money and they never fixed the issue, that EVERYBODY is experiencing with this game - not to be able to log in (maybe if you're lucky - from the 30th time). STAY AWAY!
3939	0	a	A game named for your mom.
3940	0	a	Is the best game i ever play with my ♥♥♥♥ in the bathroom . Who create this must to be punished by hitting him with my ♥♥♥♥ .
3941	0	a	It's the kind of casual puzzle game that makes you wonder... why the hell it was even made in the first place? It's not /bad/, it's just very pointless.
3942	0	a	Pretty boring. I thought it would be like a reverse rubix cube puzzle game but the camera/aiming controls are ♥♥♥, the music is the same 10 sec loop featured in the trailer repeating forever, and the combo system is shallow. There's plenty of other good puzzle games on Steam so skip this.
3943	0	a	a critical experience in this Massive game
3944	0	a	Crashes and loses internet connection. Not very innovative game.
3945	0	a	Dime a dozen tetris inspired game.  Decent controls. Casual is harder than I would expect for casual, perhaps they shot for the thing to be very hard?  Nothing of note for this game.
3946	0	a	A game with a good concept but poor implementation. Modes don't feel that varied. Controls seemed a little bit awkward, and at times unresponsive. A poor showing for something that has time sensitive elements to it. More frustrating than it's worth.
3947	0	a	Critical Mass is a match-4 game played on a rubiks-like cube with a few different modes that try to do something new with this particular type of puzzle but ultimately don't end up adding much to the game. My main beef with it is that offline mode is severely crippled--since most of the gameplay is point-based and matched up with worldwide online leaderboards, playing offline limits you to about two different play modes. This seems pretty unneccessary--why not just focus on personal scores and times instead? It's especially annoying for people like me who are on a metered connection and play offline frequently to avoid overage charges. Even more annoying (for achievement hunters, of which I am one) is that several of the achievements are effectively broken, since they require the player to, among other things, reach #1 in the online leaderboards. My other favorite one is subtitled 'Play for 100 hours.' ...No thanks.  There are a few other little annoyances which I would be willing to overlook if the rest of the game were salavageable, but in this case just made me dislike the game more. The music track is a simple loop, very short, that you'll need to turn off after a few minutes to avoid going insane. I did like the game's namesake mechanic in which you're required to clear blocks before the cube becomes too heavy for the screen and reaches 'critical mass.' It's basically a time limit for each level, but it kept me playing the game a little bit longer than I would have otherwise.  I guess if you're not much of an achievement hunter (that one really killed it for me), and aren't on a metered connection or simply don't mind staying online all the time, and you're looking for a simple puzzle game to kill some time with, you would probably find Critical Mass enjoyable, but I feel like there are so many other games that have done this one better that you'd be better off choosing something else.
3948	0	a	This game might be cheap and might look like fun, but it's refusing to run properly. It doesn't show which blocks I'm placing and that's just silly. If you can get it to work properly (in my case, it's a lot of hassle), it's a decent puzzle game, but it's far too much effort to go through to play this regularly.
3949	0	a	It just got old really quick for me. I love puzzle games and matching games but for the life of me I just couldn't enjoy this game for longer than 10 minutes. Playing this prompted me to quickly open another puzzle game instead.
3950	0	a	Critical Mass asks a simple question: What happens when you turn a Match-3 game into a 3D model? And that is what you get: A mass of cubes that requires you to match 4 cubes of the same colour to clear the level, and the idea alone is rather fascinating...  ...Except that the main mode is basically a time trial mode, where the mass of cubes expands all the time and explodes at 'critical mass' level. Once it does that, the whole level restarts and you lose all your previous power-ups.  I find this implementation frustrating, as it never gives you the right breathing room to think about your cube placements. I understand that there is a Zen Mode where you are free to clear cubes at your own pace, but the fact that I can't play through the vanilla ranked mode properly leaves a bad taste to me. If only they have a time limit for each level instead of making the mass of cubes a timed bomb, I would have enjoyed this game much more.
3951	0	a	 What I liked:      Another relaxing game     A 3D match 3 game ( I don't like match 3, but it's cool concept)   What You Need to Know:      This really is not my kinda game, as you can tell by my hours     So this thumbs down is only for people who know they don't like match 3, this game won't change your mind     No issues or crashes    My Score:
3952	0	a	Even at the lowest settings, this game lags with nearly unplayable frame rates. Despite the very modest requirements, this game does not play well with Windows 8.   And that 2.6hrs of gameplay? I'm pretty sure that's a bug. I've only managed to play one game, and I only played one game due to how badly it lagged.
3953	0	a	Is it a good game? No idea! Can't get past GFWL-login screen.
3954	0	a	It's a decent platformer, but I've played too many decent platformers to bother with one that doesn't have something unique to bring to the table. In this case the attempt at something unique seems to be unsubtle commentary about sexism in video games, but it doesn't really work, and with credit to Richard Cobbett of RPS, 'down that path goes most bad game parody – joking about how crap something is, and then straight-up doing the crap thing instead of the trickier task of finding some way to subvert it.' Also, the sound gets annoying pretty fast. Go do some handstands instead; your shoulders will thank you.
3955	0	a	I wish I could give a 'barely thumbs down' on a graduated scale...  Nice ideas, nice scifi environment, nice music... But I personally just cannot get used to the explode-as-jumping mechanic. The fact that it uses inconsistent animations prevents me from getting a good feel for my movement.
3956	0	a	Ms Splosion Man is not a bad game, far from it. It never reached a point where it was explicitly bad, but unless you've beaten every other platformer under the sun. Your money is better spent elsewhere. The gameplay can't compare to the sheer number out there today. Also, the humor is funny during the intro and ending, in-between it's just obnoxious. I recommend muting and playing your own music over it.
3957	0	a	I wanted to like this game, but I couldn't get into the 'humor' that is an extreme stereotyping of a hyper teenage girl. The way it's implemented was so annoying, grating, and horrid that I couldn't even keep playing.  If you can ignore that, gameplay is pretty excellent.
3958	0	a	I really enjoy platforming games but I'm afraid that I can't recommend this one.  The game has a nice comedic art style, sound effects and music, but that can lose its charm when you have to redo an area 20 times in a row. The game can be more frustrating than fun in areas where you have to do millisecond perfect timing or you die and have to redo a lot.  If you die enough times without progressing than the game does allow you to skip forward to the next checkpoint, so I've been having more fun with the game ever since deciding to use that function whenever I get too annoyed.  The only reason I've played this game for so many hours is because I try not to uninstall games until after I've finished their singleplayer. Ultimately, I regret a lot of the time I spent on this game.  If you're into speed running than this game has some nice features and difficulty for you, but for people that just want a fun platformer, definitely don't get this game.
3959	0	a	This felt like a really annoying sequel to Splosion Man (which I've played on the 360). Frankly, I found the 'feminization' of the player character (the titular 'Ms. Splosion Man') to be absurdly sexist in the most casual manner possible -- making cheap jokes (which are really just visual gags, as it's a wordless game, so maybe I should cut them some slack). I just found the whole 'slap pink on it and toss in some horrific stereotypes about teenage girls etc' to be really grating.  I got it for something like $2.50, so it wasn't like I got horribly ripped off. The original is just... less obnoxious? Meh. Perhaps I'm just becoming old and jaded. I just found it really irksome.  If you really have a platformer itch that needs scratching, get Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams. That game is easily amongst the best platformers I have ever played. I play with a controller, so I'm not sure how convenient the keyboard setup is.  TL;DR -- competent, but the original didn't grate at my nerves with (likely unintentional) casual sexism and annoying cutscenes. Get Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams if you want a light-ish platformer that's fun to pick up and play whenever.
3960	0	a	Not as enjoyable as the first for a few reasons. 1) The bosses were disappointing and boring. 2) There were several maps that had trails of dead-end explosions that were simply trial and error to discover the right path which is never fun in a platformer. 3) Many of the levels simply dragged on for far too long with little to show for novelty or uniqueness. 4) There were multiple points in each level that simply felt like placeholders to make each area longer.  Points in its favor were most notably the soundtracks to the second world and when using Mandy as well as the use of cars. Overall, the game was pretty lackluster but worth a few dollars.
3961	0	a	The first thing you'll notice upon playing this game is that a lot of budget was spent on thousands of inane voice acted lines. The main character speaks them constantly, and the novelty wears off quickly.  The second thing you'll notice is that the levels and gameplay aren't really anything remarkable. Pity, that.
3962	0	a	Couldn't get-on with the humour or style - it's just trying to scrape your ears out of your head...  Controls - whilst mostly OK - do occasionally have a bit of a holiday - usually on long complex series of jumps which you have to repeat when they crap out.  In a world filled with platformers - ones which aren't 100% tight-as-a-drum in the control dept and which scream at you constantly are hard to recommend
3963	0	a	Not recommended at all. The controlls feel floaty and imprecise and contribute as much to you dying as screwing up. All momentum is brought to abrupt halts due to inconsistent level design that encourages trial and error and memorization over getting better. The sound design is absolutely dreadful, and I'd recommend anyone who plays this to just mute the entire game and play music you actually like because the 'voices' will drive you insane.  this game is great if you want to hear 'all the single ladies!' or 'I must increase my bust!' every twenty seconds, as you replay the same section of a level over because your slippery avatar can't land on a platform properly in a platformer.
3964	0	a	Hmm. It's got a style. The gameplay is hard, but not unfair. I just can't help but wonder, if I was female, would I be offended by this?
3965	0	a	♥♥♥♥
3966	0	a	This was a great game on the XBox. On the PC, it doesn't run and has never been patched. I'll update this if it ever gets fixed, but don't buy this game anytime soon.
3967	0	a	I like the idea, but the game is quite repetitive with frustrating puzzles and it wants to force you to keep on running and try to beat the levels quickly. Not quite my thing.
3968	0	a	I have to say, this is a difficult review. The game was fun and the mechanic delightful... but the character model and random noises of Ms. Splosion Man herself are so incredibly obnoxious that I had to stop. Solid controls, absolutely unbearable character design.
3969	0	a	This game is one of the hardest, if not THE HARDEST game i have ever played. It starts out fine, until you get to world 1-5. On the xbox port i couldn't even beat world 2, so you get an idea of the frustration that this game will give you. Have fun! In all seriousness the rest of the game is great but the difficulty is where the ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan.
3970	0	a	At first, it was a cute game. I had a little difficulty with a level, so I used the in-game cheat, which came with the warning of a 'curse'. I didn't think anything of it. I jumped to the next checkpoint, per the in-game cheat, and lo and behold, the 'curse' is extra weight on the thighs. I immediately shut down the game - I will not play something that includes such a fat-shaming ♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing, and I'm a little ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that I actually paid for this game.
3971	0	a	Very possibly the most annoying game I've ever played, and the gameplay, at the beginning at least, doesn't do near enough for me to justify putting up with all the cliched and lolsorandom garbage that oozes out of every seeping crevice of this monstrosity. Played three levels and uninstalled.
3972	0	a	Hmmmm, Games for Windows Live, I thought that parasitic bit of junk was dead and lifeless but NO you have to use it to play this game....aaaaarrrgghh! What were they thinking?!  The game's okay, it really would be better if I'd used a 360 controller but via a keyboard it did work albeit less than ideal. However, the GfWL addition is enough to make me feel as if I'll never return to it and sooner or later will 'delete local content'.  Shame.

3976	0	a	horrid games for windows live and the programmers themselves who 2 years later still havent figured out how to fix the near constant (every 10 mins) freezing on menus or during cutscenes, forum is full of this stuff.  fun game though, just ♥♥♥♥ everywhere
3977	0	a	A crappy difficult platformer jumping game developed by two people. Game can be explained by one word: 'difficult'.  At the begining of the game (intro), the developer actually tries to head on against the Unreal engine. Well, you have miserably failed.  This game 'IS' developed for female players in mind. This game is so difficult, all the female players will rage quit this game and won't touch your 'xbox' or PC again. The 'xbox' is in double quotation marks because this game was initially released for the xbox.  The game is totally trial and error based, so you are going to die and learn what lies ahead, then respawn from a check point, to repeat what you just did 20 seconds ago in a loop until you could get to the end point of a level.  The worst of all is that the QTE has no indication, you will just have to figure it by yourself. Although I said QTE, it is either barrels or switches that require precisely timed button press.  If I were you, I won't look at this crappy game. Go play something else. Save your time, save your mentality.
3978	0	a	Tl:dr at the end.  Ok, you probably went here to the Negetive side to see down sides of the game however most of the negetive reviewes are either:  A go back to the positve side or,  B gets boring fast.  So here is an actual review that will show the downsides of the game but, know that i did really enjoy the game, its one of my favorite games but here is just the downside.  Bad instructions for beginners. Its pretty hard to get into when your new. Having a friend showing you the basics helps. But you will spend alot of time looking at wikis to figure out what to do. Some people may like it since you get to explore. However you will probably miss huge chunks of the games content.  It also has alot of useful items only obtainable threw RNG. *cough* cellphone *cough*  One slighly more minor thing is that somtimes. Your world or characters may get corrupted. This usually never happens but if it does there is no way to recover them. However this rarely happens. I have only gotten a character lost once without mods.  One thing if you do get the game. DONT GET ITEMS FROM OTHER PEOPLE. It does severly ruins the game. If you play multiplayer, make sure you either play with another new player. Or somone who is willing to start over. This game is about the journey not the destination.  People who do say this game gets boring fast have gotten items from other people.  TL:DR  I LOVE THIS GAME. HOWEVER HERE ARE JUST FLAWS AND I PUT IT IN NEGETIVE TO SHOW DOWNSIDES. ODDS ARE YOU WILL LOVE THIS STILL.  1. RNG 2. BAD INSTRUCTIONS 3. SOMTIMES CORRUPTS WORLDS AND CHARACTERS
3979	0	a	You're probably here to look for the counter-arguments against Terraria, but is frustrated to find only dumb or fake reviews telling you 'just buy it/what are you doing viewing negative for terrria lmao lol kk'. Well, I'm here to tell the truth, and while there aren't many cons to terraria, the three main things you need to take into consideration:   - Dies out kinda fast when playing alone. A lot of the replayability comes from the fun of playing with another person, trying community maps, etc. May not apply to everyone, but applies to me and my friends so I would take that into consideration if you intend to only play Singleplayer.  - Poor compatibility with new OS versions, frequent break reports every time a new OS version is released.  - Requires guiding from the internet or another player because just like Minecraft or Garry's Mod, it has no intent in helping you whatsoever. May not be a negative if you like that kind of stuff, but it does require commitment and some people don't like it so it's good to take that into consideration.  Just taking this out of my stomach. This is not a negative review per se, I still think Terraria is an amazing game despite these three flaws (look at my playtime!), but this ♥♥♥♥ is seriously ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off.
3980	0	a	I found it needlessly time-consuming. It's just not high-paced enough for me. This game just offers too little for its time. Sandbox is good, but that doesn't mean it should be completely purposeless. And it's WAY TOO slow paced. If you enjoy it, great. I'm just voicing my opinion that it's not for me.
3981	0	a	Attention! The passage below is written by a  Chinglish man with poor grammar . I am so sorry about providing a direcommendation because I just want offcial team observe it.Terraria is a excellent game that attracts many Chinese game players include me.I have already recommended it to many friends but it failed because Terraria doesn't have  CHINESE LOCALIZATION .So I request Terraria can provide Chinese localization.That's the same wish of our huge number of Chinese players.If Terraria supports Chinese local work,I think this game will have a sales volume increase.Local private Chinese localization can't deal with such frequent edition updating.  Even about that more and more Chinese perfer to choose piracy so that private Chinese localization won't be diavailable when updating.   I suppose it's my right to require a Chinese edition and Terraria also can benefit from offical Chinese localization. I hope more people can support my requestion. Another problem I want to state is new player will be confused about the begining of the game:What should I do?Where should I go?The help of guide is lack for new gamer.It will cause some players have no interest quickly if they don't have patience to explore more about the game.How to attract new players is important.  It is still a excellent game that I nominate Terraria for 'Stand the Test of Time'award.
3982	0	a	I wanted to play with my friends but if I have a game host then there is found server please help me!
3983	0	a	The game deleted my main world and my character that I spent 70 hours on had a red name and could not play on him because it was apparently 'corrupted' I'm not playing this again until this is fixed

3989	0	a	This is a thumbs down for all the people who HAVE NOT got this game                                                                Get it
3990	0	a	Game can be fun at times when bored. But due to the fact my friend lost all his hard earned gear and grinded hours I don't think i'll be joining back into this game as updates can make you loose hard earned Characters. 
3991	0	a	Terraria is a nice game ,but for whatever reason i couldnt bring myself to like it
3992	0	a	People keep comparing this game to Minecraft. I don't get why.  They are totally different games, and that is mostly because you would play them for different reasons. Minecraft is a sandbox. This is not.   So let me say this game is really good.  Sometimes...  So lets look this over, shall we?  PROS: -Bosses mostly cool, but the mechanical bosses are just annoying reskins with more health. Skeletron is a big magic skeleton with a skull and two arms which get killed individually. Skeletron Prime is a metal skeleton with a butt-ton of health, a skull and 4 arms, one with a ranged attack. -Big waves of enemy battles at certain random events that are very fun. A ton of different enemies going on a seige to your base while you smash all of them with cool weapons. The events weild good rewards and can be summoned too. -Different reigons and randomly generated loot, makes exploring worth it. -Multiple stratagies and playstyles.  CONS: -Some bosses are just reskins with more hp. -Getting ore starts feeling grindy after you find all generated structures. -Exploring loses purpose after you reach hardmode, as most items you can find become obsolete. -Relies too heavily on finding randomly generated items, events, bosses, and structures. RNG hell. -Pre-Mechanical bosses, Post-Hardmode, is extremely grindy, finding huge ammounts of ores, grinding for boss spawners, building big platforms for boss-fights(Yes, you have to build boss-battle arenas yourself.) -Game is super easy, if you know how to cheese every boss (Which is often through random experimenting.) -Game doesn't tell you what to do, so unless you read every page on the wiki, figuring out what to do is hell. -Expert mode gives new content! But doing it in singleplayer is hyper-grindy and every boss is insane. -Relies too heavily on finding randomly generated items, events, bosses, and structures. (I had to say it again.)     So now, a story about me playing the game.  I played through expert mode until wall of flesh, where I had to build a giant bridge across the whole map, find someone else to play with me, or give up expert mode. So I gave up expert mode, beat the wall of flesh in normal mode, and then got bored because I now have to grind for a rare ore. I came back a while later, and got stuck on the mechanical bosses because I had to grind for more gear.  Gave up for a couple months, but a friend tells me to try again.  I come back, beat the mechanical bosses, and things start going my way. Need a enemy drop for a crafting ingredient.  Grind the enemy for days, kill over 200 of the same enemy.  Never find the ingredient I need.  Come back next morning.  My save data is corrupted and I have to start almost all over.  ---  It's good at some of what it does, and it's fun when the game gets it right.  But when the game fails, this game is a fetid repulsive infected corrosive pile of dog crap.  UPDATE: I gave this game another chance. And it corrupted my save data A SECOND TIME. I am done with this game.

3999	0	a	I think the game could be amazing. Sadly, it seems i have terrible luck, because on my world (which is on normal difficulty), the game would glitch out during boss battles and crash. That would leave me in the middle of nowhere, fighting a boss with nothing on my character as my items were destroyed. 
4000	0	a	Very boring after awhile and my game got corrupted so I had to restart and that was very annoying 2/5

4013	0	a	ok so something happened and now i cant play terraria. I had 121 hours on it, and was *this* close to beating the moon lord to pieces. Now, all it shows is a white screen and i cant see. it plays title theme music, and i can hear myself switching options on the screen, BUT I CANT SEE A DARN THING! someone please help me! i love terraria so much, and if i cant play it, oooh... i wont be happy. for now, I DONT RECCOMEND THIS! IT DOESNT WORK UNTIL SOMEONE HELPS! then i will recommend it.
4014	0	a	2 bugs. one is the unexpected errors and the other one is the laggy game while it has never done that before. i would like for the one who made terraria to please fix it. i kept on trying everything to help to make it better but nothing worked. i would appreciate it.
4015	0	a	could not play the coop online, is not as easy as starbound to join the game... didnt like that...
4016	0	a	A lot of people like it. I'm not one of those. I enjoy Minecraft more. To me, it's like a 2D minecraft, and I just can't get into it.  You may like it, and there is nothing wrong with that. I just couldn't get into it.

And not being able to speed up time through the night? LAME Even though I didn't care for it, Steamworld Dig is better if you want to go mining.

4028	0	a	how do i get refund my son had downloaded this game with out permision
4029	0	a	From the first time I played this game, I did not like it. I tried to give it a chance, and kept it a little longer hoping maybe it would grow on me, and it has not. And now that very thing, trying to give the game a chance, according to Steam means I am not allowed to get a refund. So now, I have a worthless game sitting in my Library, reminding me how much of a waste of money it was.   I do not recommend this game, and based on Steam's reaction to a loyal gamer requesting money back for a game they will never again touch beyond the 1 hour they have already, in order to buy a game in the future they WILL use: I do not recommend it unless you ARE ABSOLUTELY POSITIVE you are going to be in love with it.
4030	0	a	every time i try to load it is crashes and says my frame work is not working

4043	0	a	This Game used to be amazing with my friend but since 1.3.4 multiplayer has became WAY too laggy. DO NOT GET UNLESS YOU HAVE INTERNET THAT IS AMAZING AND ALIENWARE OR BETTER PC. though it still fun on singleplayer. 6/10
4044	0	a	Why are you looking at this? There isn't anything bad about this game.. GO BUY IT.
4045	0	a	Unfortunately this is one of those promising-looking games I just never got into. The long and the short of it is that I got bored - maybe it's that I was playing alone, maybe it's that I'm too used to narrative-based games, maybe it's that when I was playing this I lacked the imagination or engagement to 'make my own fun'. Don't get me wrong - I've enjoyed many an hour with Minecraft - but something about this never clicked with me. Progression felt damnably slow (admittedly, I did not spend long with the game) and I found myself constantly referencing wikis when it would have been much nicer to just lose myself in the pixelly world.  Ten hours disappeared pretty quickly, but I ultimately decided this wasn't the game for me.  PS: Y'all going into the 'not recommended' section just to downvote reviews need a better hobby.
4046	0	a	The game's got potential... If you waste 10 hours a day, Getting items, Ofcourse.  But... Well... I don't like it much, I don't recomend it to people with low patience.  God, I feel like this won't help anyone.

4067	0	a	Good game but gets boaring very quickly.Sorry to all you terraria lovers but it's just so boaring.I mean like once you beat moonloard (Wich takes like 1 month) it gets boaring and you just wait till and update.Overall good game but gets boaring.
4068	0	a	Looked interesting and I liked the premise. That was before I played it long enough to realize that it's like having your teeth drilled, except the dentist keeps bringing out bigger drills. Then when it's time to leave instead of a toothbrush, he pulls human hair and a lighter out of his pocket , sets it aflame in his hand, and then rubs his smelly burnt hair finger across you upper lip, moving in closer, and whispering in your ear 'game is bad.'
4069	0	a	i wanted to kms
4070	0	a	  Although it does bring back the retro style in gaming and with sprites and older graphics this game is personally not one of my favorite games, now I must say this, I did not feel engaged in the game. This game will eat you up and ♥♥♥♥ you out as if you were just a prune. I did enjoy Halloween where you could get goodie bags and open up these bags to get really cool items but the bosses and a lot of gameplay aspects were just criptic. Last and least making houses for NPCs is a pain in your shiney metal ♥♥♥. I do have to admit there were some great gameplay aspects and it was actually a really good idea as it also used sprites and had a great Soundtrack. I hanve to give this game a 4/10.
4071	0	a	please launch game from steam client
4072	0	a	this game will not workkkk i spent 9 dollars for this thing that does not even work. 
4073	0	a	This game destroyed my ♥♥♥♥ing house completely because the biome changed and my whole house looked like it was covered in ♥♥♥♥ing period blood.   I like this game, but when it ♥♥♥♥s with my effort, this game is a ♥♥♥♥ing nightmare.

Usually it'll crash during loading saying there is a lack of memory, and if it does complete loading, it will sometimes just stop processing graphics for a second and generate them all at once. But it did work perfectly well for Windows 7. If I can play Overwatch without issue, this game should be easily handled.
4086	0	a	i got this not to long ago about 1 year ago but yesterday i had some lag and restarted then i didnt play it again for the day wake up today and find out MY PLAYER IS GONE!!! my worlds are there just not my player i love this game and my friend is geting it but i got full hearts and mana i cant do enything to get it back help pleae ;-;
4087	0	a	The most frustrating part of Terraria is 2 things: 1. the lack of explanation and guidelines, i shouldnt have to look up a guide to start the game! 2: the insane difficulty in the first hours of playing. why do i always get killed by an eyeball when the game doesnt even tell me how to make a wall! why was that so hard for me to accomplish! but thats not why im writing this review, im writing this review becasue of the 2 save corruptions this game gave me, first my chris character, and then my world. Stea wont even refund me for the terrible time i have had. this game isnt bad by all means its just the one of the hardest games to get into, it becomes that game that you just leave on to leave it on, im mixed about this personally since i didnt find it enjoyable but dont let me terrible review stop you, this is just my biased opinion, since i cant enjoy the game anymore. it wont even let me make a person to start the game anymore, this is why im downrating it. To hard to get into and i cant even enjoy it anymore. Please fix the save state problem
4088	0	a	I love this game,however it has deleted 3 of my characters and 4 worlds making it very frustrating to play
4089	0	a	Just bought this game the other day. Binge played it and it was awesome. Woke up this morning to my character and world completely deleted. Searched solutions online and nothing worked. Absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.
4090	0	a	nothing likes windows 10
4091	0	a	Well, it was a good game until I lose a world and character approaching endgame events. Also, it sucks that there's no fix to corrupted characters and worlds when so many people have this problem. Anyway, I'm done with this until this is fixed. 1/10
4092	0	a	my cheracters are getting deleted out of nowhere. and now they wont give me a refund.
4093	0	a	Trust me this game is fun, but if you exit the game while it is autosaving(you dont know when) or if you close it via task manager then your world will be corrupted and you cant load it anymore. I was well into Hardmode when this happened, i killed the Destroyer of Worlds and got the clementinator. Now all of that is gone.

4102	0	a	  This game is boring af. Don't get it
4103	0	a	I have four hours in this game? I never remember caring enough to figure out the multiplayer, so that's probably all in the main menu.
4104	0	a	it sucks
4105	0	a	its boring, its just minecraft in 2d but if you are a fan of survival and building then this might be interestingi for you but its just weird and boring
4106	0	a	Having played Minecraft, this just felt underwhelming.
4107	0	a	One time me and my friend played a normal survival game of this, we became better and better, suddenly we killed a boss, and then the biome changed ALOT. It was so bad, and our house got completely destroyed. And our effort to our house and materials was like 2 weeks. NOT RECOMMENDED!

4116	0	a	Easy game, Expert mode is not a threat.    On the other side, it has a collecting value and its satisfying to get everything.  TmodLoader Is also good.
4117	0	a	My collecters edition wont spawn the bunny pet help plez 
4118	0	a	I WISH I LIKE IT, BUT I JUST CANT
4119	0	a	This game is just horrible. this is my 2nd time buying it (first time was on ps3) and i dont know what i was thinking. this game has akward clunky controls, super annoying enemy respawn rates, horrible music and sfx (guy sounds like a baby coughing when he gets damaged??) and tiny little items that are almost impossible to make out what they are unless you hover over top of them with the cursor. i have no idea why this game has such a huge following and it drives me nuts that i spent money on it twice. I kept hopeing it was better than i rerembered it being, but sadly it was even worse. I seriously have no idea why people like this game so much there is litterally nothing fun about it.
4120	0	a	I really wish I could give this game a thumbs up, I really do. It was fun, addicting and interesting, however due to some issues that I could not resolve I lost all my data, characters and even the world I worked so hard on. As all the time put into this was for granted.
4121	0	a	I have played Terraria for 42 hours and I still don't really enjoy the game. The game is alright but there are so many items and things in the game that it makes everything extreamly complicated. When you first start a world the game is all about survival but once you get further the game is all about combat. You can build amazing things in the game but that is very hard to do. When ever I do a single player world I never get to far before I get bored.   So basically only get this game if you like lots of combat because thats the best part of this game.
4122	0	a	This game is rubbish. Just go play Starbound: the physically superior game. I know im entitled to my own opinion but my opinion is right. c:
4123	0	a	too much fun
4124	0	a	If you like 2d games, this game is perfect for you, personaly i would not reccomend it, but if im going to look at the graphics and things u can do in this game, its awesome and worth ur time.
4125	0	a	sure there is much to do in this game, and you would enjoy it with friends but it would take so much effort to get a nice weapon or equipment, there is many rare items for no reason other than make the experience longer, i would prefer if there was creative mode or couple of dedicated servers but there isn't, to sum it up it is like any survival/randomly generated world game and it gets boring fast

4141	0	a	I find this boring....  It reminds me of minecraft but more limited. NO Creative... NO ability to make maps. It pains me. it really does.  2D minecraft.
4142	0	a	Overall, Terreria is decent. It's not hugely amazing but the world is large and there is plenty to do. The thing I don't like is the combat. I know that it's hard to get good combat in a survival adventure but the combat in this game sucks. Not because it's challenging (which it can be) but because it's bland. Also, it's way too hard for early players. 4/10.
4143	0	a	If you have ADHD
4144	0	a	this game is horrible.  every time i play this game  i get so far but for SOME RESONE IT KEAPS DELEITING MY F$%#ING FILE
4145	0	a	Terraria is a side-scrolling crafting and adventure game. Bases can be built, locations explored, items crafted. Unfortunately there is no clear incentive to play this clunky mess of a game. The crafting UI is terrible, the help system completely useless, and the community are rabid in their defense of their darling game.  Avoid this and play something that is fun instead.
4146	0	a	Played 20 hours of the game in 3 days, only for all my files to get deleted, and when I put my file back in my game from the recycle bin, the files got compressed and unusable, if you like depression I rate this game a funking 10
4147	0	a	I Couldn't play this game for a year because it was extremely ♥♥♥♥ing broken to the point of which it became unplayable. When I did play, my first guy's file became corrupt losing a ♥♥♥♥ ton of work and OP items. My second guy got deleted after trying to delete my world but it instead deleted my character and my world that I had 'deleted' was still there. This game is extremely broken, poorly made, Laggy, and unfun in every way possible.
4148	0	a	forgot to rate... positive, POSITIVE :OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!! TERRARIA FOREVS after some little 100 hours. But less better than starbound

4153	0	a	deleted all my characters when I tried to play. ♥♥♥♥
4154	0	a	I've spent 62 hours on this game, gathering materials and fighting bosses. I've defeated the Moon Lord many times and filled a lot of chests with very useful items. Recently when I started up my game, the world did not load in correctly. I can't open my map and it's just a blank screen. All my chests are ruined and my other worlds load up just fine. I can't believe I wasted my money on a game where it bugs out all the time like this.
4155	0	a	i think at one point i liked it
4156	0	a	Stop scrolling through the negative reviews and go back to the positive one!
4157	0	a	I had a lot of friends really pushing me to play this game and some great experiences, but overall it was honestly pretty boring. There might be some fun things to do on servers, but if you play with other people you either will want to start from the game's boring beginning stage or limit their items. Otherwise, they'll just bring in completely overpowered items and ruin the game. There are just too many ways to exploit the games and make the bosses more challenging than they should be. I still love the way the boss fights are designs (especially the queen bee) and there is just so much creativity in the items. I had the most fun when I was fighting them with minimal preparation, hopping into swarms of enemies unprepared, organizing my chests, and making a secret base. Some servers also have cool minigames. I'd recommend the game if you want to build and just goof off with friends, but not if you want to play alone.
4158	0	a	  I was already a fan of the creator's (Redigit) previous work which was a fangame called 'Super Mario Bros. X' Years ago (2011), I learned that Regedit released another game known today as Terraria. I was hyped and bought this game on the official website. It was everything I thought and more and I was deeply in love with it. I stopped playing for a few years just so I can see it evolve more and more. In 2016, I got this game as an early birthday present and started playing again. Hyped for what this game has become, I played a few hours of single player. The game felt different, and in a bad way. Everything that made it simple and fun now is grindy and complicated. In this 'new' Terraria you basically grind to get better 'toys' Everything seems too complicated and you need a guide for everything. The game isn't beginner friendly and you can become overwhelmed by the amount of things that you should be doing. The game punishes you for being ignorant, and only the wise ones can actually enjoy the game.   I really (really) tried to like this new Terraria, but it never satisfied me like the old version. Rating: 6/10
4159	0	a	dude my terraria broke just as i bought it says error over and over and over i keep trying to reboot computer it still says error

4163	0	a	Get very boring very fast do not suggest
4164	0	a	This game is horrible. Absolutely disgusting. I wasted hours of my life trying to make my character's skin color the same as the elf helmet's ears, and it can't be done. Horrible, disgraceful, and not worth existing.
4165	0	a	Bought multiple copies but the multiplayer is a bit laggy even over the network. I enjoy the single-player game but, honestly, the console version is the way to go for no-lag multiplayer with the kiddos
4166	0	a	Meh... gets repetitive. I've played through it twice and now get no satisfaction in playing it.
4167	0	a	i downloading this game and its stucks at 100 procents
4168	0	a	Complete waste of time and effort. I paid less than five dollars for this game and I still feel ripped off
4169	0	a	its like fallout with guns
4170	0	a	I love this game!! it has unlimted hours of adventure and the items and boss battle are amazing but i spent over 20 hours on a world and all of sudden ... it just dissapears. This is why i am now going to stop playing because all of my hard work has just gone because of the stupid save system that messes up and loses your characters or worlds. Its dissapointing because it such a good game and i wil miss playing it but after losing my world i dont want to be dissapointed again when i lose another world.
4171	0	a	why play this piece of ♥♥♥♥ when you can read the entire bee movie script   According to all known laws of aviation,    there is no way a bee should be able to fly.    Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.    The bee, of course, flies anyway    because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.    Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.    Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little.    Barry! Breakfast is ready!    Ooming!    Hang on a second.    Hello?    - Barry? - Adam?    - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up.    Looking sharp.    Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those.    Sorry. I'm excited.    Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son.    A perfect report card, all B's.    Very proud.    Ma! I got a thing going here.    - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me!    - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye!    Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!    - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry.    - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation.    Never thought I'd make it.    Three days grade school, three days high school.    Those were awkward.    Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive.    You did come back different.    - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.    - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah.    - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going.    Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.    Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead.    I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.    I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.    That's why we don't need vacations.    Boy, quite a bit of pomp… under the circumstances.    - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are!    - Bee-men. - Amen!    Hallelujah!    Students, faculty, distinguished bees,    please welcome Dean Buzzwell.    Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of…    …9:15.    That concludes our ceremonies.    And begins your career at Honex Industries!    Will we pick ourjob today?    I heard it's just orientation.    Heads up! Here we go.    Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.    - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary.    Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco    and a part of the Hexagon Group.    This is it!    Wow.    Wow.    We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life    to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.    Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.    Our top-secret formula    is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured    into this soothing sweet syrup    with its distinctive golden glow you know as…    Honey!    - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin!    - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins.    - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive    to improve every aspect of bee existence.    These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.    - What do you think he makes? - Not enough.    Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.    - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey    that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions.    Oan anyone work on the Krelman?    Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know    that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.    But choose carefully    because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.    The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.    What's the difference?    You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off    in 27 million years.    So you'll just work us to death?    We'll sure try.    Wow! That blew my mind!    “What's the difference? How can you say that?    One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make.    I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.    But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?    Why would you question anything? We're bees.    We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.    You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?    Like what? Give me one example.    I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.    Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.    Wait a second. Oheck it out.    - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow.    I've never seen them this close.    They know what it's like outside the hive.    Yeah, but some don't come back.    - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks!    You guys did great!    You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!    - I wonder where they were. - I don't know.    Their day's not planned.    Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.    You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.    Right.    Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.    It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it.    Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.    Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too?    Distant. Distant.    Look at these two.    - Oouple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them.    It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.    Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom!    He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me!    - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out.    What were you doing during this?    Trying to alert the authorities.    I can autograph that.    A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?    Yeah. Gusty.    We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.    - Six miles, huh? - Barry!    A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.    - Maybe I am. - You are not!    We're going 0900 at J-Gate.    What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough?    I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.    Hey, Honex!    Dad, you surprised me.    You decide what you're interested in?    - Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one.    Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?    Son, let me tell you about stirring.    You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.    You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing.    You know, Dad, the more I think about it,    maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.    You were thinking of what, making balloon animals?    That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.    Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!    - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny.    You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!    - You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me!    Wait till you see the sticks I have.    I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!    Let's open some honey and celebrate!    Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae.    Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody “dawg!    I'm so proud.    - We're starting work today! - Today's the day.    Oome on! All the good jobs will be gone.    Yeah, right.    Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal…    - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two left!    One of them's yours! Oongratulations! Step to the side.    - What'd you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar!    Wow!    Oouple of newbies?    Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!    Make your choice.    - You want to go first? - No, you go.    Oh, my. What's available?    Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think.    - Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you're on.    I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.    Wax monkey's always open.    The Krelman opened up again.    What happened?    A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one.    Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.    Dead from the neck up.

4181	0	a	It's actually a good game, I recommend, BUT the only problem is that only gets good if:  - You go searching on a wiki how to do stuff  - Play a ♥♥♥♥ing lot  - Have someone to play with you*  - You don't cheat  *Someone that's starting with you  So, that's why I personally don't like this game. But I can't say it's bad and/or don't recommend for you. Maybe you like...  AND YES, 18 HOURS ISN'T ENOUGH TO MAKE THE GAME 'GOOD'  I rate it 7/10 because it has a lot of ♥♥♥♥ to do.

4183	0	a	EDIT: If you honestly just go to negative reviews to downvote everything, you need PROFESSIONAL help. I can recommend a few psychiatrists.  My review created a few confusions, so I'm just going to put this warning here: THESE HERE ARE NOT FACTS. THESE ARE MY OPINIONS ABOUT THE GAME, AND CHANGE OF PLAYSTYLE CAN REMOVE SOME THING I STATED IN HERE.  I wanted to love this game. I really did. I heard great things about it- A great game where possibilities are endless!  At least that's what I thought. Now, I am a Minecraft fan (and a Garry's Mod fan, if that matters) and I can see why I liked Minecraft and not this In the game, you only have two things to do: Survive or build. Done surviving? Go build. Done building? Restart. Getting sick of doing the same thing over and over again? Too bad, there is nothing else this game offers. Don't get me wrong, I can see why some people may like this game. But it gets repetitive INSANELY quick. Go craft that, go kill that, go craft that, go kill that, etc. (Also dont attack me saying 'THERE IZ DAT 2 DUU!!!1!', I get bored way too fast to even reach doing 'that'.)  Another giant problem is the complete lack of help. While this also applies for Minecraft, it doesn't have a giant content like Terraria does, therefore in your entire playtime you will only need to check the crafting recipes and how to get to other dimensions. However, in terraria, you need to look up EVERYTHING as the game literally refuses to help you. In my 19 hour playtime, I had to look at the wiki at least 20 times just to figure out what my next move would be, and if I didn't look up on a wiki I did not move forward at all.  Another thing is that I am not a guy who can play a multiplayer game singleplayer. What I mean by that, If a game has multiplayer option, I will not have fun playing the Singleplayer knowing that I have an option to play with others. In Minecraft there are servers with THOUSANDS of players, and it's quite easy to find a friend or two that you can play together. However in Terraria, the most I've seen on a server is 20 players, and since the world is HUGE you barely even see any players at all. I could play with a friend, but again the repetitive and the no-help thing ruins it.  TL;DR A great game, but it does not have any plans to help you at all, and you do the same stuff over and over again.  EDIT 2: Apparently, people think this review is a troll or just completely wrong, for some reason. so I'm just gonna clear things up more here. I didn't know expressing opinions were considered 'trolling'. If you can't respect other people's opinions, I suggest you get off of reviews since you can't handle anything that doesn't agree with what you say.  Also , have you noticed the fact that in every single things you listed, it either  A) Tells you to make your own achievements. Which I can't. Call me achievement addict, but if you don't give me a goal to progress towards, I wont have fun. Not to mention this game doesn't give you any information what-so-ever, so I can't even figure out how to do the said challenges in the first place. And: B) Tells you to play co-op. I said this in the original review, but I'll say it again. I tried to play co-op 1) on a multiplayer server, which didn't work out at all since the most crowded server has like 20 players they don't seem to care about surviving and would rather kill you over and over aain, and 2) I don't have any IRL friends that play Terraria, and if you check my friend's list you will see that all of them have hours upon hours of playtime in terraria, so I'm pretty sure they'd facepalm 100 times if they spend 10 minutes playing terraria with me, not to mention at this point they even very rarely play Terraria.  Also, one last thing: Have you noticed that in every single thing you listed, none of them actually change the way I play the game? The only thing that can solve the lack of help is playing co-op, and I told you why that can't happen.
4184	0	a	This game leaves you with nothing in the end, please consider getting a better more content filled game such as starbound
4185	0	a	I wish I could say Terraria is good, but it just gets so mundane and monotonous. you will spend hours of your time standing or running in one direction holding down left click with a loud, constant, and overpowering banging of a gun. Most of the difficulty can be rooted down to a DPS race.
4186	0	a	it's s h i t
4187	0	a	Is like comic book. If you started from the begining and continue, is good. Start now, have to play Kachup and takes long time. Is stupid, I dont like it.   Buy game now? nah. Buy game when it 1st came out? Dah.  Is Good, but not for new comer.
4188	0	a	i played terraria all night then i played on my laptop on the same steam account but none of my stuff was there and i went back to my computer and my character was deleted somehow
4189	0	a	Played for 42 minutes, 41 of which were spent on the wiki looking up crafting recipes, and find out how to perform very basic tasks, such as building things. Apparently there's no way in-game to see what materials you need for a craft unless you already HAVE the materials for the craft. Or maybe there IS some way in the game to find recipes... but only god and the developers know where it is, and neither seem too keen on helping new players find it.   I'm not asking to have my hand held, but there's a line between 'difficult' and 'poorly designed', and depending on how much free time you have, this game can go either way.   If you've got hours to spend reading wikis and figuring things out then go for it, judging by this game's score it's probably a very rewarding experience. If you're like me and have limited time, try Starbound instead. It's a lot more forgiving on new/casual players, and has a much easier learning curve.
4190	0	a	better on console, not that I prefer console on most things, but its just not as unnecessarily hard, plus, ocram.
4191	0	a	Great game...but for ME, personally, it got boring after a while. I don't even play it anymore. The thought of it alone makes me bored.  It's basically a side scrolling Minecraft, in a way. Though it is still very much its own thing. However....that's just it. SIDE SCROLL. There's only so much you can do and so far you can travel away from your house when there's only 2 directions to go. Other people seem to really like this game, though. So maybe you shouldn't take my word for it. If you got a patient and imaginative mind, and are the kind of gamer that's super addicted to Minecraft, then perhaps it's the game for you. If you got 10 bucks to kill, then I say go for it. However, my experience is it is boring after a little while. I wish I could have my money back....But hey, on the bright side, at least I HAVE it, and it's in my library in case my friends ever want to play it, lol.
4192	0	a	This one's not for me. I dislike that there's no real instructions or goal. The world is huge and if there was any kind of structure to it I would probably love it. I played a bit with a friend who loves this game but it just doesn't really appeal to me.
4193	0	a	I spend ten hours of gameplay grinding ores and such at the start, and what do I get?  More stuff to grind after deafeating the wall of flesh!  Not to mention that after you destroy the wall of flesh, there is nothing else to do but look at a couple of new enemies and defeat boss after boss after grinding for a few hours to defeat it.  Occasionally, you'll get an event or two, but even those can be triggered by the player somehow, making it a sort of 'boss'   Other than that, it's really just a grind to kill this or that to get a new item simulator.  P.S. If you do plan on playing mutiplayer, make sure its with a freind and not some random guy because he will either: A: greif your world or B: Give you the most high tier ♥♥♥♥ and basically win the game for you.
4194	0	a	This game is really bad, the game wears off and waters down quick. Cheaters are everywhere, and you cant find a server with people playing legit. This game is seriously not worth the money, go buy gmod instead.
4195	0	a	I got this game hoping it would be awesome but everytime i try to play it freezes and then it wont let me exit the game i would not recommend downiloading this game.
4196	0	a	I bought this game when I was 11 and now I am no longer interested in it anymore. I last played because my younger brother had forced me to give him things that I had used cheats to recieved. Basicaly, do not play games with your obnoxious narcasistic siblings.
4197	0	a	Good game but everytime i have a far character it gets corrupt
4198	0	a	Don't even bother trying to make a new character and working really hard on it. I had 200+ hours on a good character and world and it corrupted. I don't recommend this game because you might waste your time just like I did. Great job Terraria.
4199	0	a	So when I bought this game it was so much fun. As I thought it would be like minecraft but no i realised its no where close to Minecraft this is how this game works. 1) Brake Blocks 2) Create tools 3) Build house 4) Mine 5) End up dying  6) Kill bosses 7) NOTHING ELSE TO DO I still loved doing the whole process for 1 to 6.
4200	0	a	start is very boring I keep getting told it gets good but I don't plan on playing through boring bs just for the potential to have fun when I can just go play another game.
4201	0	a	It's meh
4202	0	a	Downloaded Terraria  Played with friend for 1 week  Finished all content  Uninstalled  Forgot about.  dont buy this, its meh at best.
4203	0	a	It's boring, but it has cool stuff.
4204	0	a	I HATE THIS GAME!
4205	0	a	I want to make this a constructive review rather than just an angry rant on how it frustrates me. So here it goes.  I have poured many hours of my time into this game, and I have thoroughly enjoyed every bit of it, the tier levels, the styles, the bosses, I loved it. I had only just defeated the second to last boss before i had encountered the problems which now make me resent this game.   Me and my friend who had many many items, were suddenly (what seemed to feel like) spammed with three events in succession. With no breaks. And they werent just the simple, easy events. These were the topmost, hardest enemies that i had ever encountered.   I admit that i have had this problem before with events seeming to appear too often, but i simply overlooked them and tried to enjoy what was happening. But the straw that broke the camels back was when both me and my friends connection could not be established or maintained, due to the shear amount of action going on with both our game sessions. Both our games inevitably ended up crashing, and everything that was left on the floor was despawned. After coming back on immediately afterwards, we go to see most of our top tier gear had disappeared. This was the point of no return, my friend uninstalled his game, and I am left with a bitter hatred for the games unfair mechanics and need to punish the player at any given turn.  I don't wish to see comments complaining that my computer simply isnt powerful enough to run the game, but it has been fine up until this point. I am sure that this is not happening in isolation. I want this to be constructive in the hopes that this issue can be rectified.... because i really like this game, but i cannot tolerate how unfair it treats its players.
4206	0	a	A lot of content, too much content some might say, A lot of artistic quality, Cheap to buy, 90% of the Community cheats. 10% of the community plays legitimately.  The game is good, if you are that 10%. But for 90% of you, it's going to suck.
4207	0	a	This game is a very fun game for anyone who is starting terraria. When I first got the original version (PC version) of terraria I didn't know what to do, even after I had played the IOS version. Here is a basic guide for any newcomers.  1 gather some wood. 2 look around. There is certainly going to be some small caverns with chests in it. ( At the start of the game, all resources matter) 3 make a workbench 4 make some walls and build a shelter. 5 gather some stone and kill some slimes to make a furnace. ( the slime is to make torches) 6 gather some ore.   This game is so much fun when you first purchase it.  However it has been years and I have completed the game, defeated the last boss (and his event) and aquired every last drop from it. This game has one thing similar to Minecraft. They both get boring after a while. But terraria stays fun for longer than minecraft. However every now and then, I come back to this game and I enjoy it for a while. I like the gameplay and the graphics. Overall it is a very good game.
4208	0	a	this game sucks
4209	0	a	I play on Windows 10 and the game doesn't play. I click play and the game loads and I can highlight over the buttons on the menu but when I click on them nothing happens. This game sucks... Just a waste of my time and money

4217	0	a	Its a great game, I have lots of time in it and loads of achievements and it's lots of fun with friends. I logged on to steam today and went onto terraria and it had eaten up all my saves! Really terraria? REALLY?
4218	0	a	The game was all fine and dandy until the 1.3.3 update rolled out. ♥♥♥♥ this game and ♥♥♥♥ the devs for breaking it cause the game keeps crashing on me 5 or so times per sessions and every time, I'd lose a ton of resources cause this piece of ♥♥♥♥ game doesn't ♥♥♥♥ing save often enough. Don't waste your money on this garbage.
4219	0	a	*I edited the review to remove the snark.  I accept that this is a popular game, but I personally couldn't get into it. The 2d presentation and combat came across as overly simplistic. I found the constant bombardment of hostile monsters to be an annoyance, even though I didn't have any trouble killing them.  Lastly, there wasn't enough explanation as to what I was supposed to do. For example, you've built a 2d house with a tiles to the left, right, and above you. If nothing is walking behind you and you can't move off that single 2d plane, then how would you intuitively know that the house requires a background wall? Especially since monsters can still spawn if the background wall is 'natural' as opposed to placed there by you?  The guide is a joke. His tips are useless and he actually got me killed by opening my door and leaving it open at night, hiding behind me while the monsters that followed him into my house beat me to a pulp. Getting killed by the dude that was supposed to be helping me adjust to the world is what caused me to drop the game.  Just not for me.

4227	0	a	Terraria, in my opinion, is not a good game. It may be great for someone younger than me, but not for me. If you are someone that's around 7, I must first say, you're reading the reviews? I don't even do that half the time! and secondly, this game is perfect for you, but if you are 11 or above, I doubt you will like this game.
4228	0	a	since when was minecraft on steam?? Anyway to transfer my saved worlds over?
4229	0	a	Terraria, a 2d platformer game trying to be a 2d sandbox:   I have been contemplating back and forth reviewing this game let alone whether to give it a good review or not. Recently I came to a decision and as long as steam doesnt censor my review, I'll state why, through much debate, I cannot recommend this game until certain of the games grossly flawed mechanics actually get worked on and fixed. I feel that the pros of this game are quite obvious (i.e Loads of weapons,crafting items, building blocks to collect, Tons of mobs to encounter and bosses to defeat and high performance) I'll focus more on why I reluctantly cant recommend this game   My experience with this game started off quite well, although quite oddly. I'll leave some flawed mechanics out such as the 60 second health potion cooldown and no lock-on for gun weapons, and instead focus on the two most atrocious ones.   The first is the fact that this game has no mob system or spawn conditions for the mobs you encounter which you only see in 2d platfromers. This means you can get overwhelmed by atleast 15-20 mobs! This is only made worse if your character is new. Unfortunately this means if you have an idea to build a super awesome castle base you constantly get interupted by pesky mobs that attack you. Building is a stable of any great sandbox, constantly fighting mobs is a stable of platformers so what is the Dev team trying to market Terraria as???? The evening hours are when more scary mobs come out to play and since for some reason who cant sleep/ skip through the night you'll end up stopping what your building/ working on and just fight mobs the whole night. Adding to distracting mobs, this game is sprinkled with COMPLETELY RANDOM invasion events such as the Blood Moon, Goblin Invasion, Pirate Invasion and Alien Invasion forcibly stopping whatever you happen to be working on and if you dont have a invasion arena setup.......well good luck getting through it without losing massive amounts on money. The Goblin and Pirate Invasion's get a free pass for me for the first encounter since The Pirate and Goblin NPC'S will move into your town. However encounters after the first one shouldnt be completely random. The lack of a mob system also plays into my next problem. Hardmode spread.  Once Hardmode has been activated a new corruption/crimson patch will spawn in your world ans spread ridiculously fast and so will your one and only Hallow biome. So if you havent defeated a mechanical boss or, god forbid, simply lack the skill to kill one or lack the powerful weapons that you ONLY GET IN EXPERT MODE you cant buy the Clemtaminator from the Steampunker. Im not even going to mention the fact that the Clemtaminator is an awful and almost useless tool. Unfortunately my first world was COMPLETELY OVERRUN by Corruption and Hallow. Even starting a new world and following EVERY WORD of the turtorials on containing the spread the Hallow was still able to spread past a 4 GAP HELLIVATOR WITH A WALL OF GRAY BRICK RUNNING ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE UNDERWORLD and this unfortunately has overtaken my underground jungle which every world needs. I should ask what to do on the forums what I might have done wrong but if I did everything right and the Hardmode spread is just broken then it needs to be fixed.   This game has so much potential to be even better than it is and I desperately wanted to give this game a thumbs up which I probably will once this game gets a DECENT update, not colored restone wire, not birthday parties and not dust/snowstorms. Right now I simply cant give this game a thumbs up.

4233	0	a	The single most boring game I've ever ♥♥♥♥ing played during my existence on planet earth. I spawned in and started making a house, my friend destroyed it. We walked out into the boring desert, died but got some cacti. We went the other way in search for a cave, died 4 times. Got trapped in a hole and killed 50+ soul eaters or whatever they're ♥♥♥♥ing called. After that, I walked outside and 78 mil more came at me from nowhere. Died. Alt f4. Devs, go ♥♥♥♥ yourselves.
4234	0	a	I'm writting this because I'm waaaay ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off.  The game is fine, but be prepared to lose your WHOLE WORLD and progress in the moment your internet connection decide to fail. The backups DON'T WORK AT ALL, it gets corrupted as f**k and the map gets all glitched. I literally worked hard to the point I was tired as hell building some tunnels and towers and the world was simply gone as soon as the internet came back.   I repeat: The game is ok, but it's not stable at all, you WILL lose your progress and you and your friends WILL regret wasting your time on this piece of garbage.
4235	0	a	This Game is pretty good it has tons of bosses, Unique Weapons, a few nice dungeons and a bunch of pets and other cosmetics. The games soundtrack makes me insta nut but other than that this game is a masterpiece. The only thing its missing is the ♥♥♥♥ING CATGIRLS WITH HUGE GUN AND BIG SWORD I DEMAND THEY ADD THIS OR ILL REFUND EVEN THOUGH I OWNED FOR M4325 YEARS♥♥♥♥ YOU RELOGIC BRINGE ME WHAT I LOVE I WONT STAND FOR YOU MONEYGRABBING JEWS TO NOT HAVE THIS THIS MY LAST TIKME BEFOR I GO AND FAP TO MY GAY SCAT PORN FETISH.
4236	0	a	I don't like games that make me look up wiki and tutorials online, tutorial should be included in the game, otherwise I don't find it immersive, and that makes it not fun. When did developers start getting lazy and expect fans/streamers to do the work for them? That didn't used to be a thing in games.
4237	0	a	Everyone thought this game could run on a potato, but apparently not. I used to be able to play this game, but since some update, it runs in slow-motion and I can't do anything about it. Now I bassicly can't play. And I've seen people with really beefy PC's and they have the same problem. Please fix it!!
4238	0	a	Meh couldn't get into this.
4239	0	a	Before I start let me say something: I really enjoy this game, but I have reasons for my review. There is a lot to enjoy about terraria, a wide variety of mobs and bosses, plenty of biomes, and an awesome soundtrack. I have played this for around 100 hours, and I still feel like there is still a lot more to see. But even though I can say I have enjoyed playing this game, I can't say I recomend it for one big reason:  One bug This may not sound too bad at first glance, as there are tons of games that end up as glitchy messes, but this bug can ruin the fun of the game. The bug resulted in my loosing my character (Which I had played on for 95 hours), and all the items in its inventory. I have barely even touched the game since then, I don't want to end up breaking things even more. So with that I had lost 95 hours, which I had done so much. What's worce is that this bug has been around for over a year! I would expect that a team behind a game as popular as this would have found some solution already, but all I've seen are the rather un-helpful responce 'You should've kept a backup', which would be better to say to a person before something happens instead of afterwards.  So until I see this bug fixed, or something that would ease the loss, I cannot say that I recommend this game.
4240	0	a	There is a Problem with Opening game it does not work ;/
4241	0	a	Very boring. Widescreen users DO NOT BUY THIS. The Ui is super small for more than 1900x900. Also since the UI is pretty small you cant see anything! Waste of money

4244	0	a	It gets really boring after awile
4245	0	a	Starting the review off my saying I definately got my money's worth out of this game and overall really enjoyed playing it. I would still recommend it to someone who has never played it.  But...  I reinstalled it and after several updates they kind of butchered it IMO. It's extremely zoomed out now so it hurts me eyes, and the game got weirdly 'floaty' is the best way I can describe it. I highly doubt it's in my head, falling seemed WAY slower then before and just general movement all felt very sluggish.  I REALLY doubt it's my computer.
4246	0	a	Look its a great game, but the community is just full of weeaboo's.
4247	0	a	It's okay. Starbound is better IMO. Too many things were left unfinished and limited.
4248	0	a	I let my kid play this and now he won't talk to me.
4249	0	a	  it super slow motion and lagy and sas runs all computres

4257	0	a	Everyone loves this game, but I couldn't get into it. If a game doesn't engage me within the first hour, I'm out. I'd rather play Minecraft.
4258	0	a	Too small, too difficult to play. I like complex games, but too much was crammed in. Nothing is explained to the player so you're left trying to figure out how to craft and get better equippment on your own. Simply a miss-managed game that got lost in itself. If you want to spend hours hunched over squinting at a 2D 8-bit sidecroller survival game for hours on end, trying to see what the hell you're doing, then this actually may be for you.
4259	0	a	After playing for about two-three hours, I realized this game wasn't for me.
4260	0	a	I love this game in all honestly. The biomes, enemies, items, etc. I only have a few hours into the game and I have spent 8 hours into a character. But what do i get? A blank character slot. I have tried everything to restore my character. I gave up on that and started from scratch. Atleast 2 hours on that character, boom disappeared. It seems like many don't have this problem but few people can't enjoy this amazing game without something like disappearing characters. Redigit all im asking for you is to fix this bug. Everything has it going for this game. It's just that one little bug that makes it for hard for some people to play the game.   This game is a 9/10 without this bug 7/10 with the bug  But hey you are most likely not to get this bug. -Eggo
4261	0	a	this game is absolute ♥♥♥♥ an is not better then the division 
4262	0	a	Im a big Terraria fan, I have it on my mobile device, and I have it on console, I recently bought the PC version to play 1.3, but terraria seems to open up off screen making it impossible to play the game, only sit there and listen to the title screen music, like that will help
4263	0	a	Bought this game specificaly to play witha friend, cant even do that because steam servers are garbage. 10/10 would disconnect again
4264	0	a	I don't have the required hours to give this game a positive review
4265	0	a	Uhhhh. Am I missing something? I downloaded this game and the controls seemed to be very awkward. I would up having to reconfig everything while creatures were attacking. Not only that, it would sometimes catch on the cycle item left/right for items, making it so I could get to an axe in time. And I couldn't seem to chop down trees.
4266	0	a	SO I HAVE 90+ HOURS IN THIS GAME, and I decided to take brake from the game. When I re-installed (on the same pc) I couldnt play the game fullscreen and the resolution was totally crap. Really dissapointed (I am using Lenovo Y70 Touch)
4267	0	a	I could recommend this game to people.... But I tried refunding it and Valve stole my money.
4268	0	a	ok so i'm saying no because i had the solar eruption (a weapon) i used it i died lost checked where i died counldn't find it gone well there goes one of my best weapons unless Duke Fishron stole it then i don't know maybe bugged but that is just bad

4271	0	a	 1 Part I Liked  You can build a castle floating in the clouds. Or a shack deep in the jungle. Or a pirate ship. The world(s) are yours to mold.   1 Part I Disliked  Most of the progression is based on random factors: finding where the world has generated that vein of ore you're looking for, grinding bosses to get the drops you want, hoping this dungeon chest has the right type of loot, etc.
4272	0	a	PC crashed and lost a world that I spent hours on...♥♥♥♥ you Besides this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, its a great game 4/10 lost worlds

4274	0	a	I hate this game. My brother, for whom I bought this game, hates this game. There is no way to learn the controls, what you are supposed to do or how to do it. Other than by dying a bijillion times. But the big problem is, I cant survive longer than 10 seconds to actually figure any thing out. Which is highly frustrating. No, extrememly frustrating. Im glad at least I only wasted $2 on this game.
4275	0	a	  my terraria is not opening up and that is making me made

4283	0	a	I regret what i had previously said. This game has tricked me more times than i bother to remember. I start a new world and as soon as i'm about to fight the wall it crashes! Really! A ll my efforts wasted! The backup's don't ever work and they always fail. Everytime i think it will not crash it does. Watch your purchases because this game is a TIME WASTER!!!!
4284	0	a	Boring after a while. buy starbound instead! it has much more to explore
4285	0	a	this game succs
4286	0	a	I had to buy it again because I went to controls and I made the inventory key left click but then whenever I want to swing my blade it goes to inventory instead and when I want save and exit it goes to inventory so I have to lose my progress when I log back on and I have to shut my computer down to get out of the game

4297	0	a	This game is literally Modded Minecraft, minus a third very needed dimension, making things extremely cramped and finicky to work with. I can't imagine why people would prefer this over something like Technic modded Minecraft. The graphics are very pixelized, which to some people might seem quaint but personally I just think that's the kind of art style that only survives because of people who grew up with it and feel nostalgic over it, because to someone who didn't dear god someone please pass the eye bleach. I refunded this within the hour.

4301	0	a	it has a bit of glitches
4302	0	a	I personally just couldn't get into this game. as a sidescrollers where you build things, go off and get equipment/materials to build with. It just seems boring. Unfortuately I played minecraft before this I felt they were simalar, but I don't play it either anymore. This game defenitely put more work into the combat system.
4303	0	a	Great, except it crashes whenever i try to change the resolution to anything but the auto setting, I dont want to play a game where i cant read anything.
4304	0	a	Got bored straight away
4305	0	a	this game is garbage, no replay value and very short game
4306	0	a	♥♥♥♥♥♥
4307	0	a	Within 6 days of downloading this game, I've had to delete two worlds. I would save and exit the world as normal, but when I'd try to reload it later, it would fail. I would then try to load the backup, but my game would crash. Each world had several hours of work. I don't know if this is a problem with the game or my computer, but if it's the game, it's an issue that seriously needs to be fixed.
4308	0	a	I played this for 60 hours just because 2 of my friends liked it. I was miserable for the whole time.
4309	0	a	For years I have tried to like this, since I was a fan of Minecraft and stuff. I always put it down within half an hour or so. The building aspect is really shallow and it doesn't benefit very much from the multiplayer aspect. I think it just isn't very interesting unless you are really into platform games.
4310	0	a	This game is fantastic...except for one minor problem. The new update has changed the way you set down blocks. making it easier to form a house or any other square object. But anything from a wall to a tardis console is now near impossible due to you not being allowed to put the blocks except where the game wants you to. This took a lot of the fun of the game, and ruins the idea of a sandbox doesnt it?
4311	0	a	Why are you in the negatives? look at the numbers mate over 100 thousand to 5 thousand.  Slight downsides of the game: RNG, Glitches, Terrible sense of instruction form the game devs Upsides: Everything else
4312	0	a	I found the entire interface so incredibly frustrating as to the point where I almost quit because it was so difficult to use, However I persevered and evevntally dug a mineshaft which fell into a cave. After exploring said cave, I though 'hmm, I'll just leave this cave now' but try as I might, I couldn't work out how I could possibly place the blocks in the right place to do that. However I managed to drop some sand which flung me in th right direction and allowed me to escape.  I was pretty ragey at this point, but when I got stuck on the wrong side of a pond which obviously I shouldn't be able swim out of, because that doesn't make sense, right? I know a some people who really enojy this game, but pretty much from the very begining, I hated almost everything about this game.
4313	0	a	My friends play this and I really want to play it but, as soon as I press anything it goes back to the menu screen. This means I can't play the game and it was a complete waste of money
4314	0	a	The game's interface is too small to read. There is STILL no option to resize it ingame even after five years of game development.
4315	0	a	It doesn't work anymore
4316	0	a	The game is great, just don't bye it if you have a MAC. 1.3.4.4 wont work.
4317	0	a	Do not get this game. boring, empty, and slow.
4318	0	a	it is good for the first day or two

4320	0	a	Wow! Terraria! This game provides ENDLESS fun...that ends in about an hour. Seriously though. This game gets old fast.
4321	0	a	Good when it came out but there is little reason to play it now. Get Starbound.
4322	0	a	Utter ♥♥♥♥! I've tried mutliple times to pick this game up and it fails with me. I would pay someone retail to take it out of my library.
4323	0	a	Gets boring. Fast.

4325	0	a	Summoning bosses is annoying. Having them despawn at dawn is dumb. would be more fun if it was like dark souls

4351	0	a	I've been playing so long, Steam decided that if I didn't give a negative review it would strip me of my license for this game, and give it to some kid with 1000 items on his wishlist.

4378	0	a	game is boring. and i can't refound a ♥♥♥ key . . .
4379	0	a	Terraria seemed to be a fun game, but crashed when I chopped 2 trees. Tried this with any character and world size. Do not buy until they make a hotfix.
4380	0	a	It sux
4381	0	a	you cant actually do anything the screenshots show.
4382	0	a	Bad ripoff of minecraft
4383	0	a	It is a good game, when they add splitscreen coop like in the console versions i will truly recomend it enough of this 'no splitscreen on pc' ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  And for those that think 'You would need an extra keyboard and mouse to play', Terraria supports gamepads since 1.3.1, there are dozens of couch coop games on pc (Helldivers, Gauntlet, Serious Sam 3, Dungeon Defenders; List of some others:  http://co-optim.us/1aVPX80)   Any PC can have several gamepads connected like any console (Have 4 Wireless Xbox360 connected without a problem). And can also connect it to a TV with a single damn HDMI cable.  So no ♥♥♥♥ing excluses here seriously, don't even try, the devs just don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about porting the feature because people still think it is god damn impossible to do it on PC (even if we have several examples of games with this feature)
4384	0	a	This game is now part of my WNP category. Will Never Play.
4385	0	a	Doesn't work. Loads then crashes. I think it has something to do with my 1600 by 900 screen resolution, but i'm not sure.
4386	0	a	its not that good
4387	0	a	Umm this is my favorite game so far, I will most likely be playng this non stop for the whole summer. I really like all the different mosters and ore, I llove all the different weapons and ites to collect in the game. They have a great amount of items to decorate your house and character, also not gonna lie the character customization for this game destroys fallout 4. Only thing I wish their was more of is tables so I can be seen as a great terraria player! I'd also like to thank the developers as this is the only quality game on steam so far.
4388	0	a	♥♥♥♥ing terrible 2d peice of ♥♥♥♥ abortion. !!!{DO NOT BUY}!!!
4389	0	a	Game at first is 10/10 when you kill all bosses get best armour and build a really good base you are so bored and nothing to do but grind monsters and sell items you don't need now its a 6.5/10.

4404	0	a	What the other reviews don't tell you is that when you die you have to stare at 'YOU DIED' for 15 seconds before you can respawn, every single time, and there's no way to change that.
4405	0	a	  I haven't played this game for that long and i got this game for free from some online kid who was nice. This game was fun when playing with a friend, but it wasn't that addicting to play. I like minecraft more but thats just me. I know many people love this game. I am not hating on it, I just wasn't hooked on it.
4406	0	a	This game needs an update now!
4407	0	a	  I find it kinda boring because it's too complicated and it's not really that fun grinding to figure the game out
4408	0	a	It looks like a nice game, but it just would not open for me.
4409	0	a	Yeah, look I really can't recommend this game if you're trying to go for really enjoying the game I played this game, I played it alot with my friend, we played it for hours and hours. We farmed and grinded for bosses, we did every possible thing you could do in the game, then when we ran out of things to do you know what we did? Wait for the big ♥♥♥♥ing update, 1.3  We waited a good ♥♥♥♥ing year for that update, we had literally nothing else to do while we waited, so we just sat on our ♥♥♥♥ing chairs and stared at our computers just waiting for that update to come.  You know what it ♥♥♥♥ing did when it came? Absolutely jack ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥, it made the game less playable, it added more grinding and farming, the devs did anything but listen to the community, for a newcomer that update could be seen as good, but it limited what the players already had and just made it all in all, boring. My friend and I just loaded up the game when 1.3 came out, absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing hysterical about this whole thing, we played for a while to see that nothing had ♥♥♥♥ing changed, it was just the same old terraria with like, a few new decoration blocks  If you plan on buying this game, go ahead, you'll like it. Its a good game, but 1.3 was a ♥♥♥♥ing disaster that should take no place in the history of Terraria. I stopped playing this game after 1.3 and I am now looking at starbound to be the next big whatever.  Game before update 7/10 Game after update 5/10 (Moonlord is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and you need to farm for hours on end to get a single chance at that overpowered piece of ♥♥♥♥)  EDIT: Fixed words and words fixed

4439	0	a	I'm not hating. i just want you to view.      Terraria: Otherworld, it's wierd. no like i mean its just. they changed the textures and skins and stuff and. terraria the old one was good. and it's just. they'res atleast a 6.5% chance that terraria (not otherworld) will get updated anymore. its sad
4440	0	a	Boring, like a minecraft without any technology/automation mods.
4441	0	a	I am probaly the only human being alive that finds this game boring and stupid.

4447	0	a	Played for about 20 minutes with no indication of what I was supposed to do. I killed some monsters I collected some things but everytime I went to settings to figure out the controls and tweak the game I would die because the game kept going. This is not dark souls its ok to pause when I go to a menu. Gonna see if i can get a refund as its kinda lame.

4461	0	a	nope don't like it whatsever. Great for stealing peoples doors though
4462	0	a	A common praise for this game is that is has more 'game' than Minecraft. That if you felt Minecraft lacked 'gameplay' than Terraria is a 2D answer to your problems.  I suppose it is that. But what about this represents more 'gameplay' is beyond me. The amount of button pressing is similar. The flexibility of the building system is greatly diminished. The crafting system is blissfully more transparent and hellishly more bloated feeling. The combat is tedious and as best I can tell the added 'gameplay' is simply more grind. Mining takes more grind, crafting takes more grind, combat takes more grind.  I found it somewhat enjoyable but mostly I found it compulsive in the way grind-filled games tend to be. It lacks the heart, charm, flexibility and stark gandeur of Minecraft. By my reckoning, Minecraft is Terraria with more 'game.' Minecraft has a host of problems, of course, from its tedious dependence on using a wiki to the obscurity and pointlessness of many of its systems such as enchantment. But Terraria has all these problems, too.   Clearly, I don't understand this particular common refrain about Terraria and additionally while I do think it has a compulsive coherence I found myself feeling like I was perpetuatlly waiting for the REAL game to start. I think you probably already know if that's ok with you, but on the off chance that you don't know ... stay away. There are much more worthy games if you're experimenting with the unknown.
4463	0	a	This game gave me cancer.

4494	0	a	Terraria used to be a lovable little indie game starring cartoony characters, simple graphics, Lovecraftian bosses, and a little bit of everything to explore, slay, build, and craft.  Now, it's filled to the brim with edgy mages, OP bosses, enemies, and weapons, a boring, irrelevant 'plotline' that was just recently devised, and much, much more.  Issues aside, it's still got the fun and excitement of adventure and exploration left in it. But just hear me out on this one:   change isn't always good.  
4495	0	a	It was alright.
4496	0	a	Well I enjoyed it alot. About 4 years ago.  It was easy then. Build. Jam to the awesome chiptune soundtrack. Mine. Fight the Wall of Flesh. Beat all the bosses. Grab the Excalibur. Done.  They rammed in so many weapons that my inventory is constantly filled, and oh dear lord all of the particle effects. It litterally gets you to a point in the game where everything you own is overpowered, one shotting poor little rabbits and basic monsters, and nothing a a challenge anymore. The litterally decided to use Chrismas Tree and mulitple freaking Yo-Yos as weapons in the game.New order.  Build. Mine. Jam to still epic chiptune music. Beat the Wall of Flesh. Grab the Excalibur. Just kidding, apparently that was the fake one. Now use your fake Excalibur to craft the TRUE excalibur. Grab the Night's Edge. Oh wait sorry then the True Night's Edge. Then use the TRUE Excalibur and the TRUE Night's Edge. To Craft lo and behold, the Terrablade. Defeat the Moon Lord. Wallow in self pity on the false sense of accomplishment. Done.  The game takes almost no skilll, just a lot of time. A lot of time wasted.
4497	0	a	It was alright.
4498	0	a	It's a great game!
4499	0	a	Terraria is an awesome game. It is very fun, and there are loads of stuff to do.  That said, I cannot recommend this game because it is simply too hard.   From the beginning: You start off in a forest-like area, and you must build a shelter because at night enemies will spawn and attack you (Like Minecraft) Eventually you will learn to master the world, and NPCs will move to your town, who provide valuable goods and services.  Once you get enough equipment, you fight a boss. The boss then opens up a new boss fight, and so forth. Between the first boss fight (Eye of Cthulu) and the fourth boss (Wall of Flesh) is probably one of the most fun experiences I've had in a video game. However, after you beat the Wall of Flesh (which is a BS boss fight) your world enters 'Hardmode' which means that the difficulty is taken to absurd new heights. After some time, you will have stronger gear and be able to defeat normal enemies with ease, and now you are ready to fight one of the three initial Hardmode bosses.  This is where things get ugly. This is the game's fatal flaw: the boss fights. They are a major part of Terraria and very crucial to game advancement. They are also impossible to kill alone.  Your first choice: The Destroyer. This is a giant worm, and probably the easiest of the Hardmode bosses (relatively) BUT IT IS STILL A LOAD OF BS. I had the strongest equipment possible before killing the boss, but it wasn't enough. You can't beat this game with skill, because the bosses are spongy and move around too much to be able to effectively attack them. Did I mention you only have about ~10 minutes to beat any of the 3 Hardmode bosses? Also BS: consider there is a cooldown of ONE MINUTE between healing potions (though there is an item that takes it down to 45 seconds) and the best healing potion possible can only heal 150 points of maximum 500 health.  Choice #2: The Twins. A pair of giant eyeballs that fly around in a choppy and abrupt manner, making them hard to hit with any sort of weapon (especially melee) Also: they shoot lasers and green fire at you. The best part: once you take one of them down to half health, it transforms, upgrading its attack power AND defense. Must be fought during nighttime and slain before dawn to win. Total BS.  Choice #3: Skeletron Prime. THIS IS THE MOST BS YOU WILL EVER EXPERIENCE. A large floating head with extremely high HP and defense, and arms that a) shoot lasers at you, b) shoot bombs at you, c) slice you with a chainsaw, and d) crush you with a claw. The head also attacks you quite a bit. The arms can be knocked out, but they are even harder to hit than the Twins, since they are smaller and move faster.  Once you beat ALL THREE (note: this is basically impossible alone. You won't have enough firepower, and if you die once, the boss disappears. The boss fights are prohibitively expensive, since the items you need to summon them are hard to get and can only be used once) you can move on to Plantera. I've never even seen Plantera in-game, but I assume the same rules apply that applied to the first three bosses. Not to mention that the thing that summons Plantera spawns randomly underground in the Jungle, which means you could be searching for a while just to ATTEMPT to fight the boss, and you could potentially be knocked out lightning fast.  tl;dr The game is very fun up until hardmode. Afterwards the game becomes a BSfest and grindfest that is impossible to finish unless you have friends. (I don't...) 
4500	0	a	Guess I am one of the odd ones who dislikes this game. I don't understand the hype at all. Chop and build things. Meh. Rather spend my time in ableton. So I get it why some like this game. Its fun to be creative, but for me its not my enjoyment of creation. Give me a Virus ti2 and some brake beats.
4501	0	a	This game is a game ment to take up as much time of your day if you love gaming with friends finding new treasure then this is the game for you but if you like a meaning to a game then done buy it hahaha 10/10 fun 5/10 has magic 3/10 alot of gore unless switched off
4502	0	a	I cant understand why ppl like this game either I thgouht its a 2nd person shooter game like gun monkeys or something that looking like a puzzel game but that even worsse..  Dunno even why I spent my money for this ♥♥♥♥..
4503	0	a	the 1.3.3 update sucks balls its does not affect end game players and we waited a while for this update and still cant do anything but make a new character like i know thats what you do when u beat game but ive already played all of the roles and have nothing else to do why u do this to us at least they should have made the new weapons and armor more for end game than mid game and maybe a new boss at least it would get people some reason to get on and progress.   the 1.3.4 update sucks balls its does not affect end game players also to even start the event you need to find the cancerous npc and he is a pain to find, the best update in my opinion is 1.3 they added moon lord and the celestial event and the lunitic cultist and more end game items so people could progress and actually play the game. Dont get me wrong they did add new weapons and armor and more items it's just that all of it is for later hardmode and not end game as previously stated i said that 1.3 was my favorite update cause of the addition towards end game and it made people want to progress further and yes i do understand for all of the people who are not at the end game think that this update is great which is good for you people im just say it would have nice to get new end game items and a end game boss/event.
4504	0	a	  this game is for gays
4505	0	a	Edit: (New Review because i compared it too much to minecraft) Basically Terraia is really nothing more than a grindfest in about everything involved with it, Mining, fighting, etc.: grindfests. Due to this and the low replay value, the game gets boring fast when all the content is discovered through endless grinding of course, which is probably the reason why the developers decided to add in all the conetnt in it in the first place because its as if they knew it would be the game's only backbone, as evident from the fanbase when they use this trait as their main argument of the game being worthwhile. On other notes the 2d nostalgia-dependent graphics harms the games buidling aspect as you are limited to a side view which gets quite annoying, as for the combat which is heralded as the game's main selling point against minecraft *drumroll*...... is basically just like minecrafts combat system, they both require spamming the attack button to defeat enemies which is again. boring. the only difference really is the gunz and majuks but you still have to spam. But to sum it up its basically zelda/final fantasy turned into a sandbox, which explains why it would have never appealed to me in a artistic sense. I can see where people would like the game if they had enough tolerance but definitley not me
4506	0	a	THIS IS GOD DAMN ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T EVERY TIME I TRY TO MAKE A NEW WORLD IT CRASHES ♥♥♥♥ YOU AND YOUR GAME WASTE OF MY MONEY
4507	0	a	This is grinding the game.

4509	0	a	This game is for 4 year olds, hence the reason my brother has over 900 hours logged. 2/10 would not recommend to you or your younger siblings.
4510	0	a	I'm a big fan of minecraft, so I was excited to play this game. But I found that it was fiddly, uninteresting, difficult to understand, and ultimately not fun. Also, the endless blobs are really ♥♥♥♥ing annoying,
4511	0	a	Tedious
4512	0	a	I ♥♥♥♥ing hate when the game stops and I lose all i did that save
4513	0	a	DONT GET IT IT IS THE WORST GAME EVER AN THIS IS A COPY OF MINECRAFT BUT THE ONLY THING GOOD ABOUT IT IS THERE IS MORE ITEMS IN IT
4514	0	a	I cant even play it. I download it and run it and steam says im in game, but im not. i go to task manager and its running alright, just in 'background procceses' instead of 'applications'. i have this on mobile, but character creation doesnt work when i get up to the the make a character name part. then only two keys work: the letter 'I' and the letter 'R' so i can't even hit enter to create the character.
4515	0	a	I might be the only guy that thinks this is boring. 4/10
4516	0	a	Screw this game. Don't waste your money. Block placement has no ryme or reason, it places blocks in columns of usuall 4 blocks wide, removing the ability to esil make anything. hen to want to attack something, you have to turn around so your sword hits in that direction, meaning that you can't keep hitting and retreating. This game is just a waste of your money and time.
4517	0	a	♥♥♥♥ this game i want a refund xD 
4518	0	a	Company Of Terraria Please tell me why all my hard work is gone If i get my stuff back i will be happy i played this game for along time for that crap i want my stuff back  PS IF THIS IS A BUG I STILL WANT MY STUFF BACK PPS  I am serious :(
4519	0	a	I saw the advertising video and I was pretty sure I was buying 1.3, buut I actually bought 1.0
4520	0	a	Too many bugs, the game 'pauses' every 10 seconds, but during the pause the ennemies still kill you. Also, too much fight from the very beginning. In the end, I got bored after 30 min of game.
4521	0	a	(Read the whole review) Don't buy this game its a waste of money, it gets repetitive and you will most likely going to go to a item server to get items. Then the game gets boring. And you get these MAGICAL weapons so cool. If you like minecraft give it a try but if you are into games like Grand Theft Auto or CS:GO or Team Fortress 2, you will not like this game one bit. If you also like arcade graphics and/or have a bad pc you will definitely like this. But im a FPS and GTA 5 Player so this game doesnt appeal to me at all. And for anyone wondering its usually the 22nd most played game on steam.

4534	0	a	Ok, so first off, I bought this game a long time ago. Then a couple months ago I played it and there were so many new things introduced, like Telelporter, rainbow torches, and a Xenostaff??? Anyways, they've made a massive change, mostly for the good of the game. (Was kind of getting boring... :P) However after you installed the update and started playing with your friends with the new 'Join via Steam' option, you'd realise how much stuff you could get. My buds and I were like 'Woah dude that sick! Yeah man, lets craft everything in the game... &lt;Not really. We thought we were going to have the time of our lives, playing a crafting/survival game together, crafting tons of items... Then after about of month of playing, I realised that we weren't going anywhere quickly,we thought that because we defeated the Wall of Flesh, that we were unstoppable with all of the items that we recieved from the goodie bags. We thought that until the Pirate invasion came, that really hit us hard. We eventually got through it and we kept going through the game. A couple days later my Youth minister came, he was wearing sick as armour and had awesome gear, we thought he had like finished the game! But then a couple days ago he said that the gear that he had was useless junk considering who he was up against. Thats when it hit me, bro, this game at least is gonna take about a year and a half to finish, and I have a life to live for a reason. And so that is when I bought ARK: Survival Evolved and that was good, but repeptative... Anyways, there are a lot more other games to play which are better than this, don't waste your money and your life on this. Buy Dota 2, its a fun game that only lasts for about 40mins a match...  Only get Terraria if you don't want a life...   
4535	0	a	Just bought this game and for some reason it won't even start, half of the time I have no error codes. Oh well wish I could have a refund.
4536	0	a	This game is just not fun 
4537	0	a	'The only ores which will always spawn naturally in any given world are Meteorite, Obsidian, Hellstone, and Chlorophyte. All other ores are paired off so that only one out of each pair will spawn in a world. For pre-hardmode ores, this is determined at world generation; for hardmode ores, this is determined when the first, second, and third Demon Altar or Crimson Altar is destroyed. Within each pair, each member has an equal chance of spawning. Which ores are paired together are shown to the right. Only one of the hard mode ores will spawn, so multiple worlds might be necessary to get a certain ore(Adamantite for Suspicious Looking Skulls).  In all cases, equipment made from replacement ores will be statistically slightly stronger than equivalent equipment made from the original ore.' - Taken from  terraria.wikia.com   I really liked this game up until the devs did this. Basically, the new ore types they introduced to the game weren't simply added to the word generation, which is what I thought, because that would MAKE ♥♥♥♥ING SENSE. Either the original ore will be generated in your world, or the equivalent new ore, but never both. You can have copper or tin, but not both. You can have Adamantite or Titanium, but not both. A lot of items can be crafted by either equivalent ore types, but the items crafted out of the newly added ore types will -always- be better somehow. Even if they're statistically identical, the items made out of the new ore types will still sell for more. Basically in order to craft the best items in the game you'll probably want to generate multiple worlds just for mining. It's possible to obtain an ore type that didn't spawn in your world by using the extractinator, but who wants to do that? This is ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.

Bad graphics, awkward controls, nonexistent physics, ripoff of Minecraft, repetitive crashing and any tools you hold are bigger than your player and can go through walls to hit whatever is behind it! Did the developers even try? Basically, what I'm saying is get the game, see if you like it. I didn't like it, but that's me. Get it and try it out.

4558	0	a	This game is alright for the most part, but it is incredibly buggy and when i tried to configure my options, the game broke on itself because the mobs kept attacking me and it broke the menu. I could not connect to my friends and it was very laggy. I DO NOT recommend this.
4559	0	a	Let me describe my experience playing this.  - Got in . created a character. - Started chopping trees like an ecoterrorist - Got to a cave ...... it was dark, got some torches and explored it - I built a house - Lost interest  For some reason this game disapointed me and made me rush to the uninstall button O.O  This is not a good reason to not buy it , great work you just wasted 1 minute of your life reading this. Maybe ill give it 'another chance' and make a better review but until then.....   Still reading ? 2 min mark now......  In my opinion, its just a failed attempt to make a Side-scroller minecraft-kind game .   I made a mistake buying this (just like i did with state of decay while i could've bought dying light ) so dont do the same   ( 3min mark )   I just failed miserably at making both a review and a joke ...... yay me. Nah just dont buy it...
4560	0	a	Any game that requires a wiki to be open in another window to actually know how to play isn't a good game.
4561	0	a	I like Minecraft better but this game is alright. I'm still not recommending like a bleeting cow though but I will say that most people randomly like it. It's not a positive thing, just a fact. Take it as you will.
4562	0	a	My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.' I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.

4565	0	a	This game is alright for the most part, but it is incredibly buggy and when i tried to configure my options, the game broke on itself because the mobs kept attacking me and it broke the menu. I could not connect to my friends and it was very laggy. I DO NOT recommend this.
4566	0	a	Not a fan
4567	0	a	No. Worlds crash to often, back up files DONT work. Things they needed to fix, they never will
4568	0	a	Mine stuff Make armor/weapon Fight Boss Repeat  WOW AMAZING PROGRESSION
4569	0	a	This game was really fun 5 years ago when it first came out, seems like they put in a lot of work to make it more glitchy and less fun... WTF?! Also thanks for deleting my 50+ hours of gameplay for your patches. I'd highly recommend this game if you own a time machine, otherwise it's complete garbage now.
4570	0	a	this game is very confusing
4571	0	a	Ive played terraria on my iPhone and I loved it! then i played it on my computer and it was very annoying. You have no lighting unless you have torches and the controls are annoying. Also you dont have good range for mining and swinging your sword. It is very hard to install mods also. It was not worth $10.
4572	0	a	Its the new stupid graphics that sucks. remove them
4573	0	a	When I read the reviews I was greeted with praise both in the negative and positive reviews, so I opted to try Terraria out.  Here's the truth: It's a terrible 2d minecraft, and unless you enjoy minecraft you likely wont enjoy this game.  0/10 would not recommend

4578	0	a	Not a game I enjoyed, though the charm it holds for those who enjoy it is evident.
4579	0	a	The game can be real good fun but there is a bad issue that causes me to give a bad review. The issue being worlds getting corrupt i spent 10-15 hours on a world and abought to go on hard mode and then i deside i have had enough i save the game and exited and when i went back to play the game was lost. I tryed going back to the save deleating .wld and renaming the .wld.bak file so it was just .wld and it did not work. So for this i have to give a bad review hope the can patch this bug.
4580	0	a	ZERO STARS, zero ♥♥♥♥ing stars. i hate this game soooo ♥♥♥♥ing much it makes me screem it is way to hard to get started and mobs arre soooooooooooooooooooooooooooo ♥♥♥♥ing anyoing. not only that but the controlls are jack ♥♥♥♥. I hate this game and do not recamend it to anyone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    -ps ♥♥♥♥ THIS GAME!
4581	0	a	Couldn't get into it for the life of me.  Just feels like 2D Minecraft with more bosses and more weapons.  Not convinced.
4582	0	a	could join any servers and windows is not blocking it...
4583	0	a	its like minecraft but 2d and bad its boring and uncreative unlike minecraft a game of endless fun entertanment

4589	0	a	I just never found it fun. I have played it before with friends, and even then i found it stupid.

4591	0	a	CRAP
4592	0	a	this game has the worst graphics not even possible to live a day and it just sucks in general
4593	0	a	Every second I play this game I ask myself why I'm not just playing Minecraft. Minecraft has ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics but awesome open world sandbox gameplay. Terraria has even worse graphics and - side scroller gameplay. Most overrated game in the history of overrated games.
4594	0	a	the multiplayer doesnt ♥♥♥♥ing work!
4595	0	a	I HATE IT 
4596	0	a	i have ubuntu 15.10 and don't work at me :((
4597	0	a	This game never ♥♥♥♥ing saves the characters and world plz change that who ever made this game
4598	0	a	I couldn't even get past 5min of this game without dying every 30 seconds. It's not that I'm lazy and don't want to read wikis but if the learning curve of the game is this difficult I don't even feel motivated to play the game. I spent way too long trying to find a way to get back to the main menu and ended up Alt-F4'ing, only to realise all I had to do was hit Esc and click the word 'Settings' in the lower right hand side of the screen (which I didn't even notice). The preview videos and screenshots made the game look awesomely fun and the idea of a 2D platformer plus minecraftian sandbox intrigued me, but my first impressions of the game just made me extremely frustrated.
4599	0	a	Surprisingly boring.
4600	0	a	This game ♥♥♥♥ing sucks at the beginning. I enjoy the late game but ♥♥♥♥ that start to the game is impossible. So ♥♥♥♥ing grindy and aweful. Took me about 3 days in real life of grinding on expert mode soft core to beat skeletron. Jesus had a ♥♥♥♥.

4620	0	a	I finally decided on a hair style for my character. Now it's asking me to choose my shirt color? Spent too long on the character creation options, no thanks!!!!
4621	0	a	Personally I do not like this game at all. Maybe it was because I played Minecraft before ever playing Terraria. I just can't seem to get into it.
4622	0	a	This being me, i cant really get into minecraft kinds of games, so if u like minecraft u will like this. but for me i couldnt get into it.

4626	0	a	I loved ths game and found it so addictive then the character i played 25 hours on was lost such a disappointment I loved this game as well
4627	0	a	Game was going great farmed turtles for 3 hours to get 3 turtle shells then when i made the armor poof half the armor was gone waste of time glitchy as hell
4628	0	a	Go on multiplayer Find some guy Wants to be friends I say why In return he starts shooting a meowmere and crashes server........ WHAT  P.S. ALL SERVERS ARE LIKE THIS!!!!!!!! 
4629	0	a	Terraria is a game where if you dont have $26 for minecraft than buy this. Its a little less.
4630	0	a	I personnally do not like this game but it is only because I started off with Minecraft and I enjoy the open word format. But I will say that I hear plenty of good things about Terraria. So lets just leave it at that.
4631	0	a	You were slain... You were slain... You were slain... You were slain...  That's pretty much my experience with Terraria. I'm ragequitting after an hour because it's so damn frustrating to keep dying in the dark and not knowing how to get ahead to the cool parts shown in the trailers. The game doesn't exactly guide you very far. Maybe it would be a better experience with more time but it honestly hasn't pulled me in at all despite how much everyone else seems to love it. So in my frustration I'm leaving a negative review.
4632	0	a	it sucks it wont even load the game and screw up my pc &gt;:(
4633	0	a	Gets boring, no directions, not so good.
4634	0	a	do not get this game its like CRACK mycousin played for 2 days and now he lives in my basement tring to kill king slime
4635	0	a	I just can't understand what i am doing in this game and always die in that frikin cave. If you like grinding things and killing stuff with a tiny man go for it :D
4636	0	a	Ever since auto-swing by holding down the left mouse button for some swords was removed Terraria has become an absolutely tedious game to play. It would be a reasonable feature if the click speed determined the swing speed, but each sword has its built-in swing speed - meaning you have to click in rhythm with the game. In situations where you're getting swarmed by enemies and mash the mouse button in a panic, you achieve nothing.   These weak swords completely break the game by killing the players motivation to make progress. Also, not being able to change the screen resolution is worse than Hitler. Terarria could be a great game if you were allowed some customization, but as it is - it's terrible.
4637	0	a	Wont let me play the game  
4638	0	a	Superminecraftkid's famous words:  'Hey guys Superminecraftkid here, and I just got TERRARIA. WHAT? IS THIS GAME? ITS A F**KING RIPOFF LIKE LOOK AT THIS! PICKAXE? PICKAXE?!?!?! ARE YOU F**CKING KIDDING ME? And a sword? Look at this a swo- sw- sword!? A sh***y a** sword and look at this! JUMP? its just like f***ing minecraft BUT IN 2D!! This just makes minecraft better because its 3D!!! Why would you want to play that 2 f**king D when you can play the same game but better not a ripoff and in 3 F**KING D! ALSO DO YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IS 2 F**KING D? MARIO! I HATE THAT F**KING GAME!!!! WHY WOULD I WANT TO BUY TERRARIA IF I HATE MARIO?!?!?!? Ok lets get some f***ing wood! WAIT! where have I seen this before? OH YEAH F***ING MINECRAFT!'  Link:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITnwynqm1XY  Read along :)
4639	0	a	Its fun cause its minecraft but better and its 2d like legend of zelda so they game is a clone i dislike it
4640	0	a	This game was a dissapointment. The animations are terrible, the game mechanics are so confusing, multiplayer rarely connects and it's a straight out ripoff of Minecraft. I'm currently getting a refund for this game, because it was a waste of my Steam giftcard.
4641	0	a	Got boring after about 7 hours. 7/10 wouldn't waste seven hours again.
4642	0	a	THis crap got rid of my worlds and chacters
4643	0	a	good as mate
4644	0	a	The Description is wrong. Nothing is impossible except a 3d game. Minecraft is better than this ♥♥♥♥. For all you haters:   This is just my opinion
4645	0	a	Dont like it. Its silly. 1.1/10
4646	0	a	There is definitely an addictive quality to this game, but it needs a great deal of work done.   The most obvious flaw is the graphics. With an HD monitor, the sprites are too small and need to be resized. Textures are not the same sizes, so you end up with background walls overlapping foreground walls, making structures look extremely shoddy. Lastly, there are too many visual effects for the overall graphics of the game to be so poor. This just makes the designers look lazy.  In the end, I would still rather play Ultima Online, which is where this game got most of its ideas. It is almost twenty years old and still looks better than this.
4647	0	a	This game is ok. I'm not saying I don't like it, it's just not that exciting to me. It seems to be a knock-off of Minecraft. I wouldn't get really into it.
4648	0	a	'Too much corrupt files' 10/10 ~IGN
4649	0	a	it´s a good game only if you play with friends. this review is just for people that don´t have friends that play terraria and that think survival games are a little boring. the rest igonre this review
4650	0	a	not that fun honestly
4651	0	a	Nice game all in all. However, the user interface is like sooo bad, that instead of putting the results of an hour of mining into a chest, I put it into the trash accidentally. Both of it is shift click, one with a chest open, one without. And I thought the chest was open, because usually you access the abilities of a nearby placable by simply opening your inventory (ESC key... ..!) True for everything, except chests. Also, scrolling through the crafting recipes (which you have to do it with every single crafting operation) is just soooo sloooow, yooouu haaave toooo waaait fooor eeeveeeryyyy siiingleee iiiiteeeem to slooowlyyyy paaass throoough. And there's like hundreds. Game is really nice, but the user interface is sooo inconsistent, it actually convinced me the game is a waste of time.
4652	0	a	I Love The Game But If You Want A Game Alot Like This But With A Epic Story And Adventure Or Just To Explore With Friends also With More Cool Things To Find Then Get Starbound.

4695	0	a	I personally belive that when 1.1 was released... They ♥♥♥♥ed up. The game was perfect before
4696	0	a	Game was fun in 2014, but after the big update it is unplayable in multiplayer.  Host lags when making dedicated server, tunngle and hamachi dont fix anything, hosting on steam is laggy for the people who join so it's impossible to do expert mode. We cannot even beat the first boss because the game is so laggy. :( I'ts been a year since this started and there seems to be no fix.  This is a problem at least 2 people I know have but I guess most people dont?? If you know the fix please add a comment!
4697	0	a	I've been having problems running the game... When I try to open it from my home screen it won't open after I try to re-try my connection due to connection errors, and it will not let me open steam nor terraria for about 8 hours after. This is extremely frustrating. Is there any way to fix this issue?   
4698	0	a	As a game i love terraria as i play it on ps4, however the PC version of terraria is extreamly laggy and sometimes its slowmotion and this makes the game totally unplayable.
4699	0	a	I changed up some setting with my mouse and now i cant even play without it bugging out im littearlly stuck in the home screen and i just bought it  
4700	0	a	This game was great but is now absolute trash. Coming with the new update has come the inability to rebind any key whatsoever. After trying litterally almost 20 different keyboards and tons of different setups ive divined that the game is broken and terrible.
4701	0	a	Changed my review. The game is still bad. I enjoy a few aspects of it but it really is not entirely fun. IReason as to why I say this is because:  1. resources are almost worthless. I never even used copper or tin, went straight to the next tier lead, then silver, then shadow and some hellmetal armour. So half of the ore content in this game is worthless.  2. As said in my review before, you cannot craft even some of the most easiest things to craft, like rope.  3. I sort of like this but mainly hate it, you need a 'special' item for everything. Going to the land down under? Well then find, mainly find, or craft the item associated to that place to barely function.  4. They really tried to make the water physics work but they don't. Randomly, my entire mine shaft flooded and it was glitched to where it could not be removed, they acted like indestructable placed blocks. Much more to be said but I will not bore.  5. Mobs are pointless in a way. Once you have met 4 different enemies (zombie, eye, slime, mage) you have met em all. The creators barely alter the enemies' stats and maybe give them an ablility then give them a new skin with little to no animation and blamo, a new enemy.  6. Planting system sux in this game. It is just horrible. I barely get any seeds from my plants and blooming the plants is almost impossible because of all their special requirements. Too annoying to deal with.  7. The largest beef I have with this game is the fact that it almost forces you to look up a wiki, which I refuse to do. The crafting recipies are so ridiculous and the items are so random that guessing what they are is nearly impossible like knowing to combine a hell metal with obsidian to make an ingot. You would imagine that you could just smelt the metal but no, you must add the obsidian in order to craft it.  8. Another huge thing I dispise about this game is that 65% of the crafting recipies are worthless. People say there is so much to this game but most of it is copy and paste with a new skin and it is useless. It is nice to have a diverse background but when it consists of 65% of the game, then it is pointless.  Now before you are like 'you did not try the game out' 'you have the attention span of a 1 year old child' I tried the game out. I went through it and played a decent amount of time. I have seen a great chunk of it. It is okay to fight bosses, build a base, and play sim city but it is just missing a lot. I mean for crying out load, the bee and eye of cathulcabbage, forgot the name, have the same attack sound effect and attack strats. That is just lazy at its core. The eater of worlds is just a bigger worm, that I crushed only losing at max 80 health... really. The bosses are all push overs even with pathetic armour and weapons. It is just missing the diversity all people claim it has. I only got it to play with my bromines. Without them, I simply could not play the game as we compete and constantly raid each other's bases, there are regulations behind how to raid making it unique, thats a game on its own and way too long to describe.   Overall, 3.5/10
4702	0	a	Terriaria is a bad game because its gameplay is terrible, its sandblocks are bad, the world isn't big and so much more. I can't list all the bad this about this game because there is so much to hate about this game!

4704	0	a	not worth playing
4705	0	a	This game is boring. Don't buy it.
4706	0	a	Oh, where do I start. Obviously, like most game developers, they realized that having fast and cheap graphics flies nowadays. But these developers took after Minecraft a little bit more. They decided to make a carbon copy for the most part, but adding more stuff. Sure there is more features, and there is less to worry about in a 2D landscape instead of Minecraft's 3D landscape. I can make this simple that all the Developers were hoping for was that it would be more popular than Minecraft because it has more features and more to do after a while. And because they had put this game in front of the Console market and of course, The Steam Market, they cashed out very well. This game is not good in general, and most of you reading this review will hate me for saying that. The Developers got lucky with this and probably converted many of the Minecraft community into this. The Developers may claim this game was 'inspired' by Mojang's Masterpiece but I just hate to see a game that's a copy of another get popular. Bottomline, Personally I just see this as a terrible copy of Minecraft in the least. I do enjoy this game a bit, but I just can't seem to get the Minecraft copy out of my mind. So, I don't reccommend this game.
4707	0	a	its ok but when ur done doing everything u should uninstall because its boring after no replayability nono
4708	0	a	This game is just flat out boring :/
4709	0	a	Terrible game bought to play with cuzins and got bored in like 2 seconds but way better than minecraft
4710	0	a	my little brother has become stupid 10/10 ign for stupidity
4711	0	a	For the third installment of the black ops series i find this game highly offensive, nearly dropping all of the elements of a shooter and moving generally towards a sandbox rpg. 1/10 IGN
4712	0	a	I want to like this game. But every time I start enjoying it, it rips it all up with frustration and tedium. Unless you are ready to spend 100s of hours grinding, you love collecting useless crap, adore building elaborate structures for purely aesthetic reasons and you enjoy guesswork and trial-and-error gameplay, don't buy Terraria. Here are the main reasons I wouldn't recommend this game:  - You die all the time. Monsters, lava pits, random boss encounters, arbitrary unwanted Hard mode activation, you name it. - Dying and travelling back to where you died to collect your corpse takes about 1/3 of total game time. Even with rudimentary recall function, eventual mounts and buildable railway systems. - The sheer number of items in this game is insane. Most of them are just decorative or peripheral to gameplay. There is basically no info, context or explanation to guide meaningful choices. - Organising your items is a chore. It takes up another 1/3 of game time. There are practically no quality-of-life functions to streamline the experience. - The crafting system is tedious, with way too many crafting stations, no structure and trial-and-error recipes. - Having the unofficial Terraria Wiki on alt-tab is a must if you want any inkling of what you're doing. - When was the last time in a game where you had to repeatedly click the mouse button for every single swing of your sword? - The music is insufferable and the measly 3-4 tracks will drive you nuts within 10 minutes. - Graphics and animation are so bare-bones that half of the stuff is unrecognisable and the rest is just ugly. - Exploration of the randomly-generated worlds is genuinely entertaining. But that is what you do the least amount of time because of all the forced labor to get there.  If you like Minecraft and that sort of open-ended sandbox experience, you will probably find things to like about Terraria. If you are looking for decent RPG elements, any sort of semblance of a story or interesting characters, acceptable graphics, value your carpal tunnel and like to spend time doing fun things in games, this is not for you.
4713	0	a	The game progresses in a very linear way, so there is virtually no replayability. The combat is not good at all, and it takes hours of mining to get good enough things to fight a boss, and then you have to mine to get new things to fight the next boss, and it goes on and on. It gets to a point where you have to kill enemies over and over to get an incredibly rare drop to make something that gets you a bit stronger, so you can even attempt fighting the next boss. The building is not fun at all, because in 2D, it is extremely difficult to do. You will end up building a wooden box as a house. It gets boring (and annoying) very quickly.
4714	0	a	I have to say good game...  But at the start of the game exploring =no   If you do not handle frustration DONT GET!
4715	0	a	It's an ok game, but I find that it gets really boring quickly.
4716	0	a	I really wish I could actually get to enjoy and play this game.. I do.. But I've tried running this on my windows 7 pc and every time I load the game It's just a black screen with a map. No matter what I put my game setting to it's always just a black screen. My pc is more than capable of running this game, but for some reason.. something about this game or my pc doesn't want to cooperate and make sit unplayable.
4717	0	a	I'm 50/50 on this game so far. I dont like how I have to play it as an admin on my system which causes issues for my shared library with my kids on the same computer.   There looks to be no work around for this at the moment. :(
4718	0	a	THIS GAME SUCKS FRICKEN CRAP
4719	0	a	when i got out of my game my building i was working on disappears even thought it was on the mini map please fix this it happened after i got out of terraria when the load screen froze at saving world 100% and my inventory was the same as i finished it and my game had cloned some of my stuff i had in my inventory this is mac os computer
4720	0	a	Do you like grinding, do you like unicorns? I don't. No thanks.
4721	0	a	Very detailed 2D minecraft-sort-of-but-not-quite game. I'd totally recommend this, except I can't see what the crap I'm doing because everything is tiny, and the only way to fix this is to change your desktop resolution.
4722	0	a	SCREW THE CRAWLIPIEDS!!!!!!!!
4723	0	a	The game has much to offer. That is a fact. There are a ton of great aspects to the game including simply playability and lots of variety in gear and appearance. However MULTIPLAYER IS HORRIBLE!!! Especially at the end game content. THERE IS SO MUCH LAG ON EVERY SERVER HOSTED BY ANYONE AND EVERYONE!!!   Honestly that's the worst of the game aside from some content simply being overwhelming and the screen becomes so full the cursors are lost (why did they prevent us players from being able to SEE THE CURSOR WHEN THE SCREEN IS FULL OF FIGHT??!?!?!?!), traps are lost and death comes soon. Frost and Pumpkin moons are just death incarnate no matter the circumstance. Yes they are beatable and yes there is entertainment value in them. I cannot recommend this game for any price point above $5.   Oh and you might as well get super familiar with the wiki pages because the game is basically unplayable without them.   Hardcore mode on Expert worlds is absolute fun and an extreme challenge. That's probably the best part of the game; that one can go super easy mode and kill everything (until end game content then its just death or preparation) or one can go pure skill and cheese and try to survive as long as possible.  Overall 6/10. Add a better cursor (yes you can change the color but they use EVERY COLOR in the game) and sell this game for $5 or less or add a better multiplayer option this game gets a 10/10
4724	0	a	This is a cute game that gives you lots of freedom to do whatever you want, but I do not like it's UI at all. It feels like it may work well enough for a touch screen, but not keyboard and mouse. It doesn't have any story that I have seen but I didn't play it that much.
4725	0	a	missing exclucible wtf 
4726	0	a	haha copy of minecraft dont even play it dude
4727	0	a	Cannot play it due to fps issues
4728	0	a	-played the game -oh my god this is a minecraft clone  -went to write a review
4729	0	a	Made in ♥♥♥♥♥♥ technology (XNA and .NET Framework) doesn't work on most computers at all.
4730	0	a	This game, I guess might be fun for your 7 year old cousin, but this game is probably not good for any regular person over 11, I am currently in my teens and me and my mate got adicted to it! All was well and a week later we were saying that the game was, quite frankly, ♥♥♥♥. Sorry to all of you hardcore terraria fans out there and im sure there are some of you out there, I think I might just stick to my CS-GO and portal 2, of which this game does not compare.  We can see the potential for this game but we can never get past the facts that it will never blow up like games like minecraft witch it is obviously trying to be. Sorry but this game does not nearly reach my level of expextactions and hopefully will find its way into our novalty shelf of old games amongst the wand of gamelon and ET the video game.  All harmfull views aside terraria is acctially an ok game with a good processing speed and no major glitches to recall. And if you were thinking of getting this for your 8 year old son/daughter I would reccommend it and I say, go for it! Just do your 13+ year old children a favour and NEVER get them this game, unless of corse you want them immediatly talking about you behind your backs, saying to their mates, 'oi, my mum just got me terraria for christmas ROFL, ill get revenge next year by getting her minecraft!' Thanks for reading,  Tom McGill
4731	0	a	It's ♥♥♥♥. Why? That would spoil it. You'll just have to trust me.  -GawR

4733	0	a	Recently had made a world full of good things. Especially a chest full of goodies. After i quit the gam and got back on, It wouln't let me go back to that world and lost almost everything. All i have left is the things in my inventory.

4740	0	a	This is one of the best multilayer games that I have played but really? nobody does it legit everybody downloads maps and gets free items (I did that too) the game is way too long to actually complete it the proper way and it soooo hard to defeat the first boss without really good pre hard mode weapons like the nights edge. My advice... DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GAME IT IS JUST A RIP OFF OF MINECRAFT, IT DOES NOT DESERVE TO BE ON STEAM ANDIT COSTS WAY TOO MUCH.  X(
4741	0	a	I bought the game but it says a bunch of stuff that wont let me play ,and I re-install it and it wont work I demand refund pls (March ,15 ,2016) for all them haters YES i did fix it now leave me alone so i can play it

4761	0	a	it sucks 
4762	0	a	I haven't played this game much, but I don't really like it. Even though the concept seems kind of cool, the camera is way too far back. This is one of those games where everything is the size of a little icon.  I could see why people would like this game, as you get to explore, but this is a meh from me.
4763	0	a	Pls,this version keeps freezing and I can't even open it. Fix it pls. 
4764	0	a	i hate this game so much.
4765	0	a	When I added this game to my wishlist, I thought it might be interesting. And if you like Minecraft, then by all means, buy this game. If however, like me, you find it rather simplistic and boring then you'll want to give this game a pass.
4766	0	a	rocket racoon is in this game but you have to pay moey to playu him add me on steam if u want to knoow how to get for free
4767	0	a	WELL I CANT ENTER HARDMODE BECAUSE THE GUIDE IS DEAD SO I CANT ENTER HARDMODE WHY CANT YOU DO SOMETHING ELSE TO SUMMON WALL OF FLESH IT IS STUPID FIX IT
4768	0	a	Too many bugs ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off but if the game actually worked it was pretty good
4769	0	a	I guess its worth a dollar or two on ♥♥♥. 4/10
4770	0	a	So someone gifts me this game. Ok, I guess I'll give it a try.  I launch the game, start game, etc etc, and here I am sitting atop a 2D world of procedurally generated terrain. There's no instructions on how to do anything, so I'm stuck with an empty inventory, a giant world, and a companion that doesn't seem to be able to do anything.  In short, there was no tutorial or objective given, so apparently I was just supposed to run around and dig holes or something.  It's not that I don't understand the sandbox part of the game, since I have gmod and I understand making cool stuff on your own... but this game... this game is directionless.
4771	0	a	BRO TO REALLY PLAY THE TERRARIA U GOTTA BE THE TERRARIA
4772	0	a	Hard Mode ultimately ruined this game for me. For those who don't know, once summon the boss 'Wall of Flesh' and kill it, your world becomes plagued with one-shot enemies, frustrating bosses, and tedious grinding. Even after spending hours trying to get the best weapons and armor, enemies still do a fourth of my HP and healing items only heal a sixth every 20 seconds.  If your patience levels rival that of Jesus Christ, then maybe you'll be able to survive the unfair deaths and grinding.
4773	0	a	This game is really, really boring.
4774	0	a	Absence of controller support in windows - meh
4775	0	a	I want my money back to be honest. Bought this game just then since I used to play it on Xbox and me and my friend wanted to play it. Literally cannot join him. I only bought it so me and him can play it and I can't even do that much.
4776	0	a	♥♥♥♥ this game
4777	0	a	I've got my brightness setting on my monitor set on the highest setting, and I still cannot see a damn thing in the game when its at night. I thought the mobile version was too dark...with the PC version, I can't even see the zombie right in front of me.
4778	0	a	This game isnt minecraft WTF?????????????????
4779	0	a	At first it seemed fun, mining was not always accurate and getting started building things took some research on wiki's but that's fine. Then I saw what it took to get upgrades, how the crafting UI looked, how confining the game felt and I lost all motivation to continue.

4796	0	a	I have not been able to play for months, I bought it and it will not load. BS!
4797	0	a	This game is so horrible. I really can't believe why people would like this. Minecraft, the game which Terraria copied, is much more superior. The green slimes don't even do anything. The zombies are way too hard to beat. What kind of game is this? This sucks SO bad......  Cons of Terraria: I have played for 2 hours, figuring out what to do. What do I do? There should be a tutorial. This is a complete clone of Minecraft. Why the heck is it so dark at night time? The 'adventuristic' concept is unrealistic in this game. It's so bad, it doesn't even need a good computer!
4798	0	a	It would not let me play on the scond day. Waste of money if you ask me.

4801	0	a	Unlss you have a lot of time on your hands, this is not the game for you.  The gameplay is meh at best and you can't do anything unless you spend 5-6 hours getting a ♥♥♥♥ ton of materials to make all the ♥♥♥♥ to be able to do other ♥♥♥♥ to be able to do other ♥♥♥♥ and THEN stuff remotely intersting starts happening just because you have most of the items in the game at that point, which leaves you ith nothing to do but farm off of bosses over and over again.  Also, people are like 'I beat a super hard boss on my own! I must be so pro!' or 'I beat the chuthulu monsters and wall of flesh at the same time on my own!'. The bosses are reitavely difficult, i'll give them that, but all you have to do is find a glitch in the system, abuse it and have all the best weapons to kill them. There is no kind of skill or rewarding feeling in it. It's jus tlike: 'You abused a glitch! Good job you sad ♥♥♥♥!'  That is why I don't reccomend Terraria and LET THE HATE AND NON HELPFUL FEEDBACK TO KEEP IT OUT OF THE MAIN REVIEW PAGE COMMENCE!!
4802	0	a	Was killed by bunny 0/10 would not recommend
4803	0	a	Do you want to create you world and play multiplayer with your friends? To bad, to do it you need to be a tech savvy and expert on servers and internet communications protocols, after that just watch 3 hours of videos and tutorials about how to host a game and... well I bet you will still fail.
4804	0	a	IT Keeps FREEZING!! I can't play it!!!!!
4805	0	a	I was playing and i left the game and i randomly crashed.... so i checked my world and the name has changed to 'world' and everytime i would open it it would be a black screen.... WTFFFF am i expected to make a backup file? 80 HOURS GOOOOONE :(((((((
4806	0	a	  Too overwhelming. And with no tutorial... Not for me
4807	0	a	♥♥♥♥ you. ♥♥♥♥ all of this, ♥♥♥♥ red.   This game is fantastic! The core gameplay might get boring but challenging yourself to a different play style or just cheating in items and trying to defeat bosses with a stupid loadout or armor set, or even try and beat the final boss on the hard difficulty with the lowest amount of health possible (Somebody has actually done that), this game is fantastic.  However, I'd like to point out why I don't recommend this game.  ♥♥♥♥ THE ANGLER  ♥♥♥♥ HIM BEND HIM OVER AND LET A VERY LARGE ♥♥♥♥♥ ENTER HIS ♥♥♥. ♥♥♥♥ RANDOM DROPS  What's the angler? A little ♥♥♥♥ who never gives you what you want from him.  NPC's are easy, you get the money, you use the money to buy the thing you want. The angler? He randomly gives you ♥♥♥♥ after you give him fish. I get so frustrated at this little ♥♥♥♥ I ♥♥♥♥ing make traps for him just so he could fall down and I could laugh as he slowly suffocates to death.   There are also enemies that have random drops, and I tried to get a daedalous stormbow from a hallow mimic, which is a 1/4 chance, and it took me 14 tries just for him to give it to me. I gave this game up for months after the 12th try. I should also mention that spawning in a hallowed mimic is ♥♥♥♥ing hell. The game confuses you and tries to make you spawn in bosses on accident. Here's a list of bosses that an average player might spawn in on accident:   Eye of cthulhu (The tooltip on the SLE does not mention that it spawns in this boss)  Skeletron (The old man does not mention that the curse option spawns in skeletron) Slime King (Killing too many slimes in the raining slimes event triggers him without warning)  Eater of worlds/Brain of cthulhu (The guide tells you to break the orbs, but does not tell you that breaking 3 triggers the BoC/EoW)  Wall of Flesh (Nothing mentions that the voodoo demons drop the guide doll, and if you kill a voodoo demon hovering over lava and you aren't aware of this fact, you will not be prepared to fight the WoF)  Golem (You are given plenty of his spawners, however most players aren't aware that using them will spawn in golem)  Martial Madness (This is more of an event, and not a boss, however most players aren't aware that letting the probe escape, which will inevitably happen for someone who doesn't know what the probe does, will trigger this event.  Duke Fishron (You might get an ocean fishing quest and have a truffle worm in your inventory. Use your imagination)  Lunatic Cultist (The first instinct a player will get when seeing the worshippers is to kill them, use your imagination)   All of these have happened to me. ALL OF THEM.   Alright, one more thing to toss up about terraria: The cellphone. The cellphone cannot be built without using wikipedia, ENOUGH SAID. The Cellphone is incredibly useful, so it should be hard to get right? Nope, you just have to be lucky. You have to be lucky that an enemy will give you a 1/100 chance drop, you have to be lucky for the angler to give you all of the required items in less than one hundred quests, you have to be lucky. I couldn't get the last item for the cellphone, so you know what I did? I ♥♥♥♥ing cheated it in.   I felt so unrewarded I went out and deleted the cellphone, which took me hundreds of hours to get. I got all of the required items in 10 hours, the rest of those hours was the angler being a piece of ♥♥♥♥. From now on, I'm cheating in ALL of the angler items because they're all ♥♥♥♥ing useless anyway, and I'll tell you why.  1. The first item tells you what moon phase it is. This is only helpful if you have a wikipedia page open about moon phases 2. The second item tells you the weather, even though the weather only minorly effects things.  3. The third item tells you your fishing power. I always add up my fishing power, I know how much fishing power I have at all times. This item is useless for me and is only slightly helpful for items that don't tell you how much fishing power they add.   And I'm not exaggerating, it took me hundreds of hours. ALL IN ALL: If you're a completionist, over achiever, or control freak, don't buy this game.  If you're a normal person, why the ♥♥♥♥ not? It's 10 bucks and it's ♥♥♥♥ing worth it. The game has a slow start but things get very fast in hardmode.
4808	0	a	I've honestly tried getting into this game numerous times, but failed every time. I just don't find it fun. At all. You have better games to spend your time and money on.
4809	0	a	I find my self getting really bored playing this game. If you like to craft thing's mine thing's, I guess it's a game for you I find it confusing and a total waist of time, it pretty much looks like some thing form the 80s. nothing wrong with that So ive only played a short time ill collect my cards and erase it, If you get it on sale maby worth $2.99 but it's not a $10 game my opinion .. Yeah i'm going to get alot of hate from my opinion but's it's mine.. Not a game for me..

4816	0	a	This Game Wasn't That Enjoyable In My Opinion, I got It To Play With My Friend But Quickly I Realized The Game Was Boring to The Fullest Extent. I Think The Reason Why I Didn't Like It Becuae It's NOTHING Like Minecraft, That's A WAY Better Game In My Opinion, Alot More Than 2D, Its 3D. I Wouldn't Recommend This Game Thgo

4823	0	a	Terreria is a fun monster-fighting, exploring, survival game, riddled with peril and adventure!  Unfortunately, I cannot reccomend this game.  Why, you ask? As I said above, the game is quite fun. I shall go into detail on the game.   -----Gameplay-----  The gameplay is quite fun, filled with crazy fighting against crazier, random monsters. The object of the game is to survive, and build a villiage, to attract the townspeople.  However, the game wears itself out. At first, the game is a bit slow, due to the fact that navigating the rugged terrain is a nightmare with starting equipment. After a while, you start to pick up steam, get better equipment, when suddenly, the realization hits -- You are playing to get the next set of equipment. That is all it eventually adds up too, grinding for the next tier.  4/10 -----Controls-----  The controls are a bit clunky, due to the side-scrolling nature. This isn't that much of a problem, except on difficult terrain, which makes it a nightmare to go anywhere without falling into a pit of zombies. This is especially true down in caves.  However, the perils add to the fun, to an extent -- then you get tired of falling further into the cave with no way out.  7/10 -----Graphics-----  The pixalated graphics are very fun, and the monsters are a hoot to fight. They reflect the light mood of the game, although some effects are kind of gruesome.  9.5/10  -----Overall-----  Like I said, the game is enjoyable, until the grinding starts. I got the game for %70 off, so I feel like I didn't waste any money.  Sadly, I do not recommend, except on sale.  5/10

4859	0	a	The most ♥♥♥♥ing insanely boring and biggest waste of time game I have ever played. It is a 2D Minecraft with more items. Once you beat the story for the first time which is extremely quick and easy the game is boring. Cannot believe I spend 20 hours on this game.
4860	0	a	many months later this game still doesn't have boats i rate 0/10
4861	0	a	Great game, enjoyed it.
4862	0	a	The whole 2D aspect of the game doesn't really spark my interest, so when I launched it and got into the world, I was bored after a couple of minutes. I can see why this game would be fun towards much younger audiences, but it doesn't awe or amaze me to any degree.
4863	0	a	i would rather shoot up my family then play this game.
4864	0	a	The gameplay is fun, and challenging, but it's no fun building up a large game file and then losing it the next time you turn on your computer.  This game has a nasty glitch that deletes your game files, seemingly at random. Although, I'm not sure if it's the game itself or Steam's synching mechanism because it seems to happen when I have to log back in.  Either way, it wasn't a good introduction to this site and frankly $3.00 (on sale) isn't enough to keep me invested.  Also, they try to say you can set up a link account to a third party server to backup your gamefiles or something, but, honestly, what's the point? If the game doesn't work internally or on the site, it's just a bad product!
4865	0	a	ReLogic YOU BETTER LISTEN! My world disappeared with my meowmere, vampire knives, ufo mount, bone key, and every other important item to me. Not to mention that i put all my important items in chests because my character disapears, and i lose everything in my inventory. on a scale of one to ten 0. 0 STARS. I HATE YOU RELOGIC. I WILL BE TELLING MY FRIENDS ABOUT THIS SORRY EXCUSE FOR A GAME. AND I WILL BE PLAYING A MUCH BETTER GAME G MOD, CUZ GMOD DOESN'T LET ME LOSE MY GOOD PROGRESS

4872	0	a	I LOVED THE GAME I still do but when i was playing on a world with my friend after spending hours building we crashed and when i got back on the word was gone(corrupted) THEN i was ok i decided i will make another world for me and my friend then after getting back to the same point of hours and stuff it crashed....the world was gone againcorrupted IT HAPPEND 2 TIMES. dont get me wrong this game is a master peice but i dont trust it with my hours of work and grinding anymore thus im probably never going to play it again. On the other hand if it never corrupts you its the best game ever...
4873	0	a	This game sucks!             Nah this game is better than minecraft ;). This game rocks if you like Adventure. I miss clicked the thumbs down button. Terraria isn't 2d Minecraft and even though I only have like 22 hours on record I first started playing the pocket version and spent 100s of hours on that so yeah...
4874	0	a	i feel like this is one of those games where you cant just play for long periods of time
4875	0	a	What the ♥♥♥♥ did you just ♥♥♥♥ing say about me, you little ♥♥♥♥♥? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the ♥♥♥♥ out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my ♥♥♥♥ing words. You think you can get away with saying that ♥♥♥♥ to me over the Internet? Think again, ♥♥♥♥er. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re ♥♥♥♥ing dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ♥♥♥ off the face of the continent, you little ♥♥♥♥. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your ♥♥♥♥ing tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ idiot. I will ♥♥♥♥ fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re ♥♥♥♥ing dead, kiddo.

4879	0	a	Want a game which is essentially a 2D Minecraft? Then maybe Terraria is for you.  This statement will make a lot of people angry; you might say “Terraria is nothing like Minecraft, or “Terraria is about gathering items and fighting monsters and maybe “they aren’t even comparable. I’ve discovered the reason why many of you will be thinking like this, and it’s a very clever trick from the developers of Terraria.  After the “developers of Terraria successfully converted 3D Minecraft to 2D Minecraft, they realised that everyone will know that the game is a copy. In order to hide this, they changed up some of the sprites and items in the game. For example, the dirt block looks slightly different in Terraria than it does in Minecraft. This is done to give the illusion that Terraria is actually a different game.   Now here is what I don’t understand, why would you want to make a copy of a game which already sucks? Minecraft is clearly a kids game, it’s very similar to Lego (except you are building stuff on a computer) and the graphics are just absolutely terrible. I’d also like to mention that Minecraft claims to be a survival game, yet it is one of the most unrealistic games I’ve ever played in my life.  Please don’t get Terraria, all they did was put Minecraft through a “3D to 2D Converter and just waited for the game to finish converting. Sure, they changed some sprites here and there, but deep down the two games are nearly identical.  Avoid both of them at all costs.
4880	0	a	CAN YOU BAN ALL SERVERS THAT GIVE FREE ITEMS CAUsE WHEN YOU FIND OUT THAT YOU CAN CHEAT ITEMS, PLAYING TERRARIA HAS NO PURPOSE I AM SOOO SAD THAT I CAN CHEAT I WISH I COULD ERASE MY MEMORY OF HOW TO CHEAT  
4881	0	a	THIS GAME HAS A ULTIMATE PROBLEM WITH MULTIPLAYER
4882	0	a	My main complaint would be that there is too much dlc in this pay to win fps horror game. In terraria, you are forced to do its uncreative storyline, killing ants on a small stage, and not allowed you to create anything on your own.  Only saving grace of the game would be the fact that I recovered from autism shortly after installing it  1/10 barely better than minecreeper
4883	0	a	I lost my character when i closed my computer and i think he is corrupt becasue it shows his character name but its a blank picture and there no stats pls help me this is the only place i think i can get help everything else hasnt worked

4890	0	a	I'll be frank: Terraria frightens me. Not because of anything that would conventionaally scare someone, like creepy atmosphere or startling enemies. Terraria frightens me because of the mind-boggling amount of content.  And that's not a backhanded compliment. It's genuinely disturbing how many things are in this game, and even more disturbing how few of them are original ideas. The wiki is bloated and often self-contradictory because the unbelievable volume of enemies, bosses, biomes, and items - oh dear god the items - make it impossible to keep updated. Redigit - the man I am given to understand leads development - has a penchant for adding things to the game that he recently saw somewhere else. The Crimson biome, for instance, apparently showed up right after Redigit saw 'The Red Weed', a theatrical performance based on 'War of the Worlds'. More recently - and more blatantly - Redigit added an entire new weapon class - yoyos. The kicker? Many of them are exact likenesses of yoyos made by One Drop - and One Drop has even agreed to manufacture a real version of a yoyo Redigit programmed to drop from Terraria's final boss. Of course it doesn't stop there. I would bet money that literally 50% or more of the items in Terraria are references or direct ripoffs of things in other media. The SDMG - Space Dolphin Machine Gun - references the game 'Edge of Space'. Costumes galore parody popular culture - including, ironically enough, other, better games.  Moving on from the unoriginal nature of the vast and overwhelming content we rapidly encounter another problem: Difficulty. The difficulty curve, to be exact. It's backwards. I'm not exaggerating here. No matter how much the enemies are buffed or replaced with smarter, more dangerous versions the game only gets easier. And it gets a LOT easier, considering how asinine the game can be early on. Enemies that belong in the endgame randomly float though walls while low-level players are desperately mining in hopes of crafting marginally better armor and weapons. Yet as soon as they have defeated Skeletron Prime the game becomes a cakewalk. Even the final boss - an eldritch horror that makes the whole screen shake and go gray - can be farmed on Expert mode with the right equipment.  Even on a smaller level the balance is wonky all over the place. Ex 1: The game has eight basic ores in four tiers, with each world choosing one of two four times to get a semirandom assortment upon being generated. The problem? One set of ores is slightly better. A world can generate with a tier-2 ore, for example, just as useful as - or even more than - the tier 3 ore, despite being twice as common and half as valuable. Lead and Silver: Lead has significantly more applications, and is more common than Silver; yet Lead armor is just as strong as Silver, and Lead weapons just as powerful. Silver is effectively useless, especially since it is harder to find. If these ores happen to generate in the same world, the player is effectively left without a tier-3 ore and has to exert much more effort to make better gear by finding the significantly rarer Gold or Platinum. Ex 2: Three main styles of combat exist: Melee, Ranged, and Arcane. While swords and bows are easy to craft and use immediately, early-game magic weapons were unheard-of until update 1.2, which added Staves. Even now these staves are poorly balanced - early on, mana doesn't regenerate as fast as the staves seem to think they should - and inordinately difficult to craft, with each staff requiring a lot of a different, specific, and largely arbitrary gemstone the player has no garauntee of finding.  I could go on for days about the myriad flaws and highly questionable design choices that make Terraria poorly-balanced, buggy, and bloated - the frustration of characters' snail-like default speed, the suicidal stupidity of the NPCs, the arbitrarily low drop rates of desirable items - but I want to keep this review readable.  Terraria was once a joyful adventure through a fantastical 2D retro pixel land, with exciting and original ideas. I would reccommend that game - seriously, if you can find a version before 1.2, play that. But the Terraria on Steam today is an unoriginal, overinflated, glitchy, unbalanced mess. If someone gifts it to you, by all means play it up to the Wall of Flesh. But don't bother playing past that, and certainly don't spend any money on it.

If you play this just to let you know back in 1980s there was a mario game, would really love you all to play it first and compare both because, holy ♥♥♥♥ the graphics are real.
4894	0	a	Doesn`t appear to have a functioning set of controls for left-handed people who bought the game. Does not appear to allow Controller suppport. Thus, It cant be played by this customer as a game should allow. It also has a rancid community with a Mod who appears unblalanced mentally and socially. Avoid the forums like the plague if you the controls refuse to re-map; or you will be attacked, and then given a lifetime ban by an abuser supporter.

4901	0	a	I've played it. Quality game. best game i've ever dun diddily playedd
4902	0	a	I'm not giving it a thumbs down because it reminds me of Minecraft .. but rather, the game itself has several issues.  In order to even play with someone else... you have to do ALL kinds of coding. Like, knowing their server's number along with digits. Then you have to type the password in to unlock entering their world. The worst offender is that usually you can't connect because the servers are bad.  Playing by yourself is alright, but some of the enemies will be to much of a hassle in dealing with. They can even phase through the floor and hurt you badly. I didn't enjoy this to much.
4903	0	a	Got this game off a sale. Never played a sandbox game before so I decided to give it a try, and here is my impression:  I learnt that in a sandbox game, you would have to collect blocks (in this case via mining) and then put these raw blocks together to make a shelters, platforms and the likes. While there is absolutely no need to, you could also upgrade these buillding blocks by refining or even mixing different types together to make your structures look better.  At the start, it is pretty overwhelming in the sense that there are so many places to explore, different mobs to fight, and also multiple seemingly random events that would happen. Thankfully, there is a kind NPC named The Guide who points you in the direction on what you should focus on next. Soon you find yourself facing the first boss and this keeps you interested in the game as you prepare for the future bosses, crafting stronger weapons and exploring further and deeper.  This game called to my inner OCD, and eventually I find myself clocking a total of 52 hours in gameplay. And here's the twist: I don't even like the genre. Yes, this game isn't for me, but being able to suck me in for ~50 hours says something about it. Afterall, it is one of the best of its genre (97% positive reviews) and I'm glad I tried it.  Overall, I choose not to recommend this game. The pushing factor being that if anyone were to read this review, it would be people on my friend list, and majority of them would not enjoy the genre either. However, like all my reviews, I will end with my presonal rating:  6.5/10
4904	0	a	This game sucks. It is over-rated and over-hyped.

4909	0	a	Ripe from the time period where every indie developer could make it big by shipping a game that looks just as terrible as castlevania from the nes with one fourth the challenge and depth.

4913	0	a	this game is probably the worst game i may have ever encountered in my life. it just makes me want to take off my pants and sit down in a nice warm chair, only for an autistic kid to walk in the room and give me a nice long good speech about how the korean war was just a setup by cubans. after the speach the kid will take a nice cold glass of milk and proceed to spill it in my lap
4914	0	a	I played this for 18 minutes and never before have I so desperately wanted to commit genocide. 2/10
4915	0	a	Will change reveiw if multiplayer is easyer
4916	0	a	Game looks good, but for me the problem is that I've played Starbound, and comared to it Terraria is very boring.
4917	0	a	This isn't mine craft tf
4918	0	a	As much as everybody around loves Terraria, I don't. The game is boring and pointless, doesn't really show anything new. If you want to buy it, do it when it's on a 90% sale, at least you'll have a free game for your library.
4919	0	a	it was fun at first but slowly and slowly and slowly and slowly over time i started to hate it it faded from 100 hours a week to 0 a year
4920	0	a	Ignore the time spent playing. which for some reason is completely misrepresented, possibly due to a bug. I've played countless hours between the PC version and the Xbox 360 port, and I can say, with vindication, that Terraria is not so much a game as it is a petty time-sink.  Terraria was not inspired by Minecraft. It *is* Minecraft - Minecraft as presented in a two-dimensional space and rendered with sprites. Minecraft is intensely popular, so it stands to reason that this game - which doesn't even really attempt to conceal the fact that it's a blatant copy - is unreasonably popular as well. This game is loved by 12 year olds everywhere, and it's already sold its thousands upon thousands of dollars' worth of copies. But for those few of us 'traditional' gamers who are left sitting on the fence, wondering if this critically-acclaimed Minecraft-esque 'sandbox' might not be so bad after all, take it from me: it's bad. It's very, very bad.  Now, why would I say this while claiming I've played the game for an obscene amount of time? The answer is easy. Games like this are built for the 'grind' - they're constructed for the sole purpose of wasting your life to artificially pad their own extreme lack of depth. If I've played this game, say, 72 hours, then I can say without hesitation that 50 of those hours were spent holding down a directional input and the 'use item' key, watching my character loop a pickaxe swing animation over and over and over again, and waiting.   Strip out this facet of the game, the whole concept of 'mining,' and more than half of the experience is moot - the other half is holding the use item key and bumping yourself into barely-animating 'monsters,' hoping to 'out-DPS' them with your better numbers before they do the same to you. No wonder today's 'gamers' are so enamored with this one. It requires extremely little thought. In lieu of tired-old RPG stat-based mechanics, we have tired, old RPG gear-based number mechanics. The imperative is to grind enough randomly-distributed materials to get palette swapped items with bigger numbers. That's it.  The game wishes to appeal to our innate love for exploration, which is a noble goal, but ultimately it fails in execution. The worlds are randomly generated, but this merely boils down to 'hidden rooms with treasure chests can be here, here, or HERE.' No elaborate, sprawling underground ruins, no crumbling catacombs, no abandoned villages: just a bunch of differently-colored blocks of dirt with scattered structures that serve as an excuse to hold candy-bag treasure chests. Sometimes, the accessories found in these chests hint at fun, and the game toys with the concept of breaking its own rules with double-jumps, rocket boots, and other gravity-defying trinkets, but the game never transcends its one-button aspirations.  A major flaw rests in the core design of the game. The two primary difficulties are both...wrong. The easiest makes it so that you lose only money on death, which was of only minimal use to begin with. With no other penalty for dying, many players just dump their money in a chest, go grind up a bunch of stuff, then throw themselves into the lava to teleport back home, which neuters the game completely and strips it of any challenge or depth. Then the 'mediumcore' mode sees you drop absolutely everything on death, which gives failure the necessary gravitas, but at the same time it makes the game's constant, endless enemy spawns and cheap one-hit deaths stand out as the extreme flaws that they are. Technically the 'you're dead forever' hardcore mode doesn't really count, because your progress is tied to your gear anyway, not your character. If you lose your gear, it's a long, slow trek back to where you were, which often proves next to impossible without help as your mobility is savaged without all those above mentioned accessories, and your character is mauled to death by the weakest of enemies regardless of your own experience with the game. As a straight numbers experience, without your gear, you are essentially dead meat trying to get your stuff back.  For example, have fun getting killed over and over again by the 'King Slime,' a boss that can spawn at random, who will instantly teleport right on top of you and one-shot your freshly respawned, equipment-less character. That's right, he teleports right on top of you, and your starting character is too slow to do anything about it. Either de-log from the game, and lose all of your dropped stuff forever, or tough it out and wait until the boss despawns thirty minutes later. What's not to love about watching your character die and respawn endlessly for a half an hour? Stuff like this shows that the devs really don't bother to analyze some of their ideas at length before just implementing them into the game.  With nothing bridging the gap between 'so easy the entire experience is easily-abused and utterly moot' and 'so frustrating that this game is not worth the increase in blood pressure,' I cannot in good faith recommend it.  On the positive side, the game is very, very good looking. Its deceptively simple sprite art is charming, and the lighting is quite good, especially when outdoors and in the rain. And it's always thrilling to tap a water reservoir and watch a cascade go spilling down a shaft into the caverns below. Occasionally finding a new item that actually changes the way your character interacts with the world is a momentary thrill that fades when you go back to mining the same old dirt tiles five minutes later, in the exact same way you've been doing it for the past 10 hours or so.  It should be mentioned before closing that the game's interface is terrible on the PC version, and, inexplicably, the console version's is infinitely superior. One would think the opposite should be true for this sort of game. Accessing, organzing, and swapping your items is a massive pain and almost impossible to do properly under stress. The keyboard controls for movement are horrible and suffer from noticeable lag - acrobatic feats with the grappling hook, easy enough to pull off with some practice on the console, are next to impossible on the PC version. Ranged weapons are a nightmare to aim, as the best you can do is to point in the general direction of your target - aiming with the regular cursor - and click. And again - that grappling hook! Same mechanic - point in the general direction and click, and hope the game registers the direction properly.  Way too many flaws, way too little effort to elevate itself beyond its Minecraft-aping roots. I would recommend it for its occasional thrills of sort-of-discovey, but only at a deep discount. Even at its modest initial asking price of $10, it's too expensive for a game in which the majority of your time is, inevitably, spent hammering away at rock walls. Which is what you're going to feel like doing with your head in real life with every one of this game's abundant flaws and cheap deaths.
4921	0	a	This game has a niche audience, and if you're not in that audience, you won't like the game. I couldn't figure out the controls - not because I was confused about what to do, but because I had to constantly fight enemies away because they would just gravitate towards me when I was just minding my own business. Don't get me started on the vultures. ♥♥♥♥ those things.  If you want a 2D Minecraft-esque game, go for it. If you don't like fighting off tons of enemies all at one time, don't go for it. Seriously.
4922	0	a	A good first gen 2d sandbox. Lots to do and plenty of replay value. The developer is the biggest turnoff.  He puts out fluff updates with lame filler content such as reskins and renames of the same monsters, ores, etc. and then of course everyone praises him for doing so.  He should have given us more customization power when hosting. More server side options like controlling world seeding, mob and item spawning, spawn permissions, block destruction permissions, etc. You could get a lot more custom gameplay out of the game after you've experienced it in vanilla if you could do this.  I would have recommended this game before but now that Starbound is about to be released I'll likely never log into Terraria again.   Starbound has lots of the things I wanted to be implemented into Terraria but never were. E.g., ease of modding, better hosting controls, procedural generation, quests, in-game scripting, and so on.  Tiy might not be able to talk about Redigit or Terraria because of the NDA but it's pretty common knowledge that he left the Terraria dev team because Redigit is greedy and was stealing his ideas.   I've got 723 hours into Terraria, I think I'll get at least 3x that into Starbound.
4923	0	a	It isnt really fun its kind of a let down. 
4924	0	a	Dont play there is a jumpscare
4925	0	a	bought this game special to play online multiplayer and it just crashes and gets stuck at loading tiles. Waste of money and demand a refund.
4926	0	a	0/10 would not do a 3rd playthrough.
4927	0	a	no multiplayer from the start
4928	0	a	I understand my review, if read at all, will be downvoted to hell, but I feel the need to pass on my experience with this piece of garbage as a warning.  I picked up Terraria on a Steam Sale a while back for a couple bucks. I'll be honest, after hearing good things about the game I was excited to give it a shot.   Unfortunately...  No tutorials, bad UI, arbitrary deaths, and the worst crafting system I've ever had the misfortune of dealing with. If the game can't compel me to keep playing it in an hour, there's a problem.   I uninstalled and haven't looked back. I would be willing to pay money to get this ♥♥♥♥ removed from my library. 0/10, You'd be better off playing Minecraft, Trove, or Planet Explorers.
4929	0	a	This sentence is false.
4930	0	a	Waste of my shekels
4931	0	a	I bought this game during a sale at Christmas cos I had a little wallet money left over. Boy, am I glad I got it on sale. It starts off as a good premise, build a house and slowly build a village of NPCs while battling monsters and soon have a fictional village and world of your control, but it took me HOURS to build a basic hut (not least cos, if you play Starbound or Minecraft, a wall isn't a seperate item you need to craft). A week in, playing a few hours every night, I'd only just gotten four NPCs in my village and had taken out one boss simply to go underground (else Skull Guardians one-shot you. You need to kill the boss I did just to dig below a certain level). Every night, monsters would constantly attack me if I was outside (you can't skip to morning) and I once got three blood moons in a row (so three nights where zombies burst into homes and butchered everyone I had just collected). By then, I'd lost all will to carry on in game. Don't get me wrong, Minecraft is like that too but it takes longer before you feel miserably lost to work. In the end, I turned to a map editor to aid me with my problems (like Corruption/Crimson/Hallow, which spawn annoyingly strong enemies and leave massive chasms you need to cross). Not to mention, you can't swim in this game without certain items. Found this out when I jumped into a lake and nearly drowned trying to climb back out.  Terraria has good points, don't get me wrong. IF you can find a working server, then the community is insanely flooded with talent and you'll desire to make even grander designs to match the work of others. The game itself has good ideas, what with the vast collection of items and bosses, and allows customization on a level that Minecraft requires external software to achieve and most of the in-game jokes found (such as certain item descriptions or the tempermental female NPCs on a blood moon) are chuckle worthy. But, at the end of the day, the months of work, the sacrifice of a life required to achieve something so fruitless in game smothers these things.  If you've played Starbound or Minecraft and liked or loved those, only come here if you're ready to break your spine doing simple things. If you've not played either, this game is punishing all the same. Perfect for those obsessed with recreating New York in a videogame and those who love complex RPG systems, terrible for those who just want to have done with it or just wanna play a few hours.
4932	0	a	Game gives me cancer on PC, better on console.
4933	0	a	Decent game. Wasnt my favorite. Cant see myself playing it without a friend, didnt hold my attention for long. I did get it on sale though, so it was worth the small fee I paid.

4941	0	a	this game is very slow and boring!!!
4942	0	a	It's pretty fun. Love this game on android. Played it when it was a beta, but after having played starbound, I wanted to come back but can't cause its annoying as hell having to click like a mad man to attack.   I guess I've been spoiled by games like starbound and diablo that you can just hold a click and keep attacking.  I recommend starbound, though.
4943	0	a	Touted as 'action packed', I found Terraria got boring quite quickly. Too much of a grind, not enough early game reward to keep you motivated. Interface was a bit clunky, and I lost interest in switching items very fast. Not a bad idea, but could have done with more motivation and purpose.

4953	0	a	Add MAC please
4954	0	a	It's really unfortunate. It did not occur to me that a game that is clearly designed with the controls of classic 8 &amp; 16-bit platformers in mind, still doesn't have gamepad functionality. Especcially given the successful console versions.  For many people, this isn't an issue. I, however, have been unable to enjoy playing this game with a keyboard and mouse. Several third-party solutions later, and I still found the experience highly frustrating. I spent hours trying to get into it, but I never managed to transcend the controls.   Which is a shame; there's a genuinely lovely game here.  If such things do not bother you, then there's a lot to like about Terreria. As it stands, however, I cannot in good faith say that I enjoyed my time with the game.
4955	0	a	I would pay money for this game to not show up in my games list
4956	0	a	Its just so boring. And I like walking around getting loot, mining, crafting, et al. Cant understand why this is so highly rated. Had Steam offered refunds when I originally purchased I wouldve gotten one immediately.
4957	0	a	this game is autistic as heck, it's really bad, please don't buy this game.
4958	0	a	Boring piece of ♥♥♥♥ 2dimensional Minecraft.
4959	0	a	I think this really needs to be played with friends to be enjoyed. A bit too open world for me with little guidence and I felt like I was making no progress at all. Felt very repetitive and grindy as well.
4960	0	a	The game is alright, but it's a little boring for me. I don't feel like doing a multiplayer because I don't make a server for a friend.  I don't know what I wanted to do on Singleplayer. So yeah
4961	0	a	About as boring as minecraft except its 2D  Same gameplay mechanics as minecraft Same sprite based look like minecraft Same boring as minecraft.
4962	0	a	Any sort of hosting or playing on a multiplayer server is enraging
4963	0	a	I bought Terraria the day it was released. I was really into Minecraft so this was the next best thing. Terraria is really good - just not for me. The controls always felt wonky to me, and the universe is made up of a giant mess of different styles. They mix in everything from sci-fi alien guns to magic to basic primitive crafting and castles. It comes off weird.   Look, there is LOTS of game to be had here, I just don't like side-scrolling crafting games. I have also heard this being called a MetroidVania - which I assure you, it is not. There is not much of a storyline here.  Music is really good.

4973	0	a	This Game Sucks Xbox version is bad and pc version is bad.all that is holy dont buy this game all
4974	0	a	I bought this to play it with my friend because he recommended it and we were able to play it together the first day. The next day I got on to play with him again and it just sat there loading and never connected. I would recommend this game if your interested in a fun game to play alone but if your getting it to play with a friend then its not worth the time or frustration.
4975	0	a	To all the Game Developers who are making Terraria, I'd like to give my Honest opinion to this Horrible Game. Kudos to the Character Customisation, a 1/10 for my liking, however, I was playing with my Loving and Kind friends until I died every 5 seconds by Trees, Dogs and even Parrots. This Game is a Disgrace to Steam and should be Banned. Don't let this Minecraft-Copied game enter your lives, It will create Havoc to your Wonderful Lives. Definitely not worth paying $10 for.
4976	0	a	Thought this would be better than Minecraft. It is not. Bought a 4-Pack and didn't even give the last one.
4977	0	a	I just dont understand. What is the appeal of this game? You dont like all the freedom and user friendly interface of minecraft? You hate knowing what anything does? You hate playing with other people?  So i created a character and a world and poped in to start a play session. There was a guy walking around an some pots to my right. Video game insticts kicked in and I started destroying pots and getting stuff. From the moment I started the game there was a slow stream of slimes coming from the left side of the screen that I had to deal with. I press every button to figure out how to get to my inventory before just giving up. Then I hit escape and realize my inventory opens. What the ♥♥♥♥? Why did they think that was a good idea?? It also acts as the options screen as there is a small settings button in the bottom right corner that you probobly wont notice.  So I started looking at all the stuff from the pots when I started thinking, 'What am I supposed to be doing here?' I walked up to the guy that was walking around figuring he was there for a reason. After 5 minutes of fumbling around with him I figured out right click is the interaction button! Come to find out this guy is the tutorial. He has a handful of short messages that I guess are supposed to help you know what to do. Before I could finish reading all his stuff night came and a metric ton of floating eyes and zombies swarmed on me. You do so little damage to them and they kill you very very quickly. The eyes are also very hard to hit. So for about 15 minutes I would spawn, and die over and over until day came.  Then I decided to build a house. A staple for these types of game you would think. And thats when I realized. 'What the hell can you do with a 2d house? ♥♥♥♥ all is the answer to that question. After fighting with the interface to build a simple house I decided to start mining to see what I could get. The sprites are so small compared to you that it becomes frustrating to click all of the tiny crap so you can mine. Not to mention its hard to gauge the depth you are digging for stairs. In minecraft you know to dig 1 down because you can only jump 1 block high. Here however, you have no idea. My stairs ended up looking all deformed and messed up because screw trying to count each little sprite.  I then made a crafting table to try and craft something. I put one down and right click on it an nothing happens. After a while of fumbling about again I realize that you just stand next to it and the recipes show up in the player inventory screen. I just dont understand how people find this game entertaining in the least bit. Maybe they have never heard of minecraft?  After the crafting fun I start digging some more. A slime drops out of nowhere on my head and kills me.  I cant even bother trying this game again. It may get better after a few hundred hours and reading a bunch of guides but who the hell would want to do that? Ill just keep building massive cities and castles and going to the moon and messing with crazy mods in minecraft.
4978	0	a	Its like minecraft, but 10x worse, don't recommend what so ever
4979	0	a	Nope ....  This game is boring
4980	0	a	A game which is not in early access should not crash all the time after this 'new awesome update', before it was an awesome game though
4981	0	a	Easily one of the most boring experiences I've had and is very close to the worst game in my library.  The invintory is the bulkiest, most in the way, trash I've seen in a game. It doesn't go away either. The controls are so clunky that the closest thing I can compare them to is something out of the NES shovelware library or the dollar store electronic games section. All that content people like to talk about? You won't get to see any of that unless you've got days to spend swinging your starter pick at the most obnoxiously sized dirt/stone blocks.  And when I say the blocks are obnoxiously sized I mean it. Once you've mastered the moronic controls you will very quickly realize that single blocks are your biggest enemy.  So if you hate other parts of a game getting in the way of playing a game, don't like spending hours and hours looking at an ugly little man banging away at square turds for hours and hour for literally no gain whatsoever, and like it when your enemies don't extend past set pieces then save your time and money because this game has every one of those.
4982	0	a	  this game really sucks to be honest... I'm glad I picked it up for only $2 USD. This game is similar to minecraft but it's 2D and it has wayyy more things than minecraft.... well sorta.... I'd rather play minecraft then this piece of sh!t even tho I hate both.... This game is good for killing time.... It's so boring tho and so bad.... so many people say this game is a great sandbox and it is but it's just not what I expected.... It's really fake and hard when you come across one of those slime or zombie fu-ckers..... If you have like $20 in your steam accounts then just go ahead and buy terraria when it's on sale, but please don't buy it at full price..... But if your limited on money and your games then don't even bother with this game.... I honestly don't like it, overall I give this game a rating of   10/10...........Billion.
4983	0	a	Nope ....  This game is boring

4987	0	a	The game is supposedly quite fun to play with friends. All my friends have already stopped playing before I got a chance to try it. As a solo experience, I find that the game does a bad job introducing the game to you. I've tried to get into this game several different times on various different platforms but it has never managed to spark my interest.
4988	0	a	Its like minecraft, but 10x worse, don't recommend what so ever
4989	0	a	Boring, uninteresting, and downright confusing. These are only a few of the words I would use to describe the horrible and short experience that I had with this game. If you can figure out the awful crafting system, even then the game has nothing new or interesting to offer. Combat is terrible, crafting is like trying to steer a charging rhino, and the entertainment value could not be lower. I regret buying it everytime I see it in my library.
4990	0	a	i need this for MAC!!!!!!
4991	0	a	A game which is not in early access should not crash all the time after this 'new awesome update', before it was an awesome game though
4992	0	a	I had more fun shaving my grandfather's back this morning than I did playing this stupid game. I really tried enjoying it but all I did was DIE DIE DIE!!! If being slain by demon eyes and buzzards over and over again because the only weapons provided for you are a pick axe, useless dagger, and a shovel that take out 1 point damage every 10 hits, then by all means, play the game! But I would not waste my time if I were you.
4993	0	a	I found a pink slime once. I thought it was just a normal slime, some hits and its down. It ended up killing me. You shouldn't play this game unless the most cute and innocent-looking slime should kill you.
4994	0	a	Keeps crashing, can't even play with the 1.3 update.
4995	0	a	The developer already has my time and money, but I would get my money back if I could. The fact that it's 2015 and the game is hard limited to 1080p is insane. No other game I launch has this limitation, because it's stupid and has no reason to exist.  This developer is basically a bag of ♥♥♥♥♥, with some ♥♥♥♥♥ on the floor. Buy this game if you support developers who smell like a bag of old ♥♥♥♥♥.
4996	0	a	game like ♥♥♥♥,even worse than mountain
4997	0	a	this is a ♥♥♥♥ game it giltches out and i lost my character
4998	0	a	Terraria... yeah... it was ok... until Starbound came out... now it kinda sucks... 30/100
4999	0	a	Possible Waste of time and computer space. I couldn't even open it before it crashed. Help?
5000	0	a	It's a great game. Really. Sadly, i wasted money on it, thinking my buddies and I would get together and play every week or so, but it's just not one of those games. If you're hardcore you can go maybe 2-3 hours back to back doing singleplayer, but I would'nt recommend that either. If you want it, go for it. If you're still unsure, just don't. You can use that $10-$15 later.

5013	0	a	Not for everybody.
5014	0	a	To be honest, I'm not recommending this game based on my own likes of games. This game has nothing inherently wrong with it other than, if you're playing with friends, you can blow through everything the game has to offer in less than a week of playing for maybe 4 hour stretches of time. Some people consider that a good thing.   This game just isn't the style of game I like. That's completely my problem though. The game isn't bad, just not my style.
5015	0	a	The sad part is I read the reviews way before buying this game and the negative reviews were still positive messages. This will leave you with Misinformation and is really unfair for the consumer, so let me give you my real, albeit negative, opinion.  I started a few days ago and as impressed as I was, I now am just irritated with it's tediousness. If you enjoy Minecraft, mainly for it's creative fun, this is NOT the game for you can't just have fun with it, you must spend hundreds of hours to get a great stash and repeat hours and hours of stuff to complete a collection that transfers between worlds. I literaly had someone babysit me to teach me how to play because it was too immense. I spent 4 hours just building a bridge for the Wall of Flesh today and I don't intend on ever doing it again. The Wall of Flesh is a really mean boss at the bottom of the map who moves towards you and you cannot escape him, and to summon him was completely unkown until I asked for help. And after beating this wall of flesh, my house was destroyed because the game jumped into Hardmode and the starting night was an even that spawns enemies like crazy and when I got back home, it was over-taken by powerful and hardy creatures who killed a ton of NPCs. Minecraft may not hold your hand at all, but this game has a lot of nasty first-timer tricks and cruel jokes, suchas Ore that damages you or even spawns lava when it's mined.  If you're a creative person but can handle adventuring and long hours spent mining and farming, than this game for you, if you just want to design castles and dungeons, stay away, there is no creative/cheat mode for you here.
5016	0	a	Gave a try to Terraria as it was in the humble bundle and i wanted to know what the fuss was about - contrary to what the apologists say it is indeed a poor man's Minecraft. Same OC gameplay but with more timesinks, without the 3rd dimension which allows to construct actually interesting buildings and without code injection tools masked as levers and switches.  I do have a problem with figuring out the draw here. It boasts three million copies sold yet it's a game without a proper goal, with the building component rather lacking, some bad RPG-like progression mechanics; the aesthetics are nice but the style's now overused and has got the 'indie game with pixels #12' label all over it.   It's a constant grind that, compared to Minecraft, doesn't even reward you with the option of building something cool that you can post on the internets. I'm not a fan of Minecraft either so I completely understand that I'm not really the kind of gamer Terraria is supposed to appeal to. Would give it a neutral review but Steam doesn't allow it.  My suggestion is - if you're not a fan of Minecraft you're likely to appreciate Terraria even less so steer clear.
5017	0	a	I personally found the late game to be completely unenjoyable in Terraria, even when playing with a friend. There are simply too many items to keep track of and obtain let alone intuitively combine into new ones. The same happens with the combat, as an abundance of choice and general clunkyness made the game too frustrating to finish.  I'm told they're still adding content to the game to which my reply is the game does not need more content and it is obsessed with quantity over quality. If you do want to finish it I hope you like alt-tabbing to guides a lot.
5018	0	a	The start is just ridiculous. Way too many monsters with stupidly unbalanced power compared to player, and no reasonable tutorial makes this a death fest that in no way encourages people new to the genre to pick it up and enjoy.  Crafting is confusing, placing of objects is way too hard, UI is a mess. I gave up after two hours of chain dying on or near the spawn point. I guess I'll just wait for the stable upgrade for Starbound...   EDIT (to expand on previous and respond to some comments):  Chain dying is not the fun part for me, others may think differently. The fun part for me comes after you've checked the wiki pages, learned the basic ropes (no thanks to the game!). Then, and only then can you start incrementally learning how different things work. Repeatedly dying at the spawn point only teaches you to build a 'shed' at the spawn point. By that time I was getting 3-4 mobs at a time + one flying creature, and with the starter weapon there is no way to survive such attack waves.  Guess how the Starting Guide for Terraria (in the official? wiki) starts?  'If you're here then chances are you've begun playing and have wondered what you're supposed to be doing (and perhaps how to keep from dying).' I wonder where they got that from? Could it be that the game simply starts in a way that is way too brutal for those who simply have no idea what to do? Compare to eg. Starbound where you spawn at the ship when you die, so you can actually try to learn the interface without being constantly attacked by mobs. Where the quests teach you the basics incrementally, and leave the rest to be discovered.  I'm sure once people get the hang of it, Terraria becomes a fun sandbox. However, as I said, the start is too harsh, too unforgiving, and too difficult to approach without extra help. I guess I should have looked for a manual, and then read that to know everything there is to know.  Regardless of the dying aspect, the crafting interface is confusing: which part is the source, how many will be crafted, do I need to be close to the table, is the crafting menu context sensitive or not, what materials did I need for what, what can I actually craft, why would I want to craft something...  Placing of objects was simply ridiculous: even though I knew I wanted a door, and had a correct sized opening for it, getting the door into place seemed next to impossible. The best approach seemed to be to just wildly move the mouse pointer in the general area of where the door should be placed and hope for the best. Again, compare to Starbound where you simply place the cursor roughly in the correct place and the door snaps in place without sub-pixel placement requirements. The problems with door placement seemed to be present with table placement, camp fire placement, ...  As for UI being a mess, I meant that literally. Opening a chest places so much text on the screen as to make most of it unreadable as it overlaps the player's inventory text.  I'm sure there is a great game down there somewhere, but if the game is by design harsh for the first timers, then I'm glad to leave it to those who appreciate that sort of thing. I'd rather play something where I don't have to fight user interface idiocies or be killed repeatedly simply because the developers thought that would be fun. Luckily, there is no shortage of great quality games where the challenge is not the interface, and where I'm not punished for not already knowing everything there is to know about the game *before* I've even started.  Nevertheless, I want to thank all the commenters for their helpful insights, and their compassion. It's nice to know that those who can get past the rough start have a great community to play with.
5019	0	a	trhis game stole all my friends
5020	0	a	I'm a huge fan of Minecraft. I love 2D games as well. I thought I would love this. I just... didn't. I just could'nt get into it. I tried guys I really did, I'm sorry.
5021	0	a	♥♥♥♥ sucks worse than Olive Garden. 2 Breadsticks out of 10 Salads 
5022	0	a	after you get all the ♥♥♥♥ you wanted, it quickly becomes 'now what?' sure you can build ♥♥♥♥ everywhere but whats the point? im not the type that is going to try and make something great just to impress people i don't even know.   also the pvp is just garbage, even if you find a good challenge the fight is just lame anyway. This game really wasn't made for that ♥♥♥♥ to begin with.  i actually enjoyed the game at the very start where i had to be careful at every step but now with a powerful character i don't care about anything anymore including the game itself.
5023	0	a	do not download this game uner any circumstances, you will lose loved ones, you will lose pets, you will lose family members, income and the possibility of ever seeing the actual sun again. terraria becomes everything, it is all consuming and all knowing... the only reason to ever stop playing is so it can update.
5024	0	a	I find this game to be a tad on the boring side and a bit hard to pick up and play. I've had it for over a year and have never been able to commit myself to sitting down and playing it for more than 5 minutes at a time.  Overall, its a well-made game, but I find it rather bland. Starbound is way better if you're looking for a sidescolling minecraftlike.
5025	0	a	I did not do a lot research before buying this game. I saw the 'Overwhelmingly Positive' status and just assumed it was a great game. I started playing it and I got that Mincrafty feeling. I was expecting more of a puzzle platformer than a sandbox game. The game is too open ended and that makes it boring.
5026	0	a	It is a well done game but gets boring really quickly after you've done most of the things this game has to offer. I will not recommend this because only the first hours are fun, the next hours you would've got used to everything and yeah, have nothing to do. Plus the worlds are tiny, even when on the largest size, they aren't really big.  -I am not comparing this to Minecraft, as Minecraft sucks even more, and Terraria is a whole different game.-
5027	0	a	Play Length: Very brief. This is just an impression of the game, so take it with a grain of salt.  Positives: Some of the things I like about Minecraft, I like about this game. I like the lighting system, I like the feeling of exploring a deep cave and harvesting resources.   Negatives: I could call this game a rip-off of Minecraft, but that wouldn't be very constructive. Actually, a 2D version of Minecraft is an idea with a lot of potential. So let me talk about why I think Terraria doesn't harness this potential, and ultimately doesn't work.  For me, the biggest appeal of Minecraft is the idea of being able to freely alter a 3D environment. The fact that you can dig into the ground, and that your very exploration is shaping the earth around you... the idea that you can take the rescources you find and freely shape them into 3D structures. If Minecraft were just legos, that alone would be ground-breaking. But Minecraft is more than just legos, it's also an adventure and exploration game, and allows you to carve out a place in your own world.  The key to why this is so cool is the fact that Minecraft is in 3D. So the fact that Terraria is in 2D really neuters a lot of what makes Minecraft cool. It's not nearly as interesting to build structures in 2D. It's not nearly as interesting to carve out a cave in a 2D plane as you explore. But that's not to say that Terraria couldn't work well as a game... it just needed to find it's own path. And Terraria does try to be different... unfortunately, it mainly does so through combat. Terraria features a greater variety of monsters and bosses, much greater than Minecraft. The reason why this doesn't work well is because combat in Terraria is not particularly well refined. Combat was always the weakest aspect of Minecraft, and that carries over to Terraria. So placing a greater emphasis on this element seems like a mistake.   There's other things that bother me about Terraria. Graphics were never Minecraft's strong suit, but that's because the nature of the game engine necessitated simplistic graphics. That is not so for Terraria, and yet the graphics are still so rudimentary. I'm not asking for realism, but there is a real lack of charm to the art style that would have really helped the feel of the game.   The soundtrack is actually pretty decent. But nothing special. I think Minecraft's music is much better for this style of game... I love how it leaves you in silence most of the time, but every so often some beautiful music comes down from the heavens to accentuate what you're doing. It works amazingly well. Terraria's constant music doesn't work quite as well. This is one area where they actually probably should have copied Minecraft a bit more closely. Which is not to say that the music is bad, but it could have definitely been much better.  Overall: I can kind of see why some people like this game. But for me, the concept of a 2D Minecraft is still very untapped. Terraria borrows (or steals, depending on your slant) a lot from Minecraft, but it leaves behind the essence of what makes Minecraft an amazing game, without compensating with anything special of it's own.  About my rating system: I have two things I rate on. Overall score, and soundtrack. Personally, I feel like game soundtracks are tremendously undervalued; to me, it's a vital factor in getting me into the game. For the score, I grade on a scale of 1-10, and I try to grade in such a way that each number has a meaning and equal importance. The meaning of each number are as follows:  0: Garbage, 1: Awful, 2: Poor, 3: Underwhelming, 4: Mediocre, 5: Decent, 6: Good, 7: Great, 8: Excellent, 9: Phenomenal, 10: Masterpiece  Terraria's score:  Game Rating: 4 (Mediocre) Soundtrack Rating: 4 (Mediocre) 
5028	0	a	im sorry but out of all the games i have this is the most boring i cant stand this game theres so many games like it that are better i would never ever recommend this game to any one im sorry this is the truth i have this game trust me i know i really do hate it its all just rince and repeat. i have just put this here only to show my side of this game i wish i could retern it and get my money back i just really dont injoy its really not worth it for what it is. be sure to send me all the hate comments you want or if you agree with me make sure to let me know that u for taking the time to read this and have a nice day.

In fact, I feel like a lesser human being for owning this. Even the price tag of €2,49 during the sales is excessive and I would therefore not recommend this game under any circumstance.  Never.  Ever.

They left Terrarria and started work on their own game.  Starbound is like Terrarria but with an infinite amount of space and planets to explore as well as there being 100000x more things to do.  On it's own, I rate this game a 6/10. Its okay. Just barely above average when it comes to block-building games.

5043	0	a	Important: ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Gamerbros will hate and demean you for disliking the game.   Hardmode absolutely brutalizes new players with things they couldn't possibly anticipate and mobs that are stronger than most bosses you fought until that point. Oh and around that time randomly bosses spawn and kill you in your own base. So you can't even bunker yourself in during dangerous times like in Minecraft. Day/Night, there is enough that can kill you in a few hits in HM.  Unless you have a friend who can pull you through most of HM, prepare for a game that makes you wish you were playing Dark Souls instead.

5047	0	a	slightly better than shaq fu
5048	0	a	It had been forever since I'd played this game, and I just happened to see Sips streaming it, and it just got me in the mood to play some Terraria, remember all the fun I used to have, so I loaded the game up, went for some chieves, and it was just what I needed... to realize yet again why I like Starbound so much more, Terraria's got it's whole fluidity of completion, by which I mean, it's not as WIP as something like Starbound, but somehow it manages to be far worse.  Comparison between Terraria and Starbound: Prices T: $9.99 S: $14.99 Sure, Terraria's cheaper, but not by enough to make it favorable for that reason, but I do have to give it a point for pricing.  Gameplay: T: Terraria's gameplay is classic... for it's time. It was THE 2D sandbox game when it was popular, but now it's been vastly improved upon, making Terraria's mechanics somewhat outdated in comparrison, it's got the good ole' tested and true 'you just got dropped on your ♥♥♥ into a world you don't know, good luck' feature, and that's fun at first, but it gets old pretty fast, what sets Terraria apart here is your first homeless pal; the guide. That guy's there to help you on your way, and more NPCs to come once you do build a ♥♥♥♥ing Super 8 motel. The next thing about the gameplay other than your classic sandbox survival is that it has many various summonable bosses, and the world levels around you into the hallowed version, then you win and it's all been there done that, it has low replayability, or it WOULD per say, if you weren't able to go to a new world through, uh, the sheer meta-ness of it. With that feature you can go everywhere and see everything as much as you want. S: Starbound at first seems kinda like a rip of Terraria, 'your classic 2D sandbox survival, yada yada' until you actually make your character (more on that later though) and spawn in and realize hey, where is the world, and more importantly, where am I now? That's right, Starbound breaks the mold here and gets you into the world in a different way. At first you are on your absolutely wrecked spaceship, with nothing to go by but a few animated sprites on the wall for you to interact with, and well, a door, and that's all you see in your first moments, so naturally, you look for what you're menat to do, and end up finding the ship's AI, and it walks you through just a bit of where you're going to be getting started, it enables your matter manipulator, and your teleporter, and then it gives you an objective and you're off, you are finally dropped into your first world. So after your generic survival sandbox stuff, you find yourself completing more quests for your AI and realizing oh, wait, I'm on a space-ship, I can go to another world if I want! Opening up (eventually) the space exploration aspect of the game, which lets you progress even further until the point you gte some items for bosses, seeing some naturally generated structures, and even getting to the next tier of planet, and getting more ans stronger materials. It's overall pretty vast, and exploration heavy.  Modding capability T: OMFG dont even get me started, Terraria's modding community has never been spectacular, from what I've seen anyways, and the way the update was so random, no mods were updated yet, not that I expect that would have made this much better. S: Starbound's modding community is EXPLOSIVE, new races, new gameplay mechanics, new generation features, and more, every catagory seems to have mods waiting to be tried out in SCORES, it's honestly spectacular, and the community for Starbound's mods might even rival Minecraft or skyrim at some point, the community is ripe with this one! And that's me almost forgetting to mention that mods are easier to install on Starbound.  Character Creation: T: Terraria's character creation is really bland, and a bit difficult to navigate, the best thing about it is the ability to fiddle with the colors with variety, but that said, not ease. S: Starbound's character creation is better overall from point A: Race/Species You have a total of six vanilla races to choose from, and tons more from the modding community, the color options are more limited, but again the modding community comes in to help this, but I will admit it isn't 100% resolved. you can customize what you're character's starting clothes are, what they look like, even the pose they stand still in.  Honestly, if it comes down to it, don't get this game, save up the other five bucks to afford Starbound instead.

I can't recommend it for non-Minecraft fans, but if you like Minecraft, this is the equivalent on a smaller scale.  Is it a bad game? No. Is a good game? Most likely, I haven't played far into it. Is it a game that I like? No.

For those who enjoy this type of game, this and starbound are great additions to your game librarys.  Yet for entertainment I feel it just lacked the fun element FOR ME, as I just never understood it and thus couldn't enjoy it, that's why I do not recommend it.
5086	0	a	I didn't enjoy my time playing the game. I've spent more than the couple of hours listed on steam, as I've played it off of Steam, and am probably closer to somewhere around 10 or 20 hours total.  There is no goal to the game, besides exploration and getting stronger, which I struggle to find fulfilling. Part of the problem was how I started playing the game - playing with friends who had already gotten as strong as feasibly possible. That sucked the fun out of it for me, and I've never been able to get it back. Most of my time playing was spent hiding away from the strong monsters my friends had spawned, only able to hang around to participate in conversations.  Many others seem to enjoy it, but I do not. Maybe this should be taken as a warning to be careful how you approach the game and who you play with, but I personally don't recommend the game at all.  That, and the art is really... enh.
5087	0	a	Imagine a giant ♥♥♥♥♥ flying towards your mouth, and there's nothing you can do about it. And you're like 'Oh man, I'm gonna have to suck this thing', and you brace yourself to suck this giant ♥♥♥♥♥. But then, at the last moment, it changes trajectory and hits you in the eye. You think to yourself 'Well, at least I got that out of the way', but then the giant ♥♥♥♥♥ rears back and stabs your eye again, and again, and again. Eventually, this giant ♥♥♥♥♥ is penetrating your gray matter, and you begin to lose control of your motor skills. That's when the giant ♥♥♥♥♥ slaps you across the cheek, causing you to fall out of your chair. Unable to move and at your most vulnerable, the giant ♥♥♥♥♥ finally lodges itself in your ♥♥♥♥, where it rests uncomfortably for 4, maybe 5 hours. That's what Terraria is like.
5088	0	a	It feels like everyone but me loves this game. To me, it felt like a flash game that was suddenly for sale on steam. Maybe my opinion was tainted when the beta just used recolored final fantasy sprites for everything. I had a bit of fun with it at first, and then quickly became very very bored. Building a city- checking the wiki constantly to try to make villagers show up in it, mining out so far from your city that it takes forever to get back and forth, trying to figure out why a perfectly well lit sealed room in your city is suddenly full of monsters, all good times.  Maybe if I'd gotten past the first five or six hours I'd have a different opinion, as the promotional videos all look much more exciting than my experience, but I suppose showing the week spent digging holes for rocks to make stuff with wouldn't look as fun.
5089	0	a	How the ♥♥♥♥ did I play 67 hours of this. Help me please.
5090	0	a	You see, I have an odd relationship with this game. It was very fun at first (playing with friends in multiplayer, I can't stand single player) but it got old fairly fast. I found myself beating the game, getting bored and not playing until the next update, rinse and repeat. I feel this game is worth it when it's on sale, but I honestly cannot recommend this at it's full price. Maybe this is just me, and others will have a different experience, but I would advise holding off on buying unless it's on sale.  In conclusion, this game (for me) can be great fun, but ultimately has little replayability and can be beaten (Every boss) in about 10 hours.  Thanks for reading my review, and I hope someone can give me a reason to get back into the game, but I won't be playing it anymore if not.  (Sorry for my terrible formatting, this is one of 3 reviews I have written)
5091	0	a	IF YOU HAVE WINDOWS VISTA DON'T PURCHASE THIS GAME! I tried buying the game earlier, and if you have Windows Vista(A.K.A - The worst of all the windows products) it will not work! You cannot download several things you need in order to make the game run. I've never expirenced such a disapointment in my life. I got no support/help, I had to learn the hard way, and I cannot get my money back. If I'm wrong, someone please tell me how to fix this!
5092	0	a	With everyone else praising this game for everything it does its a rarity that someone critizies it. I can't say that I go for this game much, its the familiar setting of a mystical world filled with vicious creatures that want no more than to eat your insides while forcing you to watch, and thats great, however trying to present this in a 2D view is not ideal.  The enemies are easy to kill once you know how to do it and the items you can craft (tables, chairs, bowls. etc.) have no purpose other than to waste your resources.  Although this is supposed to be a (dare I say it) minecraft clone it centres on co-operative playing and helping one another out, when playing single player you sit there in a house made of stone and just wait, thats it, theres nothing more to this game when playing it alone. On the other hand when you're with others you build a castle, putting everyones collected resources into the building, you fill it with bowls and chairs and tables and then you basically just sit there in the castle and wait.  For the 2.5 hours of mind numbing boredom I endured with this game I would not pay more than what I did (£0.84) and I wouldn't advise any one else to.
5093	0	a	A game that requires me to watch tutorials and read the wiki page right off the bat is not a well made game. This game was recommended to me by a lot of friends, knowing me and my love for Minecraft they assumed it would be a great game for me to try. Not sorry to say, but I didn't like it. The UI is terrible, you have to craft an 'approved' house is silly, most of my time spent on this game was looking up what the hell I needed to do or craft... even how to build a house. Something so simple turned out to be a major headache. I'll eventually give this game another try when the bitter taste in my mouth from my dislike and frustration for this game is gone.
5094	0	a	This game is fun for 3 days, then you realize you've already done everything there is to do, been to the farthest left you can go and the farthest right. After you do that, shortly you'll collect all the gadgets have the highest tier set of armor and the realize 'wow, there is nothing more to do...'    No replay value whatsoever. Combat is awful when comparative to any other sandbox game like this. You'll lose every drive you had to play this game after a time peroid literally less than 3 days. This game is not hard to play, it's not fun afterwards, and you will be amazed at how quick you lose all interest in this game once you get the highest tier of armor on your first character. Unless you think you have fun doing the same thing over and over again, it's not worth it. Don't waste your time on this game, you will be so dissapointed in the end.   To add to Terraria's vast sea of negative features the multiplayer in this game is also pitiful. It takes ages to load worlds and maps, and half the time it crashes. It's only connection VIA IP, no servers. (though not a big deal on that one) and once you do get in a server connection issues are evident and just as unavoidable as smashing waves in high tide. And these waves will leave your sandcastle in ruin. Don't think you'll be able to easily play with your friends, because you won't. Connection issues will stop you. Game is easy to play through solo but rather hard to connect with friends and stay in a server long enough to have fun. If you are buying this game to play with your friends, simply buy another game. Wasting your time on Terraria's pathetic multiplayer will prove to be fruitless.  Want a simmilar game that you can get a lot more hours out of with better gameplay, combat, even storyline... and loads of customization along with randomized PLANETS instead of just randomized BIOMES... space travel, and 4 different races?  Try Starbound.
5095	0	a	Not sure why but this game bores me and quickly.
5096	0	a	I just couldn't get into it. the deeper I went, the more it seemed like I wasn't getting anything done in the game. depth is usually a good thing, but when I need 10 hours of grinding to make the slightest progress, I lose interest.
5097	0	a	Don't get me wrong.. This is a great game. Its polished and basically bug free. There is a ton of content in this game and plenty of places to explore, discover and fight.. But what makes this game undesirable for me is the Micromanaging.. When you start getting a stock pile things.. it becomes very tedious to organizing items and you start to get bored once you acquire the higher tier gear.
5098	0	a	As of right now, the game is unaccessible for many people including myself, if this is fixed then I would fully reccomend this game.
5099	0	a	As much as I LOVED this game for the first 20 hours with friends, I gets quite repetitive. I joined a random server where a guy filled my inventory with a bunch random crap. I went to me and my friends home world and too my suprise the stuff the guy gave me was in my inventory. At first I thought it was a glitch but after learning you can join a random server and get lot to transport to your world I saw that as a horrible idea. I finally realized where all the good stuff my friends where finding was coming from. This game is ok but can use some fixings.
5100	0	a	Run around and upgrade stuff, that's about it. Building is diffacult at best, and at times fustrating.  I am also not a fan of the 2d 8-bit like graphics. Also, one seems to end up running around for hours trying to find the one thing they need to craft the best items.

5103	0	a	This game had me hooked for a while, but I sadly stopped playing it. It seems that the developers don't care about this game anymore. I've lost all interest in playing it as there is nothing left for me to do in it. When you do buy it, be prepared to one day never play it again.
5104	0	a	Like a hand out a car window

5106	0	a	Now that the game actually works for 20 minutes at a time without crashing, I can render my true and informed opinion: I just don't find this game to be especially fun. The simplicity - the monotony, even - of its central game mechanic belies the complexity of the progression, on which matter the game itself offers no guidance. Scurrying back and forth to the wiki for reference is an irritation that has no part in a satisfying game.  Though combat was initially intriguing and satisfying, with some truly excellent sound design, the same limited control scheme that makes Terraria simple to learn simultaneously makes it trivial to master. As I understand it, in the endgame a wider variety of ranged weapons with unique utilities become available, but I have no desire to put in the dozens of hours it will take to get there.  Terraria is a game with a huge amount of content to explore. Unfortunately, exploring that content and reaping the rewards of extended play is tedious and extremely time-intensive. Furthermore, the unstructured nature of the sandbox makes it difficult to maintain any sense of purpose, momentum, or direction. Alone in a hostile, static world, I just feel crushed by the pointlessness of it all - though perhaps it's my own fault that I give in so easily to electronic nihilism. Perhaps sandboxes are just no longer my cup of tea.
5107	0	a	For whatever reason i could never get into terraria i even had trouble getting into this review. But my friends seem to like it so i guess it cant be that bad
5108	0	a	Many people will enjoy this game, since it offers many things Minecraft doesnt, however i was none of them. This has several reasons: * The graphics and the UI are bad. I could still live with the graphics, but i have never seen such a bad interface in my entire life! * I found the controls extremely unintuitive. This game feels like a platformer, just on an extreme scale, and i dont think PC is the right platform for that. I really had serious problems moving and fighting properly * There is no help for newcomers. I hate it to have to watch a couple of tutorial videos, just to know what i can and should do * Variety is very small. There is no campaign or story, (which you'll find and enjoy in other sandbox games like Craft the World, Planet Explorers), just endless play, and no character developement... * The translation is bad. Noticeable parts of the text havent been translated at all, or only sloppy * Crafting is a bit of a mess, since you need to stand in front of a production structure, to be able to use it. Additionaly, only those crafting receipies are shown, which can be crafted with the current ingredients in the inventory. Regarding that there are lots of different production structures, and that the inventory is small, this really gets annoying  Still, if you think you can live with all that, get it and you wont be disappointed...
5109	0	a	Many people liken this game to Minecraft. Personally, I find that freakin' hilarious. Kinda like when people compare a Lexus to a Saab, or meatballs to pizza. This game, TOTALLY unlike Minecraft, does NOT potentially consume half your harddrive with saves, map-files and other worthless, rëtardedly coded java-trash, which is possibly its only redeeming feature. And likewise, it gives you about as much content as it requires harddrive space, which renders THAT feature worthless. Sure, you can go down underground and search for random crap that'll basically just further emphasise what a worthless, pathetic excuse for a gear-whöre that you really are.  SUUUUURE you can try 'building' things. But does it really matter? Your NPC's sure as hell ain't gonna thank you for letting them live in a luxurious mansion instead of a crappy shanty. So, basically... this game is plain dumb and boring. That and the characters are all ugly as hell. 1.8/10
5110	0	a	please can you make Terraria on a macbook!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5111	0	a	Get Starbound instead.
5112	0	a	they fixed the multiplayer but my laptop meets the requirements yet on the hardcore boss fights and the golem temple area my fps drops to 1 and dosent go back up unless i restart my game to i cant progress anymore
5113	0	a	At first I was drawn into the game by the cute graphics that reminded me of the old SNES days, the very cheap price and two of my other friends owning it (But one just had it gifted to them and didn't want it). After some playing through the single-player portion (And a run-in with a very toxic and hostile online group, L6D's Community Server), this game just is not very fun. Not much direction on what to do in the single-player mode, and joining a new community puts you in a killzone where you are forced to be slaughtered four dozen times while community members tell you to go slit your wrists in real life.  I've came across some games before, that focus more on multi-player than single-player. That, to fully experience them, you have to play among friends or play online. Terraria is clearly one of those games.  Just it is not a very fun game. The only benefit is I spent only 2 bucks on this.
5114	0	a	Can't say I'd recommend, but it's fun from time to time.
5115	0	a	Quite the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game, I'm afraid. Decent for spending some lulzy old school, nostalgiafag time with friends. Not everyone's cup of tea. Especially not those who aren't into tedious menial tasks which end up feeling redundantly more challenging at higher levels. Or those utterly lacking a sense of direction; running out of clever ways to singlemindedly refuse getting stuck and dredge through to construct a virtual fantasy Peach's castle.
5116	0	a	I've purchased this game, my comp meets and exceeds system requirements, It crashes every time I try to open it, i have tried all the fixes me and my friends could think of with no progress, I have sent multiple e-mails to the support team with no response. I have played the game on a friend's comp and enjoy it but it is a waste of money to buy something that isn't supported in any way. Very Disappointed
5117	0	a	Worst $5 I've ever spent. Game has almost no originality or continuity. Game requires large amounts of outside research to understand and what's worse doesn't even make that journey fun. If this game interests you at all you'd be better of with Minecraft, Pixel Piracy, or Space Engineers. All games that have a great sandbox setup without all the things that ruin Terraria.
5118	0	a	DISCLAIMER: While it may seem I am a Minecraft fanboy, I am not. I dislike Minecraft more than I do this game, it's just Minecraft does what Terraria tries to do MUCH better.     It might have been that I went into this game with rather high expectations, but I did not have a very fun time with this game. The 2-D viewpoint, while charming at first, becomes a major annoyance after you begin to try and build things. Building things on a 2D world I instantly saw as difficult. While in Minecraft (which I will be comparing this game to a lot considering Terraria is essentially a 2D Minecraft clone.) it is easy and streamlined since you have all 3 dimensions. After building the best thing you can, a wooden box (not like you'd want to build anything more) you go to dig and find some minerals. Dear God where did I go so wrong. Digging in this game is horrendously difficult. In Minecraft I dig in a stairs sort of way so I don't fall into lava or down a steep drop. I assumed Terraria had random generated caves and whatnot as well, so I dug in a stair fashion. DO NOT EVER DO THAT. Since your character has some freakish way of not being able to move in certain spaces, causing digging down to be your only solution, causing you to inevitably fall to your death. After you manage to explore the bland 2D world, you aquire several various minerals. First thing you'll notice about the crafting menu is it's counter intuitive as balls. In most games where crafting is involved you get the recipes from the game itself. In games where you don't LIKE MINECRAFT, you get a set of boxes to mess around with and expiriment with. In Terraria you get a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who repeats the same couple of tips no matter how far you progress. SPEAKING OF PROGRESSION: there's no sense of it. This might just be me, but I get iron or something and make some tools. I then wander around aimlessly for 15 minutes and go play a good game like TF2. I feel no motivation to go and get more stuff. In Minecraft you can make your house interesting BECAUSE IT ISN'T IN THE FORMAT OF AN NES GAME. (Not to say this game is on par with masterpieces such as The Legend of Zelda and Super Mario Bros 3) I feel as if I have no purpose in this game and when I go to explore I instantly get ♥♥♥♥♥ by god knows what the hell it was. I have tried time and time again to explore the world to see if there's any redeeming qualities to this game but I continually die by the same mob. Maybe I just suck but I think that's a pretty big problem. The combat is boring, it consist of: hold A or D and click wherever the mob is. I bought this game a lot for the multiplayer, but they had to ♥♥♥♥ that up too. I have the same problem with Minecraft multiplayer as I do with this game, THE SERVERS. You have to recite the Ukrainian pledge of allegiance (does Ukraine have one of those?) backwards 40 times then solve theoretical physics, WITHOUT letting the Combine come through some portal thing and make Earth gay, THEN you have to write an entire game in C++ if you want to host your own server. I know I'm exaggerating, but if I want to play this mediocre game with my friend, I don't want to have to make an exception for it in my modem and figure out what my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ port is or whatever. NO. I don't want to do that. I know if I read a Wikipedia article on the subject matter like 5 times I might be able to barely scrape by, but you know what? Why don't you just take Left 4 Dead 2 as an example and MAKE DEDICATED SERVERS. No one wants to have to fish through some website to find a server someone already made, where you have no free will. MAKE DEDICATED SERVERS.    Overall, I would not reccomend getting this game. The charm of it wears off quickly and whatever it had working for it eventually becomes clunky and annoying. This game has been overhyped by many sources. I give it a final rating of 4/10. What it borrows from Minecraft it ruins. If you want a fun Sandbox building game, get Minecraft.   If you disagree with me feel free to tell me why and try and sway my opinion otherwise.
5119	0	a	Not being able to hold down the mouse button to attack was a real deal breaker for me. Otherwise it is an excellent game.

5121	0	a	Its a sandbox that tried to create much the same model as minecraft. It was basically just a 2-d version. I praise terraria for its wide diversity of gameplay, but at the same time I just don't know if i can recommend it, because in their development of the game, they forgot what the genre of block/survival REALLY is about. And that is about beauty and creativity. Down the road of development they seem to have left that behind, and it dissapoints me.

5140	0	a	To be honest, i do not like this game. I could run down a list of reason, and i will but thats later, first let me give you some backstory. First I picked up this game because I LOVE minecraft, I mean like a crap ton of hours, so i went into this, think it was a 2d minecraft, its not, Minecraft, has a lot of bioms and lets you play mini games. This game, is hard, long, and to be honest not that fun.  ------------ PROS - Interesting idea - Nice graphics - Ok Multi-Player  ------------ CONS - Hard, i had to spend hours watching guides just to figure out how to survive a night. - Borring i just could not get into it - Hard to do stuff in, its hard to build a sword, or a pick, or craft anything else. ------------------ Conclusion This game, could have been fun, i dident like it, but other might

They give you a .exe to run your server, but that doesn't do anything for you. Even with the correct IP address it wont sync with other players. No. I just wasted $10. :P

5162	0	a	It's like Minecraft (I assume.) in 2d. It feels really like addictive, and I'm the type of person who gets into those things. Ultimately the game is very shallow and kind of just relies on you to make it fun for yourself. I like to collect and horde things I think it just takes advantage of people with mindsets like that. I don't really recommend this game, because it's just so blah and bland. The combat is not deep at all, it really has nothing to offer me as a game player. I just found myself compulsively hording and farming for materials so I could make the tools I already had, but get a better version of the tool that does the job of the tool faster, and really the game boils down to that. Just use a trainer and have all the stuff, and realize you kind of just wasted your time.   The obvious counter argument to that I suppose is that all games are wastes of time, but to that I say waste your time more productively, heh.   Also, cheating in games is not really a moralistic thing as long as you're playing a single player game you can do whatever you want, if you don't have the time to farm ridiculous amounts of matierals just save yourself the time and effort. Play the game a little realize there is not much there but time sinks, and move on play something you enjoy or work on your personal life. Just cheat in this game if you have it, then do something with your time.

To me, I never felt like exploring or crafting. The game didn't seem to entice me to keep playing (granted I've only played for 2 hours). I'll stick with Minecraft.

The obvious counter argument to that I suppose is that all games are wastes of time, but to that I say waste your time more productively, heh.   Also, cheating in games is not really a moralistic thing as long as you're playing a single player game you can do whatever you want, if you don't have the time to farm ridiculous amounts of matierals just save yourself the time and effort. Play the game a little realize there is not much there but time sinks, and move on play something you enjoy or work on your personal life. Just cheat in this game if you have it, then do something with your time.

5175	0	a	Downloaded Terraria when I was on a survival kick, but wasn't all that impressed. I know this game isn't supposed to be visually impressive, but that's not why gave a thumbs down. To me, I never felt like exploring or crafting. The game didn't seem to entice me to keep playing (granted I've only played for 2 hours). I'll stick with Minecraft.

It was terrible, from my understanding it would have been a 'minecraft' type game. It was hard to understand. I would've rather spent my time looking for a game that is much better than this one.

Sucks
5202	0	a	NOTE: I DO NOT THINK THIS IS JUST A MINECRAFT RIP-OFF. PLEASE READ BEFORE YOU ASSUME I DID! I gave this game as fair a chance as I could, but, ultimately, I was very dissappointed with it. Unless you have this game already, or are already very good at this game, then it will be very, VERY difficult. The only multiplayer is NOT private (as far as I could tell) so I could NOT get my friend's help, and the tutorial guy wasn't helpful in the slightest. I came in expecting what the rumors said: a MC ripoff. BOY was I wrong. The only simularity I could find was blocks. EVERYTHING else is VASTLY different. Not to mention I wasn't able to get a house built to protect me from those GAD DANG FLYING FISH. OH THOSE FISH! THOSE STUPID FISH!!! I found the game frustrating and annoying. I was NOT able to get into it. So, from personal experiance, I do not reccomend this game to anyone who hasn't gotten at least SOME idea of what you're doing. (other than building XD)

Sometimes I am able to join however most of the time (49 out of 50 times), the 'accept' button you have to press to join the server does absolutely nothing when I fix it. There are other reports of this issue online as well but seemingly no fixes. Terraria has given me a lot of enjoyment however I've had enough of the multiplayer issues.

5228	0	a	Wow, this is arguably the most stupid game ever conceived right next to minecraft. No intro, no tutorial, you can reconfigure only half of the controls, and the other half just works randomly. I got it because of a fun looking intro movie after I saw it was the 10th most played game on steam. After spending 30 minutes messing around with it, I want my 30 minutes of my life wasted, back.

5249	0	a	It is just a cheap minecraft with even crappier graphics. sure, it has more stuff, but what is the point of all of that stuff if you can only use it in a 2d, limited size world. Even if it had billions of different types of mobs, blocks, biomes, etc. , it would not count for anything.  Another thing, sure minecraft is not anywhere close to being the best game in the world, but it is still better than this. No, not just because it is 3d, but because the capabilities of a flat, tiny world are nothing compared to the endless, modable, and versitile environment has to offer.
5250	0	a	This game sucks, buy Starbound, not this poop, buy Starbound, period.

5262	0	a	this game is for all your nubs with a crap pc
5263	0	a	I didnt pay for price for this because it doesent really look that interesting by the pictures, only a 2D mini world to explore and hit stuff as people explain. If you know what you are doing then its a good game, if not then its pointless even getting it as all you can do is basic crafting until you find some good gear. Single player worlds do get very boring and before you buy this game please take note that this game is multiplayer but you will have to create a server to play with friends which is FREE. If you like the game and are getting bored of it you can buy the new terraria game called starbound which you can travel to SPACE.
5264	0	a	It's ♥♥♥♥, don't buy it.
5265	0	a	This game is Aufull. I started playing after my friend reccomended it but I can not reccomend it.

5271	0	a	I can not even play multiplayer which means this game is not worth it i can not enter the server port
5272	0	a	idk what to say if this good or bad but its kinda boring to me for some reason even thought i beat 1 boss and get awesome stuff its kinda boring but the boss fight is kinda good but thats the only thing i like

5274	0	a	Absolutely dissapointed. Okay game by yourself but i bought for the fact i wanted to play with my gf but hey guess what the multiplayer connection is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ like how the ♥♥♥♥ do you do this?
5275	0	a	I played the game on the iPad and enjoyed it. Friends told me the PC version was even better, so I purchased it from steam. This game has good promise but crashes upon startup and is not playable. Example: Upon install the game would crash every time I tried to create my first character - I looked up the problem on the web and discovered I had to do a regedit just to get it to create a character without crashing. After the regedit, I managed to play for an hour or two. Several days later I tryied to play it again - now it doesnt appear to run at all - If I choose single player it immediately crashes to desktop with unhandled system.IO exceptions. I've spent some time trying to look up the solution, but none of the recommendations work.  Apparently the programmers need to go back to school and learn how to write code that doesnt crash.  save your money - dont buy this game.
5276	0	a	it annoys me
5277	0	a	i had alot of fun and shred alot of gnar with my frends i rallyed up and it was relly fun playing this i relly reccomend this to everyone who is reading this if u dont have this game and this its ar ip off of miencraft then ♥♥♥♥ you

Enjoy. Do you like arbitrary aesthetics? Woopie! Mindless enemies trying to fly into you all the time? Boy howdie!  11/9 Would prefer over minecraft.

5285	0	a	I see why so many people love this game and for a while I did too. You can only gather and craft for so long before it really begins to feel tedious. If you like minecraft or starbound this is more of the same. For me, too much of the same.
5286	0	a	If you came here to read bad stuff about Terraria then you gotta look elsewhere.
5287	0	a	I really could not get into this game. I wasted 15 minutes and there was nothing to lure me back to play it.
5288	0	a	call me a filthy casual but I share the same idea as Yahtzee, the term 'It gets better later' should not be a valid argument because if someone isnt having fun they should have every right to put the game down and play something else.  Somewhere under here is an amazing game but I will never ever play 10 hours of boring ♥♥♥♥♥ just to get to the good parts, as a game should be engaging from the start.
5289	0	a	This game. Well, I'm sorry but i just don't like it. You dig and amass your shiny weapons and armor and equipment, but it just feels so dull. On single player I could scarcely play for 10 minutes straight without saying 'why am I even playing this?'
5290	0	a	is there anyway to avoid losing game files because i just lost 41 hours of game play. not happy with this and hopefully steam can fix this bug to avoid this from happening to anybody else

5306	0	a	I WANNA UPDATE FOR DIS GAME then ill like it :) but dis games great
5307	0	a	All I can remember is digging blocks for hours wondering what I was doing with my life and wishing it would stop.   You set your own goals in this game, and it pretty much revolves around collecting things to get the next tier of armor and tools.   There is building things and combat, but sense of accomplishment for building anything isn't as grand as seeing it in 3D like in Minecraft because of the fixed 2D perspective, and the combat is clicking down until someone's health bar runs out.   It'll waste a lot of your time, it's intentionally designed to be addictive and drawn out.
5308	0	a	♥♥♥♥♥♥ and boring game
5309	0	a	Minecraft clone minus all the good features (including 3D). I paid $2.50 for the game, not worth it. Do you know what IS a good game? If you said Mount &amp; Blade: Warband, then you are correct. I regret buying and playing this game.

5313	0	a	I will be honest--this game is fun for a little bit, but sincerely, it gets boring after a while. It gets way too easy when you can just bring your stuff into every world and everything is accessible. Don't get me wrong--the game is okay, but it's not something I'd spend money on. Good thing my friend gifted it to me :P
5314	0	a	its not that great
5315	0	a	This game has not loaded for me for the last couple of months. I have reinstalled both Terraria and Steam a couple of times each but still nothing has happened. And until I can play it... 0/5
5316	0	a	Boring. Usually I like survival games but this one just bored me. I can definitely see why people like it, but honestly, I didn't like it much.
5317	0	a	I never really got into terraria. Just my opinion, this game is just another one of those 2D survivals. EDIT: Wow, people do not like opinion. I said I just never got into it, I'm not stopping you from playing.
5318	0	a	At first it was fun....but the more you play, the more you wanna play.....minecraft!?  Yep, its true, this is a okey game on its own merits, but the comparison to minecraft is undeniable.  Terrarias greatest pro, is its sidescrolling view....but also its biggest con.  This will be different from player to player, and if youre a Minecrafter you´ll find some fun things here. But most people just play a little, then go back to minecraft.  Therefor i cant recommend this, because i were one of those who quickly got bored and moved on.   I love that its available and buyable, but i wouldnt buy it, if i could instead get minecraft.
5319	0	a	Not my kind of games. I can't see a reason to prefer it to Minecraft, really.

5321	0	a	Boring. Usually I like survival games but this one just bored me. I can definitely see why people like it, but honestly, I didn't like it much.
5322	0	a	I know this isn't going to be a popular review, but please respect other peoples points of view. It isn't about 'agreeing' with it, it's about being useful for people who want to buy it. Thank you.  First, I have to confess that I love Minecraft. Since it isn't on Steam, I haven't kept track of how many hours I've played it. Countless, certainly. And yes, this is most likely biased because I played Minecraft previously to Terraria.   Many people say that Terraria is like Minecraft, but in 2D. It isn't. While they certainly have in common that you explore caves, kill enemies and build things, that's where the similitudes end.  While at Minecraft the focus is around exploration and building, I feel that the focus at Terraria is just the exploration. It certainly has more interesting types of caves than the monothematic Minecraft ones, but at the same time the building options combined with the scrolling view limit the options to 'a house made of stone/wood' and 'n number of floors'. There isn't much room for decoration when all furniture is prefabricated (as in, you create the chair, not put together certain blocks to make something it looks like a chair to you), and you only have 2D to work with.  Speaking of exploration: Terraria's caves are huge. That's a pro for some people, I guess. For me, and compared to Minecraft, it just felt like I never get anywhere. Dig, dig, dig, get the same type of ore that you don't need anymore because the higher-grade tools you made won't ever break.  Other than the extreme dullness of digging with no objective in mind (since you don't know a darn thing about the world), there's no peril in the caves worth mentioning (medium difficulty). Some bat here and there, no damage that you won't regen in 5 secons after. Unless, of course, we speak of the traps. Diabollicaly hidden traps that willl instakill you during at least your 20 first hours of gameplay, making you drop all your items on the floor. God help you if you don't know which way you came from, or if you did need this upgraded equipement you just lost to clear your path there.  People also say that both Minecraft and Terraria are about crafting. Lies. Terraria lets you craft things, in the same sense Skyrim lets you craft tour own weapons and house furniture. Neither of them are games about crafting just because you can craft a handful of items, and in my opinion, Terraria just doesn't step out of the linear paths of crafting where the ores will make bars and the bars will make armor and there it ends. There's only just so much room in a screen for decorative objects cluttering it. No first person view, no eye candy.  Before ending, I want to make clear that I understand that some people may like this game. It just ins't for me, and I think it's important that possible buyers have both parties POV.  Veredict: 5/10

5325	0	a	I found this game insanely boring and glitchy. It doesn't flow at all. It takes about 20 clicks to get a single block down, as well as the combat is very slow and boring. I don't even know what to rate this, it's so bad. XD
5326	0	a	It's like Minecraft, except worse.
5327	0	a	I am a MAJOR Minecraft fan. My friend decided I should buy Terraria while it was on a $2 sale. I bought it thinking I was getting a great deal. When in reality, $2 should be the original price! This game is awfully boring when your alone, and still even boring with your friends! And let me tell you this, your character transers ALL it's items to whatever server you enter. If you hop on a PVP server, you better hope you put your items away,. This game wasn't for me. It might be for you! This is a worse version of Minecraft... and too easy.
5328	0	a	Absolutely horrible. I spent 2.50 on it and I feel robbed. The Hindenburg was a better idea than this game.

5334	0	a	TL;DR (Save $10, don't buy this garbage.)  After playing his load of garbage for many hours I can finally conclude that it isn't worth $10 or even $5 or anything at all. It is a 2-D sandbox with zero effort put into it and a very unbalanced difficulty system. At first glance it looks all well and good but after you reach a certain point defeating a boss called the Wall of Flesh the game falls into the stupidly difficult Hard mode where monster kill you in seconds even with 'Hard mode armor' equiped, Overpowered Bosses can spawn at any time including when you don't even have proper weapons to defeat them at all, and stupid events like a Christmas themed 'Frost Moon' occur spawning literally thousands of mobs that kill your NPCs and kill you and force you to die multiple times in a single night costing you loads of money. And the developer for this worthless game has made almost no progress in patching or updating these problems. This is one of the most boring games ever. It's on the same level as Starbound in all honesty, great idea terrible presentation. Do yourself a favor don't waste your time on this stupid game, the playerbase is full of fanboys and girls who think this game is the best game ever but they dont see what I see; a bad game with poor game design and unbalanced gameplay.
5335	0	a	DO YOU LIKE A GAME WHERE ALL YOU DO IS CHEAT IN CRAP? NOTHING LEGIT? NO FUN? WELL THIS PIECE OF CRAP GAME IS MADE FOR YOU. ALL YOU DO IS FIND A CHEAT SERVER GET CRAP AND ENJOY YOUR WORTHLESS LIFE GO AHEAD AND WASTE YOUR LIFE KNOWING YOU ARE HORRIBLE GAMES AND LIFE. SO BUY THIS GAME THAT RIPES APARTS GREAT FRIENDS AND YOUR SANITY. BUY NOW! NO SARCASM HERE NOPE WHATS SARCASM? NO SARCASM IF YOU THINK THIS IS SARCASM YOUR STUPID
5336	0	a	DON'T BUY THE GAME AFTR 2 DAYS IT WILL STOP WORKING!!!!!!!!!!!
5337	0	a	I really wanted to like this game. But much like minecraft I can never figure out what to do. These survival style games drive me nuts.
5338	0	a	2d clone of Minecraft. Very boring gameplay.
5339	0	a	My friend gifted me this game and now it tells me to buy it again. Ummmmm no 
5340	0	a	Eyyyy.......What are you doing here go to the good comments 100000000/10 It is goo dim just drunk 
5341	0	a	Gets boring pretty fast, in the end it's just another lazy minecraft clone. Don't waste your money.
5342	0	a	There isn't any guidance to the game... its just a place to build a pixel fantasy. Sure I know there are boses but I shouldn't have to read text or do research to figure anything out... this game isn't my life. It was a nice little thing to do on my own. Try to put in wiki's and stuff in the game... Like a tutorial or something.... Also, you can do an infinate amount more with the games, why aren't you using it. Always the same creatures and same rythm of random bad guys who spawn and try to hurt you... Nothing on the positve side except little pots which you can bust open once. Perhaps more crafting would make it better. I'll come back in a few years and see what your up to. For now, a disgusting review about another pointless game which decays my life quality anyways.
5343	0	a	Can't even play with friends without figuring out how to host my own server or some ♥♥♥♥ which I really don't feel like figuring out how to do.

5347	0	a	once when I was a small child, I was running and frolicking about the blacktop at my then-elementary school. Blinded by my 6 year old stupidity and my pre-adolescent cheeriness, I attempted to leap over a backpack lying on the ground. The result was a gorey wound on my hip that would suck in my whitey-tighties like a grotesque black hole of death, forcing me rip the underpants from the wound making a bigger mess of said wound. Whitey-tighties now stained red, I charged on into the ever present challenge we all know as life, equiped with my blood soaked briefs and the knowledge that backpacks can prove to be fatal.

I starting getting Bored. Everytime same Bosses. Getting more easyer and easyer. There is only 1 way to beat the game. Kill Moonloard (last boss). He is very easy and u can farm him to get even more good ♥♥♥♥ to make everything easy peasy.  Multiplayer: If u wanna play with friends then u neeed a rly good Internet or u can forgot it. I have 700 mb and lags only if im playing in Multiplayer. My friend has 1000 mb and even dat lags. So you need to have a Really Good Internet or its gonna lag every 2 min.

5367	0	a	Do not play this game. It takes too much time, just look at how many hours people spend playing it!   Games should be played once, and beaten. You cannot do that with this game, so don't bother trying. It is different everytime I make a world! Who would ever want something that can be replayed differently, every time? Certainly not me!  There is too much to do in Terraria. I don't want to be bothered with 'building' structures and 'mining' for resources. What is this? The digital apartheid workforce of South Africa? People do not want to do that!  I hope that after reading this, you will never, ever, for risk of shame, think of playing this game. Do not do it. I warned you.  You already did, didn't you. You hated it, right?   Bah!   There must be something wrong with you.

5369	0	a	You know... I loved this game. Got some of the best best weapons and me and my friends would gather around the computer and try to defeat a boss. Then today happened. My characters highlight was red and my worlds were gone. Now i am locked out of my character and no good worlds so I think this game is very stupid and dont waste money or time on this game. Its not worth it. I have regrets of wasting so many hours of gameplay on this. This is a train wreck.

5374	0	a	I don't because I'd recommend buying Starbound, it's made by the same guys (I think), pretty similar but WAY bigger! I enjoyed Terraria a lot but since I rushed through it pretty quickly I couldn't tell you to buy it ASAP! Hope this helps!
5375	0	a	This game is like trying to play Mario on the Comadore 64 while simultaniously jerking yourself and your neighbor's hot 18 year old son off to the sound of Marilyn Manson played backwards over a tin of grated cheese and over cooked, over seasoned rice. All in all, I would rather have every single tooth yanked out of my skull, ground up, and then shoved into my veins through the worlds biggest needle than play this game again.

5395	0	a	I like exploration, open-world, crafting and survival games but I despise modern 2D games as they lack proper animations. Going 2D nowadays is mostly an excuse to be as minimalist as possible with demanding parts of game development, ergo amateur hour.  If you have low standards for graphics, animations, UI design and controls, then this is probably for you.  No controller support by the way!

5399	0	a	I'm sorry.. But I cannot in good heart recommend this game to anyone, much less my friends.   I found this game a hugee let down. It's overly complicated in a way. Maybe just me, but it seems very redundent.  I'm not one of those people who say that it's just a 2D clone of Minecraft, because Terraria was made first so I hear. I was expecting to play with my friends, but the private server joining thing is over the top complicated. Nothing we tried seemed to work. Overall, this game gets 4/10.
5400	0	a	I love Minecraft, its amazing and I dumped tons of hours into it.  Terraria is not that.  Its more of an ode to 2d side scroller castlevania but with crafting.  Lots of friends got into it and loved this and Minecraft, but the 'lego' feeling is gone from this game so I can't recommend it.

5456	0	a	*MY SPELLING IS HORRIBLE* Terraria, Minecraft vs Terraria, The Big wars back then, I was a huge minecraft fan back then (Alpha Stage :D) But Now since Wallet sucker simulator (TF2) I now sit for 24/7. I thought of giving Terraria a try since it was 4.99 on sale. When I bought it, I was very excited, I read alot of good reviews about it. But I regret it. ALOT. First of all, The Music was good for like 3 minutes and it just sucked badly, The Loop was horrible and I had to mute it. But Before I mute it I made my character, It was nice you could make your character your 'Style'. I waited for like 5 minutes when finally it finished. Then I was so ♥♥♥♥ing confused. I didnt know any of the controls. All I did was break trees, get wood, break stone or rock or whatever, And Made a mini house. First of all, the Crafting system is HORRIBLE, The Minecraft crafting systems are atleast better. Anyway After like 20 minutes my Fingers had start to hurt ALOT. Because in this game and Minecraft, You have to click the mouse button FOREVER. This was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off the max, And for some reason if I hold the mouse button it doesnt break anything or attack. I had to install a 'Auto Click' So my fingers could ♥♥♥♥ing rest, When it was night Monsters came out, I didnt craft ♥♥♥♥ and all I had was the wooden sword,Axe,Pick and some stone and wood. Monsters came out of nowere and I died the moment I when Rambo and killed them. Then I just quit. The Next day My Computer had 'Thousands of Virus' I had to use my Virus Check (Malware Anti-Bytes) and Waited for like ♥♥♥♥ing 10 hours. I thanked GabeN because I ♥♥♥♥ my pants thinking if my steam was hacked. Then I played terraria again. I waited again and It was still night. WTF I died like so many times. I was getting ♥♥♥♥♥♥, And So I just 'Idle' Until night was over While I was on 'Idle' I played some Kirby Super Star Ultra, Since its my favroite game and Im a HUGE ♥♥♥ Kirby Fan. Anyway I waited for like 10 minutes until it was day, and the day started. I mined until I fell into a Botomless Pit, and Died because a hungry pack of monsters were about to eat my satanic corpse. Then I just Quit and played some CS:GO. I did this review before steam added refunds, But Your game could have more then 2 hours on it, OR You could not have it for more then 2 weeks, Well ♥♥♥♥, I had that game for like 2 months. Im not a Minecraft Fanboy, But I would rather spend $26 Dollars on a blocky game that has GOOD Reviews (Not IGNorant reviews). This was a Waste if $5. I would buy some TF2 Keys, or Buy pack of LEGO's to entertain my self. Too Make this easier   Pros -9.99 Dollars (4.99 Dollars on sale) -Nice Character Customizing  The Best Pros, Has to be the Uninstall button, Its a great feature to Terraria and every other game on steam. -UNINSTALL BUTTON WORKS! UNINSTALL BUTTON NO LONGER EARLY-ACCESS   Cons  -Fanboys Minecraft Vs Ter♥♥♥♥ Etc. -Finger gets Cancer -Auto Click install -4.99 Dollars given to GabeN -Every ♥♥♥♥ing IGN Review about this game  -Too Minecraft Like, Get something more original not just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game like BLOCKADE 3D -And Everything else in the game -Music -♥♥♥♥♥♥ monster -No ♥♥♥♥ing Turtorial or 'Training' Mode, WTF -Playing with Multiplayer takes forever and its a waste of MY Time -0.8 Hours of my Life wasted on this horrid ♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥  Anyway This Game should REALLY DESERVE a Dead Kirby out of 10  By That I mean 3.5/10   Remember This is MY OPINION NOT YOURS!

5457	0	a	I'd give this game a 6.9/100 since its not fun at all. But the 6.9 is because it looks like my favorite game Dead Rising 2: Case West. The main characters of Terraria are Chris Brown and North West. They enter the phenotrans facility and yuck it up for about 69 minutes. The best part of this game is the online. GTerrariA Online is a great expansion to the very great single player. Rockstar really hit a homerun on this game. Have you ever wanted to play a 2D game in 2013? Well you're in luck! Terraria sells for the very cheap price of 6.99 on the origin website. If you want to get 69% off Terraria on uPlay you can ask your neighborhood MrFatSwag and he'll pull a promocode out of his ♥♥♥♥

5459	0	a	This game is soo boring
5460	0	a	I Tried.
5461	0	a	There is something that people love in those sandbox games that I don't get. After spending an hour gathering ressources and building houses, I am bored to death. Exploring dungeons for miles and miles underworld just doesn't appeal to me. And don't get me started on clicking on blocks for hours and hours... I'd rather do a literary commentary than wasting my time and computer on this. But other than that, it's a cool looking game with plenty of possibilities (I'm sure!). I'm just not a fan of those games.
5462	0	a	I am going to be honest about this game. Ok, I don't care if people like this review or not, I just want to state my point.  This game is not worth you, or your friend's money. And if it were free, it wouldn't be worth you or your friend's time. The game is currently uninstalled as a result, sitting in my steam library, most likely not to be touched ever again.  Let's face it. Terraria is a 2D game, with 2D performence. There is literally NO point in this game. Kill monsters, get gold, waste 15 too many hours looking for someone to spend that said money, only to find that whatever you bought was a piece of trash. You can only build 2D things. As a personal player of Minecraft myself, there is no need to get this game. The most you could do is pixel art, and even that is better on the game listed before. Nothing in this game is interesting. If you find yourself able to build 2D castles, fine, that floats your boat. But ask yourself this. Why are you getting this game? Are you truly going to be amazed by this game? Is it worth the money? There are better games out there, that cost less, and actually bring you an experience. As a person who has wasted too much time and gone through the pain of finding my money completely wasted, please take a moment to think, and only buy this game, if this game has EXACTLY what you are looking for, and is perfect for your tastes. Otherwise, save your pennies, and buy a better game. (And for those who think that I am going all out hate, don't even get me started on the devs related around this 'franchise' of this style of game).
5463	0	a	Story: Got Game. Chopped Tree. Built House. Mined Stuff. Turned House Into Ice Bricks. Looked Cool. Built 2 Other Houses. Got Bored. Quit...
5464	0	a	this game is buttcheecks
5465	0	a	Forced to play this game by my son who loves it. The control system is poor so it never feels natural. Most deaths are because it dosent do what you want it to. Its fussy to the point that if a pixel is in the way you dont move. The ores are unclear and look too simular. It dosent support networking very well meaning you have to faff about with it to play on a LAN. Internet play is harder still. All this for a 2d version of minecraft. Its a mess and makes minecraft look like a shining example of design and programming brilliance.
5466	0	a	This game is not for me. I don't know why... I see a lot of people playing it, and I'm sure they're having fun with it, but not me. I think it's downright boring. I had the same feeling with Minecraft. Sure, I knew before I bought this game that it would be somewhat similar to Minecraft, but still, I like to experience all games myself. That's the reason I buy so many games. Anyway, in this game you get to kill enemies and chop wood, things like that. With the resources you build things like houses and weapons. That's the basic idea. There are no objectives, there's no mission. You just create a world of your own, fighting enemies along the way. I salute those who do have the patience to put hundreds of hours into these games, creating the best worlds possible, exploring everything, doing everything, but next time I see a game like this I'll just simply ignore it. Period.  [Rating: 66/100]
5467	0	a	fun at first, boring later
5468	0	a	Nobody ever wants to play this with me. ♥♥♥♥ it.
5469	0	a	this game is buttcheecks
5470	0	a	Basically 2D Minecraft
5471	0	a	Fun at start, then gets boring once there's nothing left to do
5472	0	a	I cannot fathom any reason people would enjoy, or even play this game. It's repetitive, slow, unoriginal and plain boring as hell. If you enjoy this kind of thing, I would highly recommend playing Starbound, because even the deep-beta that that game is in at this moment, it blows Terraria right out of the water. Steer clear of this one, because € 10,- is ridiculous for this kind of crap.
5473	0	a	Looks great, not for me.

5481	0	a	It's ridiculously boring. At one point I found myself unable to mine anything, because I accidentally dropped my pickaxe. And I was unable to create another one. I ended up making a new character. And I couldn't even transfer his pickaxe to my old character. Because I was unable to make a chest.  2/10 Stars

5487	0	a	I couldn't really get into this game, but most of my friends are addicted to it.  I guess you just gotta try it and see if you like it, which I didn't. (Did I mention that already? :&gt;)
5488	0	a	You like PLAYING games? dont buy this!
5489	0	a	Well i was playing with my ranger and about to get full shroomite armor then i lag. I try to restart my computer, come back on and then boom. My character said 'Marksman' in red. And i couldnt play on the character and he had nothing equiped. Then i try going on the world and my game crashes. Is my world and character corrupted? If it is, learn to fix it. Thanks Terraria &lt;3
5490	0	a	Nah not that good aye.
5491	0	a	Its ♥♥♥♥♥, don't play it
5492	0	a	Good for salty nerds like me. It's good for a little while.
5493	0	a	Every person I've known who enjoyed this game smelled of burnt pizza farts. Avoid.
5494	0	a	This is a fun game that can be played for hours when it works. Recently this game crashes on startup, and can't be played. I reinstalled .Net and XNA, but the game still crashes on startup.
5495	0	a	The dev(s?) behind this game promised Steam Achievements, and then he was just decided to abandon that idea. This game, therefore, loses its appeal for me. I feel ripped off by this undelivered feature.
5496	0	a	This game will become a great disappointment for players that gives lots of time to it. If you will run into situation when your PC is accidentaly shuts down during game then don't be surprised to lose everything you created. Your character and your world will be erased due to some bug that is well known by developers and they don't bother themselfs to fix it.
5497	0	a	Good for salty nerds like me. It's good for a little while.
5498	0	a	Cool game, it has a lot of depth, but I'd rather play Minecraft.
5499	0	a	This is absolute junk! No other way to say it its just junk! 
5500	0	a	I don't agree with consoles having exclusive content so I regret buying this on PC.
5501	0	a	All I have to say is that this game is bland and linear. I am telling you that there is no end game once you grind through hours and hours to get better gear you head into combat that involves jumping around, spaming pots, and rapidly clicking in an atempt to kill bosses that just spam attacks back at you. The building and creativity of this game is severly limited by the 2d and the building should have been put in the background so that when you open a door you can enter your home. The way it currently works is that you place blocks and make a wall around you and must jump over or walk through your house making it feel much less like a house. This game was also made just for the money as you can find many clips around youtube of the devs saying they patch it to make money. Also this game was orginally planned to move fully to xbox and have the pc updates end. Why? simple to get the hundreds of players to pay more money to play with new items. The devs are just plain evil and the game itself will get boring dispite it's inital appeal. Personally I would not have bought the game knowing that the devs have taken down honest reviews of the game for 'copyright' purposes yet left extremely positive reveiws untouched. Please do the world a favor go play a good indie game deserving of your money.
5502	0	a	this was fun until i turned 13. now its GAY.

5512	0	a	Having a hard time deciding if this or Minecraft is better. Honestly they are a lot alike. But Terreria is more for the classic gamers who grew up playing gameboy advances, mario, megaman and the like. It offers more features, but I haven't played it long cause I got a little bored. I may try to play this again soon, but honestly I think I'll rate this down 4/10
5513	0	a	This game... This game is only fun if you have no other game installed on your computer and your internet is off... thats the only time i've played it... unless my friends wanted me to play it.... The poor developer brought this game to handheld devises because he wasent making enough money from the poor 5 year old downers. If you like Mario and Minecraft you should get this game... But the design of it i do not like and is too rough around the edges.

5530	0	a	Terraria is a 2D crafting exploration game. It has called itself the 2D Minecraft, but this game puts a higher emphasis on combat. More enemies, more attack patterns, more weapons that do unique things including grappling hooks, grenades, throwing stars, sticky grenades and so on.   Once you create your character, the game generates an entire world when you start, so no two playthroughs are exactly the same. When you begin, you have a pic axe, wood axe and sword. Wood axes cut down trees, pic axes dig and take down things you've put up and swords, spears, bows and other weapons are efficient for dealing with enemies. The only problem here is switching between all three with the use of the mouse wheel. Not just that, but you'll need to aim your mouse cursor at blocks and enemies. Mouse aim on a platformer isn't that fun, but its even worse on PSN.  The left mouse button is to use the object you have highlighted in your inventory. The right mouse button interacts with things such as opening doors. There is a jump key that thankfully you can rebind, since I find it difficult to traverse when I need to move to the right, jump and aim with the mouse. There is an inventory button where you'll not only see a list of 10 hotkeyed items up at the top, but a crafting system that lets you easily craft from things in your inventory. You won't have to guess what combination of things will make something, the game bluntly tells you that you can make this, because you have this and that. You will need workshop tables and smelters to make more complex items like armor. Its a nice system, but the array of items you can craft is limited to one column instead of an entire grid of things. This causes you to have to scroll to what you want to build instead of just selecting it from a giant grid like the inventory.  You can equip your character with armor, helmets, greaves (leg armor) and other things you find along the way like climbing claws. Its as easy as drag and drop. Life will regenerate, but if you don't have the time, potions will do and you can even craft a campfire to increase the generation. The game gives you treasures that make me feel overpowered and invulnerable too early in the game. Finding things adds another interesting layer because of how much loot is in a single chest and getting to the treasures is always interesting. Finding underground rooms, having to dig a chest out of a wall that you may have missed the first 8 times you passed by it.  With all of the materials you harvest, wood, dirt, stone, gold, copper, and so on, you can use them to build and craft. Build platforms to get to higher places or keep from dropping to your death. Build walls to protect yourself from zombies at night. Build doors to let you and other NPCs through, but keep out enemies. You can make your own creations. Want a treehouse, go for it. Want to make a Castlevania style mansion with stone gargoyles made with copper walls? Go for it. You can even have friends drop into your world to help and play.  There is a lot of creativity in the game, both in enemy design, world terrain and what you can craft. Stronger monsters lurk in the dark either in caves or at night. You can put down torches to keep them from respawning and you can carry a torch to light your way, you just can't 'work' or fight while carrying a torch. The enemies feel good, they'll jump, float and fly at you from odd angles, but the combat just doesn't. Uneven terrain with a sword that only goes forward can leave you at a great disadvantage, especially flying enemies that come from all sorts of different angles, but luckily a lot of weapons have mouse aim and even then it can be difficult to hit enemies. Axes and other weapons have a full overhead to forward attack that seems good. Some weapons have a chance to knock back enemies that feels helpful.  Because this is a game of exploration, you have a mini map that helps a lot if you want it, but not just that you have a big overall map. You'll only see territory you've explored. You don't have to have it or use it, in fact there's a permadeath hardcore mode, but whenever I spend hours in a single playthrough, I don't want to feel like my time was wasted like that. My work and time spent chopping down trees, digging through dirt, assembling things.  There is a lot of creativity and the chance to build a 2D castle of your dreams, mold strange worlds to your liking and explore the depths of lava labyrinths. You can sink hours, days, months and years into this game by building and exploring. With all of this being said, the game feels more like work than fun. I want a game that I can play. I never felt that I was getting anywhere with hours into it. Playing with friends in the game was a lot of fun, but friends make everything fun.

5533	0	a	i use to love this game hence why i have like 350 hours on it but then they updated it and ruinied the game 
5534	0	a	meh its not so great
5535	0	a	Purchasing this game is like purchasing an ineffective enima- You assumed you got your money's worth, but instead you end up with constipation, and then eventually hemroids.
5536	0	a	Someone decided it would be a good idea to turn Dig Dug into an RPG...some game ideas should just be left in the 80s, and this is one of them.
5537	0	a	Multiplayer is confusing as hell. Several of my friends and I all own the game, and we have yet to figure out how to play together. Basically, you have to host a server, and then your friends have to join by entering your computer's IP address, plus some other port address, and it's not explained anywhere within the game. In otherwords, you have to know exactly who you're playing with before hand. You can't just go looking for a random server to make friends in. Single player is relatively fun, but without other players you'll likely find yourself becoming bored rather quickly. Assuming you can get the multiplayer to work, however, you can carry the same character over from server to server and use all of the same items you previously collected. This was really a game meant for multiple people, but they went about it in a very poor way. Overall, I would say don't get this game if you wanted to play it with a friend.
5538	0	a	I like the ability to at ease move around and dig and build with quick and with no limits that i have to rest all the time ability. This game is a good game.  THE DOWN FALL: The game has tone of items with no auto up date book guide how to or what for so your not waisting your life on never fining the right item or thing or what ever needs to be done to move on. Like i said just because you can make more of this or that dose not make a good game. You have to have a personal auto book you carry to look at to now how to build this or that not look online for those who have no life out side of games.
5539	0	a	Boring and bad multiplayer system
5540	0	a	This game is boring... AS HELL... The only funny part is when you're digging to see if you can reach the center of the earth...

5551	0	a	CastleVania: Symphony of the Terraria is the latest in a long standing series of running back and forth simulators developed by Namco-Bandai. In this latest offering, the ante has truly been upped, nearly as high as the bar has been hoisted. Gone are the scary vampires from the original titles,as they've been replaced by annoying eyeballs that crash into until you die.   Minecraft: The Super Mario Brothers Super Show is quite possibly the pinnacle of games where you go left until you find a castle. The soundtrack pulses with 1960s thunder as you delve ever deeper into the planet's core. By the time I found a diamond, I knew that Motherlode: Prepare to Die Edition was a cornerstone of the 'Bullet Hell' genre of 2D shooters.  Dig Dug II: Assassins of Kings is the premier digging simulator of 2011. It features such stunningly dynamic gameplay interfaces as trees that fall down, alongside terrifying and challenging boss battles such as fan favorite 'That's a really big eyeball.'  This game has everything. Side scrolling. Digging. Bats. NPCs.  When I built a F/A-18 Super Horney using only wooden planks and eyeballs, I knew this was the game for me. Overall, I give Bebe's Kids: The Fall of Max Payne a mystifying 3/10.

5555	0	a	Jeez. I get it. It's creative and totally undirected. But it's also slow and extremely frustrating. Not sure how to describe it in terms of genre but it's certainly not an RPG. More like platform build-em-up. Not for me I'm afraid. No score.
5556	0	a	I got this game for free. Still want my money back.
5557	0	a	I couldn't get into it. The controls are so hackneyed it felt like I was fighting walruses in a tub of Jell-O with a waterlogged roll of off-brand paper towels. The inventory system is a mess, it's like looking for a red marble in a sea of red M&amp;Ms. And what's with the resolution? Drug Wars on a TI-81 has more fidelity. Terraria, more like Terriblia.

5565	0	a	This game is horrible. It advertises multiplayer gameplay, but setting that up is a nightmare and a half. I sat down with 3 other people for over 2 hours trying to get the multiplayer aspect to work; tried creating a dedicated server; tried messing with the router's port forwarding settings and firewall. This game fails at delivering something very simple that should not be such a hassle. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNLESS YOUR ONLY INTENTION IS TO PLAY SINGLE PLAYER.   2/10  Sent the devs an email asking for a refund.

5581	0	a	My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.' Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.' I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway. 
5582	0	a	Ok so a few things. I'll start with singleplayer. Single player is fricking amazing, the bosses, the armour, the ores, the npcs, everything is flawless. Oh god not the multiplayer. I have never tried joining a dedicated server, but holy hell, is it impossible to host a server and play with friends. You might be able to figure it out, but not without a tutorial somewhere and a very extensive knowledge about computers. My rate 6.7/10. It would be great as a single player game, but taunts you with its multiplayer option.

5584	0	a	I wish people would stop making negative reviews for such a great game!

5587	0	a	Quite complicated.
5588	0	a	I'd rather watch grass grow.
5589	0	a	+ Gets enjoyable after a lot of hours  - The idea isn't original - Very slow based - Boring - Getting started takes ages - The lack of instructions - You have no idea what are you supposed to do if you don't read guides - Get's even more boring after completing it - The annoying soundtrack - You get stuck a lot - The tools last far too long - Getting out of the underground alive is quite an achvievement in the early game - The creators of the game bann YouTube users that dislike this game - The backround - All the customisation abilities on the character look ugly - The art style hurts my eyes - Far too many reason why to dislike this game
5590	0	a	It's been surpassed by everything in the genre and combines the worst aspects of sandbox games: Grinding, not being very open-ended (It forces you to activate hardmode to unlock half the game), has little to no mod support, it's impossible to not get killed dozens of times even at endgame so people who just want to build with nice blocks are SOL, the game is extremely graphic so it alienates anyone who might be squeamish and the main developer is a complete tool with no sense of commitment.  Just go buy Starbound, Crea, Magicite, Signs of Life or one of the other games out there where the dev team actually seems to give a crap about the community.
5591	0	a	Good game but its version on the ipad is better as it is easy to use
5592	0	a	As a builder game, its boring with tedious disruptions. As a fighting game its the simpliest hack and slash. All combined - mindless grind that rewards you with more mindless grinding.
5593	0	a	I found it boring lel!

5595	0	a	I dont ♥♥♥♥ing like this game.
5596	0	a	honestly terraria isn't a bad game although it takes a certain kind of person that like this one that can put hours into a game without going no where and then finally getting to that next step you have to be very patient with terraria and can be a great game for a long time and yes this does just seem like a 2d minecraft at first glance after beating the first boss it made me see the game a different way its not a building game its a prep to defeat the big scary ♥♥♥♥in eyeball and then the next boss after that but unless you are that kind of person terraria isn't for you but one of my friends told me that the developers hire people to write good reviews which on a quick google search if didn't find any evidence I did however see that they take bad reviews down from YouTube.  http://www.terrariaonline.com/threads/just-a-myth-i-heard.102902/   http://www.giantbomb.com/terraria/3030-34940/forums/terraria-developer-cant-take-a-joke-and-hates-fun-497028/  in my opinion if a developer cant take negative critic and go out of there way to remove it they remove all credibility they have even if the review is biased you should let people see it otherwise you are just saying that you are a ♥♥♥♥♥ can cant take negative feed back and if people don't tell you that something in your game is bad it wont improve and games that are made after that will probably bad as well which is sad because terraria is a good game and has got a ♥♥♥♥ ton of content and I also heard that the original developers don't even update the game anymore nor work on the game. (thanks for ruining the image of indie games and this is the kind of stuff that wants to make me pirate games)
5597	0	a	You have to kill me. It makes me sad. Jk would recommend this game to anyone. Really fun and also challenging. 8/10
5598	0	a	I can't really recommend this game. It's basically 2D Minecraft. That's all it is. If you took Minecraft and made it have sex with 2D, you would get Terraria. I know that doesn't make sense. Shut up. I guess if you're tired of Minecraft and love 8-bit graphics this game isn't bad. Personally, I didn't find much to enjoy. Mostly the control scheme is what turns me away. There is definitely a more fluid control scheme that could have been used, or at least implemented as an option. Wonky mouse clicking is sucky. Two thumbs down.

5609	0	a	Ok ok ok....So I got Terrerria about a year ago just so me and my friend could play Multiplyer but guess what? Multiplayer dosen't work. I was quite angry because thats the only thing I wanted to do with the game. Then I said, 'Well I guess singleplayer COULD be worth 10 dollors alone....' But It wasnt. It was the definition of crap. It was a cheap ripoff of Minecraft and the dungion bosses were UNBEATABLE doing 1 hit kills on me when I couldnt see them! Well you would think 'Well this game has a LOT of items.' Well yes it does but half of them are useless, And the other half are hard to get. And you need a crafting table to make these but guess what? When I put down my crafting table and TRY to make stuff it dosent work! Well there you have it. The definition of Terraria.    Edit: Well I tried playing it again and got bored right off it was too hard and I didnt know where to get any items. Everywhere I went I died. So I just quit. Guys beware of terraria DONT BUY IT!!!

5611	0	a	Its laggy minecraft with 120 mods would run better then this. Dont waste your money with this game its a 2d game and you need a super computer to get even 10 fps. I had better time on 3d games filled with mods and on multiplayer. Other then the game being un playable the game play is great.

5616	0	a	This game is pretty much the Battletoads of this decade. A game title so ♥♥♥♥ing profoundly and mind-numbingly ♥♥♥♥tarded that I'd rather rip out my teeth and gum a ♥♥♥♥ing cactus than play this piece of ♥♥♥♥. I've found about as much entertainment with this ♥♥♥ wad as I have slamming my ♥♥♥♥ing noggin into a brick wall. If I had to, I'd put it somewhere between Mega Man and individually smashing my fingers with a sledgehammer on the 'fun' meter. I know I've made reviews that were meant to be taken with a grain of salt in the past (I literally have like ONE serious review excluding this one). My reviews are meant to be sarcastic and satirical. But this ♥♥♥♥ing game, this ♥♥♥♥ing... I don't even know. A braindead dying walrus could probably design a better game than Re-Logic. Maybe it's just me, hell, it probably IS just me, but don't play this ♥♥♥♥ing pile of anal discharge. I literally got AIDS the second I installed it.
5617	0	a	Game? Fun? No. Terraria is none of these. This, pathetic excuse for a ♥♥♥♥ing game is one of the worst ways I've spent money in basically my entire life. And I bought it hearing 'good' things about it. No. This is pathetic. Wanna play with a friend? Better know how to take apart your computer piece by piece system wise so you can even begin to access part of it. Oh, you thought you could just invite someone to play? NOPE. BECOME A IT SPECIALIST AND THEN WE'LL TALK. Or what about the actual meat and potatoes of this 'game?' Ha. That's pathetic. 2D minecraft my ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥. Minecraft is a perfectly executed building simulator that allows you to have full access to amazing tools and build a world that is your own. Terarria is a pathetic little side scroller that doesn't let you have any creative freedom. It's obtuse, roadblocks you anytime you even begin to think you've figured something out, and doesn't even have anything fun about it. If I could get a refund for even just my copy, I'd be thankful. But I can't get a refund for the time I spent trying to figure out this sad, pathetic excuse for a game.

5627	0	a	You will be spending much time building, deconstructing &amp; jumping just to get around. Because there are no slants or much smooth ground, especially after playing a while, it's almost impossible to make a simple walk with enemies out of any journey. It makes a chore out of something only marginally fun once you're doing battle. Why not have any goal being a reasonable travel of time away? Because they need to waste your time with this open world crafting and digging gimmick.  This game has such a low focus on the battles themselves, they are a mess on their own and look so poorly animated. The music is GRATING and I love chiptune! It's just horrible sound choice &amp; the composition doesn't help. I disliked this game so much I hate even seeing it in my library. Is there a way to fix that and drop ownership? I don't need a refund, but that would be better.
5628	0	a	This game is garbage, i do not get the hype about it at all. I feel cheated by the community that hyped this trash  This game would be ok for a small child or someone with mental disabilities

5632	0	a	Terraria is good, but not great.  Don't go thinking i'm saying this since i play Starbound.  The game is good, items are good, textures and music are good, but the game itself? eh, don't waste your money. Get Starbound. Way better (Again, not because i played it first. If you think that's why, don't.).  The controls are confusing no matter what you set them to, you have to look at your inventory just to exit out, you cant exit the game using that big red x at the top, you start out with crappy weapons and mining is slow, you cant see AT ALL at night unless you have a torch, you cant defend yourself from monsters that are flying at the beginning, takes forever just to respawn, you cant do much at first, you don't see how much of a block you mined, the pickaxe is a better weapon than the sword, and the biomes make no sense. there is literally a block inbetween biomes.  If you want this game, go ahead. It's fine, but i would recommend Starbound (YOU SERIOUSLY THINK I WROTE THIS SINCE I PLAYED STARBOUND FIRST!? WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU!?)
5633	0	a	If you build a house they will rave in it
5634	0	a	if mindcraft and mairo was combined then we would have terraria. great game mash up from nintindo and Javabeans or watever the company is called, idc. mindcraft aspects of game- survival of the elements. maireo- goombas included, 2d fps action. overall though the game feels clunky with controlls becuz i use my atari joystick to play and i asume many other people use that. 9 minecraft hearts/20 (only true minecrafters will get the reference.) there are also some fps elements to it. 4.5/10

5646	0	a	During the year of 2014 my best friend was going to Sierra Leone to aid those who had gotten their whole life destroyed because of the horrible virus that is ebola. I really wanted to go with him but unfortionatly I had other things to take care of at home. On his journey he got to meet all sorts of people from poor, hungry children to happy tribesfolk. But there was one thing they all had in common, they where all sick. Only a couple of days before his journey back home my best friend made the horrible discovery that he had also been affected by the virus and he would not be able to make it. His fate had been decided, he were to die. My heart broke when I heard of the news an yet there was nothing I could do about it. After the incident my mother has repetitivly reminded me of how lucky I was that I wasn't able to go with my friend. Yet I still strongly regret not doing so, because this game gave me ebola anyway.

5655	0	a	Are you an autistic scumbag who's PC didn't quite make the cut to play minecraft? Well then Terraria is perfect for you, expierence a sordid game that transcribes it's thoughts not only into a written form through it's inviting and exciting 1992 direct IP connection feature, but it also holds your ♥♥♥♥ by making a game that allows you the player to do all the work. Make a house, masturbate, die, or hit rocks and build another house! You name it Terraria has it and its an atrocious 8bit nightmare I sure do love 8bit, the retro sylings go great with the ♥♥♥♥ed up IP connect. Do you have a PC that is older than the first troglodyte to create fire? Then this game is perfect for you otherwise I'd reccomend you play a real game like I dunno Call of Dogs: Black Ghost. 1 out of 10
5656	0	a	Like a hand in rushing water, a cool and tangible surface, like a hand out a car window, the wind controlling its movement, like a hand upon green grass, as you watch it bend in softness, like a hand touching fire, every moment leaves a mark, like a hand in the frozen snow, your warmth could melt it all,  gently, slowly, specifically, all detail matters, and every inch is art, I could tell you about a reason, to love a moment like this, but its better left, unsaid,  for a touch is worth a thousand words, and pictures just don’t matter anymore, for only a memory of your touch, can bring that look to her face, and that longing, to her eyes.
5657	0	a	Can't wait for people to dislike this automatically. BRING ON THE HATE, I HAVE AN OPINION.  Terraria is interesting, to say the most. It has more charm than minecraft, but like minecraft, it's boredom central. Oh, yes, there are plenty of things to do, but holding down the mouse for two hours to end up attacking the occasional zombie that crosses your path just to mine again gets so boring. I suppose multiplayer is more hectic and livelier, but the single player is very dull. It's a very good time waster, I'll give it that; when waiting for things to happen to me in real life I might play this for a bit, as it certainly distracts you from things, but it's just not something I want to play all the time.  My problem is not the graphics (although pixel based games are oversaturating the market) and it's not the sound (which sounds boring, but gets the job done). It's just the gameplay; Minecraft and this game share a lot of the same problems; HOWEVER, Terraria has way better combat than Minecraft, and it's NPC's are better as well; they have actual pathfinding, unlike Minecraft, in which enemies simply walk in a straight line toward you. Crafting is weird, and I have to say it is better and worse than Minecraft; it tells you what you need for an item from the getgo, but the way you craft seems unweildy (having to press esc and scroll through a very small menu at the bottom left).  All in all, I had more fun with this than Minecraft, but I still didn't have a lot of it. It's probably worth it to every single other person other than me, but it just isn't my thing.  BUT HEY, $1.99 ON SALE, CAN'T BEAAAAAAT THAT!  pickaxe/10.
5658	0	a	This game is extremely unstable. What the requirements don't tell you is you need an up to date version of .Net Framework (4.0 or higher), XNA Game Studio, and it's operation is dependent on your Sound Card's sound set. APPROACH WITH EXTREME CAUTION!
5659	0	a	This game is crap. It is basicly Taco Bell with the same price and quality. There is nothing to do and its over complicated. The 2D graphics make it unbareable to play and dont get me started on the fighting. They add in 'fighting' mechanics but its absolute trash from the start. Just click and hold. The AI also stinks and you just place a block then your safe. Overall, this game is just crap and NEVER buy it. The only reason this is in the runing for an award is becasue of the annoying minecraft kids that buy horrible merch for this game. Terraria is the litteraly Donald Trump of steam. Game = Trash

5666	0	a	I have been playing this game since 2011, and it's always getting better. I will say, terraria is much better when playing with friends But here is when I'm angry THERE IS ALWAYS A F***ING PROBLEM WHEN TRYING TO JOIN OR START A SERVER TO PLAY WITH FRIENDS.  'Oh well it works for most players' 'Oh so you change your router port and port forward' EVERY SINGLE TIME I SEE THE SAME POST TO F*CKING CHANGE SOMETHING OR LITERALLY BREAK THE GAME OR YOUR ROUTER I RESET MY ENTIRE F*CKING COMPUTER TO REINSTALL SOME MICROSOFT FRAMEWORK S**T  'What are you talking about? There was a new update that lets you join players via steam' OH WELL THAT LITERALLY NOTHING EITHER THE SERVERS WORKED UNTIL THESE USELESS UPDATES THAT ADD LITERALLY 5 ITEMS PER UPDATE SO IF YOU HAVE NO FRIENDS AND WANT TO WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS GAME, USE YOUR $10 DOLLARS FOR THIS PIECE OF SH*T
5667	0	a	Fun for the first few hours, then gets boring, after that point you will only play the game with friends when you are bored, 2D mining was not a good topic for this game.

5669	0	a	You can't even swim. What the hell
5670	0	a	Truthfully? I don't get this game, I found it to be kind of boring and hard to pick-up. The lack of a server browser is what really kills it for me, it's on Steam, why is there no matchmaking? It might be different with single player, but I'm probably not going to try it on single player, if I ever do play it I guarantee I'll be using Skype and Hamachi in conjunction with it to let whomever else I'm playing with know that I 'HAVE NO CLUE WHAT THE HELL I'M SUPPOSED TO DO'. The combat is rather difficult, it's not uncommon that you take as many hits as you deal out, and then the crafting system. It's impossible without having an internet browser in the background for first-timers But it doesn't come without it's pros, unlike it's 3D counterpart Minecraft it focuses more on adventuring and exploration rather than digging a hole and building giant monuments. And it's a reasonably small filesize, less than 20MB.
5671	0	a	Its a piece of trash
5672	0	a	This game is BAD! I bought it because it was only a dollar but i still feel like this game was a waste of money.

If you want a good version of this game buy minecraft. Much better and more fun.

Play it now on PC, Xbox 360, PS3, PS Vita, iOS, Android, and Windows Phone!      Its Bad         Really Bad          Unless you like minecraft          Combined with Mario

So, I made a new character, but after you've done everything you can with the game, it gets [bold] BORINGGG. [/bold] I had already got all the items but a few. I had beat all the bosses. There was nothing left to do. Its a good game for a while, but then it's just not worth it anymore. Get it when it's on sale. Trust me. Patience is key.

5691	0	a	stupid game terrible rip off of Minecraft 0 stars &gt;:(

5695	0	a	Crap game dont download!
5696	0	a	I believe this game is garbage because how kidish the whole game is with a on going minecraft feel (despite 2D pixel graphics). The graphics are bland and the game is generally boring. This game might appeal to 12 year olds or man babies tho not me. My ovarall score is 2/10. (Its not my type of game). One more thing is that is is really overrated so, go buy age of empires (Factorio is good too) or some ♥♥♥♥. ♥♥♥♥ off fanboys this review is made 4 people looking to buy the game not for you to b annoying.
5697	0	a	  haha i pirated this game and then got it for free
5698	0	a	A painfully average game that wants to do everything without doing any of it well.
5699	0	a	Cool idea but didn't work that well and tough to learn.
5700	0	a	I dont really like terraria and here are the reasons why: there is no tutorial, game is to expensive for a game that was moved from a mobile to pc, multiplayer sucks and it has such a small download. This is basically like a kiddie minecraft game but the cheap version.
5701	0	a	so after dying to get this game that has over 60k positive reviews suddenly i find it gay, maybe its not my type or i still dont know whats the point of it !
5702	0	a	It's really funny at first but it startes to suck after a couple hours. Wasn't really worth the money. Get other, better games. 3/10 would not waste my time again
5703	0	a	When i try to open Terraria it just says 'Terraria has stopped working' and then it closes. Is there a way so i can get a refund? Thanks
5704	0	a	BUAHAHAHAHAAHA IM THE ♥♥♥♥ WHO DISLIKED TERRARIA jk this game is amazing the dislike is only a troll
5705	0	a	great game
5706	0	a	Pointless. Stupid. Just play minecraft with tweens.
5707	0	a	made a house, thats about it
5708	0	a	This game has AWFUL load times, and I'm running it on a Titan 1980x, 2 TB of harddrive space and struggle to get 1-2 FPS. I wouldn't even recommend this to anyone on the spectrum.
5709	0	a	You can throw your money down the toilet, which makes more sense.  1/10
5710	0	a	Just really not my type of game. I thought that it would be worth it to just try it out, but honestly I shouldve went w my gut and avoided it  EDIT: Wow, people really weren't happy with my review. Maybe if I put it in a more reasonable way: I had gone into to this game apprhensive, knowing that I dont like games such as Minecraft. I decided to give it a chance anyways just because of the great reviews &amp; my friends who love it. But if someone doesn't like beef, it doesn't matter how great the steak is. They just won't like it.

5712	0	a	Co-op is very hard to set up. 0/10 IGN.
5713	0	a	This game is alright, it get's boring after awhile. The first time you fight it's hard, but when you get better gear then it's like there really is no challenge at all. The bosses are cruddy and really easy to fight. The only thing I like is the multiplayer mode, that still get's boring. Even with MODS, this game doesn't amuse me. So what this game have more crafting recipes, it's just pointless stuff. I think this game could have been better if it was 3D , because the fighting stinks in 2D, it's just hit, wait hit, wait hit, wait, dead! At least in Mincraft you have to worry about 3 dimensions. . Switching Softcore to mediumcore doesn't change a thing, it only changes what you drop. I think this game isn't worth ten bucks. Why don't every sad little troll who owns this game get Minecraft? I think their to stubborn to admit that this game is a piece of garbo ( compared to Minecraft) but I do like is the equipment, I'll give them that, it's still limited in 2D.
5714	0	a	ripped off starbound 1/10 for effort atleast
5715	0	a	i cant play the 1.3 version because it requires a better graphic card and the cheapest that works fo i could find was £100.
5716	0	a	  its mincraft
5717	0	a	Spawned in a new world...first time playing...after speaking with the help guy twice, a giant bee called Stinger attacked me and i died. It continued to attack me 46 more times...sorry, but I'm not even going to give this ♥♥♥♥ a second chance. There's a lot better/nicer/smoother games out there that don't spawn a boss on you in the first eleven secodns of the game.
5718	0	a	Terraria is disgusting. A game made of pixels that isn't really fun. Pretty bland and stale so I wouldn't recommend unless your a little kid or into these disgraces of a game. I've prepared myself for the dumb fan boys to leave dislikes and rude comments because Terraria is their only life. Rate 3/10 Rank Bad
5719	0	a	I always loved terraria but when i recently went on, i lost my dude with hallowed amour, wings and a terra blade. SOOOOOOO ♥♥♥♥♥♥ OFF
5720	0	a	This is a really good game and I highly recommend it.
5721	0	a	Guys you should listen to this and stop blowing him off. The graphics in this game are high quality compared to the last one. If you are a noob then i suggest getting this game because noobs find this game more fun like a 6/10 man its like when your a little kid and things seem bigger but i mean pros it like when you grow up and things r kindaa smaller so if you want i guess just by advanced warfare if u r good but if u r a noob at pc gaming then just buy this cause it will seem cooler so over all i would give this review a 9/10 and stop blowing him off guys but this game gets boring kinda fast its basiclly a dlc to the original that came out last year so over 9.5/10 buy this game just be careful because when you are playing on line lik this time some guy hacked money out of my pay pal account so i would just download an anti virus so just buy kasperski or super anti spyware but i would actually suggest avast because it works i would probobly give it a 4/10 compared to all of the other anti viruses for pc. One complante i have is that the crafting is not as good as it is in casle miner z. i mean why would it not be as good. in casle miner z you can make many items like guns and shovels and in minecraft you can make jukeboxes and in skyrim you can make Dragon Armor and these factors are not in the binding of isacc which really dissapoints me. Also i cant seem to find the first person mode that was in the last game or maybbe im thinking of another game. idk. well you might be asking what if im not a noob or a pro, what game should i get, well i would suggest getting the dlc for the original and just playing that be my friend free ds is an average gamer and he loves that so i would just get that guys okkk? ok!!!!!!!!! Some of you guys might think that cod ghosts is the game you should get but it isnt. Now i really really love the graphics in this game as Ford F150 4x4 XLT Texas Edition. They show much improvement from the original but they are not as good as the graphics in the original. Most of you will call me stupid but im pretty sure i have a good understanding of what im talking about because i have a assosiates degree in Graphic Desighn from the career halmark college and i have published a few apps on the amazon app store so im pretty sure i know all about graphics. So in conclussion i would stick to the original game for one simple reason. the money. this game is FIFTEEN DOLLARS while the original is only five and goes on sale a lot like it will probobly go on sale this week so i would just stivk that one and buy the dlc and if you get bored you can just get a job and save some money to buy the pre sequal which is only 60$ and it a complely new inovation unlike this crappy game. So all in all i would just abondon the terraria series and move on yall cauese its like almost 2015 and our generation is moving in more futuristic games like Borderlands the Pre Sequal. Im going to tie back to my original point and say that saving your allowence and buying the pre sequal is the best and i would give this idea an 8.5/10 and the game an 8/10. So just remember to play safe and that graphics are not the only thing in a game i mean just look at Battlefied 4. The graphics are not that grate but the game is still pretty cool because it looks nice. Just remember to buy a good anti virus when you play online because of the hackers and common guys Ford F-150 4x4 XLT Texas Edition deserves a little bit more then 3% support so lets help him but this is just a better version of his comment if you have any comment or questions, instagram me @ckasper77788. have a good thanks giving.
5722	0	a	It really isn't worth your money, as the last update hardly added anything for new players and only caitered to the old ones that spent time grinding their way through the tedious garbage that is this game's midgame.  Don't buy it.
5723	0	a	This game was a piece of s****.
5724	0	a	I do not recommend this game if you get bored decently fast, I am not hating this game.
5725	0	a	sucky  its very bland its impossible to do anything and your worlds delete  i had made decent progress in a world and then next day its not even there
5726	0	a	Call of duty is a better game. anyone who says otherwise 1v1 me rust intervention only.
5727	0	a	If you like a game that spontaneously fu cking crashes on you then your in luck.
5728	0	a	its ok for a while then gets boring
5729	0	a	Another crappy 2d indie game pushed from the bowels of a neckbeard!
5730	0	a	Well, it may be an awesome game with great fun. Yes, I thought it should be. But saddly I got stuck at the very beginning. The very beginning... :( Really dont know what to do with it. Can my guide talk? He even died for quite some times before I managed to figured out the meaning of his exsistence... So, maybe I'll get back later with some knowledge. :(
5731	0	a	If you like making out with little boys then you should play this game. It's amazing. What's even more amazing is downloading a map with all the items on it and never playing it...EVER AGAIN.
5732	0	a	Doesnt work. When I try to open the game, it doesnt open, but for like 5 secons it'll say to all my friends I'm playing it. Can anyone help fix?
5733	0	a	♥♥♥♥ game, why did i get buy this 3 times
5734	0	a	I got this game for £6.99, £6.99! For what? I play and get ♥♥♥♥♥ by zombies then some ♥♥♥♥ing eye cums all over my face and kills me. My friend makes a house but some homeless guy steals the thing called jeff the killer of house manners. Fudge this game. AFTER ALL OF THAT I MAKE MY OWN HOUSE AND MY FRIEND COMES ALONG AND STEALS ME CHESTS ME GOLDEN CHEST. 0/10
5735	0	a	Good game but have to say no because I wanted to play multiplayer. A few friends and I have spent hours on one of us trying to host the server and followed multiple tutorials without even coming close to playing this game together. They should have made it simpler to play multiplayer. The 'Host and Play' does NOT work.
5736	0	a	it's a good game, but for whatever reason, i could never really get into it.
5737	0	a	After 300 hours, this is the worst Left 4 Dead copy I've ever seen. 0/10
5738	0	a	Terraria is one of the first games I got on steam. But i don't play it much anymore.  Terraria was a fun game when I played it but after I purchased the game 'minecraft' it got a little dull. Yes, terraria has some stuff in it which minecraft doesn't have such as guns. But once you get certain weapons on a character, you basically just won the game since when you start a new world. You're character's items and gear transfer over to the new world.  Multiplayer is fun-ish because when you slay a boss, someone can come in a jack your stuff and you can't do anything about it.  Terraria in my opinion wasn't worth the pickup.  Note: This is my opinion and I know people out there like this game but I just didn't enjoy it
5739	0	a	trying too hard to be roblox
5740	0	a	I do not like this game at all. I want a refund!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11!!!!!!
5741	0	a	Possibly one of the worst games I've ever had the misfortune of playing. It is a pale imitation of an unsuccessful product, a blurry image photocopied through a printer with no ink. Not a single asset is original, not a single idea unique or noteworthy. Though it is absolutely overloaded with systems, not a single one functions in any way that could be perceived as fun or engaging. This is a product sold through subversion and trickery. It does not succeed on its own merits, only through suggesting an experience much grander than it can deliver. This is a product that could not have possibly succeeded in any time other than now, any place other than here. Decades of technological advancement have created the ideal environment for complete and utter failures of game design like Terraria to thrive. A person could play this game for hundreds of hours, constantly believing that within the next few minutes, every disparate, poorly realized element will come together into some beautiful whole, some masterpiece that justifies the time and money spent on it by the developers and players. This review serves as a warning: that moment will never come. If Terraria represents where video games are going, I'd suggesting finding a new hobby.   Also, I kept getting recommened Minecraft clones, so I throught downvoting this game might tell Steam's algorithm that I don't want to put up with this anymore.
5742	0	a	As a fan of Minecraft since the Alpha stages, I thought Terraria could be a bit of fun. I was very wrong. Bad controls, graphics that are more childish than charming, and linear gameplay make Terraria pale in comparison to Minecraft.
5743	0	a	Weird game... It has a really really strange atmosphere and a quite annoying system to mine, craft or build something. It's more a point &amp; click game than a survival /crafting game...   Better stay with Minecraft!  
5744	0	a	I don't get why people like this game? xD
5745	0	a	Okay game. Worth $2.50.
5746	0	a	I'm serious when I say this is one of the worst games i've ever played. I don't know why people like it, I won't question their judgement, but I am going to question a lot about this games design, because it's ♥♥♥♥, and ♥♥♥♥ is fascinating.  +Easy to pick up on +Social game better played with friends +Alright boss fights  -A shamefully obvious attempt to jump on Minecraft's bandwagon -Published by 505 games, the company responsible for banning users from its forums for criticism and the second game ever to be recalled after release. -Super ♥♥♥♥ing easy, getting end-game gear is as easy as finding a floating island and building your way up to the top. Chances are you'll find adamantite and angel wings. Now you're set to do absolutely nothing for a few hours.  -End game can be reached super quickly, and there's nothing to do afterwards. Minecraft may be pointless to play beyond slaying the dragon or whatever, but here there's no real objective. In Minecraft you could set your own objectives, build your own cool-looking 3d ♥♥♥♥, but the 2d limits this game in that regard. -Better flash games online. Free flash games. Y'know... the kind you play in your BROWSER! -Map generation is incredibly limited, biomes aren't interesting at all. -The soundtrack is probably one of the worst. It's practically the same two songs and it seriously felt like a hot drill was being put to my head after about 20 minutes of listening to it. -No dedicated multiplayer servers -No matter how you die, you explode. This means you can fall a couple of feet at low health and you still turn into a mess of gore. It's funny if anything besides ♥♥♥♥ing stupid. -Water is annoying and cannot be traversed without flippers. Wouldn't be so bad if it weren't ♥♥♥♥ing everywhere, and if you didn't have to chance to drown in a seriously difficult boss fight just because you can't get out. -Combat is pitiful. Nearly every weapons swings in a complete circle, which makes combat rediculously easy. Ranged combat is hardly ever used outside of bosses and is just a simple point and shoot.  -2d perspective limits creativity.   ♥♥♥♥ game. Don't really care what people think about me saying that, but I say it with the utmost confidence. 2/10

5758	0	a	F*cked up and boring after 3 minutes NOT WORTH $10
5759	0	a	General Review:  This game is a pile of crap.  Pros:  -The advertising campaign -The fact that they sold more than one copy of this game  Cons:  -Controls are messy -Crafting is messy -Stay alive would be hard for Gandhi with all his patience   What could they do to make it better?  -Rewrite the entire crafting mechanic system -Fix the control system -Provide better explanation for first time players
5760	0	a	Just 2d minecraft, didn't find anything special about it you're better off with starbound since theres so much more to do
5761	0	a	3rd try to start playing. While I'm figuring out how to build a wall, the night came and everything I see it's a mouse cursor and I hear some one are biting me. So much fun.
5762	0	a	This is an awesome game. I play it a lot. I have an issue right now though. I clicked on my terraria game and started up a world. About five seconds later it popped up that says A problem caused the program to stop working correctly. Windows will close the program and notify you if a solution is available. It's been like that for like two days now and im getting worried. For that I am putting a thumbs down.
5763	0	a	I just simply never liked it &amp; never will , its the most simplistic &amp; boring gameplay you'll see.  For 9.99 you can get better games like FEZ or Rayman Origins (Rayman origins has no uplay DRM!)
5764	0	a	Why you hating? You just don't know how to play, so shut up and buy this game
5765	0	a	OMG GUYZ THEREZ BLOCKS IN DIS GAME!!!!!!! ITZ A MINECRAFT RIP OFF!!!!!!! IF THERZ BLOCKS IN A GAME, IT MAKES IT A MINECRAFT RIP OFF! DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! MOJANG HAS TO HEAR ABOUT THIS!!!!!!!!!!!

5769	0	a	Terrible graphics. I can barely tell what anything is. I get it's a type of art style but it's too pixelated. Too distorted. The controls are horribly awkward and the 2 dimensional gameplay is terribly awkward also. It's difficult overall to manage. It took me a while to figure out what the heck was attacking me. 0/10.

5777	0	a	this sucks do not get it is a piece of ♥♥♥♥
5778	0	a	almost perfect but i don;t know why you still dont provide Chinese version !!!!
5779	0	a	I thought this game would be like Craft the World or Minecraft or something but it's much worse. I don't really care about paying $10 or $20 or whatever I paid for this game but the reality is the game isn't that good. The graphics don't scale well if you have a high resolution display, the main character and icons are tiny, ok. Second, the gameplay isn't that great. Feels very alpha quality. That being said if you don't expect much or haven't played better games then maybe you can enjoy it. Thank you for reading.
5780	0	a	People go mostly fangay when you say anything about how this game is boring, when it IS boring when you play it alone. Same general mechanics like in Minecraft. Harvest in the day, hide at night if you aren't ready to take on the monsters. Rinse and repeat adinfinitum. Once you get stronger, or use a mod to boost yourself, you get to go 'raid' as they put it. Killing bosses for their loot. But as said, doing all this is as boring as playing Minecraft alone, unless you are using Minecraft to hand build worlds, statues and whatnot which you can't really do in this.
5781	0	a	Do not buy this extremely boring! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!
5782	0	a	this game lacks replayability
5783	0	a	i don't play this game anymore. it got to complicated. it's like 2d minecraft but more focused on the adventuring then the mining or crafting.
5784	0	a	I don't know in which category to post this, but for all the people who are saying that it's crashing, from what i noticed, it's only people who used a key to activate the game, also, there is a steam cloud feature to maybe help you out.

5797	0	a	I wish this game was fun. I really do. But it isn't. It's tedious, and the crafting is the least intuitive thing I have ever experienced. Even quitting the game isn't intuitive. When I want out, I shouldn't have to go three menus deep, I should be able to hit the X in the corner and wash my hands of the experience. If I had to dig up something positive to say, I guess that it's visually pretty cute while you're being murdered by slime and trying to figure out what a wall does or how to place a door.  This game does not even remotely live up to its hype.
5798	0	a	What the hell are you looking in the negative reviews for? This game is one of the best 10 bucks you'll ever spend!
5799	0	a	Ok so just started had one of my friends who play terraria sitting next to me, (because the game does not have a tutorial) im getting in to it finally have a weapon that can hurt a zombie. I'm feeling good, found loot found cash, even had a travelling merchant come by. Finally learnt how to build properly, Everythings great. (if your wondering why this is in the negative section ill get to that) I spent not ages but awhile playing the game. 30 hrs in and now i have killed every boss (not all the event bosses o and i had help) then it goes down hill, this is when fishing became a thing, log in planning to bring the ocean to the bottom of the world only to find my world isnt there, it sucked but i was like MEH, did as i planned and then had no more ideas. It got boring, more boring then trying to level up in HALO REACH, i quit for awhile playing starbound and come back and its hard to compare the two games, at 20$ in terraria you got a tiny world with no tutorial which was also considered finished then starbound pre 1. you get a whole galxy an intr a tutorial now its 1. u get a guided campaign multiplayer steam mods and different biomes other then grass jungle and desert if you want to buy an awesome game get starbound not terraria, if you read this your cool and deserve a cookie. but i spent 20$ on terraria so i cant go and buy you a cookie
5800	0	a	THIS GAME, I LOVE IT PIECES AND HATE SO MUCH BECAUSE EVERY FLIPPIN TIME I BINGE PLAY IT THEN STAHP FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME EVERYTHING GOES OF AND DELETES ITSELF LIKE HILARIES EMAILS SO MEH/10 WOULD ♥♥♥♥♥ SLAP AGAIN

5803	0	a	I like Minecraft, but never got to like this game, tried playing it more than 5 times, but just can't seem to get to like it.  It sucks. =/
5804	0	a	this game ♥♥♥♥♥ me and than spat on my shiny ♥♥♥, do not buy
5805	0	a	Don't buy into the idea that this game is similar to minecraft or starbound, all three games have much less alike than most people think. I personally think this is less fun than minecraft by a long shot. (I don't have starbound.) Probably the only reason I still play it at all is because most of my friends think the exact opposite. In fact they're all playing this game right now.
5806	0	a	Awesome Game Played For 3 Months , Then One Day Lost All Proggress !

5817	0	a	Oh man...words cannot express what happened to me after eating these. The Gummi Bear 'Cleanse'. If you are someone that can tolerate the sugar substitute, enjoy. If you are like the dozens of people that tried my order, RUN!  First of all, for taste I would rate these a 5. So good. Soft, true-to-taste fruit flavors like the sugar variety...I was a happy camper.  BUT (or should I say BUTT), not long after eating about 20 of these all hell broke loose. I had a gastrointestinal experience like nothing I've ever imagined. Cramps, sweating, bloating beyond my worst nightmare. I've had food poisoning from some bad shellfish and that was almost like a skip in the park compared to what was going on inside me.  Then came the, uh, flatulence. Heavens to Murgatroyd, the sounds, like trumpets calling the demons back to Hell...the stench, like 1,000 rotten corpses vomited. I couldn't stand to stay in one room for fear of succumbing to my own odors.  But wait; there's more. What came out of me felt like someone tried to funnel Niagara Falls through a coffee straw. I swear my sphincters were screaming. It felt like my delicate starfish was a gaping maw projectile vomiting a torrential flood of toxic waste. 100% liquid. Flammable liquid. NAPALM. It was actually a bit humorous (for a nanosecond)as it was just beyond anything I could imagine possible.  AND IT WENT ON FOR HOURS.  I felt violated when it was over, which I think might have been sometime in the early morning of the next day. There was stuff coming out of me that I ate at my wedding in 2005.  I had FIVE POUNDS of these innocent-looking delicious-tasting HELLBEARS so I told a friend about what happened to me, thinking it HAD to be some type of sensitivity I had to the sugar substitute, and in spite of my warnings and graphic descriptions, she decided to take her chances and take them off my hands.  Silly woman. All of the same for her, and a phone call from her while on the toilet (because you kinda end up living in the bathroom for a spell) telling me she really wished she would have listened. I think she was crying.  Her sister was skeptical and suspected that we were exaggerating. She took them to work, since there was still 99% of a 5 pound bag left. She works for a construction company, where there are builders, roofers, house painters, landscapers, etc. Lots of people who generally have limited access to toilets on a given day. I can't imagine where all of those poor men (and women) pooped that day. I keep envisioning men on roofs, crossing their legs and trying to decide if they can make it down the ladder, or if they should just jump.  If you order these, best of luck to you. And please, don't post a video review during the aftershocks.  PS: When I ordered these, the warnings and disclaimers and legalese were NOT posted. I'm not a moron. Also, not sure why so many people assume I'm a man. I am a woman. We poop too. Of course, our poop sparkles and smells like a walk in a meadow of wildflowers. Thanks for all the great comments. I've been enjoying reading them and so glad that the horror show I experienced from snacking on these has at least made some people smile.
5818	0	a	Game Has stopped working about 2 years ago, Whenever I would load the game, it would crash before even the click to play screen, leaving a white screen, and after a short time would show a 'terraria is not responding' message. I do NOT recommend this game until it has been fixed as you may recieve this issue as well and waste your money.
5819	0	a	Overwhelming Rating aside 0/10 on the super fun factor scale. (I'm pretty sure most reviewers just got this game from their friends because they are too poor to buy their own games)  What!? You got this game from a kind rich friend on the 75% discount days!? So you decided to leave silly reviews about how superior this game is to everything else!? *Gasps* My word...  Music is... *Gags* Boring, Ugly UI, Ugly Pixels design hooman race? more like poomans.  Just drop me into a boring bland world!? Ugh!  Starbound: Beautiful Music, UI, Skills, Weapons, Bosses, Interstaller space travel, multiple multiple infinite worlds, Fun. I honestly prefer starbound over this inferior trash (Shots fired) at least chuckle fish did things right even if they 'Copied' Terraria, well Terraria copied super mario an made it even worse! It's pixel it's all the same to me. *Nod*  Sure I didn't play 400+ hours of this game why? Because I have better things to play. Sure port forward an play with friends, but that is still bland asf.  My review summed up: I bought it, I gave it a chance.  If you're looking for some super awesome game go play Starbound not MicroSoftCraft or Terraria.
5820	0	a	ITS A MEME U DIP 
5821	0	a	you must have had a rough relationship with your father if you enjoy playing thisgame
5822	0	a	Fun at first, killing the pre-hard bosses and everything, but once you get to hardcore worlds, its almost impossible to move up in armor since your dying every five seconds by some door opening monster! The health of the hardmode enemies is ridiculous, and the damage is as much as a pre-hardmode boss for one monster!
5823	0	a	not my cup of tea
5824	0	a	it wont let me load cause of the graphics to much graphics 
5825	0	a	THIS GAME TAKES AWAY YOUR LIFE!!!  DONT BUY IT... EVER!!!!  
5826	0	a	♥♥♥♥ed up my afternoon by trying to join my sister in a game, just impossible, Ip adresses&amp; port are not given in game, but you have to work with that, so check yourself, and try, again and again, don't get how it has been developped, but I think it was with a potato...  (also, why isn't there a menu to go back to the welcome page of the game, once you can play on a server? seriously, how can you forget that...) I do not recommend that potato-developped game.
5827	0	a	this game is the most dumbest game do not buy this u cant get online and it doesnt let u build on single player

5829	0	a	the problem about this game is that you cant play **** multiplayer
5830	0	a	I bought this game because it looked fun, and I had never really done the 'sandbox' thing before (it was also on sale at the time, so for a few bucks why not?). It was interesting for awhile, and I could see myself getting pretty involved (build a tower to space? WHY NOT), but ultimately this game left me feeling frustrated.  For one thing, the guide in the beginning is not as helpful as he thinks he is. Besides some basic hints and facts, I had very little idea of what I was doing. It was only after looking up a tutorial that I finally figured out how to build a house and not die constantly.  Which brings me to my main grievance: I vastly underestimated the amount of monsters in this game. While I accepted them to be a thing at night, during the day they were almost as unavoidable. It would be pretty annoying to have to stop whatever I was doing just to keep the slimes off my back. And if I wanted to explore the adjacent landscapes? Instantly attacked by new (and stronger) monsters. Also if it's nighttime and there is an open flat space, zombies are guaranteed to spawn no matter where you are. Even in space.  These are my current hangups, and it's bothered me enough that I'm not going to play for awhile, but in the end it's just my personal preference. I'd probably be less frustrated if I could deal with the monsters on my own terms, rather than having to constatntly watch my back. I may open it up again in the future, but for now this just isn't for me.

5833	0	a	Please don't hate me for saying this. I do not really enjoy this game that much. I just can't get into it, I'm sure if I actually tried to do the stuff I would most likely love it. But, Alas, I do not want to spend the time on it.
5834	0	a	It is awsome but the good mods like omnirs and necro pack need to be updated and keeps crashing! have a fix tell me
5835	0	a	I didn't feel like scavenging for hours to find one mineral only to craft a sword.
5836	0	a	Much like Minecraft, I simply don't 'get' this. Do not recommend for those who like to dive right in with things
5837	0	a	You can very easily get this game free. Not my personal favorite, but it seems a lot of people enjoy it, so it's not like you have much reason not to try it.
5838	0	a	For the price of $2.00 this is a neat little game. I wouldnt call it much of a deal at the regular price of $10.00 sorry to say. Take a look at Starbound, it is a much prettier version of this game, but Terraria has much more depth. If the develpoers of Starbound didnt give up on the game, so many paid into, it could put this game to shame. So its a toss up on what one i like more. Ill have to play this one a bit more to make up my mine.  Apon firther testing i do not recommend this game. It just dont live up to the rest of the games it has to compete with.
5839	0	a	Meh, fun until you find that one exploting server thatg ruins everything.
5840	0	a	I got glitched because of this game.. Sandbox 2d survival game.
5841	0	a	Got the four pack, and played it with my friends!!    10/10 would buy 4 more  After a while of playing, the Game was still Awesome, but my worlds would always glitch out and it would crash everytime i tried to join them, and i would lose my stuff, so I cant play SinglePlayer anymore. Please fix D:  SCREW THIS GAME, NOBODY WILL FIX ANYTHING WE SAY, BUT, MY GAME DELETED ALL MY WORLDS AND PLAYERS, PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSEEEEEEEEEE FFFFFFFFFIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIXXXXXXXXXXXX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 0/99999999999999 DO NOT GET THIS PEICE OF CRAP OF A GAME
5842	0	a	There are people who this game will be enjoyed by. I was not one of them. In order to experience adventure, you have to grind an absurd amount and rely heavily on random luck. If you want to challenge yourself in combat, you're not going to have fun in a 2D slow-swinging sidescroller like this when there's so much better available. If you want creativity, you can do less in this game with the same amount of work as you can in Minecraft or other similar games.  But please, if you aren't satisfied with other similar games and think this might be the right balance for you, you should give it a try. I just wouldn't recommend it over the others, personally.
5843	0	a	Terraria is fun for a while. Then it becomes a part time job to manage your inventory.
5844	0	a	It's minecraft with less clear commands. The NPC that gives you advice doesn't really give useful advice.
5845	0	a	Gets boring after a while. A lot to do but is just to much work to grind and get good items.
5846	0	a	If your used to Xbox/Playstation controlls, then this game may not be for you. Unless of course you have a controller hooked up to the pc.
5847	0	a	Good game...However I would not tell you to get this for multiple reasons..One is once you beat the game there is nothing to do,two is that the devs that made the game will do anything to keep positive reviews...They even have paid people to rate the game good.So if I was you I would not get this game.
5848	0	a	Loved this game spent many an hour on it just buliding things with no plan in mind and doing challenges. Sadly the updates made it unplayable on my system as it killed my fps right down to 3 :(. Which I though was quite unfair, they basically upped the system load after release which is a stab in the groin at those with lower end systems that had already paid for the game. And for that I can not give it a thumbs up.
5849	0	a	Well that was a disappointment.
5850	0	a	This game is very boring and there is nothing to do, it's a waste of money and i recommend you don't buy it.

5854	0	a	to be honest its terrible. i hate that its in 2d and looks like a mario jump and run mixed with minecraft. nah.
5855	0	a	This is not worth more than a buck or two.
5856	0	a	I feel that this game is clunky and terrible, after having played it and compared it to Starbound. I got it for like 3 dollars + change and I feel like I paid too much.  
5857	0	a	Massive lack of information on how to play this game. No tutorial to start with which makes the whole process very frustrating. Game continuously throws enemies at you at a rate that does not allow you time to figure anything out. It doesn't pause when you go into crafting mode (which I haven't figured out as well) so by the time you begin to piece something together, you've died. Even if you kill all the enemies on the screen just to give yourself a breather, 8 more show up within about 5 seconds. So all in all, a terrible experience.  On the service, the 8-bit graphics convey a simple pick-up-and-play to figure things out, but so far this is not true. I will continue to give this game a shot as it has been very popular. But so far, it has been a purely frustrating experience. Or did I just buy Dark Souls, the 8-bit experience? I will update as I learn more.  TL;DR No introduction for new players coupled with a constant barrage of enemies makes it a very frustrating game to get into.
5858	0	a	Its awful
5859	0	a	Wish I could get my money back.
5860	0	a	Not really worth it if you liked minecraft.
5861	0	a	Can't buy 4 pack if you already have the game...
5862	0	a	dont get this game it bugs and deletes all your worlds and characters erasing all your porgress puting you into anger and depression when your pretty uch about to 100% it by beating every boss.
5863	0	a	If not playing with friends, then it gets broing quickly.
5864	0	a	If you are a hardcore Minecraft fan, this may be a game you enjoy. I found the tutorial too fast-paced and the game play frustratingly boring. I would recommend you skip this game and get Starbound if you want to try 2D minecraft-esque games.
5865	0	a	I like this game like i like Madlin Mcain, gathering dust im my libary

5871	0	a	2-d Minecraft clone
5872	0	a	Really bad game, feels literally like 2D minecraft but somehow even more boring. Really bad controlls combined with that does not make it that much of a fun game to play.

5875	0	a	Very ♥♥♥♥ game, the most least entertaining game ive played, and it was 10$.. What a joke loool
5876	0	a	Waste of $10, setting up server is annoying, gameplay is boring. Everything bad. Go play minecraft.
5877	0	a	Uninteresting, irritating, and difficult to adapt to, this game looked quite entertaining but proved to be rather disappointing. Combat was something best avoided, building early game shelters was like pulling teeth, and the items were difficult to read or distinguish from one another. Add to that unpredictable enemy movement, slidy and shaky player control, and the game's apparent stalwart desire to push you away, and it's a losing combination. On the whole, while the idea was excellent, the execution left much to be desired.
5878	0	a	This game....it just simply sucks
5879	0	a	i enjoyed this game better when it was downloading
5880	0	a	This is just a neverending freestyle game. Trust me, it is so boring to play alone in Single Player mode. I joined a few public servers in Multiplayer mode. All the public servers are disappointing. All the servers are administred by selfish ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who would just simply ban you for cutting down a tree or building a small house. I simply has been banned for something that I didn't do in the last server I played. Unless Terraria hosts their own game servers, I don't really think Terraria gonna last long. And forever bye bye to TErraria.
5881	0	a	THIS IS REDICKULOS I SPEN 286 HOURS AND I GET A ERROR AND WHEN I LOOK FOR MY CHARCTER I CANT SELECT HIM AND HIS STUFF IS GONE DONT GET THIS WASIT OF MONEY
5882	0	a	could be monitor but game looks pixelated
5883	0	a	NO, NO, NO, NO, NOO! The 1.2 updates absolutely ruined the game by adding spiders! You're probably looking at my play time thinking: 'You've played almost 150 hours of it!' THAT WAS ALL BEFORE I DISCOVERED SPIDERS!
5884	0	a	It is really fun and is a bit like minecraft just alot of mods and 2d so much you can do on here. 0/10
5885	0	a	Its just the same every time. I know this is a really high rated video game and all and i don't think it sucks or anything but i don't think its great either. I just don't get why people find it so fun to go around in caves for hours. I just find it plain and boring and for me personally this game has never been fun to play for longer than 2 hours MAX ! I mean its cool and and all to play it with your friends but... thats all there really is to it. maybe its just the fact that i really don't like 2D games but its not a game for me sorry!  I'd give it 3,8/10 Stars ! For being.. well you already know.
5886	0	a	Minecraft clone.
5887	0	a	This game is fun for the most part but by best items keep disapearing. This has to be the WORST GLITCH EVER!
5888	0	a	A game to play with friends  Cant play with friends becuase the system is old and archaic garbage   1/10 can mine, cool .
5889	0	a	NO NO NO. Minecraft rip off with bad graphics. Not addictave at all. It is just boring and childish, Get somthing else, this is right by cod ghosts.
5890	0	a	Pre-update: Hilariously fun. Tons to do as well as having a more definitive and obvious goals. Very expansive and large world to play in, weapons to collect, monsters to defeat, even hell is a possible stomping ground! Definitly not for casual gamers, can be very unforgiviing if you dont know what your doing. definitly a 9/10 in my book!  Post update: I really don't care for this game anymore, It may have something to do with playing several hundred more hours of starbound and enjoying that more, or maybe it has something to do with terraria just being boring. I no longer reccomend this title.
5891	0	a	If you liked Terraria buy it on steam so it can crash 5 minutes into you logging on.
5892	0	a	So I was playing Hardcore difficulty, it turned night and I've been farming some resources for a quite a while, spent some time into the game. Then my guide opens the door to let a eye in and kill me. 12/10 would do again.
5893	0	a	Terraria has stopped working for me. It will not launch anymore. I tried everythimg I could. Uninstalling, installling, updating drives for my PC and nothing happens. Forget about tech support they never ansered me. I requested a refund and I was told it is too late. So, I paid for a game that I'\ can't play. When I try to launch Terraria  atI get the following error message:  System.ObjectDisposedException: Cannot access a disposed object.Object name: 'WindowsGameForm'.at System.

5894	0	a	This Game Is Horrible.
5895	0	a	A lot of people was praising this (comparing to Minecraft) so I gave it a try. Killed some blobs and tried to dig a hole, didn't enjoy it. Want my money back.
5896	0	a	I alt-tabbed apparently out of this game for a long time. I did not actually enjoy the game that much pre 1.1 update but have not played since that to know if the newer large updates have made it more fun for me personally. I liked starbound for some reason but just couldn't get into this even though this is way more complete game than starbound is.   A game that most people will like but if you don't people will look at you funny.. especially if you tell them you liked starbound.
5897	0	a	Thought it was a bit dull and frustrating to be honest
5898	0	a	First of all, I want to make it clear that this is one of my favorite games of all time, and the quality is not the reason for a negative review. I have played 80 hours of this game as of when I wrote this, and I loved every minute of it. However, it's hard to enjoy something when all of that hard work dissapears; I was doing quite well in the game until I started to see small bugs with the world saves(map errors, npc housing resetting, nothing game breaking.) around 76 hours in. By that point I was already up to the level where I had an Adamantite pickaxe and Mythril armor, so I was absolutely loving it. Then, my worlds stopped saving. Not all of them, just 2 I hadn't played in a while. I wasn't too worried until my two main worlds became corrupt, crashing the game when they started up. I had been playing on my Mac laptop up until that point, so I tried using my desktop PC instead... Same thing happened. Now I have to start from scratch, and I feel just fine admitting that I feel insanely ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off about losing a month's work in a single moment. So, my fellow gamers, don't build a castle just to get it torn down; just go build it somewhere else.
5899	0	a	It's great except when you lose a world and everything on it when the game decides to fail loading the backup world. Also you dont Ever move the files because it will f everything up and ♥♥♥♥ you off even more

5920	0	a	This game will NOT load. It is a waste of money. I have had an IT pro come look at it and he can not figure it out. I have contacted Re-Logic and have gotten no response.
5921	0	a	ohhh boy, Terraria. I got word of this game from a friend after my Minecraft fever. They said it was basically like Minecraft except 2D, but had WAAYYYY more stuff. Well I wouldn't call this anything close to Minecraft, Terraria is so much better. I've played my share of this game and quit it from time to time, but it only takes a couple months before I'm back playing it again. The only thing I find REALLY gets in the way is the multiplayer. It's not linked with Steam so you have to go through a whole bunch of annoying processed to get multiplayer working which becomes effort than reward, simply because of this, i wouldn't suggest people this game unless you enjoy paying full price for half the game, because the best part of it, multiplayer, doesn't work.
5922	0	a	I really want to like this game but I just can't. The controls are hard to use and it's fun for the first hour or 2 but hen it gets boring really quickly. I bought it on sale and i think it's a bit pricey. I mean it seems like it could be a web browser game that you play for free. That's just what I think. Don't want to somehow offend anyone
5923	0	a	It's like Minecraft, but cheaper, and in 2D, wich sucks.
5924	0	a	Minecraft clone. 10/10 dont recommend.
5925	0	a	Not as good as the Xbox one
5926	0	a	This game used to be good, but they refused to stop adding things to it and now it's way too complicated.
5927	0	a	this game is so dumb for one reason gettin your friends to join is so flippin hard u really need to make online servers would make this game 1000 times more appealing ill change my review or make a new one if u ever decide to work on this i tired port forwarding and all that other crap just cant get it silly shi
5928	0	a	This game is great. It has a lot of stuff to offer, and tons of things to do. But, if you have played Starbound, Terraria kind of seems burnt out. I have only played five hours and i dont really like it that much.
5929	0	a	Local Servers Are So Hard To Play With Freinds. 
5930	0	a	Hulk hate
5931	0	a	Final Rating: 5/10 Closing Statements: This game was fun for the first couple of hours, but I gradually got bored of it and never really picked it back up again. If you're bored or you're a diehard minecraft fan then you ahead and pick it up. Yet, I really don't recommend this game because there are many other games out there that are more worthy or your attention.   A lot of people say that this game is the 2-D Minecraft and I think that's a fair analysis of the game. You gather resources during the day and get attacked by various 'creatures' at night. There's obviously no true storyline that comes across in this game.   'You survive, get better resources, build better equipment, and defeat more and more powerful monsters.' There is also a way to play online with your friends via building a client-side server.   Pros: Fairly balanced level of difficulty Semi-Open World Many different Items you can craft  Magic! Online play with your friends Build a house for NPC's and they'll be your best friend  Cons: The use of a wiki might be required I was never that much of the game mechanics. The process of creating items seemed more difficult than it had to be.  No 'developed' storyline Dig Down and Down, and Down, and Down :/  Note: I know there are a lot of people that love this game, but I quite simply couldn't get into it. I found the game very boring and 'rage quitingly' difficult at times.  Compared to this game, Minecraft takes the cake.  Save your money
5932	0	a	Its Terraible.
5933	0	a	I Really don't recommend this game because its very boring and it lagged me out. I thought it was going to be awesome as my friends told me but it wasn't what i expected.
5934	0	a	Gameplay - 3.  Game it is like - Minecraft but 2D instead of 3.  What is this? - The game creates random worlds for you to play. Like minecraft you are looking for materials to make better weapons and armor, except your tools and armor don't break. You also don't need to worry about food. The game features about 10 bosses, 5 different events that randomly can occur and has days and nights are 24 minutes long. Monsters spawn really rapidly and are easy to defeat. You can create a town of NPC shops that prevent spawning. Pros - Bosses can be difficult Cons - It takes a long time to build up your towns, find bosses, get materials to spawn bosses, search online for hours to recipes and how to find bosses.  I played it a lot because a nephew of mine was banned from Minecraft and wanted a game we could play together. It was fun to see the look in his eyes when I'd undercover new items and new bosses.  
5935	0	a	this review is red
5936	0	a	This game is horrible. Endless repetitive fights that don't take any skill, just attention; endless repetitive digging looking for just a little loot; work work work, dig dig dig, fight fight fight, and aimless wandering. This is too much like real life but without the variety that makes life interesting. This is a hopeless boring game.
5937	0	a	This game has its moments. These moments shine in multiplayer though. The game is only fun with friends who are willing to stick together, help each other and overall be there maybe not all the time but most of the time. Unless you have enough people to play with who will help you out, not fun at all.
5938	0	a	dis game is a poop
5939	0	a	(compared to minecraft):  positive: +far more monsters +more weapons  neutral: ~plays like a jump and run with weapons ~2D world  negative: -no way to build electric/logic circuits(like redstone) -town concept is boring and predictable/manipulable -the concept makes it far less versatile f.e.no custom-games (especially competive) like spleef arena
5940	0	a	i added tapi and i unistall it and it will not let me play terraria 
5941	0	a	no because right when i bought the game as soon as all of the downloads were done i click play and i did not work so who ever wants to get this game do not or you lose $9.99 cents ok.
5942	0	a	This game is crap and I would like to return it
5943	0	a	ive gotten this game installed on my computer, it was a friends game and he let me install it and gave me access to it and everything. It just wont let me play. When i try to open the game it brings me to the games home page instead of actually opening it. I really dont mean to complain but im really just disappointed. :(

5957	0	a	want to play  as FFV butz ripoff  swinging your axe like a yoyo and read a font worst  than comic sans ? this game is for you!
5958	0	a	The terraria 1.3 up made this game useless for me. I got a Brand new Dell Inspiron M731R laptop for the chirstmas of 2014(1TB internal, 2TB external), prior to the 1.3 update my laptop run it beautifully. After 1.3 update: I keep getting errors about graphics cards, ram, etc. Well i have all my non factory installed programs on a 2TB hard drive except for the required steam and terraria software. My computer will run any other steam or non steam program fine. So in conclusion 1.3 i couldnt even test it out because the update rendered terraria unplayable on my less-than-year-old laptop....oh well time to play F.S.15 or wait for windows 10 and try it again, otherwise i had loved this game. Update: yes i have checked online and on my laptop myself and it meets and exceeds all requirments... Windows 8.1(set to update to windows 10 when it comes out) 8 GB ram video card and graphics meet and exceeds, alog with everything else
5959	0	a	I just can't like this game. I really just can't. I have tried playing this alone and getting into it, ive tried playing with friends and getting into it. I just don't find any aspect of it interesting or fun. Then with the way my friends push me to play this game like its the best thing in the world, I just can't like it.
5960	0	a	I TAKE EVERYTHING BACK THIS SUCKS THE NW UPDATE RESET EVERYTHING I HAD. true excaliber, chlorophyte armour, guns, repeater, full health, full mana e.t.c.  I LOST SOME OF THE HARDEST STUFF IN THE GAME TO GET I MEAN SERIOUSLY I HAD THE TURTLE ARMOUR ON DISPLAY WHICH I GOT LEGIT
5961	0	a	Sorry,but really dissapointed about this game..i guess im not really to 2D games
5962	0	a	I never got into this game. I really don't know why because everyone seems to love this game. I played it when it first came out but it never blew me away. The only potential I ever saw in this game was when I played it on my smartphone. It seemed like a perfect mobile game if it only had controller support.  When I heard that there was a new patch, I wanted to try it out again. I noticed that I didn't have any old save files so I thought it was a good opportunity to start fresh. I decided to play online with my friends, since there was apparently a new feature that allowed you to connect through Steam. (Last time I wanted to play I couldn't even get the online mode working so I quickly lost interest) Ok, some minor connection problems at first but then I got connected and started playing. When I went on exploring the world the enemies started teleporting around me and killing me instantly. I was kinda bummed by this and tried googling for a fix thinking that there should be an easy fix for this since the game has been around for quite some time. I tried a bunch of things but nothing seemed to work so I thought I'll just let it go and try single player mode.  Ok, at least the single player mode works and I can finally play the game. I begin exploring the world and digging deeper and I'm kinda starting to understand why people enjoy this so much. I realize that I'm actually making progress and enjoying the game. I stay up late playing and somewhat reluctantly call it quits and go to bed. I'm anxiously waiting to fall asleep so I can wake up and continue playing.  I wake up, brush my teeth and start up Terraria. I load my character and notice that something is missing. I can't find my world save. Maybe I'm just tired, because it should be here. No, it's really not there. It has been replaced by a nameless world with an unknown world size. I try loading the world but it just crashes the game. This time I really hope there is a fix. Interestingly I find forum posts from four years ago that report the same problem, and a possible fix is to disable the autosave function. Well, it's too late for that now. I try the obvious thing and restore to a previous file version. The previous version is from two days ago when I started playing which would mean that I'll lose all my progress and the world is back to where it started.  This is unacceptable. Please fix the bugs or remove all the functions that will break the game or somehow make it worse. Or at least warn people that something like this might happen. You've had plenty of time to fix all these things. I really wanted to like this game, but I quit. I just quit. I'm done trying to fix a game that should not be this badly broken. I wish I could just refund this so I never have to try it again and be disappointed.
5963	0	a	And as of 1.3, the issues with Terraria have gotten worse once more. Mostly in the form of the most absurd last boss fight in history, so severely railroaded that it might as well come with the disclaimer 'you need the exact expected equipment setup and battle strategy to survive this fight'. Doesn't help that it's also preceded by no less than FIVE other bosses fought in a row. The insulting Expert Mode was also added, designed to pander to the sub-1% of Terraria players who thought the game was somehow 'too easy' before. I can only recommend Terraria as it stands if you happen to hate fun, as the developers clearly do.
5964	0	a	my terraria will not work something about a missing verifacation or something
5965	0	a	its not fun its very hard very boring and you will die alot i even tryed to refund this game but they denied to do it
5966	0	a	♥♥♥♥
5967	0	a	PLEASE READ BEFORE THUMBS DOWN: so i bought it. its really dumb. why do you have to craft walls to put in the backround? why cant it be like its better younger brother starbound? look, i know that this will get a bunch of backlash, thumbs downs, and general 10 year old hate. its just doesn't appeal to me. you should seriously research the game before you buy, such as watch lets plays, try it at a friends, and most importantly, get a feel for the game. study the mechanics, controls, and the general feeling you have when you play. for me, a huge survival, fps, and beat em' up rpg fan, the feelings i get are dissapointment, boredom, and confusion. the controls feel clunky, you have to jump out of water, cant swim out, yet there is a breath meter. you have a hotbar that you keep cycling through to different items, and just... the game gives you that 'ugh. really?' feeling. i dont mean to offend any fans of the game, but i dont like this game. i obviously didnt sink a ton of time into the game, but im sure some people find it more enjoyable after they make a bunch of progress.
5968	0	a	I'm glad steam refunds policy really changed so I can get a refund on this crap.  It probly isn't crap but I haven't at all enjoyed it. :|

5970	0	a	IT DOESNT LAUNCH!!!!
5971	0	a	i wish i didnt spend money on this piece of ♥♥♥♥
5972	0	a	So much fun!!!I highly recomend this game,its replayable,many vanity combat style and equipment combos,creativity in your buildings,2D platformer with dungeons that conatains amazing stuff which can be used to make even better stuff,npcs that are unlocked when you are meeting reqiurements they also need housing,many events like goblin army (which will annoy a lot as you get future in the game) also these events requires some amount of hp and gear and you can get some rare drops as well, easy mode and hardmode by killing hell boss (wall of flesh) many accesories acludding rocket boots nad wings,bosses which you need to kill to get for example driad or killing skeletron to get acces to the dungeon.Many bioms,amazing underground,not so easy when the game gets serious (hard mode) tons of gear and weapons.magical,ranged,mellee and newly summoning. If i have to write all to stuff os good about this game i would finish about hour later lets end it with price only 10E and goes on slae 2E,am saying buy it its more than worth it!Well after it crashed i got my main character and world dleted and backups or anything cant load the character back,even after it worked it did the same thing again,the game itself is fun but the technical page kinda sucks for me.(negative)
5973	0	a	It's just a meaty version of Minecraft. You gather for hours, you build for hours, you kill for hours, you get bored of it just as fast.
5974	0	a	i need help. the game wont start up it keeps on saying it has stoped working. and i have deleted it and then re downloaded it but it still wont work
5975	0	a	Just really boring
5976	0	a	Multiplayer wouldn't work. Thats the only reason I got the game and it didn't even work. If you want to play multiplayer you might as well leave the computer. It just doesn't work and it's a piece of crap.
5977	0	a	What I would think would be an amazing game with all of it's positive feedback from the community really let me down. It's like Minecraft but much less fun. Not as much about ceativity but more about exploration.
5978	0	a	Not my cup of tea. And to the viral fans of this game who stand up for it like it's their God, I really don't care about your opinion. I didn't like it, accept it. It's good to a pretty big sized group of people, but it's not guaranteed. Nothing is. For me, this game was very boring.
5979	0	a	really boring and i have no idea whats going on
5980	0	a	I just couldn't get into this game. It's super popular with my friends and tons of people but I got quickly bored after a day or two in game. I kept trying to no avail. It would probably be more fun in multiplayer with my friends, but they all moved on to different games by now. I can't handle strangers on the internet.  I like the music and backgrounds, and the randomly generated maps can be fun. Getting a house built before nightfall was really fun and driving force for the game. But I just didn't have a reason to keep at it after that other that upgrading my house. The worlds were somewhat repetitive and it being a 2D side scroller really damaged the exploration value. There's only so many pallatte swaps on the same map icons I can interpret as new area.  I'll stick with minecraft's creative mode. Terraria is just not for me. If you like platformers, 2D side scrollers, and getting attacked by endless slimes while cutting down trees, I'd give it a shot. If you like survival games wherein overnight the rapebeasts come out, I'd also give this a shot. But it's just not my cup of tea.
5981	0	a	Terraria was fun until my data corrupted.
5982	0	a	So, normally I would highly recommend this game. It is fun and full of content.  However, with this new update a bug has been completely destroying me and many others game. Terraria wont even launch, and nothing fixes it. It is currently a waste of space in my steam library, which I can't do anything about. When this problem is fixed, perhaps I'd recommend it once more.
5983	0	a	I've been a long time lover of Terraria, and stopped playing a year ago to focus on college and my career. I come back all excited with a new update! After dying countless times and being spawn killed REPEATEDLY (playing on the regular difficulty mind you), I get my hallowed armor and excalibur, and teleport home for a solar eclipse! Finally a chance for broken hero swords, right? WRONG. When I last played, they were a drop from frankensteins and swamp things, and an abysmal drop rate at that. As soon as I get home, I'm taken apart in SECONDS by the new monster that the Terraria dev team wants to bone you over with... Mothron. As if the game wasn't frustrating enough as it was already, apparently it's cool to have every other day be a spawn-kill-fest, and the guest of honor is you! I don't get it, why was it considered a good idea to amp up the difficulty so much? The fun game known as Terraria is now nothing more than a rage game for me. I can't enjoy this game anymore. Am I supposed to be playing ONLY with other players, and single player is condemned with all this needless difficulty? I'm confused and irate as all manner of hell. I cannot recommend this game to ANYONE on the account of how frustratingly difficult it is, as if the abysmal drop rates for the only items that can help you defeat the hordes of overpowered enemies that spawn-kill you to oblivion weren't bad enough. Thanks, Terraria developers, for turning one of my favorite games into a Dark Souls-Minecraft abomination.
5984	0	a	Couldnt really get into it, hard to understand. 5/10
5985	0	a	i dont recomend it but if you play multi you have a whole diffrent story coming your way and that includes ADVENTURE
5986	0	a	No controller support, none of the common mods work with the latest version, keeps crashing/freezing and can't be played fullscreen. No idea what actually playing the game is like after you wade through all this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.
5987	0	a	Formerly reviewed Terraria as a recommendation, now I just can't recommend it anymore.  - Fails to Steam Sync, causing the game to crash constantly. (Majority loading characters and worlds) - Crashes on it's own. (Loading characters and worlds) - Has a chance to randomly unannouncibly close while playing, causing you to lose all progress since your last save. - When crashing, also crashes the entirety of your Steam program.  All in all, while a really fun game, its nearly unplayable. 9/10 without the crashing. 3/10 with the crashing.  Fix your crap Re-Logic.
5988	0	a	Unfortunately, this game was too boring for me. Minecraft with mods add infinitely value, while terraria with mods seems paltry.
5989	0	a	I never really enjoyed this. I'm sorry to everyone who does, but I don't see what's enjoyable about it.
5990	0	a	This games great but I want to take this opportunity to blackmail the devs into adding local multiplayer. Not adding it is a serious oversight.
5991	0	a	Unfortunately this game is better on a console. No split-screen and controller support really ruins the game.

6004	0	a	Opened game, made a character, spawned a map, waddled around for 10 minutes figuring out all the controls, got literally no directions, tutorials, objectives, or hints as to what was going on or why. Just piles of menus, and nonsensical controls.  Not sure why so many developers now seem to think that directions and tutorials are passe.

6024	0	a	This WAS a fun game, i played it alot some time ago, and i still do on console. But when i tried it now on PC... The developers have updated the resolution in such a way that for me, the game is broken. I just cant play it, either it stretches and blurs, or everything gets way to small, i`ve tried all resolutions with a 1920x1080 screen and nothing works, it`s just become so unpleasant to play i`ll probably never gonna bother with it on PC again...  But it`s okay on console, so i recommend you go there

6027	0	a	I have a few problems with this game.  First in almost every game I played with my friend if I expolored left or right there was some area with over powered mobs, which made it feel like i could not explore much outside of the forrest area that we spawned in. Also there were not many caves that connected to the surface so once my friend explored them all I felt like that there was not much that I could do. Another problem I had was the bosses. When I did a boss battle the difficulty seemed to come from the boss spamming you and the 'strategy' to it was just kiting. And the bosses were hard to spawn so when some boss kills you just by spamming a bunch of things, you have to respawn it. Lastly when I looked in the negative review section, all of them were the same stupid 'joke' where people just said 'Why r u looking in the negative review section, just buy the game already!', which is just stupid because it makes the overall percentage of people who liked lower.

6032	0	a	Terraria... what to say, what to say?  so there are the pros and cons (kinda) the only reson i could not recomend this game to just about anyone is because for three months i have waited from a fix to the problems everyone was having and havent see one, i cant even open the game without it crashing. great game really it is if it would work for me i would still be playing but because it wont and nobody seems to care i say dont buy till further notice. p.s. gameplay wise it is fantastic well worth the money
6033	0	a	I hate this game because evrey time i move in the game the black border of blocks on the ground move and bug out and shakes and i just baught this computer
6034	0	a	Great gameplay. Lots of items. Very fun. Until it deletes my ♥♥♥♥ing saves and I have to restart. 2/10

6037	0	a	Do not buy this game, It does not work.The game just keeps crashing and crashing and crashing, and all of this on the title screen. I cannot play the game, please developers, fix this game! I want a refund. Every time you click on something in the title screen, it just freezes and says Terraria has stopped working. I just can't take it anymore.

6043	0	a	It is a great game for people who like to explore and all that stuff.  But... After 30 hours of grinding and exploring, the game just becomes boring.  If you like exploring, get it, if not, stay away from it.
6044	0	a	dosent work on me it sucks!!!!!!!!!
6045	0	a	♥♥♥♥ TERRARIA IT IS A PIECE OF ♥♥♥♥
6046	0	a	no local co-op. bring local co-op to pc. and controller support like why not.
6047	0	a	Chickens need to be added
6048	0	a	im really confused.. i have a mid 07 imac 2.4ghz with 6gb of ram . spec wise i should be able to run this no problem. however.. i try and play it and i get a pop up that says i can not play this on my platform. like wth ..
6049	0	a	This game is a lot of fun. However the best way to play is with friends and the muliplayer simply doesnt work. The game will not let you join a friends world and when invited you will be kicked within a minute of joining. Dont waste your money on a game that says it has multiplayer but wont allow you to play multiplayer.

6052	0	a	I have a fear of slimes, and at one point in the game it started to rain slime, I was so scared I immediately closed the game. Why must there be slimes in games ;(
6053	0	a	PLOT TWIST: I love this game
6054	0	a	Terraria killed my mom. It made her go dead. One day i came in on her playing with her Terraria husband. She loved him more than she loved me. I would ask her for food and water, she told me to ♥♥♥♥ off and die. I told her to get food for the dog but she told to kill my dog. I rate it a 10/10 game would never play again. Don t play this game or it will kill you like it killed my mom.
6055	0	a	sooo.... what happened to the 'monthly updates' the devs promised?
6056	0	a	First things first, I love this game. however, it seems to start having issues once you start getting a lot of hours. The longer you play on a world the laggier it gets and the more frequently it crashes. It finally got to the point where the world became unplayable and then the save got corrupted loosing me 150+ hours of play. I very much hope that this will be fixed, but until then, I'm going to hae to give it a negative review.
6057	0	a	Theres too much to understand and learn about and i find myself researching things about the game then actually playing it. Maybe it's just not my type of game.  Now go buy something else...     Han dies   
6058	0	a	Have ot been able to load this program!
6059	0	a	Can someone help me? Its not letting me run my game?!?!
6060	0	a	I really can't get into this game. I don't know why, but it just feels repetative. Even when you get gear, fight bosses, get better gear, you start asking yourself, 'for what?' After you've reached end-game, there is no replay value. You've already done everything the game has to offer. I will admit, there was some fun in playing with friends, but even we would get bored after about a half hour to an hour of gameplay, because it was just doing the same routine over and over again. Nothing exciting happens outside of the worms and falling into pits of mobs.
6061	0	a	Nope
6062	0	a	LOST MY CHARACTER AND WORLD ENTIRELY!!!!!!!!!!!! [JUST TO BE WARNED, THIS MIGHT HAPPEN TO EVRYONE]
6063	0	a	0/10 ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game that needs to get gud
6064	0	a	After the latest update I get ridiculous framerate drops whenever I use weapons. I have tried restarting the game, playing on the lowest graphical settings, etc. I cannot find a solution anywhere. The unstable framerate has made the game unplayable.
6065	0	a	It's an awesome game, no doubt about that. But they need to, and I mean need to fix how easily it is for worlds to corrupt. This is not just me I have been digging and looking and it is all over worlds getting corrupt left and right. So, please please please! Fix the problem with the worlds becoming corrupt.
6066	0	a	Originally, I really liked this game. Building my own little village is awesome; filling it with people and creating my own little 'community'. Exploring the caves and building my own mine system is great. Combat is pretty simplistic- and sometimes annoying, but alright. Sure, the graphical style wasn't my favorite, but I could understand why people like it. Everything was pretty awesome, that was until I reached the next evolutionary stage of the game- the spread of corruption.  As soon as you defeat the Wall of Flesh, the game kicks off and starts increasing the spread of corruption- changing the world above, and in my opinion- creating an unecessary stress on the game. I had the same problem with Majora's mask; the constant reminder that you have only so much time before you lose all of your items or have to reset. It's basically a chore in an otherwise amazing game. Dealing with the ever expanding corruption is the same kind of chore; a constant reminder that the world is being destroyed, and you have to check on it every once in a while to ensure it hasn't wet the bed. Which is what breaks Terraria for me.  An argument against this would be 'Just don't go into the next stage'. The thing is, so much extra content is in the next stage. New bosses, new 'villagers', new blocks, new weapons, new everything. It's like becoming a 'member' of a free to play game- like Runescape or World Of Warcraft. Of course, you must pay for membership in these games- with money that someone has to earn. In Terraria, you 'pay for the membership' with dealing with corruption. The thing is- it isn't worth paying for the membership, at least for me.   Which is why I like Starbound better. Progression isn't stressful, combat and exploration always feels fresh and new, and there isn't any constant reminders or chores that you have to deal with that would otherwise detract from the experience. I haven't played Starbound in a while, but as soon as I got it, I understood why I didn't like Terraria.   If you are okay with having chores in an otherwise amazing game, go right ahead. It's not for me though.
6067	0	a	i dont know why but when terraria updated my player was gone my world was gone and my brother's world was gone too! now he hates me and he has had 3 worlds and they were all amazing and they wereall deleted he was just about to fight the destroyer and tghen his world was gone! please help me because this game is awesome! and i dont wanna delete it  because of amazing worlds deleting and the back-up files dont have the worlds and my character! im sorry but i dont  recommend this game anymore unless this gets fixed......
6068	0	a	Uninstalled. Nerfraria is bestraria.
6069	0	a	This is a game with a concept of minecraft (one of the worlds most know games besides mario) its cheaper and fun but. It has a crappy system of hosting servers, there is no clear way to have a working server for friends or fellow gamers to play on. You might say this is a great game but i haven't had a great impression. To me this is a game for people who don't know about minecraft or if you don't have enough money to pay for minecraft but in other words i like minecraft better and this game isn't for me.
6070	0	a	PIECE OF ♥♥♥♥ GARBAGE ♥♥♥♥ THIS WASTE OF MONEY. (It was free for me, and I still feel cheated). KEEP YOUR KIDS AWAY FROM THIS ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T.
6071	0	a	I wish I'd read some negative reviews before buying this game. I appreciate the potential, but I'm not a fan of co-op or multi-player games. Don't get me wrong - I'm a people person. But when I sit at my computer to play a game, it's to enjoy some me-time. I found this game incredibly tedious as a single-player endeavor, and other reviewers seem to feel the same way.  So here's the thing - I do not recommend this game, but I think folks in the mood for some collaborative play would probably enjoy it.
6072	0	a	Were you done playing minecraft, well youre done playing terraria. not even worth the 2 euros. just go watch a lets play or something
6073	0	a	Simple 2D game that i got borde of very fast
6074	0	a	If you are looking for a enjoyable game in which to explore, build, be creative, and simply just have fun, look elsewhere. Terraria promises none of these aspects.
6075	0	a	Go buy Starbound.
6076	0	a	If you like long crawls with little-to-no progress and the most obnoxious mob spawning ever concieved, play this game. Make a town. Get unlucky enough to have goblins attack.  Without fault, you'll ditest this game and yourself a little more every time you pick up your sword and fail to scroll over to it in time to stop the marauders from turning you into gelatin in the shape of what may have once been human. And what is up with the female damage sounds? Why do they sound like a sensual moan when you're getting attacked by vultures or breaking your legs from a fall? The art-style is decent at least.
6077	0	a	I like Minecraft. I thought: 2D minecraft and its on sale! Don't really enjoy it.
6078	0	a	the game keeps crashing i quit!
6079	0	a	Sh**iest game ever . it cant let get back the crafting menu
6080	0	a	This game is a steaming pile of crap i defeat skeletron prime the twins and the destroyer and my world gets deleted for no reason no recommendation
6081	0	a	its ok can really get boring
6082	0	a	I bought this hoping to play on my TV with controller, but was dissapointed when i found out it doesn't support controllers (Unless i'm missing something here). Why this doesn't support controllers but the console versions do i don't know &gt;.&lt; Oh well
6083	0	a	There's doubtless hours and hours of content to explore here, but if you're not a fan of platforming, side-scrolling combat or endless grinding for better gear you're not going to have a good time with this game. Unfortunately I couldn't get to any of the 'end game' content due to the frustration of the clumsy movement and combat mechanics, and after 9 hours I felt like I experienced nothing of any value. Some people love spending hundreds of hours grinding out some cool stuff, I don't.
6084	0	a	(This is all based on a personal opinion if my playthough) This game is terrible Here are some of the reasons why 1- How the ♥♥♥♥ do I play this?: Hand holding sucks, but atleast a tutorial explaining a game basics is appreciated. Terraria doesn´t tell you ANYTHING on how to play it. That means searching on Google how to do basic ♥♥♥♥ like 'how to build a house' or 'how to place a door'. And the so called 'tutorial NPC' is useless  2- No multiple save files for one character: I have no idea why the developers haven´t implemented this. When you create a character you can choose what will happen if he/she dies.  Softcore- You lose money Mediumcore- You lose items Hardcore- Permadeath I went with mediumcore. I was having a ton of fun until I discovered a dungeon. I decided to explore it. I heard some the boss music, but I didn´t saw him, so I guessed he was below me. I was about go down to fight the boss when suddenly, he appears and 1 hit kills me. And my items are in the same place in which I died, so when I tried to go get them, I got killed by something I coulnd´t fight. There was no way to rescue my items, so all the time I wasted getting those items went to hell. And this could have been prevented if there was a way to save before entering the dungeon.  3- No way to skip the night section Pretty much self explanatory. If I´m not doing anything I should be given the option to skip to the next day.  4- No explanation on the controls I was moving some items to a chest, but it was taking a while so I decided to press Shift while cliking on the items. SURPRISE SURPRISE. That deletes the items... HOW THE ♥♥♥♥ WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW THAT?  5- The multiplayer is based on IP adresses and not servers, meaning that, in order to find a server, you must search the IP adress and then connect to it.  4/10
6085	0	a	Very bad game, dont buy this!
6086	0	a	I do like this game. Its just not worth a €10 in my opionion.
6087	0	a	I love the game its suppper fun and in my opinion its better than MC, BUT i am very mad!!!!! 2 times already my world has been deleted for no aparent reason and it jsut makes you not want to play it! Try it if ur intrested but im tired of playing it with this bug
6088	0	a	I had no idea what I was doing when I started this game....and I learned nothing. If I can't get into a game in the first 10 minutes, I don't see why I should keep playing. Maybe I'll try again another time.
6089	0	a	Waste of 10 dollars
6090	0	a	You know what I hate this game now, everytime me and my friends try and launch a sever it either lags out or just gets stuck on the found server pages. So the last thing this peice of s*** was good for is now void. Play Starbound instead of this obsolete game.
6091	0	a	Dont buy, simple as that. Kill slimes etc and dig thats it... :(
6092	0	a	Sucks massive ball ♥♥♥♥
6093	0	a	for a game that focuses on adventure, weapons, and killing things. the combat system is boring and simple
6094	0	a	the game keeps deleting stuff from my inventory and when i put stuff in a chest it deletes every thing
6095	0	a	meh. that's all, really; 'meh.'
6096	0	a	Worst game ever i cry the money i scammed to buy this
6097	0	a	I bought Terraria because a friend recommended it. I've had a hard time maintaining interest in the game. This may be because I compare it to Minecraft, and Terraria just seems like a 2D version of Minecraft.
6098	0	a	TERRIBLE! DO NOT GET. Crashes every time you make a decent world, cant mine above your head just terrible.
6099	0	a	This game is not a game that anyone with work, school or anything that you want to get done in life should play. This game is addicting even though it looks boring and is slightly is.
6100	0	a	All items went missing on death, disappeared from game. ♥♥♥♥♥ this shít. /rage
6101	0	a	I'll tell ya the truth here: This game is hard. Especially if you're too used to Minecraft to get used to it. Popular as it is, I wouldn't recommend it to those who think it's just a side-scroller clone of Minecraft.   (Get the game if any of the things I wrote didn't give you any hints. Find out whether it's worth the money or not.)
6102	0	a	awful multiplayer support. that is all.
6103	0	a	Blue thats all
6104	0	a	This game is garbage, don't waste your money. If you want to play Minecraft, play Minecraft.
6105	0	a	can't play on mac so when my friends got it we couldnt play i was disapointed  
6106	0	a	this game sucks
6107	0	a	it wont even let me play the game
6108	0	a	horrable game its boring when your not playing with friends then it makes you go around like a crazy person just to get a server port and its dumb cause i cant even get it up and me and my friend know how to do it     my last comment WASTE OF MONEY
6109	0	a	play thru once in a day and never again
6110	0	a	This is the least fun I've ever had playing a game. I recommend Starbound over this; Starbound is a beta and is still significantly better than this game. This markets itself as a 2-D Minecraft, without the fun of Minecraft.
6111	0	a	This game is sort of designed to be an addictive time sink and it's kind of transparent. Most of the game is spent waiting for your little man to dig so that it's satisfying when you've finally dug enough. If you're worried about spending your time effectively, it's not going to feel good to play this game.   That's not to say there are no fun parts. Exploring existing caves, getting lost down in the deep dark underground, and getting upgrades ARE fun. It's just that they're part of a game that's drawn out too long and I don't recommend it unless you're looking to kill as much time as possible on a game.
6112	0	a	This game it me is good but i just don't like how it reminds me of minecraft but 2d and starbound (the second game) is the same but with spaceships (this is just what i think)
6113	0	a	When I group this game with others that share the concept I am left thinking, 'I still like MineCraft'. Though it is a complex and fun game it isn't really on the same par. If Minecraft isn't your cup of tea, then this may fill the world creation void in your gaming.
6114	0	a	This game wouldn't be so bad if they gave you intstruction on how to perform basic tasks, like crafting, but sadly it doesn't. It makes the game extremely frustrating and unfun. Furthermore, the system for multiplayer is flawed to such the extent that it requires the use of Hamachi to utilize. If the game has a multiplayer option it should be multiplayer without the use of third party software.
6115	0	a	It sucks,terrible game it wouldnt let me do much of anything like jumping half the time,and placing stuff?good luck, i didnt even get an hour in before getting ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off and quitting
6116	0	a	I don't recomand this game...I played for 30 minutes ,and it's boring(as a FPS gamer) , If you don't like minecraft I suggest NOT TO BUY THIS GAME!!! For me it's just : Mario combined with Minecraft and Zelda , nothing special ,IMHO. I regret...I spent my money on this...
6117	0	a	I despise this inelegant, obtuse, pointless game.
6118	0	a	saw everyone playing the game and thought id get it on offer, played for 30 minuttes and couldnt figure out how to get my house made without anything gonig through the walls. spent an hour online searching and finally found out i ahd to build the back wall but no information no how to make it.  so i cannot with any sense reccomend a game that doenst even give a basic tutorial in game. deffinetly a 0/10 for everything.
6119	0	a	It was ssssooooo pathetic and boring....Watching paint dry has more entertainment than this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t game...
6120	0	a	DONT BUY THIS GAME.  This game is really bad made i know it's like minecraft but minecraft is better because mods and stuff but this game is like a piece of crap sorry to say waste of money!.
6121	0	a	Very boring and pointless, even when you play with friends. If you're not into sandbox games, do not buy this. I bought this game because I have never played a sandbox game before and I wanted to try it out.  Basically, if you don't like sandbox games, don't buy this, very big waste of $10, I would return if it was possible. Yes my gameplay time is over 10 hours but most of the time I just left the game on while afk. I played for like 3 hours and don't plan on playing again, big waste of $10
6122	0	a	i dont reccomend this game unless u like this sort of thing i just hated it my opinion i do not reccomend this
6123	0	a	I am losing my data every time I update my steam, dont buy this game.
6124	0	a	This is an alright game, but I'm just going to leave it as simple as it's disappointing. I give it a 3/10
6125	0	a	Someone else already said it better than I can: This is one of those games thats really bad and good at the same time, it reminds me a lot more of 2D Skyrim than it does minecraft
6126	0	a	so fucvking boring
6127	0	a	there is a bug with my game my friend gifted it to me and when i downloaded it it it would not load and it itis getting really annoying
6128	0	a	Momentarily quirky and promising, but very quickly pointless.  2 out of 5.
6129	0	a	It's an interesting little game but I just couldn't get pulled into it like other sandbox games have done for me. Perhaps there isn't enough visual feedback, I don't know. Clearly there's a huge player base for this but not for me. I would recommend to try it out first (or watch some videos) before buying unless you already know exactly what your getting.
6130	0	a	This game is a rip off of Minecraft, and I don't like it.
6131	0	a	Its a terrible version of minecraft. Its not fun at all and the controls are pretty annoying. By that I mean i hate using the mouse to do everything pretty much.
6132	0	a	The game is awful. It's boring, and the gameplay is very slow. If you want to buy this, buy it when there is a discount on the game 
6133	0	a	 www.google.com/THISGAMEISBAD    look it up
6134	0	a	I dont recommend this game. I say that because evertime i get into hardmode and get a pair of wings and some good items, everytime i go off for a bit my caracter gets deleted. Plz fix and maybe ill reccomned it
6135	0	a	This game is basicly a 2-D Minecraft. This games mechanics and bad, and the load up is worse than Minecraft, and Minecraft is a 3-D game. In the end, don't spend $10:00 on this game, unless you really want to try it.
6136	0	a	Terraria is a good game but if your about to buy it and have $15 stop right now and go look at Starbound just stop right now and go check it out if you don't like it and like this more fine but man are you missing out!
6137	0	a	Terraria best fits on consoles more than on steam. Servers are very hard and complicated to get into, and solo is just incredibly boring. The game is pretty cool for a sale but not for 10 dollars
6138	0	a	If you like a crappy boot leg minecraft, this is the game for you. Im not sure if this came out before minecraft but its just so so ♥♥♥♥♥♥
6139	0	a	EVER LOOK AT A FLOWER AND HATE IT?
6140	0	a	Personally I hate it ,but like most games much better when played with friends.
6141	0	a	If you dont know anyone that will play with you than dont bother
6142	0	a	its a really bad game brian
6143	0	a	I am apparently too stupid to play this game. Waste of $2.50.
6144	0	a	While I can see why people like this because of its extensive content, I found all of my playtime not really having fun, and more just boring grinding.
6145	0	a	Got old very quick. 2D minecraft.
6146	0	a	Bought a 4 pack of terreria for the kids....only one works....there are no instructions / info on how to get the onther 3 accounts to works ?????? well done....no emails..no nothing
6147	0	a	I've gathered a whole folder of games which are crap. This is one of them. - Oh, hi, Terraria. You're so popular! What am I supposed to be doing here? - LET YOUR IMAGINATION RUN WILD! THERE'RE TONS OF POSSIBILITIES! - mhhhokay, uninstall
6148	0	a	Not to say that this is a  bad  game. It's not. It's just kinda mediocre. It is very difficult to get anything done unless you have the wiki open and have watched a million Lets Play's on it. While MineCraft is more focused on building, Terraria is more focused on loot and combat.  The combat is good, there's nothing at all wrong with it. Loot however, is a grind (like usual though), usually being built by yourself rather than finding it in chests. By the time you find those chests you'll be geared up for anything, and I found the items to be a fair bit useless by then.  Enemies are varied, and the fact that people populate your houses as you build them is a nice touch. But other than building a nice town and digging deeper, it got old fast. Despite all the cool armor and weapons and tools and all these cool toys to mess with, it just somehow got old. The loot from enemies and in chests didn't seem to keep pace with the items I made myself, and so I found little incentive to keep going.  Personally, I prefer Starbound. (Yes, I'm one of  those  people, to the fans of this game). Why? It's basically Terraria, but with goals and a quest line. It has everything this does, but it doesn't get boring for some reason. The Multiplayer in SB also works, unlike in this game for some reason. I can join big servers owned by rich hosts, but I can't even join my friends despite going through all the setup, using hamachi, using router, etc... Private servers would seem nice but nobody I've tried to play with can get it running. It's a shame.  For a few hours or so, this game will be enjoyable. I suggest getting it while it's on a sale or something, because that justifies the price. Even though I've played this game enough, both online and offline, I can't say I've played 9.99 worth of this game.  Now, you might enjoy it, but I just couldn't myself. It was okay, not BAD like my thumbsdown said. I just say to you if you contemplate getting this game, think about it some more, watch some videos on it, or buy the futuristic 'Terraria' called StarBound.
6149	0	a	Cheap for a reason. 2D 'adventure' minecraft-esque, but far more annoying with tiny blocks, and VERY slow building processes and general progress.
6150	0	a	I don't understand why people like this game. It's boring, repetitive, and all you do is run either left or right intill you find a place you wanna make a house or explore for dungeons. For me this game was boring for all of the reasons I listed above and even more smaller parts that are not worth saying. Others have told me 'Well if you played with friends it would be fun, single player is always boring in these games' well that's not true either. With friends you still have the same things, running left or right, repetitive dungeons, and over all still boring. I highly suggest not playing this unless you have played games like these and you like them. (This is coming from a FPS gamers Point Of View).
6151	0	a	So hard, i can't survive a second at night, the eyeballs are to over powered.
6152	0	a	Not able to play on mac.
6153	0	a	Not very good didnt enjoy, minecraft is well better
6154	0	a	One of the most frustrating games I've ever played. There are no instructions in the game, maybe that's part of the lure of the game but it irritates me that basic things aren't explained. I've talked with one of my friends who owns this game and he tells me that he loves this game and I want to as well, but it's extremely unforgiving. When you die you have to go back to where you died and pick up all your stuff, which irritates me because I have to go back to where I died and face the thing that killed me without my items.   My only advice to anyone picking up this game is to use a guide because otherwise you will be lost.
6155	0	a	So I just booted up terarria for the first time...   There seems to be an NPC next to me with a text buble next to his head, I should talk to him. [LEFT CLICK ON NPC] Oh crap, I've stabbed him! Come back buddy where are you going!? [NPC finds deep water-filled crevass and dives in without hesitation]. Wow. He just sunk right to the bottom. Hey, what is that green thing coming towards me at an incredible rate of-- ow, he's attacking me! BATTLE STATIONS! Wow, this sword really is a piece of [DEATH]  Ugh, ok, he's going down. [kills slime] Sweet, he dropped something, let's see what it -seriously!?- Another one attacking me already? Ok, i guess I'll just have to [DEATH]  Ok, this sword needs to be upgraded. How do I do that? That slime is in between me and my tutorial man -I'll call him Tutorio- but I've played plenty of games like this before so this should be simple. [PRESS E] Huh, nothing happened. [PRESS C] Still nothing. [Press Tab] nope, hey something's hitting [DEATH]  Ok game, give me a freaking second to figure things out. Hey, why are red numbers coming out of the tutorial man's head? Is he drowning?! OH COME ON! Seriously? Ok, I have to figure out a way to save him, army of slimes be damned. Here I come Tutorio! [NPC DEATH] [DEATH]  Ok, ok, ok. This is bad. I now have no idea what I'm doing. Aaaaand it looks like it's getting dark. Of course. Wow, really dark. Ok, seriously, I can't see much of, well, anything really. Now it's pitch black. My screen is literally black [DEATH]  [DEATH]  [DEATH]  Ok. [DEATH]  This is [DEATH]  ridiculous. [DEATH]  Seriously. [DEATH]  I'm not [DEATH]  having fun [DEATH]  anymore. [DEATH]  How do I [DEATH]  exit? [DEATH]  [PRESS ESC] Oh! THERE'S the crafting screen! [EXIT GAME] 
6156	0	a	a good time sink  oh wait did i say time sink, which might imply this game is remotely fun, because i meant WALLET SINK UGH WASTE OF MONEY
6157	0	a	I walked five yards, encountered some unkillable demon, uninstalled.
6158	0	a	While I like the concept I have found the game to be extremely grind-heavy. Between the interesting bits you have to spend hours just digging around. Might be fun with friends, though, but then, what isn't?
6159	0	a	This is the only game I've purchased in years that I wanted to return.  Don't get this stupid POS, buy Minecraft instead.
6160	0	a	Tried out this game because I enjoy open world exploration and building stuff in games.  After spending a little bit of time with it though, I just couldn't get into it. The game doesn't teach you how to play at all, forcing you to search the web to try to figure out what the heck you are supposed to do. On top of that, the game has strait up zero goals or anything for you to accomplish.  Maybe this game would've been more friend with a group of friends or something where you could come up with stuff to do together, but it was horribly boring solo.
6161	0	a	'It's a clone of Minecraft, just in 2D, that's desperately trying to be different from Minecraft' -- is what I was told when I asked about this game. My mistake was I didn't take it seriously.  The further review is only for Single Player mode, maybe Multiplayer has some charm in it, but I wouldn't know.  So, this game is mediocre, you walk around and dig for stuff. For no real reason that I could find other than to pave a road for yourself when you fall into some pit. So, you walk left and right (because it's only 2D, remember?) and do what? That's the question I couldn't find answer to. At times you get attacked by some monsters that come out of nowhere. They come in swarms and they're brainless - even flying ones have single pattern of movement. You gotta fight back. You have a sword, a shovel and an axe. The best option is obvious - you shovel flying ones to death, because sword and axe are useless against them (wut?).  And that's about all there is to this game. I enjoyed oldschool DOS version of Prince of Persia more. Personally, I believe buying it even on a sale was a mistake.
6162	0	a	bought the game on this account months ago and still no help from official forumon why it wont run. already reinstalled multiple time and reinstalled xna and frameworks multiple times
6163	0	a	this game could seriously benefit from some in-game info. only a few bare bones ideas for crafting are given to you, the rest you'll discover on the wiki. bookmark it now and read it in the downtime. there will be exploration (fun!) and monsters (lots of fun!) and quite a bit of grinding (never any fun!). i've gotten to the part where you mine ore in hell to get gear to fight the wall of flesh, but it is TEDIOUSLY SLOW. and for me, game breaking. might try to get back into it, but at present feel stifled.  i would like to add that everything up to this point was awesome. finding the npc's. building your little town. fending off the invading army. and the exploring! do sort of wish the inventory was a little bigger, but that's a small detail. really everything leading up to the WoF fight, fantastic. cannot recommend based on the material bottleneck at this point in the game.
6164	0	a	I found this game very frustrating and difficult. To be honest, I wasn't used to it, but I personally don't recommend this game unless you are up for a big challenge...
6165	0	a	anover bby gam i was trickt in2 buying. its ok to play once but after it suxs. very poor replayabilillitie. bby gam 6/10. Remember subskrib, lyk,favorit, and no h8. ty-Autism Kid no h8rs
6166	0	a	Abysmal controls weaken this derivative, tiresome almost-game.
6167	0	a	Worst controls ever, might have seen what the hype was all about if I could move anything with any ease.
6168	0	a	shot my self in the foot then bit off my hands so i didnt have the choice to play!
6169	0	a	'just play minecraft'
6170	0	a	i dig to the underworld, which by the way takes me two days, and i get tonnes of good stuff, then my files get corrupted and i lose it all! bullcrap
6171	0	a	I don't recommend this game for Windows 7 or newer, because: - the game crashes on start - it took me 2 hours to workaround the issue: on my system I had the newest .NET framework 4.5.1 installed. The game requires and ships with .NET framework 4.0, but due to newer version present, 4.0 is not installed. Uninstalling 4.5.1 and installing 4.0 took me 1 hour on Core i7, 6 GB DDR3 RAM, SSD system. And 1 hour to check few compatibility options and google searches for clues. - I don't think that is something an average user can do. - And check the store page: Is it worth it? My answer is NO!
6172	0	a	I just don't like it. Not surprised since I didn't like Minecraft either. Only paid like $3 so no big loss.
6173	0	a	Don't get me worng this game is good singleplayer that is.But when ever i try play with my firends they can never join nor can i join there servers with hamchi and with out its, its getting extremely annoying
6174	0	a	Everything about it is great exept the world file and player file corruption. I had played 114 Hours and lost all of it to file corruption
6175	0	a	its good
6176	0	a	I got bored to death,It's probably just me,I find it really confusing,just like Minecraft this game gives you little to no info on how to play and you gotta figure it out.That's one thing that throws me off.I like the style,the graphics are nice,but I don't like how 'help' is being given to you when you start,
6177	0	a	I hate this game and I'm upset that I wasted my money on it.
6178	0	a	Wait is this just 2D Minecraft? Multiplayer is a hassle to set up.
6179	0	a	Okay to be honest there is nothing good to say about this game, people say it is better then minecraft but it has nothing to compete with minecraft it is one of the worst survival games I have ever played. (worst 2.00$ I have ever spent)  4/10
6180	0	a	Hmm.. dunno how to put this because there are so many people find this game to be amazing. However, I have put more than 10 hours and I am struggling to have fun with it. Sure, the first few hours was fun because you have to find a way to survive the first night. After that.... I lost sense of purpose. I will dig down and keep on digging.. not much to find. I will chop off trees and keep on chopping and got more woods than I can use, I will build houses for NPCs but... finally got bored. Will craft few items here and there, nothing really exciting. Anyway, I will take a break.. and will probably come back to this game again sometime in the future. My opinion may change then, maybe....
6181	0	a	Silly tutorial, you have no clue what u should do in the beginning, and when the zombies show up, you're done anyways. Pathetic!
6182	0	a	I don't know why but when i try to play it decides not to work. :(
6183	0	a	omg the last time i played this it just crashed but my computer sucked anyway but last time i played it there wasnt to much to do like i saw tin and lead and was like wtf is this but that just makes this game even more fun getting stuff and learning what to do so all around good game so i do reccomend this game to anyone well i would but that is until you realize that theres this bug that if you play on a world for to long it makes your game crash and you cant get it back
6184	0	a	'Minecraft? Never heard of it.'
6185	0	a	this game gets very boring very fast.
6186	0	a	Pretty fun if you play with friends.
6187	0	a	Those who've played Minecraft for hours on end, this game will probably not be for you. It's a gather resources and build type of game but I just got bored after an hour or two. A 2d builder just isn't as satisfying as a 3d builder. You'll never get those 'Wow' moments when entering your own creations. They'll never look or feel as spacious as 3d worlds.
6188	0	a	This is just a 2d Minecraft alike game.It isn't that exciting.Yea if you have friend you could have a couple of hours of fun but if you buy this and your friends don't have this you're in for a bad time.
6189	0	a	tewawia is not on fiyoh
6190	0	a	this game made me ragequit within 15 mins of launch.   Some people may really enjoy it, but i thought the system was really frustrating and i think a lot of the mine and build fun was lost in the 2dSS. I get that it has a lot of cool content, but it just wasnt for me.
6191	0	a	Not really
6192	0	a	Oh man I'm sorry, I just can't. no. I can't recommend this any more so I've removed my review. We finally got a patch that was actual content update but honestly it's just... it's so outclassed by Starbound.  Now admittedly Starbound is still unfinished but it's still better in its unfinished state than Terraria. Its art is better, its worlds and gameplay are better, and when they FINALLY update again, Starbound is going to leap ahead in how much fun it is so I'm afraid, give Terraria a miss unless it's super cheap. Sorry guys!
6193	0	a	we need terraria for mac!!!! its so boring to watch the people who have windows play!!!
6194	0	a	Buy starbound instead
6195	0	a	Terraria is fun and a great buy for any Minecraft fan looking to try something new but still play something very familiar. There is so much to do in the game from exploring deep underground to finding terrifying foes to building your dream home. I'd definitely recommend playing this game with a group of friends because it is a lot more fun and you can accomplish more faster.  Much like Minecraft though, the game can get very repetitive and seem like there is nothing to do once you have gotten higher level weapons and armor. The game could also use a better inventory/organizing system and DLC content (I know fans wouldn't mind paying a few extra bucks for something new in the game). Overall, Terraria is pretty solid for an indie game but I wouldn't say it's worth the money if not on sale or bought in a 4-pack.
6196	0	a	I don't know what to say. I didn't enjoy the game whatsoever.... Sorry guys
6197	0	a	this game is fun but when you've played for weeks and then everything on the game breaks and everything youve played gets deleted every time you open the game it gets annoying the players and worlds ive worked on have been deleted and corrupted too many times in a period of 4 days. this game is trashy and buggy
6198	0	a	Played it once long ago and had it in my head that i loved it so i re-bought it (after having it on a previous steam account ages ago) but really can't get on with it anymore.  Soundtrack is pretty sub par and dull. Gameplay can be very repetitive with some weapons feeling absurdly overpowered. Visuals don't quite have the charm to them which a game like this truly needs.
6199	0	a	i got it and it wont load
6200	0	a	WHY CANT I PLAY AS MY BEST CHARICTER!!!!!!!!
6201	0	a	I spent $1.99 on this game, and I feel like that money has gone to waste. The multiplayer is complex: you have to enter in an ip and port; you have to sign up for most servers. All in all, not worth the cash for me, even on sale.  However, I have noticed that this is a popular game. People clock in a lot of hours into this game, for reasons I'll never know.
6202	0	a	this game is a virus. it ♥♥♥♥ing doesnt let me open this shet and league of legends and dots 2 is better than this shet. go play hearthstone 420 yolo swag ♥♥♥
6203	0	a	Terribe game unresponsive controls with attacking being almost impossible. Looks like fun however trying to stop yourself dieing and unintuative crafting controls make me wish is was runecraft
6204	0	a	'I wish I was minecraft' it cries form a decade it does not belong in.
6205	0	a	really bad
6206	0	a	This game use to be a simple cool game but ever since they did the BIG updates its gotten a lot worse :( i used to love this game now i hate it sorry peeps who love it im done with it.
6207	0	a	Basically very addicting game. Once you beat it, it then becomes boring as hell. Don't buy...
6208	0	a	I bought this game in a four-pack and gave the other copies to friends, I ended up playing this much more than they did. The sandbox survival game craze was really picking up at the time this launched, and I liked digging and finding stuff in Minecraft, in spite of the problems I had with that game. I still had fun exploring and discovering things. I didn't care about crafting, or building, or fighting monsters, I was captivated by my sheer childlike sense of wonder.  At a glance, you might look at Terraria and think that it is a fun and engaging experience, and you would be right to guess that it befits the tropes that Minecraft ran through so well. However, once you get past all of the good elements, elements which Minecraft emulates perfectly for you, you have entered a game held back by a single flaw so frustrating that you should know not to ever buy the game, not even on a whim.  That element is the combat, which consists of single clicks to stab with a sword or to throw a boomerang. What could have worked is held back by obnoxious design choices. Randomly generated 2D terrains prevent you from ever escaping anything, zombies have too much health, enemies all do too much damage, and the platforming is a big time enemy that the game forces you to endure simultaneously alongside all these other wretched elements. If you are to die at night, which lasts as long as the f**king day, you are respawned at a default position in the middle of the night f**ked once again by all of the monsters that hit you for tons of damage and knock you around the place in this stupidly treacherous environment. Yes, Minecraft doesn't have good or fun combat, either, but at least the existence of a third dimension made it more possible to avoid things you didn't want to fight. Being chased by enemies in this game basically ends up with you running into a cliffside, sitting in a building for several minutes until night ends, or attempting your best at the terrible click-spam combat.  The idea of difficulty in this game is simply deciding how much you want to lose on death, if anything. The difficulty does not effect how annoying or dangerous the monsters actually are, so you might as well set it to the easiest to minimize the horrid punishment of combat in this game.  Terraria stops being an enjoyable experience once you make it to night, all of the bad design choices and frustrations make certain of that. Overall the worst game I have ever purchased on Steam. I am bothered that it sold as well that it did, but it was timed perfectly to feed off of Minecraft's popularity. Thanks developers, for creating a game where all of the mechanics and elements are necessary but not all of them are enjoyable.
6209	0	a	Its a 2D copy of minecraft AKA a peice of junk
6210	0	a	Game is meh. Such a hassle to even try to play with friends. Waste of $5
6211	0	a	This game is honestly horrible, I bought it for Mac and over the years it became a Windows game. I wasted ten dollars, on a game that isn't even updated on Mac anymore. Yes, the overall platform is awesome and has smooth graphics, but the developers who changed the game from Mac and Windows, to only Windows are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.
6212	0	a	it doesn't mean i hate this game,.....i just don't know ♥♥♥♥ what to do in it,...because i don't know how to play it :'c
6213	0	a	its fun at first if you got someone who knows everything, unless you do it takes 1 hour to find out how to make somenthing and make it.... if its a pickaxe.......
6214	0	a	Can't play... friend is using Library. ♥♥♥♥
6215	0	a	 Holy ♥♥♥♥   I have never had a more boring and bland experience in my life, and I've played current TF2. The game is hard to get into, and when you  do  get the jist of things, it ends up being a bad game overall.  3/10
6216	0	a	There is a certain knowledge floor to this game that makes it difficult to get into without friends.   Simply put, its not worth playing solo.
6217	0	a	Had to delete my previous positive review. The last update has completely screwed my game. Hope this trend of the Steam version of games being the worst ends soon.
6218	0	a	I forgot to downvote this wana be mine craft
6219	0	a	Why the hell would you check for bad reviews?   BUY THIS GAME!
6220	0	a	i love this game but sadly i cant recommend it.   player respawn times take so long, i used to love how after dying you could get right back in the game and run back to were you died if you wanted to get back what you dropped but now its 10 seconds and feels like a harsh punishment even on a single player normal world making it feel like a pain to even play. i want to get right back in i dont play games for any kind of realism i play to have fun and to get in to the game, but that comes to a grinding halt after death  there was a huge update recently and i really want to play, they added achievements and so much more but the 10 second long respawn is just ridiculous and kills the mood i have for playing.  if i can ever force myself to play again and get past the stupid respawn times and feel like im having fun again i'll change my review. but for now im dissatisfied with my favorite game
6221	0	a	WAIT HOLD ON, before you read this I would like to say a few things, no I am not a minecraft fanboy I actually do not like the game in its current form, and no I am not a hater because I have an opinion, so let's begin, terraria is the most boring game I have played in a long time, it's not a bad game but you just click and kill things easily, now compare that to minecraft the most common comparative it's combat is pretty much the same but the 3Ds of the game make combat feel more open apart from just standing and clicking, building however is much better in terraria but it only gets that from its 2Ds as there are thousands of options to choose from, same with weaponry and armour, but now for the part fanboys will burn me for... Exploration in minecraft you get to explore for pretty much forever and I don't know about terraria, note my time played. But that doesn't excuse again the perspective, I know it can be done right but it makes surviving, thriving and exploring really easy, if you see something before it reaches you or even sees you you can just walk away, In minecraft you have to see it, and there are 3 ways compared to terrarias 2 terraria it's kill or walk away, minecraft due to its 3Ds you can sneak by it, terraria is not a bad game, infact you might like it for the reasons I mention but I just don't like it or recommend it to the majority of people.  Problems: 2D perspective is bad for gameplay AI is ♥♥♥♥ing stupid there is way to much stuff for 2 options around something  Overall 4/10
6222	0	a	I WANT THIS TO WORK FOR MY MAC!!!!!!!!!!!!! HOW DO I DO THIS?????
6223	0	a	The game refuses to launch on windows 10
6224	0	a	why buy it when you cant even PLAY IT??!! 
6225	0	a	why is this game so popular
6226	0	a	Extreme mode is like wiping your ♥♥♥ with sandpaper....would not recomend
6227	0	a	Here i am still waiting for the mac version i have the game cuz i tought the mac and linux version would come out with 1.3 but i guess not ;/
6228	0	a	This game keeps on failing on loading worlds for some reason then I hit load backup then it takes me into a game of a black screen and my hotbar the game then crashes. I then can't join that world again because it says its an 'unknown' world and it does the same thing with the black screen. So I lose my whole world with all the items I had in the chests and all the buildings! I cannot reccommend the game until this is fixed as to because I could be a lot farther into the game without this it's so annoying and I dont feel like putting hard work into my houses and into the game!
6229	0	a	ehh not really fun....
6230	0	a	Terraria is a fantastic game. Incredibly creative and full of differences from Minecraft. Or at least, that's what i'd say, if something didn't change my opinion entirely. Me and my friend decided to make a multiplayer world. We've played for probably 15+ hours on it, and worked so, so very hard. Today, I opened Terraria, picked out my character and selected the world. Um... I.... selected the.... um.... Where's my world?! I found it was replaced with another world with no name, and the difficulty was changed from expert to normal. It said 'Unknown World', when I looked at the size. Upon opening it, I was left with an all black screen except for the item hub and an immediate crash. I've looked all day for a solution and all I could find was 'There is no fix for a corrupted world yet.' Honestly, now I feel like I've wasted money and 3 days. Do NOT buy Terraria until this bug is fixed. I can't even process how 3+ days of work can be gone so instantly. Terraria, you've cheated me. I will not be playing Terraria until this is fixed. I'm so incredibly sad, and I highly recomend you bring your buiseness elsewhere. There are other games on Steam you could buy and not be a waste of money. My Summer from this point on is ruined.
6231	0	a	The Slimes suck
6232	0	a	just beat the last boss on expert didn't get my end bag thank you developers for making this game suck for me v.v.
6233	0	a	Takes forver to switch resolutions and at 1080p you can't see a damn thing. Game froze while generating structures and then it's like a side scrolling minecraft. It wasn't fun before the new patch and it isn't any fun now.
6234	0	a	Been playing for the last week and now I can't continue. Once my world converted to hardmode I read up on demon alters to bring some new ores to my world. Turns out, every alter you break has a 66% chance to convert some 1 block into corruption somewhere in the world. 1 ♥♥♥♥ing block that spreads out to other blocks. What the ♥♥♥♥ is this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.   I want to contain the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ corruption in an area. I don't want to look for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ needle in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ haystack. I don't have a problem making gold farms. I don't have a problem cleansing ♥♥♥♥ because I have the stupid cleansing gun. But I don't want to ♥♥♥♥ up my world with stupid tunnels to hell every 80 blocks just so my cleansing gun can purge this ♥♥♥♥. What the ♥♥♥♥ is this game mechanic.   'Begone, Evil!' is the achievement you get from destroying one alter. Begone, evil my ♥♥♥. ♥♥♥♥ this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Minecraft doesn't even do ♥♥♥♥ like this.
6235	0	a	sucks
6236	0	a	I like how just scrolling through the negatives, people are just not agreeing with any of the reviews because their wet dreams of this game are too strong. But in all seriousness, this game is pretty stale, even with the creative aspect, sure its fun to build something, and that's it. Everything else is just a slightly different version of the same, boring thing. To be honest this game gets more praise than deserved, but that's just my opinion. Well, that's enough for this review, disagree away fanboys, you'll only be proving a point.
6237	0	a	Dont ever get this game if you are playing on a laptop. When my battery died and i got to see if i can play my game again my character was erased! ALL HIS CONTENT TOO he didnt even have sprite it was just a blank box but when i made a new character my other worlds were still in tack
6238	0	a	My brother was obsessed with this game. My mum told him to get off for dinner. My brother kicked her in her pregnant belly. Nah im just kidding my mum isnt pregnant.
6239	0	a	I never wanted a game that would get me so addicted that I would end up reaching 100 hours and counting... I never wanted a game that would turn all my dreams into a 2d game that i got for sale for $2.50 (in which i got from selling trading cards). I never wanted a game that would make me so frustrated I would do 100 fishing quests just to get one silly item to make a cellphone. I never wanted a game that no one told me was a curse. Ever... see ya. got to go purify my world so that all my 75 hours of work doesnt go to waste...
6240	0	a	Cant start up the game 10/10

6245	0	a	So ever since the 1.3 update, I've had constant crashing with the cloud save feature on and without it on, Terraria just randomly resets deleting all my characters and worlds. I lost 87 hours of work all because of this update, and it's just irritating.
6246	0	a	Cant See The Game On Screen Its Open But My Computer Says It Is Not
6247	0	a	I could never get this game to load.
6248	0	a	What why are you looking at negative reviews? THIS IS TERRARIA!
6249	0	a	Before this game i had a group of many many friends, then they made a server for this. Its all they play. Terraria killed my friends. r.i.p ♥♥♥♥♥s early 2015- late 2015
6250	0	a	I thought I'd like it but...meh. If you don't like the way it looks then don't buy it.
6251	0	a	Save me from the nothing i've become.
6252	0	a	This game is similar to Minecraft in that it's all about exploring to gather resources, fighting enemies and bosses for resources and items, and building structures. If you really like those things then you'll have some fun with this game. If you have friends to play with you'll enjoy the game even more.  However, if you're like me then it will be hard for this game to hold your interest. I really like it when games have memorable stories and characters. This game obviously isn't trying to go for that, but then I need it to have really fun gameplay to compensate. The gameplay in Terraria isn't particularly interesting until you've played for a ton of hours to get good items, and getting there just doesn't feel like a worthwhile investment of my time.  My favorite games tend to have a short singleplayer with exciting gameplay and environments, or a highly replayable competitive multiplayer. Terraria is practically the opposite of all that, it's one of those games where you aren't given a specific mission to accomplish so you need to figure out what you want to do. Some people could probably play it for hundreds of hours and not be bored, but that is just not the case for me.
6253	0	a	Help me i has update the game but the version still 1.3.0.6
6254	0	a	I'm not too fond of this game, but - it's a cheap bit of entertainment for you and your friends that requires a minimal platform to run.  The gameplay feels a bit static, Gear is all. Gear is unrealistic, but it's a colorful, cartoony world where anything can happen. There are bossfights that are enjoyable, and there are large worlds for providing a lot of room for exploration with friends. Singleplayer seems to get old fast, however. Though, that's most sandbox titles. Eventually you reach all four corners of the playground.  Combat is basic, the game feels like it lacked polish last time I played. I think they updated it once or twice since, I don't know. I can't say for certain that I will ever play this game again.  What this game really does well are its boss fights, despite its mechanics, and cartoony style. If you like cartoony, power to you. The boss fights are great, but its hard to hold up the entire game with just that. I suppose PvP in a large multiplayer server might be good, but I was never motivated to take it that far.  For the price of $10, playing singleplayer? I give this game a solid 5/10.  With a total hours a bit under 30, having played it on a friend's laptop a few times and a bit of offline play, I suppose I got $10 worth of content.  NOTE: I write this now, as it might be important to mention. I did NOT pay for this game. Someone bought it for me as a gift, and as such, it might influence my perspective on value. It was not my ten dollars I paid.
6255	0	a	WORST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYD NOW RECOMMENDED #WASTE OF MONEY
6256	0	a	The developers of this game (Re-Logic) have confirmed that they have been deleting NEGATIVE reviews of this game, and claiming any negative or suspicious review content as copyright infringement.  Some reviewers have come out and revealed that Re-Logic had PAID them to say good things about Terraria and spread positive buzz.  The main developer has said he made this game as close to Minecraft as he could without infringing, only for money, thanks to the Minecraft craze.  This review may also be removed due to astro-turfing.  Don't support this kind of behavior.
6257	0	a	I might be the only one in the world that thinks this, but this game is just f**kng terrible in my opinion. Buy minecraft instead of this,
6258	0	a	eh boring, good for kids, but i just got tired of it.
6259	0	a	I bought Terraria in the 2014 summer sale, and toyed with it on and off until a few weeks before the 1.3 patch. After the patch I began to play the game more seriously and attempt a completion. Unfortunately, the 1.3 patch and Steam integration make my game crash approximately every few hours. Even with this problem, I've been happy to save, quit and load back up periodically.  Today, 17 hours into Hardmode, I made it through my first blood moon with only 1 death. I quickly reclaimed all of my gear and continued playing. Approximately 20 minutes later the game crashed. This time, for whatever reason, every piece of equipment on my character was deleted in the crash. Some of it totally unretreivable without starting over on a new world. Frankly, it has immediately turned a game I was growing to love, into a crash engine that causes more frustration than gameplay.  If and when I can reliably play the game without countless hours of grinding deleting itself at random during a crash, I may pick it back up. Until then, I won't touch with with a pole. I highly recommend saving yourself the headache and avoiding Terraria here until the 1.3 patch is fully integrated into Steam.

6264	0	a	this game is totaly s''t you have to be a expert the at the game the first time you play to craft at all 
6265	0	a	Terraria is loved by many, but I don't know why. It's less user friendly than Dwarf Fortress.  The game is tight lipped about its basic controls, and this is something that you just can't afford unless the controls are very simple and very intuitive. They aren't.  For some utterly bizarre reason, the default settings don't pause the game when you open the main menu, so you have no respite from the enemies who WILL rip you to shreds even while you are trying to learn what button or mouse click you use to swing your sword and defend yourself from them. But the menu and its confusing submenus don't even offer that information. There might be a key binding submenu somewhere; I wouldn't know, I never found it.  I could find a few wikis with a Google search, but none of them mentioned basic controls either.  I managed to fumble my way blindly through the first elements of combat and building... and then I made a mistake, as one is wont to do when fumbling around blindly. I built a wall around my character from which she could not escape. Now I needed to know how to unbuild something. One would think that in a building game, this would be an essential tool to anyone, one the designers would want to be sure you understood from the beginning. But there was no help for me that I could find either in-game or in an online community.  My only recourse was to blindly click and swing everything, flinging my weapons gaily away while zombies chewed on my unguarded toes and a block in front of my forehead prevented me from moving.  It turns out that the solution was that I had to use a specific item, the pickaxe, on any block or item I wanted to unbuild. I discovered this after about 13 minutes of frustrated, blind experimentation.  The devs claim that this game is not a Minecraft clone, but I refute them. How in the blazing hells do you expect anyone who isn't a Minecraft player to intuitively understand that in order to unbuild things you need to hit them with a pickaxe? At least in Minecraft you CAN remove things without a specific tool, it's merely less efficient. Here, no such luck.  Tutorials don't need to be explicit or in your face, but if your controls are complex, or gods help you unintuitive, they MUST be present. Terraria and all its wikis completely fail to give a damn about introducing you to them. I have met seasoned players who can't answer me when I ask them how to control whether a placed chair faces right or left.  It doesn't deserve its legacy. Play Dwarf Fortress instead. It's not simple either, but a Google search and a few clicks can get you a user-friendly tutorial. It's the father of games like Terraria and Minecraft, and can compete with them in potential for building awesome things. It has a huge dedicated user-base, tons of assisting tools, a well-maintained wiki of virtually any information you could want, and it's completely free, funded by donations alone.
6266	0	a	never again will i enjoy the torture of this game it has too many glitches fixing the buges with expert mode would be a good start also a good idea for this game is not to have a 10 min wait just to respawn or geting to press any key to respawn, also in expert mode its not allowed to one shot you if there mobs that spawn too often like hell bats and eater of souls
6267	0	a	this game is bad it lags to much my guy got screwed up now i cant play as him and the moon lord is over the top hard and the towers are bad and time wasteing the game should be rated 4/10
6268	0	a	Even the bad reviews are good    This game is awesome
6269	0	a	Ever had that one game that all your friends love but you cant stand? This is that game

6271	0	a	OMFG. Why this game doesnt have Chinese!!
6272	0	a	Hit the 24 hour mark on this great game when the name of my character turned red. My character and my world were both corrupted forcing me to delete them. I do recomend you getting this game when they fix this problem. 24 hours gone, Not Cool.
6273	0	a	Yup. Edit: If only I was able to forward my ports I'd enjoy this game more. But no.
6274	0	a	this game is so boring firetruck it         
6275	0	a	I typically enjoy these types of games, but had trouble getting into this one. I'm sure the experience is better if you are playing with other people. Personally, I found Starbound to be a more enjoyable experience.
6276	0	a	No. Just don't buy this lil piece of cr@p
6277	0	a	I bought the 4 pack so i could play with my son and friends. After watching multiple youtube vidoes and hours of trying, it is impossible to set up a server to play with him. I regret buying this. There doesn't appear to be any ingame support and it shouldn't be this hard.   I do not recommend.
6278	0	a	this is dumb. I paid $1.25 for it..I kinda want my money back
6279	0	a	Can i sell this???

6287	0	a	Just boring.
6288	0	a	I found this game similar to minecraft. But Terraria is diffferent, no beds classical pixal sandbox adventure and you dont know what to do after a while. I would recomend Starbound why? You will see
6289	0	a	i just went on and i lost everthing that i had, all my saves are gone and now im really mad!!!!!!!!!!!!!
6290	0	a	so......feels so retro because of the graphivs. Buid system built like a house of cars. Vage as dust mission objectives. 10-10 plz help my addoction 
6291	0	a	The game is broken. The game refuses to accept any keyboard inputs other than the space, shift, and tab buttons, and therefore unplayable as intended. Do not buy.
6292	0	a	no cause some of you may press shift to put somefing in the invetory i tryid and i keep frogeting that it goes to the trash so i endedup deleting 10 op item because of it so f you and have fun

6294	0	a	it dont want to start if i can get a refund please do it because i pay to play  windows 7
6295	0	a	-
6296	0	a	amazing game.but this game is for kids that are 8 years old - 6 years old, the first 3-4 hours of the game will be fun, but then it will be boring,minecraft is better.
6297	0	a	cant host or join lan, cant host or join seaver. tried everything jumped every hoops 10 time, nothing works, if you want roll the dice and see if it happens to you be my guess but im so done with this game.
6298	0	a	I don't like this version I CAN'T OPEN THE DOOR! Idk why I'm not sure if I need a mouse I have one but I Idk if I should use it. Doors, chests etc don't work and I'm getting fustrated. Can someone tell me if I need a mouse for the Mac? 
6299	0	a	it does'nt work so i click it again guess what happens it does'nt work-_- please fix it or ealse steam is the worst game selling company! 
6300	0	a	I whant my Money back
6301	0	a	Beware the multiplayer servers in this game. I had an especially bad expierience with  jteeria.net . They refused to deliver a $25 expansion that I had ordered, and banned my account when I finally disputed the transaction.
6302	0	a	This game needs to die
6303	0	a	Hate it.
6304	0	a	Every game has a learning curve. Most complicated games at least have walkthroughs for how to play the game.  Terraria skipped that and said 'Suck it players'. When/If you start playing, I suggest you look up what to do online otherwise you will end up hiding in a hand-dug-hole from zombies for 2.4 hrs and never play the game again.
6305	0	a	Fix the god damn multiplayer Via steam connection.... Takes us 10 attempts to make it work.
6306	0	a	make it 98% off!
6307	0	a	DIG,BULID,MINE as soon as they fix the game. the bug is the play button dosnt work.pls tell me how to fix it if you did.
6308	0	a	I wanted so bad to like this game. I can see the reason peolple can quickly get hooked but i cant get to that point. It really doesnt give any information on how to play the game so you will have to go on tips and tricks on how to play the game. Everytime i go to explore i just die and forced to start over again. Its just so hard and there is so much too learn and it can get overwheming for noobs like me. Im glad that this game was cheap because i would have been upset. This game is not for everybody.
6309	0	a	Go back to the recommended. i recommend this.
6310	0	a	This is not a very good game and I regret buying it. I guess I'm just not into games with no plot, no direction, no goals, and no explanation as to what to do or how to succeed. Having to consult external sources to figure out how to play a game is not desirable to me. $2.50 was too much.
6311	0	a	dont hate me plezzzzzzzz but 0.1/0.11 haha no plz seriously? nooooo seriouslyyyy??? noooo seriousleeee? nooooooooo buy when you dnt wnt 2 coz ♥♥♥♥ gaem
6312	0	a	this gane sucks
6313	0	a	Waste of money! Bought it today and it doesn't work at all. All it has been doing is crashing and freezing! I do not recommend buying this game until they fix the problem.
6314	0	a	I ♥♥♥♥♥♥ LOVE THIS GAME BUT IT WORK START FOR SOME REASON I TRY TO REINSTALL 5 TIMES AND I HAVE A GAMING LAPTOP PLSSS FIX I REELY LOVE THIS GAME
6315	0	a	Doesn't support 2560x1080 resolution. Unplayable for me
6316	0	a	Not suitable graphics card!!!!!!!!! ARE YOU KIDDING ME I WAS PLAYING IT AN HOUR AGO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
6317	0	a	I'll start off by saying that I only got the game because it seems to have some sort of rabid fanbase.   That being said, I cannot, for the life of me, understand how anyone could find this game entertaining. The fact that I had to even leave the game and hit Google just to figure out what the game wanted from me and what I should do is off-putting on its own. Add in the fact that mobs seem to be sucked into your gravitational pull rather than being free-roaming creatures that you come across as you explore the world and you get one annoyed player. But if you're into that kind of thing, have at it!
6318	0	a	I dont get the point of this game without another player.
6319	0	a	wow i got hacked. i killed a nymph and wasted so much time on this WHY.
6320	0	a	Stuped game wont load up when i hit start and i only played it once last night so yea im done with this game its sad it seemd like a good game for the 9 hours that o played it
6321	0	a	0/10 Not enough Yo-Yo's
6322	0	a	One of the worst games I've played.  Terraria is a good game. ON THE CONSOLE! It seems like it was meant for the console, since on the PC version, things are much more difficult to do.  For example, pillaring up is something I do often on the console when I need to get to a higher level. On the console version, I point the right stick down, hold jump, and hold the block place button. On the PC version, you have to create platforms (not the item, but platforms out of blocks). You can't make a pillar on the PC version without something else to stand on, wings, etc. Another example is combat, which is an extraordinarily large part of Terraria. Maneuvering your character is harder on the PC version, thus skillful combat is impossible. Another thing that's missing is quick select. On the console version, you can bind certain inventory items to different buttons on the D-pad, so if you're fighting, you can quickly take out a health potion, gun, or sword. Or if you're mining, you can have torches in a slot, a mining tool in another, and an umbrella (an umbrella makes you fall slower) in another. The PC version has nothing like that.  All in all, I'm sad. Sad that I wasted my money on this godawful game. If you like playing video games, get a console. PCs were meant for work.
6323	0	a	well i would now like to have a refund because on my computer it doesnt even begin to function so i literally spent ten dollars on nothing
6324	0	a	its ♥♥♥♥
6325	0	a	This Game Sucks
6326	0	a	I had no friends before I bought this game, not the legendary p2000 god sido comes to my house everynight to punch me in the throat.
6327	0	a	GET THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
6328	0	a	I Loved it. but then. 1.3.0.8 came. then all my things were GONE. including my friends. they were talking to me about it. i dont know whats going on. this game is broken.
6329	0	a	Terrible, only buy and play it if you are desperate for something to play
6330	0	a	Wonderful game........execpt no pause, which means I have t exit the world, and then reenter away from where I was working, just so I dont die if i need to pause the game....very inconcient.  *Edit* auto pause is not a good slution for me still running in to a like problem.
6331	0	a	Terrarias great. one of the first games ive bought on PC and is what introduced me to the master race. But now, the more things they have added is kind of overwhelming and its hard to keep track of everything. I used to love this game but theyve changed so much I just can't get into it anymore.
6332	0	a	tim my m8 sold his lyf eto dis geme
6333	0	a	Every time I load in a pre existing world after leaving one causes steam to entirely crash...It gets really damn annoying after a while.
6334	0	a	♥♥♥♥ this game off and get Minecraft! its waaaaay better
6335	0	a	this game is still broken for windows 10 creators please fix this now or uninstall
6336	0	a	it dosent even work on my computer 
6337	0	a	Fun little survival game, although no tutorial. Hard to get into the hang of things without light and NPC's guiding you. After one hour still not sure what to do. Do I stay or do I try to leave house? Where do I use coins? Greatly could have benefited from a tutorial. Multiplayer didn't work.  From a F2P perspective it is a okay game, I got upto Tin armor/weapons in my time, then it just got repetitive. Huge P2P limitations if you want better armor. Needs more stuff to do except surive.
6338	0	a	loved 1.2, not a big fan of 1.3 though.
6339	0	a	Why are you reading the negative reviews! BUY THIS GAME ALREADY!
6340	0	a	What are you doing in the 'No' Area. Slap that Add to cart button NOW!
6341	0	a	Terraria is a great spinoff of the anime series Pokemon, set in the year of 1942. In Terraria, you must learn to accept your differences and cope with change following the third World War.
6342	0	a	i cant get on my mac and there is no beta to open the game up do i need to get the dlc first to play or something :(
6343	0	a	its boring 
6344	0	a	it keep not working for me i did undownload a  help some one
6345	0	a	Stick better to Super mario. This Jump&amp;Run here has maybe better water physics but a major problem in the Movement of the Character.
6346	0	a	.
6347	0	a	Im sorry but to me this game just isnt good, if you join late you have no chance. And everbody that likes this game always tries REALLY hard to defend it and its rwally annoying.
6348	0	a	Buggy, crash-prone, and has NO ABILITY TO ZOOM. (or it might -- I tried to launch it, and it decided a crash was appropraite. Since it took that position, I figured unisntalling and a public refuation would be a good rebuttal.)
6349	0	a	seawsdsa
6350	0	a	it wont let me play my worlds
6351	0	a	It's kind of ridiculous that I have to have two licenses and two separate Steam accounts in order to play this game with my son.  I'm not ready to make him his own Steam account.  It's not happening anytime soon so I guess I won't be playing multiplayer with this game. I'd much rather play Starbound anyway.
6352	0	a	Terraria Needs More Worlds. It get's Boring with just one and it needs more people.
6353	0	a	this game freezes every 5 secounds if not that when i click play game it will freeze 
6354	0	a	Everyone tells me I don't find it fun because I haven't gotten into it far enough, but what's the point of playing if the whole experience isn't fun? I don't want to be bored half to death, HOPING that I can finally get to the point where I can actually have fun. I want ALL of the game to be fun and engrossing. I wouldn't recommend it, but you should probably take the side of most Terraria players, as I'm the minority here.  Starbound is so much better  3/10
6355	0	a	The game is pretty boring; I had to consult a wiki to find recepies more than Minecraft (and that is something to say!) It took me forever and a day to figure out you need back walls in addition to your regular walls so no monsters can get in (rediculous idea) I got bored playing it a little past a half hour (90% of the time was trying to figure out controls, dying, and aiming to build a back wall...) Wouldn't recommend
6356	0	a	my computer says that the file is invalid. I already installed it for the 4th time and nothing happens
6357	0	a	STOP LOOKING AT THE BAD COMMENTS AND BUY THIS GAME.  The amount of content in this dumbfounds me. This game requires patience, strategy and for you to enjoy yourself. It succeeds in doing so. The entire game is an exciting blast from the moment when you spawn, to where you fist pump after beating the mid game boss, and when you scream at your friends after an amazing loot drop. Which reminds me that playing with friends is even more bliss than playing by yourself, and you odn't even need to pay a host, you just click host and play, then boom terraria has found a server for YOUR world to be hosted on and the save data from the multiplayer world will transer for to the single player world. Buy it now.
6358	0	a	'Nothing is impossible' Getting into this game was, for me.  I haven't had much time played but it seemed a very basic game: you mess around building some pixel walls and recruit NPCs to join your 'village'. I see people having fun on it on twitch, which confuses me because I found it really easy and basic.   Different tastes I guess :)
6359	0	a	The game was ok for the sale but got boring quick with buddies, I prefer starbound for its adventure
6360	0	a	If you like bad graphics from the early 90's, this game may be for you. Typical game play: walk left or right, your screen turns dark, and then you die.  I can't understand why anyone likes this game.
6361	0	a	While you CAN do tons of amazing things in this game, as stated by other reviews, I found the game itself to be boring and frustrating. This, as you can imagine, is somewhat of a problem, seeing as how you have to play the game in order to progress and be able to do awesome things and have fun. Can not in good conscience endorse, if you are looking for a similar game because the idea/description/videos intrigue you, I would recommend Starbound (also available on Steam). Please note: Although at the time of writing, Starbound is an early release game, and as such still in beta, it is quite functional, very enjoyable, and constantly improving.
6362	0	a	lmao this game is terrible. call of duty and minecraft are 69 billion trillion time better XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

6374	0	a	I love Terraria. Played it on friend's computers, played it on the Playstation 4 - I really enjoy the game. So, when I got the opportunity to purchase it for myself on my computer, of course I would! After downloading, I start it up, ready to begin another new world - when suddenly a 'Windows Update' upon launch fails. I try and try again, getting the same result. I'd recommend this game to anyone who can actually play it, but considering I can't (and I fear many others may not be able to as well) I'm afraid I do not recommend this and will be requesting a refund.
6375	0	a	I don't like the game no more it got modded too much I want a refund please need to but another GAME!?

6384	0	a	This game sucks. Results in broken keyboard, and intense rage.
6385	0	a	This game is REALLY repetitive and very bland, no actual story line, etc. -5/10 I gave up on this game a long time ago and I found out why. This has been my review for 'this' game.

6387	0	a	For the same price, you'll take more pleasure with a ♥♥♥♥♥.
6388	0	a	Every time i launch it it will let me create a character but as soon as I try to create a world if CRASHES. IT'S VERY ANNOYING THAT I JUST SPENT MONEY ON A GAME THAT WONT EVEN RUN WITH OUT CRASHING BEFORE I CAN EVEN PLAY IT 
6389	0	a	Okay- I changed my opinion. They have messed this game up since the early days; I used to love this game. I'm saddned and enraged by some of the changes.
6390	0	a	After you get all of the achievements, find out how to cheat, kill all the bosses, fully upgrade your character, and build a base, there is nothing else to do. Haven't touched this game in a while because of that.
6391	0	a	I recommend this game for DELETION! This is an AWFUL game. I played it for all of 15 minutes just trying to get the hang of the controls and have to say it wasn't worth it. The game is just awful. It's a terrible, terrible clone of Minecraft. Just buy that instead and stear clear of this travesty. Big thumbs DOWN!
6392	0	a	this game sucks
6393	0	a	why would anyone want this it's literally just mario maker only harder smh
6394	0	a	At the game's current state, I wouldn't recommend it. I'm not at all against the content of the game, its exciting and all and its content is fantastic, but if you don't have a website of constant spoilers or just happen to know to use the guide every step of the way, while also happening to trigger all the bosses by accident before being bored of it and calling it a Minecraft clone, you can semi-muster a blind playthrough. I respect the game for much more than that but too many of my friends have played it for 1 hour and called it bad based on a bunch of spoilers versus their immediate experience.  There NEEDS to be more in-game documentation so that these spoilers dont get through. even some of the crafting items that show up, like the frost moon present shows it on the tooltip. It also shows ectoplasms as a crafting ingredient, which may prompt people to look it up and it just spoils everything too fast.  A game like this shouldn't need to be spoiled so quickly. That's my only real reason for not recommending the game at its current state. I'll change it if they fix this. Hopefully Terraria Otherworld addresses this glaring issue.
6395	0	a	the whole tier/balance system is actually outdated. tiers can be easily skipped. there is only a rough limitation up to certain points in the overall game progress. it requires complete revision which is at this advanced stadium of the game practically impossible and thus not feasible. in other words = dont add, continue aka 'Terraria II'
6396	0	a	It's a boring and complicated game, all you do is grind and look up the controls because of how easy to forget they are.
6397	0	a	I didnt liked it that much. not my style
6398	0	a	It's really great if you like mindless ♥♥♥♥ 90% of the time and some kindof cool boss fights 1% of the time. The other 9% is you wondering why you haven't asked for a refund.
6399	0	a	Oops wrong button

6405	0	a	I like the Game alot, It's fun, addictive, and brings out the creative side of you! But a HUGE problem is all the random Problems!! For instance, I launched the game yesterday And it was fine, I launhed it today and it says 'failed to Start game (unknown Problem) And I did not update it, and It had no update's that could be downloaded!!! So if you want to get it, be aware. ever 2-5 months your game will not launch and say Failed to start, and you will need to go through A huge, long annoying, reseting process!!!!!!!!!!
6406	0	a	my world was 'unknown' and the game deleted my world :( spent 200 hours on it :(

6410	0	a	amazingly good game but in the new update i cant play it, apparenty no soutible graphics card found  goddam computer :steamfacepalm:
6411	0	a	UPDATE - From the perspective of someone who HAS played Starbound:  Without getting into the drama between the two games, a number of features in Starbound feel more polished and thought out than similar ones in Terraria, even basic things like block behavior and mining. Fundamentally, they're very similar games, but if I were unaware and had to guess which was the game that sat in Early Access forever, I would assume it was Terraria, since it just feels more unfinished and unrefined - see my original review.  I'm changing my review from a recommend to a do not recommend in light of having played Starbound, but that doesn't mean I feel any differently about Terraria in general. It's still a good game, I just would recommend you buy Starbound instead.  ORIGINAL REVIEW - From the perspective of someone who has NOT played Starbound:  Terraria is an interesting take on a sandbox game. It looks like Minecraft in 2D, and in some ways it is, though there's a bit of a WoW or traditional open world game flavor in there too in how its quests work. It has the same mechanics that many people find addictive in games of this sort - the freedom to create and build a world of your choosing. You get exactly what it says on the carton, in that sense.  My major issues with the game revolve around its scope and plot structure. The scope of Terraria is clearly restricted. Though you have a great deal of freedom in what to do in the game, you don't have terribly much freedom in how to do things. The heirarchy of resources and crafting stations is quite rigid, and the number of different environments and worthwhile endeavours is not as large as it may first appear. You start a new game, you chop down some trees, you mine some stone, you build a worktable and a house and put the guide in it, and the rest of the game flows about the same. Once you've seen one underground marble cave, you've seen them all.  This wouldn't really be all that much of a problem - tons of sandbox games excel with a fairly rigid set of rules, look at Factorio and all the people squeeing about that - except that Terraria's content is welded to its shockingly linear plot structure. To get wires, you have to find the mechanic character. To find her, you have to enter the dungeon. To enter the dungeon, you have to fight this boss. To fight this boss, you need a significant health upgrade. To get the health upgrade, you need to spelunk in caves for hours. But once you get a few, this other boss appears, and it'll really save time if you build more houses and get these other characters to live in them, and geez is this a sandbox game or an RPG? I just wanted some freaking wires!  The entire game's set up that way. As another example, a huge amount of content and equipment is walled off in something called 'hardmode', which requires you to travel to the bottom of the map (read: hours of exploring caves and mining and placing platforms, ropes, minecart tracks, etc.) and fight a very difficult boss. Until you do this, you can't access a ton of different tools, types of blocks, and entire gameplay mechanics. For someone who already has a strong character, this is fairly easy to do on a new map. For someone wanting to play an RPG with an exploration/crawler focus and minimal crafting elements, this is probably pretty fun. For someone just wanting to build some cool things with teleporters (or other similar sandbox game motivations), it's a huge pain in the ♥♥♥ and a bit of a turn-off.  So, I'm recommending the game because it's polished, well-designed, and pretty fun. But, you should know what you're getting yourself into. Terraria masquerades as a sandbox game, but if you try to play it like one, you'll get frustrated.
6412	0	a	The basis of the game is unoriginal and is repetetive. I play this game and it just gets boring too quickly.
6413	0	a	I know everyone that is about to read this is gonna hate me, but I HATE THIS GAME. What is this? A bad acid trip or something? It's full of a bunch of complete nonsense. For example, there's a weapon called the 'Electrosphere Launcher' which shoots bolds of electricity. Sounds like this game would take place in the future or something, right? But then there's pirates!? What the hell would they be doing in a futuristic setting? There's also zombies, vampires, a giant queen bee, and slime monsters, which were in Legend of Zelda first! It's an acid trip, I'm telling you. And then there's a Mothra knock-off called 'Mothron'. REALLY??? I HOPE TOHO SUES YOU, RE-LOGIC! So they ripped off both slimes from Legend of Zelda AND Mothra. However, Re-Logic did make Super Mario Bros. X, a game I really love. So I don't completely hate them, but God do I hate Terraria. If you like nonsense, go ahead and buy this game. I rate this game 1/10.
6414	0	a	I see you wandered off the wrong side of the review section. Don't worry it happens. Now go buy this monument of a game before and stop fooling around.
6415	0	a	Terraria is unfortunately ANOTHER overrated indie game. In such a short amount of time it managed to garner a huge fanbase of autistic nerds who can't wait to build stupid ♥♥♥♥ that nobody cares about. It's clearly a rip-off of Minecraft but they've gypped you out of one whole dimension. Someone call Super Nintendo, it looks like their graphics have been stolen! Look if I wanted a Super Nintendo I'd head down to Good Will and buy one for $5. Stricken by poor level design and hardly any platforming challenges, it's hard to tell what the devs were going for with this garbage game. It's no wonder that one of the lead-developers is a pretentious, emotional autistic nerd, who is well known for his deviantART poetry, 'The Art of Touching a Woman.' He also looks like Andy ♥♥♥♥. Anyways, Terraria or Minecraft 2: Electric Boogaloo is cookie cuter, uninspired, and overall extremely terrible.

And for pro gamers                 Just kidding                  im really bored             Help ;_:                                INHALE THE MEMES EXHALE THE MEMES INJECT THE MEMES INTO MY BLOOD STREAM                                           WHY HAS GOD LEFT US
6428	0	a	Now, normally people would look at this game and scream out 'Oh wow, they totally copiede Mojang and made Minecraft 2D!' Granted, the two are very similar, but personally I believe Terraria is a little more story driven, especially with the new 1.3 update. I really love this game, but there's just one thing that bugs me about it.  I HATE REPEATEDLY GRINDING FOR MATERIALS  I'm what you would call a 'Pixel-Artist', and I love making big huge 2D pixelated masterpieces. And it was really hard to do it in Minecraft because it has a very limited color pallate. Terraria, however, has a huge range of every color in the rainbow and then some. But to get a lot of those beautiful blocks, you have to do some absurd gathering just for one little piece! And have I mentioned that TERRARIA HAS NO BUILT-IN CREATIVE MODE?!  I really want to be able to expand my gallery of pixels, but it's hard to do it with Terraria because of this stupid lack of freedom.  I guess what I'm trying to say is, Re-Logic, give Terraria a ♥♥♥♥ing Creative mode
6429	0	a	Pros:  -Good Graphics -A lot of items -Cloud-saving -Cheaper than Minecraft -Better than Minecraft -Easy to customize your character -More weapons than Minecraft -Wires -Walls -Wings -PORTAL GUN :D  Cons: -You're looking at the negative section. -You haven't bought the game yet. -You're still choosing between Minecraft and Terraria  My tip: Buy Terraria   Have fun :&gt;
6430	0	a	Ok, seriously, what's with the deleted progress. I haven't played Terraria for a while and I came back since I wanted to play on a server. And then when I loaded up my characters... All gone. Not even my worlds are here too. I don't know why this happens. Probably because of a bug or something. I really want the devs to fix this, it's really annoying.
6431	0	a	played a tiny bit, its pretty good
6432	0	a	at first it works the second time you play POOF It makes a disk write error
6433	0	a	Too pixelated
6434	0	a	Terraria was one of the best games I've ever played, but after they released 1.2, I stopped enjoying it! Luckily through the use of (I don't know how) I have a working 1.1 cliet, I still wish RELogic would release the ability to download the old versions with 1.4...
6435	0	a	It can be fun sometimes, but when u playing just by ur self, its really boring... ^-^ so 1-10, 4.9
6436	0	a	If I haven't watched a ton of Terraria videos I would call this a Minecraft's clone. Probably a lot of people think that way. All I saw was from videos and they were awesome. Boss run, epic structures, amazing weaponry, the list goes on. But then you might wonder why I dislike this game. The thing is, it is very limited at the very beginning. All that great loot is random, and there is so many of it that newbies such as me get too confused. I'd love to play this game, but the beginning scares me away because every time I get killed by some random monsters and all I had was some horrible wooden armor and sword. I can't recommend a game that doesn't let me try it's full potential. Buy it, but only if you have a pro friend who could teach you how to play.
6437	0	a	Well, here i am writing my review for this newly terrible game. Since 1.3.1 the updates are just going downhill and making the game more boring and repetitive. Since 1.3.1 i haven't played Terraria AT ALL and this is because it's just got worse. In my opinion they should have left the game at 1.3 and just update purely for bug fixes.
6438	0	a	new opion - dislike the art style dislike the gameplay if you can call it gameplay soundtrack is anoying cant be bothered to right anything else old opinion - This game is very fun I find it is hard to restart because you feel under powered. Can get tedious when farming for certain items but still love this game get this and love it if your not a fan of 2d game I would not recommend this as the game to start with
6439	0	a	honestly one of my favorite games ever till now, my 40 hour playthrough with tons of work just got corupted and theres literally no way to fix it.. this is the third time this has happend, it happend twice in 1.1 and i thought it would be fixed but nah
6440	0	a	Nah just kiddin, its the greatest game ever!!! Even other negative reviews agree with me! No, seriously, go check it out if you dont believe me. Hands down the greatest RPG game I've ever played!

6442	0	a	Game can't run anymore Which is crazy because they didn't even update the specs in the steam page It's one thing to ruin the optimization It's another to lie to those looking to buy your game  Keep in mind this isn't a small drop in fps I went from running a constant 60 and having no issues once so ever on the highest settings To having low 20s-30s at best on lowest graphics It's basically unplayable now
6443	0	a	The game wont open for me. I love Terraria so i bought it on christmas and i played it once. I tried to play it again but it just wont open.

6447	0	a	I installed Steam on all of my children's computers as I was informed that the games on the platform would prove more reliable than having a disk. What an utter bloody mistake.  Having spent a week trying to install it, but consistantly coming up with an Error code, I tried to use the support but had to find a log on, tried to ask for advice on Facebook, received no guidance, looked on the help forums, and Googled as many ideas as I could to try and understand why it would not upload on my sons computer (note: it was installed, and then decided one morning simply not to work).  Thinking it must be a problem with the computer, I took the laptop into the computer shop, and had them completely clean out and reinstall my sons computer at a cost of $150, only to discover on getting it home that guess what..... IT STILL WON'T REINSTALL. To say I'm hacked off is an understatement. I pay for games, I expect my kids to be able to play them.  I am not interested in getting a Steam Support log in, I simply want them to be able to play the game I paid for? Is that at all possible? I'd appreciate some support from someone sometime soon, as now, out of pocket, I've actually had enough.

6449	0	a	This was my favorite game- until.... I LOST TWO MAPS WITH GREAT ITEMS IN THE CRATES!  -_- I tried to restore them on my laptop which runs on windows, but to no avail. First one- I had a house in the sky and everyone had a home, 9 heart crystals, 15 mana were in a crate box. I was already at full health so I had extra. That one crashed. Then I started going to my other map, where I had a special home designed like a japaneese garden. :/ And then it crashed today- no clue why. But I worked hard on it, really hard- and for some odd reason- I got kicked out of the game- when I tried to restore a back up file and it would not work. :'( And now the world's backup file is gone. I'm sure it's windows doing this- but I would love for this game to not fight with Windows for effing sake!  I love this game, but have to change my review due to this experience. I'm beyond frustrated now. I've been working my ♥♥♥ off this whole week so I can fight bosses. Now- I'm back at flipping square one, except what's left on my character. :(

6452	0	a	i got cancer playing this game.
6453	0	a	i got cancer playing this game.
6454	0	a	I can't even play it. Waste of time and money
6455	0	a	Edit: Can no longer recommend this game, its broken in so many ways. Death from random heights, no matter how close you are to the ground, you can die from a 2 block drop. Health Potions are taking 5 to 10 minutes between uses, yet every wiki or set of information states it should not be doing this. Developers have failed to respond to inquiries and support tickets submitted to them.
6456	0	a	The game is really cute, but as far as I'm concerned that's the only thing it's got going for it. Pros: + Cute, nice looking art style. + Straight forward easy to understand gameplay  Cons: - Awkward, stiff and clunky controls which add frustration and more difficulty than there should be. - Only supports use of one gamepad at a time, meaning that in co-op someone has to use the keyboard which controls are even worse. - Local co-op only. - Unforgiving gameplay (could be a positive, depending on your opinion)  Tl;Dr: Tobe's Vertical Adventure is a cute game with really awkward and broken controls, which on sale might be worth buying but I would recommend spending your hard earned money on something else.  Thanks for reading my review, have a great day!
6457	0	a	Don't want to read much: Pro: + Platformer + Looks nice + Cheap (when on sale)  Con: - Bad Controls (imprecise) - Button colors/labels ingame do not match with xbox controller (the one tobe seems to hold) - Flow interrupting 'cutscene' in every level - No two controller coop, just controller/keyboard (title supports only local coop) - Tiny resolution - Unable to exit the game with the controller   I usually enjoy platformer, especially short and independet ones with great music.  I don't really care for the graphics, although I have to say Tobe's looked pretty appealing to me on the screenshots.  However nice graphics cannot make up for broken control mechanics, which are in my opinion the most important part of any platformer.
6458	0	a	Tobe's Vertical Adventure is one of those games that makes me long for a ~Meh~ option for steam reviews.   Right, right, so what've we got here? Well, Tobe's Vertical Adventure is a Side-Scrolling... Er, Up-n'-Down-Scrolling(?) platformer where the idea is to get from the top of a cave to the bottom and then make your escape back to the entrance, all while collecting gems and animals as you descend/ascend. It offers two different playable characters for singleplayer and multiplayer story modes across four different worlds, each with four levels. So lets get started shall we?   First of all I'd like to mention the presentation. The majority of the game is represented in the form of sprites, with some art slides that are used as cutscenes and such. The style of the art is nice; it's a simplistic style where everything is gratuitously round for some reason or another. I'm being told it's cute, but something about the hips of both characters being twice the size of their heads puts me off... Anyway, it works, but it's nothing I can say is spectacular. The in-game sprites also look okay and have decent animation to them, but I noticed that a fair few of them were blurry or lacked sharpness, specifically the character sprites. Overall, it's a quaint artstyle, but it's nothing to write home about.   Audio is also just okay. Not a lot of music to listen to; There's the menu music, one track for each world, and then some cutscene music. Once again, none of it is /really/ good, just kinda okay. I suppose I liked the 1st and 3rd world's music the best, seeing as I remember them the most, but it's still all... Whatever y'know? Sound effects as well, which really wouldn't even be noted in this review if it wasn't for the fact that many sound effects occuring at the same time will cause the sound to increase in volume exponentially. Collecting gems becomes a little less fun when you start hearing 'ding, Ding, DING, DDDIIIINNNGGG' as you pick them up in groups.   Put hey, as long as the gameplay if fun, right?... Er, well, it's okay. That's the word of the day folks. As previously mentioned, you start at the top of the level and must make your way down to a chest at the bottom. You'll encounter stage-specific traps and collect power-ups such as balloons and ropes... Which is to say those are the only items you collect. Balloons allow you to float down for a short period of time and ropes can be thrown to the ceiling where they'll hang down and you can climb them. In all honesty though, I never really /needed/ these items. Aside from using balloons to break my fall simply so I could go down a vertical shaft a little more quickly for my own convenience, everything can be done almost, if not just as easily without these items. They /can/ occasionally be used to make speedruns easier, but speedrunning, while encouraged, is not the main focus of the game.   The worlds don't have a whole lot of diference in them either. The first one is just a cave; there are some enemies that walk back and forth, nothing really special. The second world is an ice world that introduces horizontally positioned ropes, and has invisible blocks as one of it's level gimmicks. There's also a trap that's, like, an impossible-to-see fake wall that'll drop on you from the background, but it only appears twice and it's where you'll be running so fast that you'll pass them without a second thought. Third world is the lava world, so there's lava and stuff. This world has these bubbles that'll pop and bounce you up when you land on them, which make the platforming a little more interesting. Thing is, these bubbles reform waaayy too fast, so you'll encounter vertical shafts with unavoidable bubbles in them so that you can quickly ascend, but on the way down will only bounce you up and reform before you fall beyond them. Lastly there's the pyramid island. There's some shooty traps, there are some annoying spike traps, and some crushers. Nothing entirely notable really.   What IS kinda cool about this game is the escape bit of the levels. Once you get to the bottom, you have to unlock a chest which causes the cave to crumble while you make your escape. You have a limited amount of time, which can be extended by 10 or 15 seconds depending on how well you do on the chest unlocking QTE. At this point in time, the level changes, destroying certain walls and platforms to allow for certain shortcuts and various hazards. It can also make getting the collectibles easier, but you also have a time limit, so you kinda have a risk/reward thing goin' on there. You can even see what blocks will be destroyed when the cave crumbles, so you can semi-plan your escape route on your way down!   Finally, lets talk about the characters. There's not a whole lot to say about them; both can grab ledges, wall-jump, and roll. Tobe, the yellow one, is faster and can do a short wall-run. The controls for the wall-run are fairly clunky and imprecise though, so I'd always screw it up at vital points in time. Nana, the pink one, on the other hand is slower, has less health, but has a double jump. This double jump allows her to make ascend quickly, break a long fall, take short cuts, and basically wall-climb. She is by far the easier character of the two, as reflected by the stricter speedrun times in the achievement sections. The game was short enough as it is, but even after clearing the game 100%, Nana got me through it in a little under a half hour.    And that's kinda the whole problem with the game. It's pretty short, and what little there is of it has a lack of substance. Playing through the game as both characters was probably an hour's work, and that's with doing the previously mentioned 100% completion. And that's not even mentioning the various glitches I've come across, including but not limited to being clipped inside of a wall consistantly after being hit on a particular level, or stuttering scrolling during co-op play. Match that with head-scratching desgin choices like unnoticable but sparsley placed wall traps, or quickly respawning bubbles, and this game is a short, unpolished, substance-lacking 'meh' of a game.   The one place where this game shines to it's fullest though is it's co-op, which is still flawed in a way thanks to the lack of duo-controller support and the fact that it's local-only. Still, in co-op, there are some extra moves you can pull off such as head bouncing or pulling the other player up a ledge, which made for some interesting multiplayer-specific shortcuts. Two players also collect gems and animals more quickly and efficiently, making the experience a touch more streamlined. Good luck finding someone who'll play it with you though, even if it would only be a half-hour.   But hey, that's all just my opinion. Cross reference mine with others and determine if this is a game for you. Though personally, there's juuuust enough wrong with the game to lean it towards the negative side of meh, and I really wouldn't pick it up unless it was on sale or something.
6459	0	a	This is probably on the very tame side of negative, but negative it is nonetheless.  My main problem with this game comes down to the controls; they're very stiff and clunky and even 100%'ing the game I'm still not quite sure how everything works. Wall jumping in particular is a pain but really there's just a lot of weirdness here.  The neat thing about this game is the way levels start you off going down, then hurry you back upwards with more paths unlocked. It's actually generally pretty clever level design and only a few levels really spoil this by forcing you to wait for an obstacle to be out of the way.  That being said it's also fairly glitchy and clipping through walls/platforms is not an uncommon occurence. Not a huge hindrance but it's there.  The music and graphics are fairly standard 16-bit type stuff, nothing really special.  The control scheme is also quite awkward and if I ever thought directly about which button to press I'd always end up pressing the wrong one. It's just strange.  This probably isn't a 'bad' game but it's not one I particularly enjoyed, it's a very 'meh' game more than anything. It's also really short, 16 levels that can be completed in a few minutes each. Probably not really worth it for the price, that's also a part of my rating here. Honestly it's possible to have some fun with this game but it's not a high-quality experience even still.
6460	0	a	 Tobe's Vertical Adventure  is a retro platformer built around modern ideas. As the titular Tobe and his would-be girlfriend Nana, you embark on a quest to loot every island you come across and making off with as much gold as you can carry. A simple plot for a simple game, it sets up Tobe's most interesting feature.  Each level is structured like that of a cave, starting you off at the top and forcing you to make your way down to the treasure somewhere at the bottom. When you finally get your prize, the cave begins to collapse opening new paths and sending you scrambling for the surface before time runs out and you are trapped under the rubble. It's a cool mechanic that I haven't seen other games do, and works well given the somewhat nonlinear level design that lets you choose from several different paths going both downwards and upwards. Being able to run off one side of the screen and pop out the other also allows for more creative traversal, which is the game's strongest asset.  But aside from this much of the game is rather clumsy, especially in terms of controls and movement. Essentially you move as a mix of Sonic 2's underwater levels with the original Prince of Persia's acrobatic hijinks. Tobe can run up walls, slide under gaps, and dangle from hanging branches, whereas Nana swaps the wall climb for a double jump. This sounds great on paper would work fantastically with the open level designs, if only the characters controlled with any consistency. Button presses register only part of the time, your jump is terribly weak which makes scaling walls frustratingly unpredictable, and movement as a whole feels like Sonic plodding through a muddy swamp.   The second problem is the game is alarmingly short. I completed all 16 levels in just over an hour, which for the price feels quite insufficient. Theoretically you could double this time if you plan to play through with both characters, but they play so similarly I don't believe it to be worth doing so.  All the while I was playing I couldn't help but think how much  Tobe's Vertical Adventure  feels like a flash game awkwardly dressed up as a full game and put up on Steam as if players wouldn't notice. If it wasn't for the terrible controls I could still recommend it at sale prices, but unfortunately they ruined my enjoyment of the game and I wouldn't feel right advising others to purchase it. I'm quite disappointed to have to say it too because the level designs, art and music are not half bad, but a platformer with bad controls is like a sandwich without bread. It just doesn't work.

The technology seems limited, I didn’t like the controls, and the scrambling animation half through a level takes way too long for my taste. The story is really basic and put on top.  If you like pixel platformers, it still may be for you.
6462	0	a	Game doesn't work for me - crashes on load with a 'Some issue with Steam API. Highscores downloaded: True' error followed by a fatal exception window. Messing with settings didn't seem to do anything, and there's no other reports of this error for this old game.  So yeah, not a 'real' review, but also not recommended since it doesn't function.
6463	0	a	Shoddily coded platformer that's not particularly amazing. If you have a copy, here are some tips:  - Play as Nana if you're not co-op, double-jump is great. - The game does not save your settings. Period. So god help you if you want it windowed/lower volume/custom keys, you're changing it every time. - If you play windowed/alt-tab away, the game will continue tracking your key inputs when it's not in focus! Have fun responding to an IM and then it quits the game on you. - 4-3 is a ♥♥♥♥ed up stage. Worst level in the game.  I'm platformer-friendly but damn this thing is repetitive without any real positives.
6464	0	a	Tobe's Vertical Adventure is a mix of classic platformers and new platformers but will you want to sit through this game ? In Tobe's Vertical Adventure you play as Tobe his Girlfriends Nana brings him on an adventure to find a treasure. So how is this game ? Now i wish to give this a good Review but im not gonna do that. First of all the game is quite charming and at first glance fun but after playing it for a while you start noticing the flaws. First the good. The game is quite fun to play and it looks beutifull but after that its all bad. Glitches are all over the place and it makes the game an even bigger challenge. The game has unresponsive and broken controlls. The game is incredibly short clocking in at around one hour long. Overall the game is pretty broken mess thats not worth your money or youre time only get it on a sale when it goes 90% off or a bundle with other games other wise dont bother. Tobe's Vertical Adventure gets a 5/10
6465	0	a	Tobe's Vertical Adventure is a cute-as-a-button adventure platformer. The game has a few technical shortcomings that, at least for me, hamper my enjoyment.  The Good:    The game's art style is retro. Nice SNES would probably describe it pretty well.    The game has nice music. It's not mind-blowing but it fits the games visual theme and genre.    The gameplay extends beyond simple adventure platforming through the use of consumable tools/items (like ceiling ropes, balloons, etc.)   The Bad:    The controls. A platformer lives and dies with its controls, and moving around in the world is painful. Taking turning around whil running for instance, it's a seemingly-forever animation that heavily penalizes for running in anything but a straight line in the game. Precision jumping feels a bit trickier than need be, but maybe that's just me.    The frame rate. It suffers from an XNA bug (thanks Microsoft!) that locks the game at a lower framerate than what it's supposed to run at. Rather than just looking choppy, this framerate affects the controls as well so the game feels sluggish. See the forums for a post about this where someone links to articles written by other devs who've had to fix the bug in their games.    Limited video settings including no resolution adjustment. This isn't a horrible aspect since the game has a decidedly retro look anyhow, but I couldn't find much in the way of graphical settings of any kind. Given that it's made with XNA, my guess is this was because it was intended to (or did?) live on a Microsoft console at some point.   I suspect if the developer ever came back to this game to give it some love, this could be a really fun game. However, its technical shortcomings right now leave it in a state that are mildly frustrating and certainly not worth anyone's time given the quantity and quality of other platformers on the PC.
6466	0	a	I really tried to like this game but the controls are just horrible. Everything about controlling Tobe feels clunky and awkward which makes traversing each level frustrating rather than fun. Considering that the latter half of every level is against the clock such imprecise controls just result in an unpleasent and unsatisfying gaming experience.  Navigating the confusing menus and UI is equally frustrating and, even though you can redefine the game controls, you still have to use the hard-coded defaults to operate the UI. This means that even when dismissing in-game dialogs while you are playing (i.e. when you read a sign) you still have to use the J and K keys.  While the art is quite cute and Cave Story-esque I can't see much else to recommend here.
6467	0	a	Just another wonky controlled, delayed response, buggy platformer with standard enemies and bad collisions unfortunately. Nothing much else to say.
6468	0	a	Controls are very unresponsive for a platformer. I gave up after the pressing up didn't grab a rope for the 20th time.
6469	0	a	This game suffers from some clunky controls, even after you remap the keyboard to have less ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ keys (which by the way, also requires a lot of effort to do). The levels are short and in each one you decend to some treasure before re-climbing in a timed escape. When you are under pressure to get out quickly, falling to your death because of un-responsive controls is not fun.  This game isn't without its up-sides, but it usally just ends up you longing to play a different, better game, live Noitu Love 2. Better controls, better music, a choice of 3 distinct characters instead of 2 basically-the-same-but-one-is-worse characters. This recommendation is actually a recommendation for Noitu Love 2. Go buy that game, and screw this one.  2/5
6470	0	a	The design is cute, and the game seems like it'd be fun, but it is crippled by the fact that the control scheme was clearly made in mind for people with a superflous third arm- and by proxy, a third hand.
6471	0	a	Not sure how i managed buying this?
6472	0	a	I DON'T LIKE IT
6473	0	a	this kid runs like naruto and it's the clunkiest platformer i've ever had the distaste of playing 2/10
6474	0	a	.
6475	0	a	I do not know what people see in this game. Off the bat it is to cluncky and wierd. Also the game is a platformer with no controller support? Really?  ♥♥♥♥♥♥ programming with mainstream gaming makes this a game I can't recommend.  Also the changes in gravity and friction for no reason just makes it hard to play. Stay away from this game if you know what is best for you.
6476	0	a	It's... meh. It's not bad, but you really get the feeling that there's no actual point to playing it.  Oh, and I hate the controls. So much.
6477	0	a	Because Tobe's Horizontal Adventure would be politically incorrect.
6478	0	a	How good or bad is this game? I dunno, I haven't gotten very far, because the controls are godawful...  Do with that what you will.
6479	0	a	Could have been a good platformer with its own personality, but it's kinda buggy, which makes it not optimal enough to be what it wanted to be.
6480	0	a	Doesn't work under Windows 10/with 4K resolutions.   Selling games that are not supported for forward platforms on Steam is misleading and deceptive business practices.   Don't buy this - it doesn't work and the developers don't maintain it.   If it's not removed from Steam soon, it's a lawsuit waiting to happen.
6481	0	a	weird/awkward controls, couldn't get take it
6482	0	a	The controls are terrible and unresponsive.
6483	0	a	Meh.. Too boring and i consider a a waste of money. This game may be a little similar to games like Super Mario but is more boring. Also the countdown on each level and the controls are awful.  ~ 2/10
6484	0	a	This game is trrash
6485	0	a	Tobe's Vertical Adventure is a pretty generic platformer. You go down into caves to get some stuff, and then you have to get up again quickly, on a timer. There isn't a lot to make the game stand out from other platformers.
6486	0	a	cool
6487	0	a	4/10.   Welcome to Tobe's Vertical Adventure, a platforming game without good platforming. There is basically no story. Controls are given in non-gamepad instructions when your gamepad is plugged in. There are 4 worlds, but they have the EXACT same look and layout just with the color of the blocks changed. You can jump, roll, and have 2 abilities. Jumping is terrible, it is super slow and floaty. You will wall jump and barely move out to the side. Half the time when you jump you think you can make it but your guy never will. Some of the worst actual platforming I have seen in a platformer. The rolling is inconsistent because you have to be holding sprint, moving to the side, and then press down, but it doesn't work half the time. You cannot use direcitonal pad, as only analogs work for some reason. Every level you go to the bottom and then just run back up to the top. There is a little bit of destruction but its basically just the same thing.   The poor level design and the time limit on getting to the top make it so if you die you have to restart, and if you accidentally press the wrong button because they aren't labeled correctly on the pause menu, you have to restart the level.Both of the abilities are finnicky and poorly done. The rope doesn't shoot up above you and you can never tell where it will go exactly. The balloons if you let of them you drop, as opposed to toggling, which makes more sense.   All in all the lack of proper player control, the poor platforming, and the reused uninteresting level design and repetitiveness just screen free flash game, but they charged 5 dollars for it. Avoid.
6488	0	a	Really good game
6489	0	a	I honestly wished that I could give this more time than I did, but the controls for this game are so terrible that I could not play through it. The jumps feel awkward and clunky, which is a huge problem if you are trying to make a platformer game, as it is your primary mechanic. The run just felt way too slow and the run jump was never a further jump than the regular jump. When you are trying to make a platformer, you need to get your controls down first. A plaformer can have the best level designs ever, but nobody will enjoy playing the game if the controls are unplayable.
6490	0	a	I got this as a premium key on ♥♥♥,at first the game looked promising as there was a 2 player coop mode,but what I found playing was terribly unbalanced characters that tried to make the game more dynamic but instead made the game much more stressful when one of the players can get to a certain area and the other cannot.Single player was kinda fun but it didnt really fit my taste.
6491	0	a	I cannot play this game its not working I can hear the sound but I cannot start the game up .I have tried everything there is No playing this game jet it says I have been playing the game but it was just the sound in the back ground .
6492	0	a	I don't recommend this game
6493	0	a	This game is graphically beautiful and has a unique feel. I feel bad not recommending it, but the gameplay is repetitive and I'm not particularly motivated to keep playing it. It's as though I *should* like this game more than I actually do.  If it's on sale, you may wish to purchase it just to see what it's like. But for me, playing it was a chore.
6494	0	a	 ~ The Kid just rages for a while. ~   Great at first, but gets old very quickly. For every pro, there's a con. Let's start with the good stuff. The colourful, fresh art style and the fast-paced combat are Bastion's biggest pro's. It plays well, it looks great, the cold and unfamiliar atmosphere is well supported by the good soundtrack. Also, being able to change the difficulty in-game by using Idols is a great way to manually spice up the game if you're finding it too easy. Bastion is a quite easy game, so being able to experiment with that was a good touch.   On the other hand, it's very vital that they did. Because the gameplay (despite fun in the beginning) tends to get old quickly. Sure, you unlock more weapons as you progress, but it doesn't take long before you familiarise yourself with a certain set and feel comfortable with it, so you don't have any incentive to use the other weapons. The underwhelming story and mediocre level design don't really incentive you to adapt to environmental dangers either. It all looks so much alike, you progress is the same fashion as the first hour, the narrative pacing is very sub-par. Most of the time it's a straight path with very little dead ends where you can find extra items and upgrade materials.  + Visual design is colourful and looks good. + At first, gameplay was fun and being able to change the combat was a great touch. + You can experiment with the difficulty yourself (with the Idols). + Nice soundtrack. + The narrator gave the game its own unique identity at first, but...  - Later the narrator just becomes boring, adds nothing new, and even gets a little annoying. - Gameplay gets old rather quickly, despite being able to spice up the combat. If it wasn't for that, it would have even gotten old a lot sooner. - Uninteresting story with even less interesting characters. - Mediocre, unmemorable and extremely linear level design that doesn't do the good art style justice. - 'Action RPG'? Don't make me laugh. This is absolutely the bar minimum.   I don't recommend it. I got it for free, and even then I feel disappointed. So to me it's not a matter of price, but a matter of spending your time with Bastion. To be very honest, in hindsight I think I would have rather spend my 11 hours on something else. It had great potential, but unfortunately it just gets old so, so quick.
6495	0	a	Played it on The Recommendation Of Everyone In The Whole World but it's not that good. The graphics are great, the soundtrack is great, the narrator is great... the colours, the scene, the history, the theme..... everything you'd think would make a great game is there... except for the fact that it's actually just a bloody chore to play through. I just switched it off, halfway through a level, coz I was just so sick of another group of monsters attacking me.  It's not fun killing them, no matter how much everything else around that is beautifully presented.  
6496	0	a	Bastion is a polarizing game. Basically, I feel confident in saying you will either love this game to bits and find yourself writing essays about how brilliant and deep and awesome this game really is, or find it one of the most obscenely, dangerously overrated, yet pretty good-looking and fine-sounding, piece of pretentious indie [you know that word] you'll ever play.  Luckily for you, Oh Revered Prospective Buyer, you don't need to rely on the confusing cacophony of opinions of other people to figure out which camp you'll find yourself in in. Like, don't like, and wait... why? For, you see, O Might One, this game is endowed with the Mystical Power of The Demo.  Demos are strange beasts and too often misleading ones as well, willfully tricking the Player. But this will not be the case for Bastion: you will either think this game has the most boring minute-to-minute gameplay experience of the isometric action RPGs you ever had the terrible misfortune to play, or that it'll be to you about as good an invention as The Revered Sliced Bread, maybe even a slice better.  It doesn't matter which button I'm going to press when I am done writing, because obviously the majority thinks I'm the minority and thus this one single vote is simply a drop in the ocean and won't matter one single bit. That is fine and dandy as it gives me a chance to be completely honest without incurring in any unwarranted backlash, isn't that true Almighty Community?  You won't downvote this &lt;cough&gt;review, because while I almost dread every single hour I spent on it (, I'm still encouraging people to be open minded instead of trusting my judgment blindly, as it were The Word, and try the demo for themselves. Which you should really do: you have very little to lose and much to gain.
6497	0	a	This is not a bad game. But I've owned it for over 2 years and have tried picking it up on several different occasions only to never completely get into it. I don't feel very attached to the characters and story. It's all extremely vague, which can make some games fun because you get curious and want to explore more and play more. But if it wasn't for the narrator talking into my ear there would be no story. His voice is everything... and I kind of don't like that.  The gameplay felt really tight. The weapons can be somewhat interesting when you combine them with different power ups. I probably should have set my game on a harder difficulty because I found no challenge to it, but that's my own fault. I used the keyboard. The artwork is swell. I never fell in love with the music, although it is ever-present and perfectly fitting. The enemies are cool but kind of repetitive. I think that's about it. There's really nothing that stands out wrong with the game in my opinion, except for the story resting so highly on one overdramatic voice, even though that's the part everyone raves about. And to me, if you have a problem with the story then you have a problem with the game because the story is one of the biggest reasons why I'd ever even play a single-player game.  I believe that I now realize what my other main issue is. I said 'there's really nothing wrong with the game', but there's also nothing that special about it either. You strip away the artwork and the [annoying] narrator and it's just some run-of-the-mill barebones top down 'twin-stick shooter', as someone in my comments had said. Twin-stick shooter. That genre might still be fresh enough for many people but for someone like me gaming into their late 20's who has already played quite a bit of those it doesn't do enough for me. Bastion is just not for me I suppose.
6498	0	a	I feel bad giving Bastion a thumbs down but unfortunately I just didn't enjoy it. This isn't because I think it's a bad game as it's clear why it has received so much praise, but the repetitive gameplay led me to fail in my quest to play it through. It's pretty, and the aesthetic overall is endearing and the narration too is an interesting touch, however overall it failed to grab me and make me want to see it through to the end.
6499	0	a	While this game isn't completely terrible, there is also just nothing about this game that really enternained me or that I felt was done well. It's just a very basic fight and don't die type of game with a very uninteresting story.
6500	0	a	The reason why I bought Bastion was because of the immense praise and positive reviews it recieved on release. That might have been a mistake on my part, since I expected it to be a lot more than what it turned out to be. I didn't get the indie gem I thought I was getting, but instead a mediocre hack n slash with some underwhelming RPG elements slapped on top.   It does have one thing going for it admittedly, and that's the presentation. The isometric graphics are beautiful, they were clearly shown a lot of love, and the narration is enjoyable, even though it gets kind of irritating after a while.  The gameplay on the other hand is dreadful. It may be responsive and functional, but it is incredibly dull and repetitive and offers little challenge or variation. The levels are essentially all the same, there are no puzzles or interesting gameplay elements to differentiate them, only a slight difference in color hue and tileset. There isn't much enemy variation and it just feels like you're powering through mob after mob to get a little bit of story to keep you going(and the story is only decent at best).  My advice is to try the demo and see how you like it, since it will give a pretty good idea what you will do for the rest of the game. Don't believe the hype.
6501	0	a	The gameplay is tedious and boring, and I generally enjoy 'repetitve' gameplay. The world is boring, and the narration, which was cited as what made this game stand out is annoying, distracting, and rarely informative of anything important. Simply a Ron Pearlman imposter telling you what you already know.
6502	0	a	ENG:  I've tried playing a few times as a console as the Steam version. I do not know just exactly what the game is fine, or interested in, but it did not hit me.

6504	0	a	This game has an amazing soundtract and a decent story but all it has for gameplay is combat. If you don't like isometric shoot 'em ups (cuz that's basically what it devolves into) then just watch a lets play on Youtube for the soundtrack and the story. Funnily enough I got much more enjoyment out of the soundtrack than the game itself.
6505	0	a	Despite all the love for the game, I can't recommend it. Unless you want a very slow and sluggish hack-and-slash that is repetitive and who's weapons are generic for the most part.   I'm not sure why the developer made your character move so slow and sluggishly, and no, it's not because this game requires precise and accurate controls. This made the entire game a slog. Basically it's whack whack whack, as the different enemy types do not require a specific method of attacking them and they all fall after a few basic hits. Even the weapons and their 'upgrades' all basically are different variants of the same.  All of these hides behind a nice coat of pain and sound that, I have to admit, is a treat for the eyes and ears. But with regards to everything else, the game falls flat.
6506	0	a	This has to be one of the worst games I've ever had the displeasure to play, and it's all because of it's terrible block mechanic.  With a proper block mechanic, I'd have recommended this game.   I know this review will get a lot of negative ratings from fans. I don't really care.  Enjoy hitting that 'unhelpful' button without reading.  So in order to appease you fans of this game, let's start with the good:  -The game is gorgeous. Despite how absolutely dreadful some of it's aspects are, art isn't one of them. -The game's soundtrack is great. -The narrator is also very good. Actually, the whole sound design (things getting hit, things exploding) is rock solid across the board. -The game does an adequate job of letting you know where you are and where you need to go without leading you by the nose. There are a couple markers early on. I don't recall too many after that. -Upgrade materials are placed in intuitive locations; you won't need a walkthrough to find the last upgrade material for a weapon or anything annoying like that. Story bits are also intuitive. -Game takes a while to complete, which I always count as a positive. Even in games I dislike, like this one, because for those who do like it that means more stuff to do and more entertainment time per dollar. -Customizable difficulty beyond just 'The monsters are stronger!' or 'The monsters are weaker!' in the 'gods' system; each god can be activated individually, and grant the monsters special bonuses (such as: explode on death, increased damage reduction, regeneration, increased damage etc).  Now, where to start on my list of gripes?  -Let's start small: the game constantly swaps out your loadout whenever you get a new weapon or skill. This is frequent, as there are many weapons and skills in the game. This isn't praise, though, as they're mostly useless. What this means is that the game will take away your favorite, highly-upgraded power weapon in favor of some worthless piece of unupgraded junk, then tell you to complete a level with it. This is all the more appaling considering we have TWO weapon slots, but the game will not default to taking away the first or second; melee ones will equip the first, ranged the second, and you can't possibly know what random junk the game will throw at you without reading a walkthrough (which will ruin the whole story aspect of this story-based game).  -Gods are not unlocked from the beginning, and must be earned even when you do unlock the shrine. Also, gods are only for increasing difficulty, not decreasing it. Players who struggle with the game will realize that it's got no 'easier' mode. While I believe the game to be fairly easy when it doesn't cheese, I've been playing for most of my life, and those who haven't and are struggling will be annoyed by this.  -Next up: targetting. How do you ♥♥♥♥ up targetting? Well, if you're bastion you do, because you're 'special'. Normally, if I want to target something I indicate those wishes to the game by pointing at it with my mouse. In general, a game will pick up targetting within a reasonable range of the target (and not exclusively on top of it). Bastion, though, begs to differ; not only do you have to point directly at the target, you also have to keep your mouse on the target to shield from it when faced with multiple enemies. Where this fails spectacularly is that there are multiple high-speed or teleporting enemies in the game, and they just vanish from your mouse cursor, making your character turn around and target an enemy outside your field of view and who isn't attacking you.  -Okay, perhaps those could be excused (they can't). What's next? Upgrades. All the upgrades in this game are boring. They are all 'faster reload by X%' or 'X% more damage' or '+X ammo capacity'. And when it's not that it's 'more knockback' or 'can now stun' - absolutely generic, boring, and frankly unworthy of a world in which we are constantly on freaking flying pieces of rock. Couldn't you have invented something a bit more interesting?  -There is no invulnerability frame after taking damage. Dust: An Elysian Tale did this on it's hardest difficulty too, and it was just as stupid there; there, if you touch spikes it's pretty much a game over (across several minutes as the spikes take 1-2 health away per second out of your 700+ total). In Bastion, if you ever find yourself in a position where you are flanked (and you will, because the game spawns enemies behind and in front of you simultaneously) then because of the aforementioned ♥♥♥♥♥♥ blocking you're likely to have the character try to block a guy who isn't attacking you, take damage, rotate around to the guy who just hit him, take more damage from the previous guy and either die or rotate again... Which means you take more damage. Repeat until either dead, use a special skill, manage to get your mouse cursor over one of them or get out of range and line them up.  -The enemies are stupid. They run around like headless chickens, fall into pits, slam into walls and keep running into them for a fair few seconds.  Bosses? Ones that can move will very frequently just fall off into a pit and die instantly, even if you don't want them to. A leaping boss fairly late into the game was apparently so terrified of me, he turned right and just jumped off when I approached.  -The story is non-sensical. It's about as stuck up it's own rear end as Final Fantasy XIII 2. Seriously, I have no idea what the hell am I supposed to be working towards; every time I gather something (shards, cores, whatever) some rampaging plot device comes and undoes my work. Why should I even bother to keep trying again? Because allow me to ask... 'Have I ever told you the definition of insanity?'  -Challenges are pointless. Again, unless it rewards you with an upgrade component for your main weapon(s) (which most won't, as two of three of their rewards will be an upgrade component and a skill for them) then they're about as useful as throwing peas at the screen when you see an enemy, because you won't be using them. There isn't even a way to know what enemies you'll find or what the terrain will look like, so you can't know what weapons will be good.  All in all, I give this game a 'broken essential mechanic / 10'. If you can get over how horrible blocking is, this could easily be a 7/10 or even an 8/10, but I can't.
6507	0	a	It couldnt keep me interested long enough to finish.  GG...   2/5
6508	0	a	This game is gorgeous, and the voice acting is just phenomenal. The controls feel great, and the animations are great, and so forth.  Why don't I recommend it, then? Well... it just doesn't hold my interest. Fights really feel very samey in a lot of ways, and I don't get a real sense of a story that I care about or atmosphere that moves me. I feel like I'm just kind of going through the motions. And for some games that's okay -- it's 'bubble wrap popping fun,' and that's great. But this game doesn't have that tactile 'bubble wrap' element, at least not for me, so it leaves me with nothing except the visual beauty and the narrator.  I really want to like this game more than I do. That said, a lot of people really do love it way more than I do, so it's by no stretch a bad game. I can't recommend it personally, but you may find that you love it. Read other reviews, too.
6509	0	a	Everybody keeps telling me thath Bastion is great.   Sadly I do not see it, there are some elements that are good like the hand drawn graphics and the narrator (although gets on my nerves with his far too frequent comments).  All the elements together makes for a very slow, repetitive and boring game. You wanna try it? Make sure you buy it on a sale or in a bundle.
6510	0	a	Kid thought his life was going to be great, since he'd heard glorious things of his life from everyone. He wandered around in pretty looking places while being constantly called Kid and narrated by voice that didn't seem to fit in the world. Ultimately Kid found everything to be very repetitive and no fun to be found anywhere, and what is life without joy? The Kid thought to himself, 'This might have been nice experience if I actually were my age and not such an old soul' and decided to end his existence as it was better that way.  1.5 Kids' out of 5.
6511	0	a	This game is horrendously over-rated.  The gameplay itself is quite poor and one-dimensional. You basically button mash melee to beat up enemies and occasionally hold the (B) button to do ranged shots. You can do special attacks (such as spin-around attack for 3 seconds) one per bottle of Black Tonic you find.  The game is presented in isometric perspective, with the game world floating in space. As you walk around the floor tiles fly up from nowhere and form the floor you walk on. This is and interesting presentation effect for the first 3 seconds, then it gets to be real tedious watching the level fly around. After an hour it's just sickening to watch. Furthermore, you don't know where you can walk in an area until the path has flown together. I bashed endlessly into dead ends trying to see where I should go next and whether a new path would fly up. Monotonous and a bad game design choice.  Then the narrator. Ooooohhhh the narrator. It narrates most actions you take in the game from walking into a new room to breaking boxes for currency. Neat concept again, interesting for the first minute or two, but absolutely maddening thereafter with no way to shut it off. To make it worse the narrator is done in 'Dismissive American Vigilante' accent, and no disrespect to the voice artist but for me it just did not work as it came off as totally inauthentic, and jarringly inappropriate for the rest of the game's theme. The cringe-y writing didn't help either.  I put in my hour waiting for something to happen and nope, just no more time will be wasted. Strip away the flashy presentation and you have a lame button-masher beat-em-up that wouldn't be worth $0.25 on sale.
6512	0	a	It was alright for the first hour or so... But then it got really repetitive.  Art and soundtrack are amazing though.
6513	0	a	Is this still updated? Cant really give a review since it is really buggy and unplayable on debian w/ gnome de.
6514	0	a	i tried playing this game in virtual reality but a nasty voice appears. 0/10 might be demonic.
6515	0	a	Sadly this games offers nothing special. It just does not hook you or deliver.
6516	0	a	Says full controller support. Well game does not recognize the steam controller.
6517	0	a	As best as I can tell there's pretty much nothing to this game -- you just go around following a path and hitting enemies. In terms of depth and gameplay it's what you'd expect from a free Flash game.  People seem to inordinately impressed with the gimmick where the game is narrated in realtime, but as soon as you hear the announcer say the same thing a few times in a row it gets pretty old.  I honestly don't see anything to recommend Bastion at all.
6518	0	a	Well visually nice game, well drawn.. and fresh look at things with that narration. But too much is too much. I had a feeling designers were not sure what to do with this game after half. Story gets just worse and worse after half of the game and also the same with ending. Weapon choice is bad in game.. + ultra strong weapon right before end. What's the point of that? Game felt very very repetitive... Unfortunately can't suggest :(  Well at least music was nice.
6519	0	a	I played 5 hours. I couldn't figure out the plot. I am sure that this game would be fun for many people. I am not one of them.
6520	0	a	Feels like it was made for children of ages 5 to 10.
6521	0	a	  Bad  The atmosphere of this game is good. BGM is good too.  is like a fairy tale.  but there is no tension and thrill  so boring.  too boring to drowsy.    
6522	0	a	Somewhat overhyped. I'm not a fan of the narration which is supposedly a big selling point, or the music for that matter. Combat and leveling are both pretty flat.
6523	0	a	Decent gameplay, but ruined by an annoying cowboy narrator.
6524	0	a	boring
6525	0	a	I don't hate this game, but I don't particularly find it all that interesting either.  I mean, some people will get a lot of out if they enjoy this sort of button mashing type thing, but personally it wasn't for me. I think the art is nice, it's good to see vibrant colours. The story is weak, but is 'discovered' through a constant voice over explaining bits and bobs along the way.  Again, I don't hate the game. It's just not for me and I wouldn't recommend it to others despite the 'rave reviews' it seems to have gotten since it's release.
6526	0	a	I feel bad not recommending this game. Graphics are awesome, music is nice and voice acting is brilliant. The diversity in weapons and enemies is great too.  However, the repetitive gameplay and unapealing story (or maybe it's too slow) killed it for me, I really tried to enjoy it but I just can't.  Go to stage A and get x item. Go to stage B and get x item. Go to stage C and get x item. Rinse and repeat.   I wanna know more about the calamity, stop focusing on the Ura story!! I know nothing about the calamity after 3.5 hours or so and I've had endless information about Uras. I'm not even sure why I'm gathering X item anymore.  I would suggest getting this game on sale or if you like polished games even if they don't have too much depth.
6527	0	a	I tried really hard to like this game. In the end I stopped playing it because it was too repetitive. Same maps over and over again with slight variance. New weapon here, new monster there... The game had little depth.  Once you get past the novelty of the real time narration, you realise there's not a whole lot to the game. Story felt obligated, and added nothing to the game. After 4 hours i felt i'd seen everything i need to with this game.  + Graphics are cute + controller support + easy casual play  - repetitive - story - slow progression
6528	0	a	Pretentious narrative way too far up its own ♥♥♥♥ with pretty basic gameplay but great presentation.
6529	0	a	Bought this game because of hype and recommendations. Everything about this game is REPETITIVE - the gameplay, the story, the narroator. I didn't enjoy playing it, for me this game has no depth at all - only enjoyed listening to the soundtrack.  Pros: + the environment is beautiful and really well designed + the soundtrack is amazing + the narroator is fun at first but quickly becoming repetitive and annoying   Cons: - the story is repetitive and boring - gameplay is repetitive  - the narroator - feels like a chore to play it  Overall: I will have to say I won't recommend it.
6530	0	a	This game was about 10 hours in playtime but you could complete it in much less time if you skipped all the practice levels that I played. The graphics looks stunningly vibrrant and music are great and was the main reason for me to play this game until the end. The gameplay though is repetitive – each level is just more of the same – some timings to attacks and defense kept the combat system interesting and not just being a button smashing time waste and made me play the game until completion.   I don't hate this game, but I don't find the story all that interesting either.
6531	0	a	I really wanted to get on the bandwagon and love this game. While beating this game was overall a good experience, I feel like it was just short of greatness. First of all the art direction, soundtrack, and atmosphere is something so terrifically amazing that most games struggle to achieve. I loved playing this game with my headphones on because it transports you to another universe. I even downloaded the soundtrack after playing the game.  The one pitfall would have to be the controls. I could never get 100% handle on the controls. I tried it out with both keyboard/mouse and Xbox controller. It was really annoying to constantly get injured by small little enemies. While you get a lot of new cool weapons and skills, they never seem enough for those enemies because the controls are wonky.  The story-line is way too abstract. It always hints at stuff yet never says what's happening. They try to make it arty when in fact it's just being lazy. The game knows it doesn't have a story, so they fake it. I commend them trying but it's not fulfilling.  Soundtrack &amp; Art Direction 9/10. Game 6/10

6533	0	a	Very nice looking, but incredibly boring. I'm only an hour and a half in but it's the same ♥♥♥♥ over and over: go here, kill everyone, break everything, get the crystal then leave.
6534	0	a	Bastion is polished to the point of being absolutely characterless. Everything about this game is technically really good, but at the same time it somehow manages to be lifeless and boring.   The gameplay is good, I honestly enjoyed it, but it wasn't fun. It was just good. The visuals and music are done well too, but there's nothing memorable about them. The plot is extremly general.   After finishing the game I'm not feeling any emotions. It wasn't frustrating, it wasn't fun, it was just, well, good. I can't find any reason not to recomend Bastion, but it is so mediocre that even a game less polished and techically worse in every aspect would seem to me like a more valuable way to spend time.
6535	0	a	Bastion is another indie game which is put on a pedestal for its presentation, even though its presentation is not nearly as revolutionary as it advertises itself as being. Once again the actual narrative is very thin on content, and the voice over narration is what people refer to when they discuss its 'amazing story'. The actual content of the game consists of walking on linear cubic paths in a void while engaging in very bland and unengaging 3rd person combat. The monotone narrator talks through the whole game, giving a greater sense of setting to the game than there really is by describing lore about the floating hallway you're traveling even though there is zero visual evidence of any the levels you're occupying as being a real place in any way.  The narrator itself is novel but not very engaging. He speaks with little to no inflection, and it can be easy to not pay attention to anything he says since you're too busy killing enemies on the current floating hallway void. The narration is supposed to be a revolutionary advancement for video game story telling, but it doesn't seem like the voice over is very noteworthy when there is basically no variation in what the player does, and the whole level is a literal linear floating void. The plot itself is vague and immaterial, and doesn't seem to go anywhere.  I really did give the game a go, and wanted to see what it would present next for a short while. The painterly art style is nice enough, even though the ambigious levels meant that changing areas amounted to pallet swaps. The music is also very nice and might be the best part about the whole game. What really got me though was the bland and easy gameplay, and Bastion's answer to giving the player more. The idols are a very good idea, games such as The World Ends With You and Kid Icarus Uprising certainly show how controllable difficulty can be done. The first few idols add some expected increases in challenge to the enemies you fight, such as increased health, faster attacks, and more damage. None of this really makes the game any harder, and the idols that come later basically consist of sabotaging the player, by making enemies randomly not take damage, and even inflicting slow movement on the player for attacking. I admit that the game was pretty difficult with all of these modifiers turned on, but what an artificial and tedious form of difficulty it was. If the only answer the devs have to players who want more interesting combat is 'play the game with one hand behind your back' then they shouldn't even bother.  I recommend for anyone curious about Bastion to play the demo first before purchasing. This is definitely not a must buy, and you should decide for yourself whether Bastion's various presentation gimmicks are as worthy of the praise it has been given. Do note as you play that the combat you experience at the beginning is an accurate representation of the whole game, and the game will never add new mechanics or interactions with the world other than new weapons. If what you played in the demo is what you would like to do for 8-10 hours straight, then feel free to buy it.
6536	0	a	Pretty good soundtrack, okay story, boring gameplay. Not to mention that the graphics look too flashy for my taste.
6537	0	a	I feel bad giving this a thumbs down because it's not like this was a bad game or that I didn't enjoy playing it.... But. Well, let's break things down into a plus/minus list, shall we?  THE GOOD + Soundtrack + Voice acting + Art + Mood  I played Supergiant's newer title 'Transistor' first, but this checks all the same boxes. If you're a fan of that one, you'll like this and vice versa.  THE NOT-SO-GOOD - Controls: Super clunky and at times unwieldy. WASD to move and then I have to hit Shift with my pinky? Yikes. I'm guess this is one of those games better with a controller. - Combat: STOP MAKING ME PICK UP ANOTHER WEAPON MID-LEVEL AND THEN FORCING ME TO USE IT. Ugh. - Price: $14.99? No thanks. I bought it on sale for under $5 - Playtime: I hit the ending in under 5 hours. That combined with the (regular) price is really what thumbs this down for me.  Now, don't get me wrong, there's replayability here. And lots of achievements to tempt you. But if you're a more casual player like I am... well, I don't really feel compelled to replay it. Which, as I said, combined with price/playtime doesn't make this worth it for me.  Don't get me wrong, it's a gorgeous game and it's not like I wouldn't recommend it. But I don't think the goods outweigh the bads in any significant way. If you're going to pick it up, definitely wait until it's on sale.
6538	0	a	Really wanted to like this, but it never clicked for me! Presentation is great, but the gameplay doesn't work for me. :(
6539	0	a	Bastion was a fun 2.5D shoot em up in the beginning, but after a couple hours it gets dull and repetitive. The gameplay and enemies are all the same throughout roughly 6-8 hours. Not too mention the boring narration that does not effectively tell a cohesive story.
6540	0	a	Repetitive and simplistic. Definitely not something I would have liked to spend 15 bucks on.
6541	0	a	Really tried to enjoy this game and understand the overwhelming praise surrounding it, but found the gameplay quite repetitive, and at times, finnicky with aiming and precise jumping, something that always plagues isometric games. The narration is iconic but it gets to a point of meaningless when every minor event is narrated in detail. The graphics and music are great, but despite picking the game up again many times, I always found myself playing it like a chore, to hold out for something more special, but it never came.
6542	0	a	A largely generic platform-style console game distinguished by its voice-over. A clever design idea, but one that I found didn't save the game from console/arcade repetition. If you like that sort of Nintendo-ey hammer-swinging and button mashing, this may be your thing. Wasn't mine.
6543	0	a	Ughhh...tried to like this, but it was so supremely boring and repetitive.
6544	0	a	Just...borning
6545	0	a	Not impressed. The way weapons are introduced means you're forced to use them for a section even if it doesn't go with your other weapon at all. Movement isn't great with keyboard and mouse. Use a controller if you have one. Aiming is awkward due to perspective. You need to aim for their feet but even then it can be unpredictable.
6546	0	a	.
6547	0	a	After playing the game for just over an hour, it's safe to say that I'm really disappointed with this game.  There are aspects that make this game enjoyable +Background music +High visual quality for a 2D game. It looks stunning and makes you feel like you're in a Disney cartoon movie. +The narrative approach of telling the story makes you feel like you're reading a book without actually reading +Just for fun. The game is not stressful and is perfect for relaxation.  However, there are rooms for improvement for the following: -The respawning mechanism is a joke. The player keep respawning in the middle of nowhere and have to die again no matter which direcion you go.  -Second chance? No way! There is a level where the floor keeps disappearing behind you so you have to hurry. When you die once, you will respawn at a place where the tiles are disappearing so therefore you will keep dying like an endless loop until the game is over.  -Combat mechanisms: If you like evading enemy attacks rather than countering them with your shield, then sorry to disappoint because you will fall off the map no matter how you evade. The combat areas are too small which don't allow players to dodge attacks instead of using the shield  Considering the pros and cons, I give this game an overall 3/10 Just because the gameplay makes me want to smash my computer, I will NOT buy games from Supergiant again.
6548	0	a	This not really a bad game, but I'm not a fan. The story is..ok at best. Each location has a 'backstory' that is all of five scentences, and the plot of the game itself is mediocre. The character backstory is extremely cliched as well. I will say the premise of the game, the idea, is really unique, though. That, and the game is really pretty with lots of colors, and a neat style. What kills this game for me is the gameplay. It is a typical hack and slash, so you're expect it to be repetative, but this one is really bad. Tha main issue is that there are probably only ten different enemies, and none of tham are really interesting to fight. So, that's my issue. It's decent, but the gameplay made it really hard to get though.
6549	0	a	The game's aiming system is total ♥♥♥♥. The ranged attacks never hit where the line is.
6550	0	a	&gt;Saw this game recieve critical aclaim &gt;looked it up, seemed meh &gt;was recommended by friends &gt;gave it a try &gt;sorely dissapointed  I was not an awful game, but there is no reason it should have recieved the absurd amount of praise that it did. Soundtrack was good. Story was decent Gameplay just wasn't fun.
6551	0	a	Maybe someday I'll be able to stomach the annoying narrator and finish the game. I really wish there was a way to turn the narrations off.
6552	0	a	Thought I would like this one but didn't draw me in.
6553	0	a	This game is crap. Its full of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t tasks that a crazy hard compared to the rest of the game and aren't enoyable to play at all. I do not recommend this game at all. save your money and go buy undertale or something.
6554	0	a	It is incredibly hard to figure where you're going to move at times due to the perspective; many (')deaths(') because I thought the tiles to the side were part of the main walkway. Paths will not be shown you unless you're on the tile right before them; just wander the edges and sometimes off of them and trust the rocks in the sky will meet you.   Early on (it seems to get (')better(') as you get further through the game), there are multiple directions you can travel in while on a mission. You best be lucky in making the wrong choices first so as to fully explore and get all the loots - once you head towards the main path, the rest of the level will be off-limits; destruction will chase you out of the level, never allowing you to return again (until New Game Plus). You can't even rely on narration to let you know 'Okay, this is the correct way, go everywhere else first,' because, of course, everything is narrated. By 'it seems to get (')better('),' I mean that the levels seem to get progressively more linear.  Aiming is prone to be imprecise; cycling through your targets is totally arbitrary.  It seems there are vastly superior choices when deciding how to level your weapons, but seeing as how you are only given information on the current tier of upgrades, you won't know what the best build is until it's too late; this renders pursuing under-par times in the Challenges virtually impossible - at least way more difficult than they could've been. Had you known that the upgrade you forsook another, equally better one for was actually included twice in that weapon's upgrade tree, while the one you didn't get was only available while at that tier... you would've been able to have a better weapon(?)  I have to give the game a *Thumbs Down* because if any other game had these listed issues, I would not be able to recommend it; Bastion, however, is a very unique game and I CAN actually recommend it to others, just know that it is not without its faults - don't trust the hype blindly.  The gameplay is repetitive; I personally find the narrator exasperating ('Oh, he personified a ship, how darling... Oh, he's talking about Peckers and Stinkeyes, how innuendo... 'Oh, he did a play on words, how good (sincerely though).'). I personally find the gameplay very good except for the listed issues; others adore the game for the narrator.  Split the difference; *Thumb Sideways*
6555	0	a	While initially this game intrigued me with its visual style, I found the story, characters, and gameplay to be lacking. There wasn't enough development for me to become invested in the characters or the world they inhabited, and the hack and slash gameplay was repetitive. I never really got to a point where I felt like the game 'clicked' with me -- I spent most of the time feeling like I was still working through the prologue, and I still felt that way when I reached the end.
6556	0	a	i didn't realize that there is, in fact, a free demo for this game, and i strongly recommend that anyone interested in paying Real Bucks(tm) for the game try the demo first. i, for example, had heard glowing reviews from friends of vague acquaintances and also the internet, but had failed to take into account that these reviews had been written by people who 1) are actually good at games, and 2) have an attention span longer than 5 minutes. i honestly didn't get very far into the game, but it was enough to tell me that it is marketed towards a certain audience, and that audience is not me. if you (like me) generally play rpgs (but usually of a 2d/pixel persuasion), have visual impairments, do not have a controller or just all around suck at games, then this is the unrecommendation for you!  the graphics are nice but in my opinion it was just very distracting and made it hard to pick things out (also it slowed down my admittedly not advanced laptop). i need to specifically point out that if you don't have a controller, it is Really Hard to play. maybe i just suck and am used to just the whole left right jump side-scrolling type thing, but moving place to place was generally slow going and i didn't have the patience for it. the dealbreaker for me is that the narrator's voice in the beginning - i Really Hated It, and i had to force myself to keep playing. i'm so sorry. i think overall the general aesthetic of the game was not for me - didn't like the character (or, rather, i couldn't develop any semblance of Caring towards them), music wasn't personally appealing, controls difficult on keyboard, that Narrator - so if that's the sort of thing that would ruin one's game experience, tread carefully before throwing the cash dollar.  i'm sure it's a good game but man. i can't do it. i can't make myself play it for longer than five minute bursts
6557	0	a	It's got beautiful graphics and an unique way of deliverying the story, by having a narrator constantly telling it as you play.  You're 'the kid' and your actions and thoughts are spoken out loud throughout the game: 'the kid did this' , 'the kid feels that', 'the kid should be more careful and not step in mud', etc. While interesting at first, It's getting tiresome after a while, as is the whole action. It's repetitive and dull.
6558	0	a	It's a singular achievement to be able to create a game in which it is possible for the player to feel bored, even while fighting 20 mobs simultaneously. I do not recommend this game. The visual appeal will keep you going initially, but within a short time the repetitive, uninventive combat and superfluous 'story' will have you regretting your purchase.
6559	0	a	Bastion is really really pretty to look at, but it's not fun to play -- not with a mouse and keyboard at any rate. It's isometric and everything is on the diagonal, to top it off it's all done on floating platforms. Going everywhere diagonally using WSAD is a total pain, especially since one wrong step and you fall off the edge into the ether.   The mobs tend to be overpowered, fighting is repetitive. You end up with an impressive array of varied weapons to choose from, and they are all upgradable, but you can only chose two before you enter a (floating) dungeon with no idea what you will be fighting. You can also buy permanent buffs, but you can only have a few active at any time.  You have an inventory, but it is minimal and based purely on furthering the game. There is a story, but in the time I played it never grabbed me. I was too concerned with getting from point A to point B without falling (while wondering what was off the screen shooting at me) to ever really *care* what the protagonists problem was or what NPC's wanted me to do for them and why. For me, it ended up all about getting to the end of the dungeon with little joy getting there. I did not finish the game.  Pros: Truly gorgeous to look at Varied upgradable weapons A choice of upgradable buffs The narrator  Cons: Being forced to walk diagonally on floating platforms, or fall off Choosing weapons blindly Mobs and gauntlet running (on the diagonal) This game is playable on a PC, but definitely wasn't made for PC
6560	0	a	For a hardcore Diablo II, Torchlight II, and Angband player  Playing this game is almost as fun as watching my grandma's knitting (only cuz she curses some times...)  The gimmicks ('Dynamic' (NOT!) pseudo-cool world, Narrator, Goodish OST) just aren't enough to make this pretty shallow game good enough for me...  But then, I *MIGHT* be missing something (In the story/text, probably. Gameplay s#cks bad)
6561	0	a	Boring, ultra repetative, and more of a story-concept than an actual story. The seeds of a good game might be here, but this isn't it. Wish i could get the hours i spent playing it back.
6562	0	a	Fun for a single playthrough, and just the right length, I believe, despite the recycled plot mechanics used throughout the game itself. The story left me wanting more, or rather, I felt as if there was some room for strengthening the overall plot. Ultimately, you get the point, but a lot of the game I spent wondering why I even bothered to do these tasks, much less essentially the same task like 12 times through.  Gameplay wise, it's your typical hack and slash, didn't really find myself very intrigued to try many different weapon combinations. Definitely some frustrating mechanics and control issues, particularly with the environment and how you can easily fall through some areas (though this could just be my own fault). The narrator's style was not my cup of tea, although I realize many are a fan of it. But why is it innovative, exactly? Soundtrack was great, however.
6563	0	a	The art is phenomenal. The music is pretty good. That's about it.
6564	0	a	boring
6565	0	a	Not for me. I put too much trust in the reviews. I reccomend playing the demo to preview the game. It looks nice at least.
6566	0	a	The graph is good, but the control is not accurate enough. Sometimes I want to hit A, it hits B, I want to hit east, it hits west. Maybe it is because I haven't figured out the best way to play it.  NOTE: I played this game with keyboard, maybe a great better with mouse.
6567	0	a	boring
6568	0	a	fun for the first 15mins
6569	0	a	I'm sorry: it looks kindof cool but the movement is very imprecise. Also the fights are pretty awkward..   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnmbESlYu24 
6570	0	a	A lot of people said great things about Bastion, but I found the only good thing about it to be the music. Clunky controls and slow combat make me not want to recommend this game.
6571	0	a	Bastion, although visually appealing, sorta lost my interest half way through.
6572	0	a	After I played this game for the first time, I could not believe what great reviews it had gotten. Let me start by saying the obvious: this is not a role-playing game. This is an action-adventure game. I have a very simple rule: if my character's performance depends on my reflexes, it is not a role-playing game. If it depends on the character's reflexes, that's a role-playing game. This is emphatically not a role-playing game. If you are looking for an action-adventure game where your ability to do well will depend on your reflexes and your hand-eye coordination, you may enjoy this game. You will not otherwise. Related to that, there is the additional problem that the default controls are horrible. The game uses w, a, s, and d for movement, but uses q for special moves. I lost track of the number of times I burned a black potion by accidentally hitting q when all I wanted to do was move. The game also makes it way too much of a pain in the neck just to switch one weapon for another. All in all, I found myself fighting the interface more than the enemies. Things got much better once I reset the controls, but they ought not to have been that lousy in the first place.  My key complaint, though, was that I bought this game because it was sold as an RPG. It is not.
6573	0	a	It's like 90% of the whole gaming community recommends/praises/hails this game. Visuals and narrator carry it all the way. After like 2 hours you're fed up of it cause the gameplays so repetitive. The storys pretty mediocre imo. It's decent but get it when its on sale.
6574	0	a	Meh, for a game with glamorously high amount of good and amazing reviews this game is so simple and clunky, story is also meh as it is too slow to unravel and there is no ups and down nor plots it's just a random guy narating something happened in this kid's life. Played 12 hours and couldn't take anymore boredom. Uninstalled and wished I tried the demo first before foolishly believing overly good reviews that could probably be fake.
6575	0	a	 Mean Mr. Mustard's short Bastion review    1) Essential - buy it NOW  2) Recommended - buy it on sale   3) Avoid
6576	0	a	Salty review incoming… This game had an impeccable reputation but it didn’t jive with my tastes. The lauded art design is too loud for me, but I also can’t stand the visual of LoL (perhaps I have a prejudice against neon colors) meanwhile, I’d assume millions of gamers disagree. Another prejudice; video games on the whole fail miserably when attempting to flex narrative muscles, I’d like to think I’m open minded, but I’m always let down thanks to my Game of Thrones level of expectations. Bastion is no exception; the story’s tone is a wannabe Legend of Zelda requiring far more investment than I’m willing to give an indie when I don’t enjoy the mechanics thereof, more on that later. The constant narration gimmick was widely praised which surprised me, as its charming for maybe ten seconds before proving to be taking itself seriously for the duration of this experience, like Samuel L Jackson non-stop yelling levels of “yep this is what we’re going to have to sit through. The camera angle felt disorienting for the amount of simple platforming the game asked (Surprise! The tiles you’re walking on are now gone!). The combat felt spongy and fumblingly awkward. I kept playing for a while to find the gold described by critics, I can’t remember if I finished the game, but no gold was found. The game function and is content rich with a great soundtrack for the price, but this alternate attempt of some sort of mix between a less charming Zelda with a more shallow Diablo did not impress me.
6577	0	a	Its very pretty but there isnt much point playing the game. All you really need to do is use Spacebar and WASD to run/roll around the place until the level finishes or the old dude speaks again. It would have made a far better animated TV series in my opinion, all the reviews say 'This is a piece of art!' and they may be right but you dont Play the Mona Lisa, you look at it.   I feel that Bastion falls under much the same category, vaguelly interesting to look it but no good for a decent game.
6578	0	a	Summary: Gameplay is frustratingly imbalanced and seemingly underdeveloped, keeping this title safely in the art house category instead of being an actual game.   Detail: Soundtrack, artwork, voice overs are all well done, but certain overpowered enemies, lack of ability to switch back to the weapon you entered a level with (when you discover a new weapon) and terrible map layout make this game more a frustrating waste of time than anything else. Supposedly the story is good (according to other reviews), but it's just too terrible to play to get to anything worth knowing. After every level there should be some strong piece of writing to bolster the story, but instead it just continues to meander in a sort of pseudo-philosophical rambling. In other words: get to the plot point already, please.  Play it for the music (though it gets repetitive), beautiful artwork and excellent voicework that narrates (almost) every action.   Don't expect to play an actual well-crafted game with an original (and interesting) story, however.
6579	0	a	If I could give this game an 8/10, I would, but Steam doesn't work like that. The game currently has 97% positive reviews which seems overrated, so I'm downvoting it.  Bastion has fluid gameplay, adaptable weapons, and adjustable difficulty with the shrine that gives enemies additional abilities if you find them too easy. It also has new game+ and score attack if you want to push things to the limit. The narration is innovative as well since it talks in real time while you progress through levels, but you can turn its volume down if you don't like it.   However, the game isn't all that. If you're 10-13, and this is your first time playing a game with a sophisticated plot, you'll like it. If you've played or read sophisticated plots in the past though, the game will seem bland. It really isn't that sophisticated, and even though there are flexible level select options as well as proving grounds to earn extra weapon abilities and upgrade, it's still pretty linear. At the end, you have two dilemmas to decide upon, but they really don't make a difference. You don't get to playthrough an aftermath, and the only consequence is different dialogue from the narrator and some different ending credit pictures.  This game had the potential to be truly epic a la Chronotrigger/Chronocross, but as soon as you decide on those dilemmas, the game's over. You're left asking for more, and feel like you just read through chapter 3 in a 10 chapter book where the author forgot to write the rest of it. The game dumps you into the middle of things, and while it gives a little backstory, you never get to make decisions in playing through it.  In a sense, the game feels like Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning in that it trades plot for action. The action is good, but not excellent. Many of the weapons are just copycats of each other with little nuances that let you trade them off. The enemy attack patterns are standard and predictable as well even though the difficulty is gradually ramped up.  Ultimately, Bastion is a solid purchase, but nothing more.
6580	0	a	what the ♥♥♥♥
6581	0	a	game is annoying
6582	0	a	I lost my savegame one hour in. I don't care if it's steam fault or Supergiant Games' fault, somebody clearly didn't do its frakking job. This isn't a beta or day one prepatch game, for Christ sake. This game is years old. Do your job.  Good game nonetheless, but I don't care, and you shouldn't.
6583	0	a	Overrated hipster garbage. Just buy the soundtrack.
6584	0	a	♥♥♥♥ this game. I hate it's ♥♥♥♥ing controls. ♥♥♥♥ Breaker's Barraks. ♥♥♥♥ trying to cycle through targets with the breaker's bow and time the ♥♥♥♥ing critical shot. Target cycling? What is this PSOne? I ♥♥♥♥in' rage quit this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.
6585	0	a	Unfortunately, I do not recommend this game. I want to like it, I really do. After reading such great reviews about the game I decided to give it a shot. I found the game to slow paced, I felt like the game wasn\'t dropping me into the action or immersive nature of the world quick enough. I am generally the kind of guy who loves fast paced games with lots of action. I did find the soundtrack quite good though for the short time I was playing it and I found the concept of a narrator telling the story of you, (The Boy) as you performed actions was very interesting.THIS IS JUST MY OPINION.
6586	0	a	Boring, repetitive, uninteresting...
6587	0	a	Thought it would be fun but it wasn't and I hate the narrators voice.
6588	0	a	Lame combat style. Challenges are too slow, enemies are boring. Can't believe this game has good reviews.  Literally the only thing that I like was the procedural dialogue that was triggered as you went through the level, thats it. Go play SNOW and get as ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at that game as this game
6589	0	a	Comes highly recommended, and the art is magnificent. Still, something about the relentless tweeness and tryhard 'I'm an art!' feel makes it very hard to get into.
6590	0	a	Really repetitive, becomes boring quickly.
6591	0	a	I could seriously fall asleep playing this boring game.
6592	0	a	While the artist style of the game is unique, the game as a whole is fairly weak.  The combat system is overly simplistic and consists solely of attack-dodge-repeat mechanics; minimalism is great, but this is barren. The variety of weapons should make the combat more interesting, but they don't because the combat system is too simple. No matter which weapon you pick, the difference will only be how far away you stand from the enemies.  The design and introduction rate of the weapons are lousy as well: you bounce from weapon to weapon quickly and upgrading weapons is pointless. Sure, you can activate idols, which makes weapon upgrades a bit more useful, but you're still stuck in the same poorly designed combat system.  The story is one of the worst I've had the displeasure of following. It's a trope-filled story narrated in a discontinuous manner with character building ripped out. The writers failed to make me care about the world or any of the characters. For imagery, think of the story as macaroni necklace: it's strung together, but not cohesive.  The 'narrative' expects you to be okay with the plot suddenly having certain elements; the turning point for me is when the line 'We became fast friends' is mentioned. This is the kind of inept story telling I'd expect of inexperienced writers, of high-school students. You can't simply say a bunch of things: there has to be connectivity between story points. Why did they become fast friends? The calamity isn't a good reason, as the direction the plot goes afterward shows. Am I to infer all of the character building, relationships and details that are not provided to me? That's not my job; the writers must do their part.  If you're looking for depth, subtlety and cohesion in a story, I'd send you to Spec Ops: The Line, not to Bastion.  The dreams are bits and pieces of back-story for each character, and they at the very least tie the macaroni necklaces into a giant ball. This is still a failing on the game's part with blame lying squarely on the writers and designers. Why weren't these things part of the main story? Why do they never come up via character interactions? All these elements that bring the main strand of story closer to something legitimate are tucked away in optional iterative-round fights. This comes off as poor design, and ultimately looks and feels lazy. It's squirrelled away; swept under the rug.  What passes for story in this game feels like bullet points for the beginning of a story idea.  To say I'm disappointed in Bastion is an understatement; it's completely forgettable.
6593	0	a	Thanks for putting all the character exposition in the midst of horrible, kick-your-♥♥♥ monster colloseum garbage. The game is beautiful, but not worth all this frustration and pure rage.
6594	0	a	Do not buy this game. All the normal story levels in normal difficulty aren't even challenges in any way, but all the special levels you need to do to get items to upgrade your gear and get extra abilities are hard as nails to literally impossible. The Repeater level is literally impossible to beat when you unlock it and have the best upgrades for the repeater you can get. Don't buy this game if you want to play a 'fun' game.
6595	0	a	This game is for you if you don't realize Clicker Heroes and World of Warcraft aren't the same game.
6596	0	a	
6597	0	a	the game looks great and sound good but i didnt enjoy it :( maybe i was hoping for much more
6598	0	a	Bottomline: If this one is on sale for $0.99 then get it.  The game is good and fun to play with short levels but technical issues hold it back. I have a GTX 980 Rig with 16 GB Ram. This game should run at constant 60fps. But for some reason they decided to lock it to 50. You can remove this through launch options but thats not the issue. The game lags badly every few minutes. It hits 60 fps for a few minutes and then goes to unplayable fps in the middle of a fight. I tried switching drivers. Then I decided to play this on lowest settings and finish it but apparently thats too much to ask. You cannot switch resolution through main menu. You are stuck with whatever resolution the game decides to run. When you search you will only find people asking you to use launch options.   This is an unfinished product with technical issues. If you really want to enjoy the game, buy it for PS4 if you have one. Don't bother with the PC version.
6599	0	a	While the game is quite pretty and the narration is rather clever, the combat tends to frustrate me rather than excite me.
6600	0	a	The game DOES NOT support my native resolution of 2560x1080 and needs additional time and messing around to display anything at all but a black screen. That's something you wouldn't expect from a Steam game.
6601	0	a	While the game is quite pretty and the narration is rather clever, the combat tends to frustrate me rather than excite me.
6602	0	a	Boring. Shallow. Ssssh-ite!
6603	0	a	if wanna play , play another, in few minuts you dont wanna play more
6604	0	a	Really easy, overhyped game. Artwork and narrator gimmick are cool, but ultimately the game feels very stale throughout the whole experience. In both of my playthroughs, I feel that this game gives you the best two weapons pretty much at the start. So, all the other pretty useless weapons just interrupt gameplay temporarily until you can find an Arsenal and switch back to the original useful weapons. Autolock-on mechanics are sometimes useful, but later on made me wish there was an option to disable it, as countering enemies becomes more important, but more difficult without the proper controls. Overall, story was very lame for how much the narrator yammers on throughout and the gameplay was incredibly lackluster. I'd personally say skip this gaming experience in favor of other better ones that have more game to them. However, if you are all about art and presentation, then I guess you'll like this product.  Also: 'The Kid had better things to do than go ♥♥♥♥♥♥ hunting, but he just couldn't resist.' PECKERS EVERYWHERE O_O
6605	0	a	Walking sideways is very annoying because you have to press TWO buttons to move in ONE direction. Most of the controls are too close together for a PC game. It becomes troublesome and irritating very fast.  The side-quests are tedious at best and boring on average.  There is no story. A thing happened that killed everyone and that is all they tell you.  The narrator is very good. Gives it a western vibe.  Gameplay is basic. Click button, bad guys die.  The art is…so-so. I don’t hate it, but I don’t like it. It is just kinda there. I liked the music though.  There is lots of charm to this game, but not enough practicality gameplay-wise for me to like it. 
6606	0	a	I dislike that idols are in this game. Could've been something else for the mechanic.
6607	0	a	If you don't care about 100%, this game is fantastic. However, games were meant to be completed inside and out, and half these achievements are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. You tried, Supergiant.

6611	0	a	A really good game for RPG lovers. Tactical movement , sound system and narration give a dreamy feelings.  *** But for me it crashes in the settings menu , maybe due to i am using windows 10. so i cant change any settings. *** and theres a little chance for casual players to become bored as you just go through the way and kill monsters. and you get a boss. then you do it again and again. But for rpg lovers it doesnt matter.  *** The game actually just dont worth the money . get it when its on a big sale.  overall a must buy game to pass time. but try to get it on cheap cheap price. so that you dont have to regret . *** A no from me for price , crashing on win 10 and repeatetive gameplay .  And i am applying for refund. But guys , really its not a bad game. developer did a good job.
6612	0	a	Combat is too slow, weapons feel mostly the same, and it's more about being able to roll better than fish (from nuclear throne) get nuclear throne instead, it's 100x better
6613	0	a	I don't get it. Action is slow and very limited. Last time I checked, you don't play a game for 'narration and soundtrack'. You play a game because it lures you in and is fun to play. The lure in this game should exist in a seperate forum. Maybe an animated tale instead?
6614	0	a	I can't really recommend this game. It looked fine and it received a lot of positive reviews so I expected a somehow polished one, at least; it has indeed cool graphics, decent music and the story looked not bad, but in my opinion controls are a pain and a complete mess.  I am not new in videogames, I have played plenty of them, in different platforms, since the 80's, but honestly this game is not well done and it has many issues. It's true that it's been designed with the flexibility to choose 'wasd' or 'mouse' movement. Sadly wasd movement in a game like this with this perspective is not optimal at all, and mouse movement is designed worse than bad for this game, no idea why; this is the worse 'mouse movement' implementation I have ever seen in a long long time, if not ever. Mostly unplayable with the mouse movement system if you compare it with thousands of other similar games. It's garbage.  So Bastion is better played with a gamepad (and probably it's designed for it), but even then, it looks like the game mechanics lack something badly.   For me, as I have said, the control issues —even if completely redefined—, make this game almost unplayable.  I have bought the game just for less than 2 bucks and I even regret it. I think it's the first time it happens to me on Steam, and I have more than 200 games, some of them costing like 10 or 15 times this price.  On balance, game looks fine, but sadly the ugly controls make it not worthy of my time. I honestly can't understand all the hype and the good reviews and critics. This game isn't even worth trying for free.
6615	0	a	I would not recommend Bastion unless it's on sale with 75% off or more. For some good reasons:  - the story is a mess, really terrible and hard to follow the plot, assuming there exists.  - poor RPG system, really minimal  - it's a repetitive task about flying from one map to other  - poor settings, there are only two degrees of difficulty  - no saving system wherever you like.  What's good?  - graphic  - music   If it's cheap, worth the money spent otherwise you could focus on something else.
6616	0	a	Rather boring
6617	0	a	It had a really unique gameplay and interaction compared most other adventure based games I've ever played. However, the plot and gameplay didn't grab me even though it's decently executed. I felt there was something missing with the game. It's good to past time but not enough to get you on the edge of your seat and play it 9 hours at a time. It actually felt like 'geez when will I reach to the end?' kinda feelings.   I think the problem with this game is that after awhile, combat seems to be a chore rather than actual fighting. You have your mouse and your keyboard to use for combating, but it didn't feel like combat at all. It felt like either destroy the mobs and spam potions or just die and start over with a different weapon. The choices of weapons were uneccessary as well, you'll find yourself not using 2/3 of the weapons you gain in the game as the stages aren't really created for weapon specific (unless you reach to the stage where you receieve the weapon). Also I find that you need to visit the shop to change weapons very inconvenient.   Overall it's an okay game, not that great to be honest. The art for it is goregous though.  5/10
6618	0	a	Aside from the soundtrack, which is amazing, this game is garbage. The story is boring, the narrator is only annoying. The graphics are alright, but the character design is inconsistent. The level design is a neat idea, but repetitive and level mechanics are inconsistent. I have no idea how it is so highly praised, aside from the fact it was made by only 7 people, but even compared to other low budget games this is just trash. But that soundtrack though.
6619	0	a	Bastion was a very slow game. As much as I tried to enjoy the game, the narration was poorly done. There was no emotion portrayed by the narrator. Gameplay and character movement lack any real substance. Awkward controls also dampen my experience with this game. Originally, I was going to give it 4/10, but the combat, artwork, and music brought the rating up to 6/10. I probably would not buy the studio's next game, Transistor.  Rating: 6/10 (60%) Achievements: 8/24 (33%) Game Done.
6620	0	a	I didn't know this was a game for children before I bought it. It's an RPG for 10 year olds.
6621	0	a	The art and music are great, but the gameplay is sorely lacking. I found that the narrator spoke too much too often, so that it felt like nothing he said mattered anymore. The game also *tells* the story instead of letting me witness or play the story. I just got bored.
6622	0	a	Overrated. The ideas are good, but the gameplay is repetitive and trivial. It's a beautiful game from a stylistic point of view.
6623	0	a	FULL OF BUGS,  nice graphics tough
6624	0	a	GAME IS GREAT ! but dont miss understand me !  GAME FULL OF BUGS ! EVERYDAY !  1) you save will be delete and u have to fix it !    2) you must change langauge that never change to english everysingle time or to ur own lanauge because for example my lanuage english everytime i login to play the lanauge turns to spanish or france cant i cant turn it back people saying u have to change lanuage from the proparties i DO but noting change it still in other lanauges and this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ME OFF !! i cant play game full of BUGS i lose all my time to fix BUGS instead of having fun developers must give a dam and fix these bugs ................   again game is good but if you're aint patient like me to waste you valuable time on fixing bugs everytime then have fun this is you game
6625	0	a	Honestly? Good artwork, somewhat interesting story, nice (but for me irritating) narration, music that's sometimes great and sometimes forgettable...but the game? The game is almost non existent. It plays worse than the average flash game, in terms of controls, variety and challenge. Even if I was almost at the end I've left it unfinished because I could not stand anymore to the lackluster gameplay mechanics. I'm extremely open minded and I like all kinds of games but this one, as a game, is not a good one. Keep in mind that Bastion has almost a cult status so saying that it's bad generates the same reaction of eating a steak in front of a vegan fundamentalist. Truth is that the only thing you do in this game is fighting (and you'll fight a lot) and the fighting part is poorly done. The interactions between your character and the enemies are floaty, there's no sense of weight nor of inflicted damage. I've almost finished it button mashing the whole time completely at random. Then I've quitted for unbearable boredom. Am I saying that Bastion is the worst game ever? Absolutely not, I just don't recommend it. Summing it up in a phrase: look over substance.
6626	0	a	Just couldn't get into it.  While Bastion is kind of hailed as one of the greats of indie gaming, I just played something that felt like an early beta. Enemies are too bullet sponge-y. The game seems to never be able to strike a balance with the narrator's dialogue, since he's either deathly quiet or never shuts up. Combat is just plain unsatisfying.   Grab it on a sale, but don't pay full price for this. It just isn't worth it.
6627	0	a	I really had to think about this one.   I bought this game about 3 years ago. Not quite sure how I found out about it. I tried to play it, but there was something about it tht I didn't like. I only made it through the first level.   I would try to pick this game up again every 6 months or so, but I just couldn't. So now, here I am with the game finished. Finally.   It starts off with a narrator speaking to you. He will talk to you for the entire game, so get used to it. Anway, he talks about some Calamity. This is the first problem with the game. The Calamity is never explained. Sure, it explains why it happened. How it happened. But not what it is. But for the entire game. the ground builds itself beneath your feet. I can't tell if that is because of the calamity or because of a gameplay element. Bad choice, either way.   So, you find a hammer and bow, fight off some weird grim reeper things, that apparently used to be workers. They aren't talked about in a more thorough way, however. Nothing in this game is. Except for where you go next. The Bastion.  I like the Bastion. I like building it as I progress through the story. But to build the bastion, you must get shards. To get shards, you have to go to different levels.  The levels are so repatative it is unexcuseable. It teases you with backstory, but of course, doesn't go any farther. After an hour fo this, I was done.   The next day, I sat down. I was going to finish this game no matter what. And I did. And now I have even more to complain about.   The backstory isn't revealed until 2/3s through the game. It feelsl tacked on. I slaved 3 hours for a tacked on story. I clicked and pressed space aimlessly for an extremely poor story about xenophobia. I wish I hadn't.  The game is repatitive, the narrator is intrusive, the story is mediocre, the gameplay is repative and boring. Sure, you get a few choices about how you want to fight. But the choices lack impact. They don't make the game feel any different.   But of course, this game is praised for it's art style and music. And that is about it. Even those don't make up for the many areas in which this game lacks.   I was going to buy Transistor. I don't think I will now.
6628	0	a	The first time I played Bastion, I loved it, even though it had some issues. Going back years later and playing it, I honestly don't remember what I liked about it. Awkward controls and just sort of boring all around. Maybe I'll revisit it again in a few years and see if my perception has changed at all.
6629	0	a	Game was pretty nice also quite short so I was able to get back to dota faster. Still I cannot recommend it since it isn't as good as Dota 2.
6630	0	a	Another completely overrated game! Waste of my money. And I spent like only 3 bucks for it.
6631	0	a	A visually beautiful and astoundingly boring game.
6632	0	a	  Bastion looks pretty nice, and it is obvious that a lot of work went into it. Well, the work went into the presentation. As a game, it is a disaster.  Just look at this: - the character moves rather sluggishly - keyboard controls are shoddy as you are moving in an isometric perspective - there is very little enemy variety - fighting mechanics are tedious and simplistic - the 'cool' narrator sounds grating rather quickly - there is absolutely no point in letting the character fall of the boundaries of the game world - pointlessly many weapons - RPG mechanics that were shoe-horned in  To me, Bastion is the epitome of the pretentious kind of indie game the mainstream video game press likes. If you want gameplay, pick a good Japanese game. Heck, not even the art is all that great, when I compare it to master pieces like Dragon's Crown.  The only good thing about Bastion is that I didn't have to pay for it.
6633	0	a	I can see why this game is so acclaimed, but it is really not for me. The pacing on world-building and story progression is excruciatingly slow - the level descriptions give you more about the world than the narrator's exposition does! While the game is extraordinarily beautiful visually and audibly and the system with weapons and drinks and so on is very interesting, I was looking for something a little more RPG-like and a little less of an action/platform crossover. Please, do go and read the positive reviews as I'm skewed by just not liking this style of gameplay rather than the game itself being bad at it, but I would suggest if you're a storyline gamer don't purchase this game - you'll go mad when you're a few hours in and still don't really know who you are, where you are, what has happened or what is expected to happen next, particularly when you spend half an hour falling off a platform or dying and you're not entirely sure what the point is of what you're doing anyway.
6634	0	a	The only interesting thing in this game is the narrator, otherwise it is an extremely boring hack and slash game.
6635	0	a	The art-style is indeed quite nice, but it simply did not entertain me. I find it rather boring from a game-play standpoint and the narration is really getting on my nerves, considering every little crap is being commentated - I don't need a commentator to tell me that I just went right - I can see that because I just done it myself. The characters hands are also so big that it's simply distracting to me.  Seeing that it's popular with most people, I guess it's mainly me, but if you aren't interested in that kind of story and if you are susceptible to being annoyed by commentary this may not be for you.
6636	0	a	A fantastic idea of a world which builds as you play, presents unusual but interesting gameplay. The soundtrack is by far the best aspect about this game. With a soundtrack version up for sale I highly recommend buying it. However, the gameplay itself does not live up to the enjoyment of other game similar to this. Yes the game is good and the narration is superb, it just doen't feel that it can maintain this enjoyment. So as you gradually persue the quest-line the quality of the missions deteriorate, making you feel as though its a chore to complete it. The combat seems to require no skill and the lack of diverse levels really create a negative influence on the rest of the game, which could really be quite something.   Pros: Great sound track. Good idea. Cons: Poorly executed gameplay and combat.  ~5.5/10~
6637	0	a	It's a 'good game' if you only look at the artwork and soundtrack. But the repetive gameplay and boring narroration just.. Doesn't cut it. I stopped right at the hub, as a matter afact because I looked at all of the paths that opened and I just.. Sighed. It felt like a chore to play this game. Save your money, don't buy it as you will waste it.  I played it for a bit more to get the trading cards to sell them.. But not too long after I threw my controler down. I couldn't stand how boring it was. It's just.. The gameplay is just that BAD. Do not buy this. Seriously. SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR SOMETHING ELSE. Something that isn't this bad.
6638	0	a	Bastion is an example of how a game can focus too much on aesthetics and narrative at the expense of gameplay.  Reviews for this game are generally glowing but overlook just how shallow this game really is. Less than two hours in I've come to realize that there's no challenge here, and I can just run through most of the levels. This is one of those games that's probably best enjoyed as a 'let's play' unless you enjoy tedious and dull combat.
6639	0	a	I don't get what's so special about this game. Is it the gameplay? It's average at best, I've seen more exciting gameplay in Flash games. You can choose between a few weapons, walk around smashing enemies and objects. That's it.  Is it the incredibly innovative art style? Yes, that must be what everyone loves. And it's also the thing I like least about this game.  If this review is too long for you, skip the following 4 sections.   You play as some young guy called 'Kid' who drinks spirits in a saloon to gain buffs. Also, you constantly have to listen to a narrator who sounds like he comes directly out of a really cheesy spaghetti western. He has a pseudo-cool voice and a fitting accent which just gets on your nerve after a while because it's so extremely stereotyped.  Sometimes, the narration gets pushed too far. I see a collectible and without thinking I run straight to it, the floor under my feet going down. 'Kid thought twice about getting [whatever it was]', the narrator says. Wait, what? Sure, you can comment what's happening, but when I'm controlling a characterless guy such as Kid who is only defined by my own actions, you can't just act like what's on his - on MY - mind.  But let's get back to the art style. Alright, I could live with that cheesy spaghetti western feeling. But the game takes place in an extremely colorful fantasy world. You have these bright colors, carry a bright red oversized hammer while walking through the bright green grass, fighting comical enemies. And in the background, you hear that narrator with that deep voice, telling you how bad everything is and how screwed you are. Seriously, this feels like Teletubbies suffering from depression. And if this wasn't already unfitting enough, the developers had to push it even more and add some weird oriental trip hop soundtrack which fits neither to the western setting nor to the fantasy setting.  Well, as it's neither the gameplay nor the art design which makes the game exciting for me, maybe the story is good. Let's take a look: The world is ending. Kid has to collect some crystals to rebuild a monument in order to save the world. Not special, but not bad - yet. During his journey he finds some nice survivors who then live in your homestead. After about 30 minutes you collect the last of the few crystals, but suddenly, absolutely incredible unexpected plot twist: One of those nice survivors gets into an argument and in his rage he destroys the monument which ultimately seals the end of the world. Seriously, what the hell? Did the developers go out of ideas? This is by far the most illogical action of any character I've ever seen. So, instead of collecting 5 crystals, Kid is now supposed to collect 20 crystal shards.   I stopped playing after collecting the fifth shard because the game just didn't change. The story didn't progress any further, the gameplay stayed the same, the narration was still annoying, Kid still lacked character.  Innovation can be good, but instead of focussing on a good idea Bastion is just a mixture of multiple incoherent art styles with average gameplay.
6640	0	a	This is a game that sold itself on a narrator and an art style. So yes, it looks pretty, just not in motion. The Kid, the character who will almost always be on screen, is clearly lower quality than everyone and everything else. The sound quality isn't that great either. It's certainly above average for most games, but nothing will stick with you from any part of the game I played. I didn't bother finishing this game. I tried to like it and it just kept spitting in my face.  The combat is just so dull. It's slow and unsatisfying. The game gives you a great variety of weapons to choose from, and upgrade. You set out for a mission with the idea that your loadout and the different ways the weapons and abilities work is how you want to play, except the game doesn't care what you chose because the game REALLY wants you to try out this new weapon and won't let you continue without picking it up. It says 'I don't care how you wanna play. You're using this un-upgraded, unfamiliar weapon until I say so.' So the way you decided to play gets thrown out the window because the game doesn't care about what you want. It's all tell and no show. The enemy variety, art-wise is very low. Enemy art is reused and recolored to show different behaviors, except you'll never learn them unless they just spawn behind you a whole bunch or you get an actually interesting and large battle. Most of the time you see the ground form up or a box drop from the sky and you can just destroy them from afar. For the first few levels this isn't so bad. Once you get to the swamps it gets much worse. I made it to the point where you got the fire billows, another lackluster weapon, crammed down your throat. The enemies at this point were a bunch of plants that just sit there and spray you with near constant streams of projectiles, sometimes birds pop up and bug you too. There has yet to be a good boss fight in this game. Don't buy this. Don't play this, it isn't fun. If you really like the sound track, just go pirate it.
6641	0	a	my 3rd party controller doesnt work on this game. seems to work on all my others.
6642	0	a	Simple and ripetitive gameplay. Boring game with nice art and worthless plot.
6643	0	a	I love the game but; 1. projectile going through targets 2. aiming is off  Fix it please. Until then i have to give this a thumbs down.   Edit:  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=296150325   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=296325843   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=296324585   TL;DR guy can't aim for his life.
6644	0	a	I really wanted to like this but I just don't. Not sure why, but when I finally got to that mission hub and all the paths opened up I was like '*sigh* do I have to play all these?' Just feels like a chore for some reason.
6645	0	a	I always was quite sceptic if this type of games - asian console Zelda-like games - was my cup of tea. As Bastion was received so positively, I gave it a try at a Steam sales. Graphics &amp; music are quite pretty &amp; colorful. Almost everything is destructible and some weapon/skill customization is available, but bad skill choices of my part, repetive and sometimes hard frenetic gameplay &amp; problems with correct aiming kept me from restarting the whole thing.  If you like games that have a resemblance of console games, this will be a mostly game for you. For those that were never in console games at all, you can try this one but be aware that it can turn out to be a disappointment.  So I am sorry it's Bastion for this type of games to be the one to get negative feedback from me, but it couldn't grab my interest for long. It didn't connect.
6646	0	a	the only thing more annoying than the MEH level of gameplay, is the PAINFUL to the point of making your EARS BLEED narration.  seriously of all the voice actors in the world they went with THAT???? 
6647	0	a	Bastion’s only thing going for it is it’s superficial artistic matter which it doesn't really have in the long rune, it's soundtrack is really dull and sounds like the type of stuff you would hear from a russian flash animated mmorpg (which it's art style also reminds me of) the gameplay is too slow and sluggish and it’s out there for me as one of the worst isometric shooters in a while due to the fact of how BORING it is. Again, a game I was happy to get out in the long run more money from selling it's cards in terms of profit. The 1 dollar was definetely not worth it.
6648	0	a	The art is nice, gameplay is decent, world makes no sense and overall the game is too linear for me to enjoy. Also the narrator becomes grating very fast.
6649	0	a	The art is very good and the story is interesting, but it's not a very good game. It's like the bad brother of Ys, gameplay- and combat-wise. If you are interested in a good action-RPG in a fantasy world you should check Ys: Oath in Felghana or Ys Origin, they are far better than Bastion.  http://store.steampowered.com/app/207320/   http://store.steampowered.com/app/207350/

6651	0	a	I've never seen a game fail so many cases of basic design, and each one left me wondering either what I was expected to do or what the ramification of my actions were. It starts off w/your very first move in the game. With no hint at all of what you're supposed to do first, you're expected to make the leap that even though you're on your back apparently sleeping you should just move and you'll wake up. Another example rears its head when you start to move: the world is isometric, but movement is not and I couldn't find a way to change that (at least not in settings). What this means is that your movement is never aligned with the basic directions of the level...you have to combine two movement inputs instead (forward diagonal left and right combined to move forward). That's normally not a big deal, except this game's level design expects you to avoid areas that cause you to die. As a result, you wind up having to use magical combinations of movement direction input to navigate past places you'll fall and die over. And the problem with dying is that you're told when you start a new game and pick a difficulty that if you don't choose 'normal' which has limited lives you'll miss out on achievements...which leads at least me to believe that dying has a consequence. That consequence was never communicated to me.  The menu system suffers the same problem: there are regions delineated as buttons, but you can't just press them anywhere in the region (like you could the physical analog they're crafted after for the ironic purpose of making interaction easier to understand), you have to press on the *letters* on the buttons. Worse, there's no feedback or hints to tell you this. Once again, you have to spend unintended effort/time learning this and then dealing with the aggravation.  The same thing happens with navigation and determining what to do next. I spent five minutes in the Bastion lost because the visual cues and narration point you at the travel kiosk at the top of the area while telling you to build something. Naturally I assumed the visual cues were telling me to build something on the travel kiosk's black circle. I died three times falling off the edge instead. Then I wandered around, and the combination of this and the character's slow movement speed ramped up the aggravation meter even more and highlighted another design flaw: when you restrict movement speed you need to design level spatial layout to accomodate (design things sufficiently close together to prevent the character from spending unnecessary amounts of time just jogging around). Finally after watching my character jog around for a few minutes and getting bored I noticed the two places on the opposite bottom left side of the area where I was actually expected to build something. The visual cues given pointed me in the exact opposite direction of this. The mistake was so obvious and led to enough time spent lost I started to wonder if the game's designers understood that their game might eventually be played by a human.  Here, I'll break it down to the simplest--if you decide to take on the task of entertaining someone else, and you choose a dynamic medium like games, you take on the responsibility of being a thoughtful and considerate host. At any time that you do not, you risk forcing them to feel their time is being wasted, their basic needs aren't being considered, and the host's concern over any of this can even come into question to varying degrees and amounts along the way. I ran into another case of this just exiting out of the game partway through the first level. With no indication of when your game is saved, when I restarted it forced me to start a new game over, leading me to believe it hadn't saved any of my progress. That led to more time spent watching the beautifully rendered character...jog. Not my idea of fun, and something that inconvenient made me wonder if the game's devs cared much about the player's experience.  This kind of thing leads to unnecessary aggravation at least, but it usually leads to just plain ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games. When I encounter more than a handful of these instances in the 1st level of a game (there were more I lost patience noting here), I lose the desire to continue. Pretty backgrounds and music don't help here, and you'd think things like enough great retro low pixel games would have clued someone into this.  There might be a decent game hidden somewhere past Bastion's first level. Problem is, it was such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ host for the 1st level that I'm not sure I care to risk more ♥♥♥♥♥iness to find out.
6652	0	a	It looked like a cool game, but the gameplay is just a bunch of button mashing. It's difficult but the only thing you can really do to be better is click faster. I didn't think there was much story to the game (which is what I originally thought there was going to be) .   Overall, good game, but its just not for me.
6653	0	a	Controls feel sluggish. I didn't like the environment constantly raising into place, it's very distracting. Hard to spot your character on screen sometimes when surrounded by lots of little enemies.
6654	0	a	Bastion was one of those games that you look forward to sit down and play. So when it was X-BOX controller ONLY compatible....  A shame. A dirty rotten shamful lie to say it's fully controller compatible.  Some of us like to PC on the couch and Bastion was supposed to be my new companion.  Maybe one day the gods will gift me with a Windows manufactured and owned controller. Until then? Can't rate a game I was going to spend on the sofa. 'Full Controller Support' my foot.
6655	0	a	Pretentious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.

6657	0	a	its to short...

6659	0	a	It's a decent game. I don't recommend it.
6660	0	a	Overrated. Didn't enjoy the gameplay one bit, found it very boring. Sountrack was nice but the art style and story failed to captivate me. Seems like something you'd play on an Ipad or other mobile device when you're bored on a road trip.
6661	0	a	If you want to experience 'Bastion' save yourself the money and just play 'Spiral Knights' while having a friend narrate everything you do in a faux Ron Perlman/Tom Waits voice, occasionally stopping to play a Cat Power song on your CD player. That would about sum it up. It's really not so much a game as it is a kind of neat gimmick (i.e. the voice over) tacked on to the most mediocre ARPG ever created. Of course the typical formula for an indie game these days is 'retro gameplay + a gimmick = success' and there are much worse games (and, indeed, much worse gimmicks) out there than 'Bastion.' But I really can't think of another game that is more grossly overrated than 'Bastion' is. Once the novelty of the voice over wears off it really doesn't have much which would distinguish it from the literally scores of free-to-play, browser based, ARPGs out there (except, maybe, the backstory which is, by turns, both half baked and over wrought). Don't see what the fuss was about with this one.
6662	0	a	I don't really know what it is. I really wanted to like this game, and really looked forward to have it ...  I think first and foremost they f*cked up the controls. It just doesn't feel right and I tried with keyboard and XBox Controller.  Second is that nearly every time I want to play this game I have to check the gamefiles integrity because it just won't boot up at the first try. Then a small file is downloaded and after that it runs fine.  Third is that it just gets boring and repetitive. And furthermore as soon as you finally found out what weapon suits you well the game takes the weapon away at the beginning of the next mission so the only thing you can really play with the setup you like to is that damn dream sequence over and over and over and over and over and over and over (and maybe even more) again.  There is so damn much done right in this game that I nearly hate myself for doing so but I, personally, can't recommend this game.  The one thing that's really great about this game though is it's soundtrack and the art design. The OST can be bought seperately. Maybe you should go for that instead of buying the whole thing because the artdesign you can see on the screenshots and in the videos ...  @ngel
6663	0	a	I don't reccomend this game simply because it is too short and not what everyone led me to believe it would be. The controls on pc are clunky so unless you have an Xbox controller you will fall off the egde. It has very little re playability for a game with such a short campaign. I found the narrator annoying. Visuals are ok but overall its nothe rdecent indie game. don't believe the hype.
6664	0	a	Bastion is an interesting take on an isometric hack and slash where everything everywhere is floating, and therefore, almost everywhere is a pit.  The art is good, the narrator is good, the animations aren't bad...  I like isometric hack and slash.   I can't stand this game.    Thankfully the dev added 'windbag ranch' near the beginning so I can stop playing, write this review, and delete the game.  Your character has tiny little arms and legs, so he moves like an anthropomorphic turtle.  In order to move faster, you must roll... but rolling is hard to control. Did I mention pits?  Windbag ranch is an arena for learning the 4th weapon of the game - a sword. The arena is surrounded by monster spawners and turrets, the only weapon you can use is the sword. Three turrets are floating outside the arena. You must kill all the monsters within 60 seconds. The monsters can fly, and half of them  run away from you...   You can't kill them without throwing your sword at them (unless there's some way to fly coming later on. I doubt that) Throwing your sword takes about 1-2 seconds, and of course it's a slow projectile... so it typically misses at range. Add to this that you have to aim for the enemy's shadow to hit their body. Add to this that you are slower than they are. Add to this that it's not always clear whether you can walk on a spot or fall ... and did I mention that there are three spawners for these monsters?  If you kill the spawners the monsters will have time to scatter - you'll never kill them all in 3 minutes if this happens. If you don't kill the spawners... the monsters never stop spawning...  I can understand super frustrating end game challenges like chocobo racing to obtain the best sword in FF10. This is a XP grind / training arena, and everytime I fail it I must  - shuffle over to the reset button   &gt;confirm reset&lt;  - watch the entire training area intro animations...  One of the levels is made almost entirely of falling platforms - there was an area I couldn't get to because as soon as went the wrong direction I couldn't go back.   This is the model for the entire game - pits and resets.  I haven't even heard enough of the story to know why I'm gathering crystals...  I'm glad the developer put windbag ranch in the game early - It probably saved me a few hours attempting to play this game.  Bastion is perhaps a very good game.   I can't stand it. Playing it is frustrating and slow for reasons I hate.
6665	0	a	this game isnt very great.
6666	0	a	It's an ok hipster time-waster but pretty boring. Click on things until they die. Sometimes you upgrade your weapon so you don't have to click as much. Nice art and music.  I don't know why it gets such high praise.
6667	0	a	This game is just copy paste from the Japanese 'Children of Mana' for nintendo DS, wich was serious, hard, and you could understand what you were doing.  On it this wonderful piece of being hipster has some pretty annoying graphics that look made from some disturbed Deviantart Queen beside of drawing some damn Ponies humping one on the other. Everything is coated with some awful wannabe Diablo music, but still for the whole family, so that even the dog can apreciate it. The worst thing remains the story teller, that just tells what you are doing every 2 seconds, and makes me yell to my poor laptop 'DAMN MAN I KNOW WHAT THE HELL I'M DOING', I never found Navi annoying on ocarina of time, but this... this kills me.  So now I go back to some serious games and won't care anymore about this deviantart sweetie hipster ♥♥♥♥.
6668	0	a	I know I'm in the minority here by a long shot, but this game is not at all what I expected and the narration that is so highly touted gets on your nerves about 40 seconds into the game. The quaint WASD controls may have worked if the game didn't force you to go in weird directions that require odd combinations of WASD to even go in the right direction. The 'RPG' aspect of the game is on life support as well. After playing all of 5 minutes (despite it oddly saying '46' minutes) I requested a refund when it was on sale for $3.64. I do not even read the responses to my reviews so don't bother. It's my opinion and there are no wrong answers as such...
6669	0	a	Like seriously it actually got worse the longer it went on
6670	0	a	so far up its own ♥♥♥♥ it needs colon irigation to save it

6672	0	a	The controls for combat are a pain to use and i was just bored as hell while playing.
6673	0	a	This game's made me lose faith in game critics, I've tried hard to see what the appeal is. I'll try and break it down to see if I'm missing something:   So we have a game mechanic that involves you controlling a character from a third person view using point and click interactions to interact with the environment. Doesn't seem too original to me, I've played many many games that use that same mechanic, to me it's boring to others it might be new.  So what else do we have; the storyline; post-apocalyptic. Trying to rebuild the world. There was a war. Again it's not really original enough for me, fair enough if you've not heard that story before then it might be intriguing, not for me though.  The sound - music is nice I wouldn't class it as critically acclaimed but fits the mood of the game and is varied enough to not bore me. The narration for me is probably the nicest feature, it makes the game a lot more immersive, the voice acting spot on.   Graphic assets; they look OK, they have their own style and feel, environment feels slightly dream-like not sure how that connects with any of the other aspects of the game though.  Can't think of much more to assess, am I missing something? My conclusion is that we have an over-used game mechanic combined with an over-used story but with a half decent soundtrack and a novel way of narrating a computer game. Problem is you can't rate a game on the narrator it's like reviewing a restaurant based on the quality of the plates.
6674	0	a	Quite overrated. Theres nothing really 'new' in this game. Good graphics. Soundtracks which this game seemed to boast to is not that amazing, personally - it's just doesnt sound too rpg'sh  One thing I'm irritated with this game is the narration. The ebonics style narration. I am so sorry if this sounds racist somewhat but this style of narration is not suited for RPGs please. Logan Cunningham has a beautiful and clear voice but I simply didnt like the style. It simply breaks the immersion and the lore it tries to establish.
6675	0	a	it's meh.. i pushed hard to finish only for the sake of it. combat was boring and story wasn't ground-breaking either.
6676	0	a	The game demands a 360 controller (gross). I got it one and it absolutely failed to detect it. I'm sure it's a neat game, but this was a horrible start. A horrible start in a world with a million kabillion games I have available to play. So, SORRY BASTION - I have no time for your horseapples.
6677	0	a	simply one of the greatest FPSs of our time
6678	0	a	I know it's a very unpopular opinion, but this game uses (although beautiful) visuals and a narrator with a soothing voice (which I'll get back later) to muster the fact that the gameplay is nothing at all special. It's bland and repetetive, and just not at all fun. A lot of people went crazy for this game back when it came out, back when quality inde games were much less common. Indie games simply never looked this good, and people were really just blinded by that fact alone to pay attention to the fact that the game simply isnt much fun. Now, that narrator- praised by the massses as one of this games major, unique, selling points, was something I couldn't stand. Having a voice tell you about everything going on made it feel like a non-stop tutorial level, and I had to mute it after awhile. It's a pretty game, and far from the worst I've ever played, but it's just not a whole lot of fun. Not a bad game, but not worth your time over some of the indie masterpieces out there.
6679	0	a	It's fun, and I really like it, but I like to collect everyhing I can just becasue, insidentally this game is very hard in that respect, as you are frequently presented with off the beaten trail locations to test your skill and to get items. I stopped playing for this very reason, it's incredably frustrating and time consuming to get down exactly what to do perfectly becasue they expect you to be perfect at it, thus my own instinctual drive to explore and gather everyhting I can for postarity is commonly met with heavy resistance making me quite discouraged and uninterested in finishing the main game as I like to turn over every stone before moving on so I never need to go back. The regular game is great though, that's a ten out of ten, it's just if you like exploring and gathering everything you can you should also be increadly bullheaded to withstand the wall of failure that will hold you back, or only play for the story, or just be naturally talanted at the game, which apparently I am not.
6680	0	a	Boring gameplay, Horrible narration. Extremely overrated.  Also could someone who is downvoting me tell me what is fun at mashing a button to see enemies die, and then pressing another button when your health is low. In a game that has almost no story, and the main character has no personality and is constantly being called a 'kid' by a narrator who has a horrible american accent that does not fit it the theme of this game at all.
6681	0	a	Wow a man is commentating everything I do! Better give it 10/10 even if it's a mediocre game.
6682	0	a	this game is cute and inventive but the narrator is lamer than all hell and the core gameplay wasnt deep enough to keep me going
6683	0	a	There just isn't enough content. I played through the entire game twice and then didn't know what else to do.
6684	0	a	Linear, Repetitive, Bad Story. Narrator is dam annoying too. I guess I expected more from this game given its reviews. It just does not stack up.
6685	0	a	it is not bad, it is just not for my taste   NEUTRAL
6686	0	a	It's gorgeous and terribly, terribly overrated. And then a few hours in, the game lost all of my saved progress and after the rage subsided I realized that I didn't even care.
6687	0	a	Finished the storyline in about 6 hours of gameplay. I found the game to be pretty difficult to get the hang of, and with not much replay value. The artwork and story are really pretty, though.
6688	0	a	I did not find the story engaging. The way in which the story was narrated was exciting and new, but that wasn't enough to redeem the weak plot. From a gameplay standpoint, Bastion is little more than a button mashing festival of boredom.
6689	0	a	Terrible game, repetitive, boring and the damned fang repeater doesn't shoot where you're aiming depending on where you're pointed, making the challenge for it near impossible. Do not buy.
6690	0	a	If you can't get invested in the story or narration device, then this game doesn't really offer much.
6691	0	a	Stare at an Salvador Dali painting. Now read a Tolkien book (just parts of it). What would happen if the two works of art come together? Say, Dali painted a scene from the Lord of the Rings series? Or if Tolkien could put in words a Dali painting? Give either concept the most basic of Action RPG mechanics, with a old west kind of sound track and BAM, you just made Bastion. One would think that two great masters of different mediums working together on the same project would create a stellar result. Few times, it works, but more often, it does not; Bastion is the latter.   Gameplay: The gameplay is basic, nothing more. It uses standard action RPG mechanics played on an isometric map. Like a lesser Zelda game. The weapons are broken, favoring all ranged weapons. I know that there are those that prefer melee, but it is pointless when a fully upgraded shotgun or blowgun can cut down anything and everything. The weapon challenge mode can easily be exploited. An endurance challenge can be fun in early gameplay but when a myriad of perked up ranged weapons are used, they become pointless. The difficulty can be adjusted to give more of a challenge. But this is pointless when a game should have natural challenges inherent to each enemy and enemy type. The payoff is adding a percent increase to currency and XP which can be beneficial from early to mid game, but becomes pointless end game. The dodge mechanic is similar to jumping in Portal: it can be used for its intention, but its just a faster mode of transportation as the Kid’s runs painfully slow. One interesting feature was how the narrator, Ruckus, sometimes narrates the actions the Kid makes, like rolling too often, destroying scenery pieces, defeating a boss, etc… It is a unique quirk that gave it some depth, and could have made the story much better, but it’s noting too special. Rather than using traditional RPG character stat leveling, Bastion uses weapons upgrades and a perk system. All of the perks, stats, weapons, upgrades and currency carry over in New Game+. This makes pointless gameplay even more pointless.  Rather than standing up to the big time RPG's, the game takes a safe approach. It feels more like 'baby's first RPG.'  Story:  The world of Bastion can summarize the whole story; it is a pretty world that feels loose and is fabricated on the spot but has no real understanding about what’s under the Kids feet. In the world of Bastion, an event called the Calamity happened which reduced the nation of Caelondia (but I presume a world) to a series of floating islands in the sky. Now the player, the Kid, has to piece together the remains of the world in hopes to save… something; the Bastion, probably. It’s really cryptic and really has no grounding. If you are going to destroy a city or world, then it would help to have some context as to what is being destroyed. The game is centered on rebuilding the Bastion by collecting crystals that restore buildings to their former state and finding any survivors. And because of this lack of context, there wasn’t any sense of urgency. Reading the Wikipedia gave more story than what was delivered. But what’s even worse, is a (spoiler) moral choice ending. It’s kind of hard to make a moral choice when there is nothing to compare it too. The whole story is told though the perspective of the narrator called Ruckus. It is an interesting narrative method for games. The story felt as if someone is sitting down and telling player a story. However, there is little disposition to character depth, world settings, and overall no relations other than with Ruckus. After all it is told from his perspective so it feels appropriate to him. This would make a good story to read, or listen to, or watch as an animation. it does serve it’s purpose. The flip side to this is that there is a level of disconnect with the Kid. The player is watching the Kid’s actions while being told a story along the way. The story might make sense in Ruckus' head, but it doesn't translate very well.  As a whole, the story is forgetful. It involves a lot of piecing together what lead up to the Calamity. It’s a post apocalypse, centered on a world that really has no reason to exist. It’s hard to save something when you don’t know what you’re saving.   Art: The art of Bastion is one of its, both in sound and artwork. The sound track is somewhat of a hybrid of folk music with and old west. The artwork has a very vibrant pastel appearance that brings a softness to the world. The music fits with the tone of the world, but the artwork clashes too much with the gameplay. The music is nothing spectacular. It does what music is suppose to do in a game, set the tone. It does a good job of setting a soft tone and has the feeling of sitting around a campfire. The music is combines well with the gameplay and story. The sound effects have an unusual and other world sound which makes it unique to the game itself. There could have been more variety of sound effects to distinguish between some enemy types, but this is only a small part.  The artwork is bright, colorful, and very detailed. Like the music, the artwork is also designed to set the tone of the game. However, this artwork clashes with the game too often. Having the floor build under the player is no different than lighting a preset corridor. The Kid can fall off the edges but not on the sections being built. Too often the borders are vague and clashing or the holes in the floor are small and hard to see when fighting in a fast paced battle. Paths can feel vague and unknown even though they are prebuilt to “light the way. Buildings and structures have a shanty town appearance that feel like Megaton in Fallout 3 with a vibrant paint job. If this is a post apocalyptic world, then it doesn’t appear that way. If this is a western, it’s too green and vibrant. Many of the enemies blend too well with the environment and it can be difficult to detect where the attack is coming from. The Bastion’s art work should have taken much more of a minimalistic approach to designing the game that could match the gameplay and or story. Bastion’s sound is good for setting the tone but it is not worth listening to on an MP3. The artwork is too much and too colorful to create an effective setting and world. On the surface it carries the appearance of a bright colorful world with a simple story like with a Mario game or Zelda: Wind Waker. But to use their color and design choices to tell a story in a post-apocalypse setting really does not do it justice.   The Bastion could be best summarized by eating a homemade sandwich at work. The gameplay is like store bough deli meats, with regular cheese, maybe tomato and lettuce, and a hint of pepper with a light mayonnaise. The artwork is equal to having handcrafted artisans bread that has a unique flavor and texture. It might have some variety and looks pretty, it might taste different, and others may call it the best tasting sandwich ever, but all it can do is satisfy the hunger to get though the day. Eat this sandwich along with hearing some slow western country song while the old raspy co-worker tells a story, and that is the experience of playing the Bastion. It is a treat for some but not for those looking for more substance.   
6692	0	a	the gimmicks are eventually bogged down by overly simplistic gameplay and repetitive environments, leading to what can only be described as ♥♥♥♥ game design.
6693	0	a	I appreciate what they tried to do. I think a stronger storyline and connection with the characters could have made this something special.
6694	0	a	A guy talks about the things you do while you engage in tedious combat.
6695	0	a	Quite cool game, seems...  but ITs ♥♥♥♥ING BORING
6696	0	a	bastion more like complete freaking dogeshit
6697	0	a	I've got mixed feelings on Bastion.... The story is fleshed out and paced very well, the graphics look great, and the soundtrack is amazing.... The gameplay was just too fast paced and chaotic for me, and in the end kept me from finishing the game even though I was only a couple hours away from beating it.. Ofcourse, if you enjoy fast combat and dodging and blocking a million things on screen then you'll probably like Bastion, but personally I cannot recommend the game.
6698	0	a	Probably, nobody will agree with me, but I frikin HATE THIS GAME!  Yes, the visuals are very nice. But this is the only point I liked about this game. The gameplay is way too slow, you are forced to dogderoll all the time to get moving. Which is risky, cause you'll probably fall off the edge and lose more time. While fighting you are always limited to those small panels and ways, which pop up to slow sometimes.  There is no real difference in all the weapons you can unlock, same with encountered enemies, except bosses. It's either flailing or charge shooting, whatever. I got nightmares from the music, it's so dang repetitive.  For me as a german, with subtitles for the narrator, he becomes annoying as well. His english is advanced and a bit mumbled, you are forced to read the subtitles to know what's going on. But when you do, you are gettin whacked by monsters.  It was interessting in the beginning, but got very annoying very quick.  I can understand why many people like this game, but Geezus, I frikin hate it.
6699	0	a	The most boring and tedious game I've ever played.

6703	0	a	Sam Elliot won't stop talking. I think my game is broken.  Just buy the soundtrack. what a dull game.  I got the black screen error. Thanks SuperGiant! Nice to know you care enough about your game to not fix a very prevalent bug.  this game won a ton of awards for copying the villain structure of a game from 1992.
6704	0	a	The kid got real tired of my monotone voice and lazy gameplay after a while. The kid uninstalled, but kept the soundtrack.
6705	0	a	pretentious indy garbage
6706	0	a	Got the game on sale and was expecting fantastic gameplay like something from Dust: Elysium, but the game seems centered around art more than actual playing. Even the story wasn't that fantastic -- the whole story seems choppy from the start without any real background or progression. If you want a game that has beautiful art and a pretty good soundtrack then you might like this, but if you want a game with amazing gameplay and a really deep story, then this probably isn't for you.
6707	0	a	I cant describe how much i hate this, he just gets POTG for holding m1 and killing 2 people and then he shoots me down before i can get the 3 rockets off to get him out of that stupid sentry mode
6708	0	a	I love the music, I love the art style, I love the narrative. I HATE THE CONTROLS. I...I can't enjoy a run and gun that doesn't have at least tight 2D field of view. 3/4 view is Landstaker madness from the Genesis days. NO. NO.
6709	0	a	I can't find the fun in this game. Annoying voice over. To be honest, growing sick of gaming. Probably a biased thumbs down. I will keep trying, but so far not enjoying this game.
6710	0	a	I found the whole experience slow, bland and over rated. Watching the credits is hilarious its 15 people that actually worked on the game and then 15 minutes of WB executives.
6711	0	a	I thought this game was going to be like a proper fantasy title not some fantasy mixed in with some wild west themed stuff. It just wasn't what I expected it to be.   The soundtrack does nothing for me and the narrator is just annoying as hell. 'The kid this and the kid that'. I can see why some people might like it but it just didn't hit the nail on the head for me. A little kid who is able to swing around a hammer and the western theme just doesn't appeal to me.  In fact, the only thing I liked is the art style which is quite pretty.
6712	0	a	I did not understand why this game was so praised when I played it. People called Bastion a gorgeous game with a very unique narration, but I honestly didn't think this game brought anything truly new and innovative to gaming or storytelling. It's actually a typical, linear action/RPG-esque game with a slightly retro feel, some good but repetitive music and a story that hasn't really impressed me.  Bastion is a good game, but I didn't understand why it was hyped and, despite my numerous attempts, I was simply never able to finish it and got bored about halfway through. I just found the gameplay very repetitive : you basically click on everything that moves until it dies in a typical action-RPG fashion, except you don't have the loot, gold or rewards that make these games so addicting. Combat just wasn't satisfying and was often a matter of mashing Mouse1 and blocking once every five seconds before repeating until the monster/boss was down. Challenge levels are more frustrating than they are challenging and the special gear you find in these levels isn't very useful or fun to use because it often simply gives you more ways to kill enemies you could already easily kill with your hammer by left-clicking them to death.  It's unique in its visual presentation, but in my opinion, the game's originality ends there, and it does not compensate for its lackluster gameplay.
6713	0	a	Boring
6714	0	a	The isometric perspective bugs me in this. Gameplay also just seems kind of simple. This game didn't pique my interest, but I didn't spend much time with it so maybe I missed out on something. Or maybe I'm just crazy :P
6715	0	a	While the Narration is pleasing to the ear and the visuals are nice, the actual gameplay elements are just plain lackluster. If I hadn't gotten this for $1 in a Humble Bundle, I would feel like I overpaid.
6716	0	a	This game is ♥♥♥♥. Like, the graphics are horrible. They look like they were hand painted. I mean, who the hell wants that in a game! Also, the music is ♥♥♥♥. It's like. Acoustic guitars, and junk. WHO THE HELL CARES ABOUT GRANDPA MUSIC, I MEAN, JESUS. WHY DIDN'T SKRILLEX DO THE SOUNDTRACK FOR THIS! My biggest complaint is the gameplay. You can't get any 360 420 quickscope noscope breast enhancemends, and I can't make half-♥♥♥♥♥ montages about it.  In total, I'll give this game a 10/10, for being utterly beautiful in all the right ways, and being something unique. I love it very muchly.
6717	0	a	I have one of the newer Retina MacBook Pros and Bastion does not work on it. I have contacted SuperGiant Games and they have not given me any kind of solution to the problem.   This is apparently not an uncommon problem. Buy at your own risk.
6718	0	a	The design of the whole thing is a bit childish, but the drama has some strong undercurrents, and the gameplay is slick. It's a fun adventure to play through, though nothing to write home about.
6719	0	a	A pretty hack and slash game with unique concepts, but with awkard fighting mechanics. Not recommended unless you are really into hack and slash type games.
6720	0	a	I recommend staying AWAY from Bastion. ▬▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬▬  ×°×★Summary Review★×°× Overall Rating: ★★☆☆☆ [2/5] Story: ★★★☆☆ Gameplay: ★☆☆☆☆ Sound: ★★★☆☆ ▬▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬▬ THE BAD: This game fails at what could have been epic. Fighting the mechanics is tougher than fighting the monsters. And good god, I haven't seen such rock VS paper weapon mechanics since my old days of Pokemon. Each mob has a specific gymic which is not challenging, just annoying while also slowing down combat most of the time. Others it's so mindlessly easy it's like cutting thru cord-wood. Even the easy mode is most annoying.  THEGOOD: The narrator did a great job. And the music is good....what you're expecting more?
6721	0	a	Not very hard game, must be for the younger folk.
6722	0	a	Style over substance. The game-play felt cumbersome and limited. The visuals were interesting but unoriginal. Only things of merit were the soundtrack and narration. But they are not enough to make the game worth playing.
6723	0	a	Hated it. The story didn't appeal to me, nor did the character development. Narration was annoying. Didn't like the floating world. The last straw was the 'Machete Level.' Completely useless targeting system. Uninstalled. I just bought it for the soundtrack; wish I would have saved the extra $5 and skipped the game.
6724	0	a	♥♥♥♥ GAME  so yeah i forgot to update this after i played it... basically it's a really mediocre game where some guy with a deep voice tries to distract you from how bad it is by talking a lot
6725	0	a	I'm sorry but I don't know what the fuss is about.  That being said the soundtrack is phenomenal.
6726	0	a	I heard a lot praise about this game, and whilst being a very avid RPG fan, I thought I'd try it out. I was a bit disappointed really.   I admit the game is very beautiful, well designed, but I didn't really enjoy the gameplay, the weapons all felt a bit awkward and the combat a bit disjointed, the town feature felt pointless with upgrading and expanding it, and you basically just romp through the levels hitting stuff and jumping about whilst some guy narrates it all.   The game is incredibly easy in terms of the story and takes less than 4 hours to complete, even though there are much harder challenges through the use of Idols and a newgame+, it feels way too manufactured or forced in terms of difficulty, rather than a challenge that's fun to beat.
6727	0	a	The name of this title should be changed to 'The Kid' cliche'. Used extensively to the point of pure irritation. For me that just ruined it. It's repetitive and gets stale quickly. A lot of others like it and that's great. Just not for me.
6728	0	a	This game is boring, stop being smelly homo hipsters
6729	0	a	VERY over rated brawler, yeah it looks nice but the gameplay is shallow and the whole game is pretty boring. its not a very good brawler or shooter and if it didnt have that 'OMG its an indie game! thats SOOOO deep' it wouldnt have been half a poular than it is. Just another good looking piece of indie crap
6730	0	a	The feeling you get when you complete Bastion is one of relief. You are so over joyed that the terrible game is over and you can uninstall it and play something half decent.  This Game is only enjoyed by the biggest of Cucks.
6731	0	a	Dont like this game at all heres why:  -game is just extremely colorfull, u want just to puke after few minutes of play, its like game for very little kids 3-6 years old  -the commentator, he tell your story in western movie style and its the most annoying and boring thing ever, he tell that u fight scumbags and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, and those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s are little fluffy blue creatures LOL   -and last its the combat, its a 2D game but its presented as if u play 3D, its very unclean, also all rpg elements are boring  So i dont recomend this game, not if u are older then 6.
6732	0	a	
6733	0	a	I can't say I really liked this game. There was something about the Narrator that was really grinding my gears. It's either you love it or you hate it, I guess.  The presentation and graphics were nice, but I found the gameplay to be chaotic very often, to the point where it was simply not fun at all.
6734	0	a	Should be cool for kids but not for grown ups ...
6735	0	a	I don't really know why but bastion is a game that looks awesome, I love the art, the game type, everything. However, I simply can't get myself to like this game, probably because there's that strange voice in the background that I really hate...  For me, this game is missing Multiplayer. I would play this game if it had some co-up options but it has nothing and I find that a bit sad. The universe is as I said before, really nice and beautiful. There are a few bugs when mapping powers though and I was actually quite annoyed by that.  I don't see really what else I could say about this game, it really doesnt stick out from the vast sea of games on steam, and I dont really get why people would play this. This game is definitely not bad. But its not good either.  My final Rating for this game is 6/10, because it just doesnt stand out in any way, yes it has good graphics but that's not enough to make a nice game, the way to explain the story is original but I personally don't like it, and the customisation options of your character are EXTREMELY limited.  PS: I see people don't find this review helpful. Well I can't really change anything about that, it's just that I personally don't like the game, I wasn't gonna lie and say that I loved it now was I? However, instead of disliking my review, you might as well put in a comment to tell me why you like this game in particular.
6736	0	a	I really couldn't understand all the hype around this. Yeah, the art style and music are good but the gameplay itself is boring. I really tried but couldn't enjoy it that much. Probably good for kids under 14 I guess.
6737	0	a	Generic pretentious indie trash/10
6738	0	a	Plays like a platformer, decidedly not an RPG.  Addendum after having finally devoted some time to finishing this. The music is beautiful, the artwork exceptional. Gameplay is abysmal without a controller. I am a keyboard player and there is one particular area near the end game, where you (FINALLY) get to jump that is a huge PITA on keyboard. The story is weak in the (mostly not) telling. The crappy choose this irrelevant course over that irrelevant course ending that is becoming annoyingly cliche is even worse here in that there is no attachment developed to the world or its characters (three besides the main, none get fleshed out). So, it's a bad button masher with bad controls and virtually no story. There is, as well, essentially no real choice that matters and no essential difference in character of 'The Kid' from player to player or playthrough to playthrough. 3/10. Soundtrack is great though.
6739	0	a	Pretty, unique soundtrack, pleasant voice acting, challenging, not particularly fun or original.
6740	0	a	This music made my ears bleed and the graphics made my eyes boil out of my head. No deal
6741	0	a	I don't know I didn't like it immediately the combat was garbage it reminded me of crappy classic MMO's and things like torchlight which are pretty bad combat wise...and i'm big on combat perspective if the game has a pretty bad combat system I wont play it if something is underpowered, slow, not fun to use in general how I am supposed to enjoy the entire game playing like this. Yea no thanks might aswell play some free to play MMO.
6742	0	a	I didn't find anything special in this game. Not a must play in my opinion.
6743	0	a	so dumb. couldnt even think up an original name. just go play overwatch you scrubs. bastion main btw
6744	0	a	Just no
6745	0	a	                                                    this game sucks its boring far too quirky and ♥♥♥♥ 
6746	0	a	bought this game on sale &gt; downloaded it &gt; played it &gt; amazed &gt; got repetitive &gt; BOOORRIIIINGGGGGGGGGGGG &gt; refund. ~the end~
6747	0	a	Requires xinput so this game only has controller support on Windows. Uninstalling and emailing Steam to request a refund.
6748	0	a	i tried so hard to like this game but honestly i was bored out of my mind. I hate when people try to be artsy fartsy and ruin a somewhat good idea. The whole thing is too far out there, it is simply trying too hard to be the next artsy game. They purposely went out of their way to make it weird, even though you can tell that is not who they are. If it was naturally weird that would be fine, but it is that awkward weird. Like that awkeward drunk guy who is not drunk but wants everyone to think that he or she is, and you have to play along or it gets even more awkward.   I give the game a Solid 50 out of 100. Great art, smooth controls, nice menus, music is very strange but not bad, just as a game package no no no.
6749	0	a	Think 'Braid' plus 'Diablo': Style, story, and dungeon crawling. Not a lot in terms of gameplay beyond that unless you want to try all the available challenges, so unremarkable overall.
6750	0	a	I think Its messed when you have a brand new mac 27' and this game just pops up as a blank screen everytime all i get is the music EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED AND FEELIN VERY RIPPED OFF!
6751	0	a	you know, im one of those people who consider video games art. people may have put bastion in some sort of museum but i consider it one of those paintings that looks like someone literally just splashed paint on the canvas directly from the can and got paid a lot of money for not much work. 2/10 would not buy on etsy
6752	0	a	Boring gameplay. Combat is clunky and all weapons feel same. Even though spirit and invoke systems provide some variety, it's not enough. Soundtracks are mediocre at best. On the other hand, art style and animations are very well done. Narrator adds some depth to the game.  For those, whose priority is 'gameplay' for 'games', I don't recommend it.
6753	0	a	Good? Yes. $15 good? No. This game is decent, but is very repetitive. If you really want it, wait for it to go on sale.
6754	0	a	This should have been right up my alley, but for some reason, I just couldnt get into it.  I think it was the weapon challenges, and trying to do them with the wonky controls. Extremely off-putting.  But I can see the potential, and maybe I will give it another go at a later date.
6755	0	a	I would like to give Bastion a good review but can't. Pretty but boring. I think it is a pacing issue. For an action game its clunky, boring, with too long of pauses between action. I've tried to play the game three times and just can't stand it.
6756	0	a	Get it on sale for a few bucks. Tight controls and easy to play. But, that narrator and repetative gameplay get old. After a few hours you've seen all it does... same enemies, tile layout etc. If there were a few more elements to it... it could have been great.
6757	0	a	Why this game is considered a good game? For the approximate combat system? For the predictable plot full of clichè? For the cast of boring characters? For the only 9 types of enemy? (boss including) Or maybe for the fact that all the missions you'll face will be the same? The soundtrack is the only thing awesome in this game
6758	0	a	Bastion was probably one of the first indie games which I wanted to play. When I finally got myself it on Steam I was happy. This game is so beatiful, have a great music and most amazing thing - narration, one kind of voice that you will never forget. Yet, Bastion is a one big disappointment. There is one reason for that and it's that game is getting boring quite fast. The story also is not bad but somehow, even with all these things combined together, I just couldn't spent in Bastion more than 30min-1hour per sitting. And so after many months I did it. I beat the game. To be honest, it was a hell ride for me. Was it gameplay? Dunno. I understand this many positive reviews and I really would want to give Bastion one myself but I can't. Even with this many great elements Bastion wasn't a fun game to play for me.
6759	0	a	The game is good and fun but the game is short. Not worth the price.
6760	0	a	Meh.. too repeating hack and slash
6761	0	a	Took a break from this game a loooong time ago because it just wasn't my cup of tea, something felt off about it. So here I am three years later, picking it up again... and something still feels off about it.  First, if it wasn't obvious from the bajillion reviews already, this is a sort of action-RPG without much of the RPG part - so basically a top down hack-n-slash. It's 2D in presentation, but everything is very obviously a 3D model.   The environmental art is pretty great, and the music really complements the feel of the world. The main character guy's model looks way beefier than he looks in the promotional artwork for this game, which is a little off putting but completely a matter of opinion.   The thing most people know about this game is the Narrator guy, who both looks and sounds like he should be narrating the adventures of Clint Eastwood in the grittiest cowboy movie ever filmed, but instead somehow found a job narrating the adventures of oddly beefy protag in crumbling world land. I'll give the game credit where it's due here - this isn't something you see almost ever, and it's kind of interesting. You can imagine this story being told around a campfire and sort of have that feeling of visualizing it in your head were you being told it in person, but it has a few hiccups in pretty specific areas where it's just silence for a while until you manage the next thing that triggers the narration. It would be weird if the narrator just never shut up or rambled on, though, so I don't expect him to talk constantly, just... finish the thought in one go. Paying that dude to narrate as much as he did though must have been half the game's budget.  So, gameplay, which is naturally my biggest problem with the game. Your character's kind of slow, and suffers from the same thing Link suffers from - rolling becomes the best option to get anywhere or get anything done. The game would benefit so much from the ability to run and the ability to perform a dash attack, but whatever. Maybe there's a dash attack and I haven't played far enough in to get it, but mechanics that add to the general enjoyment of the game shouldn't be locked behind hours of gameplay. Also I get that there's tons of ranged options, but I just can't abide the enemies floating off the stage somewhere, this is really painful in the timed stages.  Overall I don't think it's the pinnacle of action RPGs, or hack-n-slashes, or really the pinnacle of any game type, unless 'campfire story' is a genre, in which case it is a pioneer. It came out of the blue from a development studio that came out of the blue, and when you look at it from that perspective, it's pretty good for that, but that narration budget could have gone a lot farther had it been used in the gameplay department.   Anyway, because 'indifference' still isn't an option, I'm going to say no, I don't recommend it. If you want to play a game just to look at pretty scenery, there's better options out there, and the same goes for listening to a good soundtrack or an audiobook - youtube's free. The gameplay has the groundwork of being solid, and isn't buggy nor does it feel rushed, but it desperately needed to be expanded upon.
6762	0	a	You cannot use a controller with this game on the Mac. It should not have been shipped as ready for the platform, and years on they still have not fixed it. Black spot on a great game, sure, but not supporting the best kind of input device for the game is a dealbreaker.
6763	0	a	Only if you want to lose your money and time.
6764	0	a	Art direction? Gorgeous. Soundtrack? Haunting. Narrator? Fascinating. Gameplay? Repetitive and boring.  All the pieces are there for a great game, except the mind-numbingly repetitive and unrewarding gameplay. I don't mind repetitive gameplay if I feel like I'm being properly rewarded for it, but that's not the case for this one.
6765	0	a	Really wanted to love this game, but it just didn't keep my attention enough for me to finish it. The art design is good but nothing mindblowing or original; kind of a weird vaguely steampunk/fantasy mish-mash that didn't really work for me.   The biggest problems are the repetitive gameplay and the narrator gimmick that gets old almost immediately. I admire that something different was attempted, but it simply wasn't a replacement for storytelling and dialogue. I often found myself confused about what was happening due to being distracted by trying to fight enemies and simply play the game while the angsty narrator grumbled story details.  The mechanics are faily poor as well. The normal movement of the Kid is painfully slow, and I found myself constantly tapping roll just to get around at a normal pace, which was really tiresome. This on top of the odd feel to the combat was just too problematic.   Overall, not a terrible game, but the praise is highly disproportionate to the actual quality. I've heard good things about Transistor though, so will definitely give that a chance because I like what this company os going for, Bastion just didn't hold up enough for me to finish it, so I can't strongly suggest it, though ot would strongly discourage one from playing it either.
6766	0	a	Overrated game. It is ok for its price on discount, but otherwise it is a subpar ARPG. The narration is good, the story is short, and poor. Fights are okish, but unless shrines are activated it is extremely easy. I finished the game in less than half a day. Sound and music are decent.  In my opinion there are better ARPGs out there at the price point this game is marketed at and this game does not deserve its overwhelmingly positive review status.
6767	0	a	Game has no story and honestly is only worth buying on sale to waste time. The preview is pretty much what the game is like. The guy is talking throughout the game, and that's your story.
6768	0	a	After a while it gets enormously boring. This game is only a repetition of basic game mechanics.
6769	0	a	Bastion is a fun casual hack and slash, but I found it to be rather forgettable overall. I don't understand the hype behind it. Not much happens in the story for ~10 hours of gameplay. The story is very slow, which I think is what killed it for me.  Still not a bad game. But I would not recommend.
6770	0	a	Great art style. Then you have clunky controls, useless powers and an annoying narrator.
6771	0	a	No matter how good the presentation of this game is the gameplay don't match it. It is just plain boring to wander around in the world of Bastion since the fighting only feels tedious, mostly because the rewards you get doesn't add anything interesting to the mix. New weapons are introduced at a good pace but doesn't do enough to make the fighting interesting enough. The whole part with your home base (a.k.a. The Bastion) is a missed opportunity, everything you can do there is just boring instead of an exciting part of the game. The upgrades to both weapons and your character are barely noticable which probably is my biggest complaint about the game.  Again, the graphics and music deliver, but the rest doesn't. If you want something with way better combat I recommend the Ys-games instead (don't play them for the story though). Story wise I would say Bastion stays at the 'meh'-level. It isn't bad, but it isn't interesting either. Thumbs up for the narrator though.
6772	0	a	As much as I want to love Bastion - beautiful, atmospheric music and environment, strong character and story design - I just can't bring myself to finish the game. Bastion solely uses an auto-save feature, which is a deal-breaker for me. I hate re-doing content just because I had my gameplay interrupted for whatever reason. That doesn't feel fun, it feels punitive. I much prefer to replay content because I want to!
6773	0	a	I do not recommend Bastion, if you want to experience a worthful story. Basically you have to find Cores and (after that) Fragments to build the Bastion up, for that, the game throws you into different independend (by times short, but beautiful designed) locations where you have to fight through enemies, grab the main item and leave again.  This kind of presentation gets repetetive quickly.  Bastion has its strength in its fightning System, which is really extensive but suffers from the problem that the player can easily skip the combat just by rolling through the levels. Its far quicker and more valuable for the player in most cases. Yeah you don't have to do this, but this option alone makes it to a problem of the game design.
6774	0	a	Great soundtrack! Nothing special in gameplay.  Just a funny time killer which you can play on a laptop when your primary gaming PC is occupied by your girlfriend. Otherwise it's too booooring.
6775	0	a	I bought this game two years ago because it was on sale and I played it for a very short time due to the fact that it was repetitive. Wanting to give it a second change, I installed it just recently but I couldn't go on with the gameplay for the same reason as last time. The soundtrack and the narration are superb, but these aren't enough to keep me entertained. I can see the fact that this game isn't about the gameplay and it's more about the feeling it gives you while playing it. If you want an incredible experience in terms of soundtrack and story (the narration goes a long way in making the story good) go buy this game and I think you'll fing it enjoyable. But if you consider that gameplay is more important and there is absolutely no way you can enjoy a game that's repetitive, I don't think this is the game for you because ultimately you'll find it, simply put, boring.
6776	0	a	This game was so highly recommended and when I bought it I wasn't impressed at all. It may have also been beacause of the old, quite slow laptop I had at the time. Now, with a new laptop and a better graphics card I gave Bastion another chance and although it grew on me at first, I still must conclude that this game is heavily overrated...
6777	0	a	it's a beautiful game, visually and musically. it is an uncommon position i hold in finding the narrator to be pretentious and incredibly annoying. the actual gameplay, though, was just mindnumbing repetition of a combat style which i didn't find to be all that fun or engaging to begin with.  i have tried (hard) to like this game, and failed. it's not a bad game, by any means, and LOADS of people like it. the odds are TREMENDOUSLY in favor of you liking it based upon the reviews here. there is a FREE DEMO that you can check out to find out for yourself! just i, personally, can always find a game that i would have (more?) fun playing instead,
6778	0	a	I really want to like this game.  The world in Bastion is very well fleshed out. The graphics and characters are also quite charming.  But getting all these different weapons and stuff is giving me a headache. Especailly since in feels like I need to go and upgrade them by either findng the necessary item or completeing skill challeneges.  A lot of the weapons also feel redundant, so that doesn't help either.
6779	0	a	I'm not entirely convinced by this game. There seems to be a certain amount of dissonance between the storytelling ideas and the actual gameplay leaving me with the feeling that the story is suggests something far grander than is actually happening in the gameplay.
6780	0	a	i can appreciate the artwork, the soundtrack, and the idea, but i'd rather shove needles through the tip of my ♥♥♥♥ than play any more of this game. maybe i'll pick it back up when im REALLLLY bored, but for now im gonna avoid it... cuz its boring.
6781	0	a	Button masher; take it or leave it. Great vocals in both the music and narrated story. Doesn't offer much after you beat it the first time.
6782	0	a	3/10, and that's being generous. This review will sound harsh, but that's because getting the controls down was the sole hurdle to be overcome when porting this mobile game to PC/MAc. Simply put, the terrible controls ruin the game.  This game is a sloppy port of an IPAD/IPHONE game, and isn't even worth the sale price of $2.00 as it stands 5/28/14, let alone the $15 price tag when not on sale!!! SHEESH!!! The fact that the people who released this MOBILE game on Mac/PC changed nothing in the game mechanics is bad enough, but the clunky directional controls destroy any chance of this game being playable. It is blatantly obvious the game mechanics are still optomized for touchscreens. Meaning aiming/shooting/dodging is next to impossible. Atleast doing any 2 of those at 1 time is. Particularly moving while aiming/shooting. Not to mention there are so many buttons required, which are all so far from where your hands need to be. Even spending 20 minutes trying to remap/customize the controls did nothing to help, because deep down, the movement is riddled with problems.  On a rosier note, I will be attempting to use my PS3 controller as a gamepad, and see if maybe the game is playable using that. I own Bastion on my ipad, and it's a decent game....when it works.   Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this cluster- ♥♥♥♥. I am hoping this is fixed, but seeing as I just purchased the game for ~90% off, at $2.00; I'm guessing this is going to be a permanent, and dealbreaking, problem with the game. Shameful, I will be requesting a refund of my $2.00!!!
6783	0	a	Nice graphics, stiff animations, boring gameplay.
6784	0	a	Artistically masterful, but I just don't find it very enjoyable to play.
6785	0	a	I've heard a lot about this game. I tried really hard to like it. The combat seems wonky and the pacing seems slow.
6786	0	a	Beautiful graphic, nice music, nice narration, but terrible control... I tried with keyboard and mouse, but it's just meh. There is a demo of it, try it before you buy.
6787	0	a	This game is so bad. Can't believe I paid for it. Perspective is garbage, can't aim, can't move without pressing 2 buttons at once. Just terrible. Someone said it's their favorite game? You need to play more games.
6788	0	a	I started playing this game expecting more from both the graphics and the soundtrack everybody is talking about. I was not pleased. Quite soon I found the gameplay boring and the narrator very annoying, and the music was not really anything worth listening to.  The game itself can be confusing, you never really know what it is about, and after an hour or so you just don't care; which is why I cannot recommend it.  + Very low price.  - The gameplay. - The soundtrack. - The narrator.
6789	0	a	I tried to like it. It felt like a Gaunlet-style RPG, but felt even more cliche. The visuals are nice, the gameplay is boring. Bring on the downvotes.
6790	0	a	Although this game looks and sounds nice, my complaint is it get pretty repetitive after the first couple levels. The story is okay but the narration for that story is usually more of an annoyance than anything else.  Thankfully, the game wasn't all that long and I am glad to have completed it but it isn't something I can recommend others to play. I think I'd only change my tune if there was online co-op which I think would suit this game quite well...but that'll never happen so this review won't change!
6791	0	a	The gameplay quickly becomes tedious and the plot holes are obvious.
6792	0	a	Bastion is a very pretty game with decent story and gameplay. I liked the game at first, but the combat gets repetitive, and I just stopped playing this becuase there are better RPG games out there.
6793	0	a	The awkwardness of controls kills this game for me, on PC with mouse/keyboard that is.   Isometric + WASD == Nope.
6794	0	a	Easily one of the most boring games i have ever played.
6795	0	a	Its a pretty standard fare adventure game in the 3/4ths dimension and the classic 'throw you into the ♥♥♥♥♥torm and the blanks get filled in later' story. My biggest complaint with the game sadly ends up being one of its features. I couldn't relax and enjoy the game because the narrorator never shut the hell up.
6796	0	a	First I will say that I really love this game. Second I will say I really hate this game. Great graphics, great narration. I enjoyed playing it very much. However I don't enjoy replaying the same section over and over because the game doesn't save my progress... Over 4 years they still haven't solved this problem??? That's ridiculous if you ask me. I was googling and this problem dates back to 2010-2011 with no solution that I have found. I would only recommend this game right now if you like being extremely frustrated and or you like redoing things over and over again. All in all probably 80% of my time spent on this game has been redoing what I had already done. Very depressing as I really like this game...
6797	0	a	Bastion is about a boy in a fairy world affected by a cataclysm. Bastion is a linear story driven rpg. There are upgraders, levels and xp. But it is not a hack n slash rpg. Bastion has a great narrator and excellent music in common with Transistor, also made by Supergiant Games. I like this and I will probably also finish it in New Game Plus mode.  Update: I did not palay it through in New Game Plus mode...
6798	0	a	Its cool and all but somehow I tend to lose interest about halfway through the game. You may want to pick this up during a sale though
6799	0	a	Haiku Review:  Such lovely story and art But such boring gameplay Cannot help feel dissapoint
6800	0	a	gameplay is boring the art is unappealing and the narration is annoying from what i hear the story is supposedly good but if i wanted a good story i would have just read a book
6801	0	a	cheesy for little diapers babies
6802	0	a	5.5 / 10 Left Zulf to die like the ♥♥♥♥♥ he was
6803	0	a	I don't understand the positive reviews for this game. The combat, the narration, and the music have been praised, but I thought they became repetitive and stale very quickly.
6804	0	a	Great soundtrack and visual art, but the rest is an exercise in mediocrity. Very overrated.
6805	0	a	Nice art-style  Nice narration  Bland gameplay &amp; combat   Notmycupoftea/10 
6806	0	a	The game is an absolute masterpiece, but it has one dealbreaking flaw that is utterly illogical and unnacceptable at this point: it basically tells left-handed people to go f*** themselves.... terrible design, in my opinion. I know the game was made in 2011, but at that particular point in history it was a well-known fact, like, for about a couple of millenia, that left-handed people exist, that they comprise a rather large chunk of the over all population, and they like to play video games... but hey, in Bastion's dev's minds, if you're a lefty, you can go suck it, right?
6807	0	a	GREAT GAME BUT...  Great story telling and awesome soundtrack coupled with artistic design. The premise of the game is simple enough to enjoy really at any age but the game play is a bit infuriating not to mention .05% buggy. While playing I felt almost claustrophobic where I was in the game which, I get is part of the game design but when you're running in the 8 main directions and none of which is straight, it gets old after a while. There are instances the character turns around with question positioning you with your back to enemies, which sounds like an easy fix but when you have no where to step and cannot spin in one spot it again, gets old. Weapons are fun to play with and there are plenty to choose from but I really could not get an effective amount of time to enjoy them because almost every new level would introduce a new weapon on a level pretty much meant for it and would ruin the set up I had set out with and getting rid of my secret skill. The only places to enjoy the set ups were in the same old fighting pits in who knows where. The mementos were good but could add more to the story. Love the pets. Might think about adding them to a journey out in the wild would be nice enhancement. Finally after a while the vigils started giving out some good coin, but when you have some of those weapon specific missions that can be achieved in the proving grounds shooting 'foes' a.k.a. tumbleweeds, it seems like the game design was slightly underdeveloped. TO SUM UP. I rarely write reviews, usually glistening ones or scathing ones, this one I feel is right in the middle because it's fun enough to play through but there were plenty that bothered me about it. Maybe that was the point?
6808	0	a	This is hard to write but it's my personal opinion, so take it as is.  Simply put, you'll either love this game to bits or you'll finish it and feel 'meh'...that's what happened to me. Don't get me wrong, the game has something really good to it: the visuals are stunning, there's plenty of weapons to choose from and the soundtrack and narrator are outstanding(even got the Announcer Pack in Dota 2)...but what's left if you take that away?  A boring, repetitive and not so deep action rpg where you do the same stuff for about 6 hours and spam buttons.  I had this game for a while and REALLY tried to like it, trust me, but I just couldn't. Being a gamer for quite a while now(way too many years to be honest) I don't see some fancy visuals and feel sold on the whole experience...I want more, and in that sense Bastion could not deliver.  Again, I loved WATCHING the game but not playing it...it was just too simple, plain and didn't leave me a lot.  P.s. keep in mind I'm not reccomending the game to people like me, to all the rest just grab it when it's on sale and you probably won't be disappointed!
6809	0	a	So so. Nothing special about this one. It got boring at some part.
6810	0	a	Beautiful art, scenery, music and narration. Eventhough I use to love those things and usually its enough to pull me in to the game, in the case however, almost every bit of gameplay turns me off as the more you play the more you realize that the gameplay itself is not what sells this game. I've seen several games which met art. Bastion is a great piece of art yet just an ordinary piece of an average game.
6811	0	a	I can see why some people like this game, and I know exactly who they are. I'm tempted to buy them all a copy so they'll stay home playing it and  keep off of my lawn!   More gravitas and less gravol for me.   3 of 5 stars. Maybe 4. But then I'd have to recommend it. Just leave me alone and  keep off of my lawn! 
6812	0	a	The gameplay in bastion consists of a beautiful atmosphere and some excellent narration where your actions are beautifully narrated.I play games for the gameplay and this was the most boring and bland gameplay I have ever seen. It got so repetitive so fast.Just basically killing the same enemies over and over again with little variance.Not recommended.
6813	0	a	The game looks good, sounds good, has a nice atmosphere... and it's cheap.  But I found the gameplay too be too simplistic and boring. Not my cup of tea.
6814	0	a	Bastion is a nice game when playing the first time, however, when you pass the game, you cannot find a reason to play it anymore, even though the game will allow you to elevate the creep's difficulty, i have to say, it's really don't work.  The weapon in the game is just too munch, but not all the weapon is well designed, when you pick a weapon gained in the late game, you will never use the early ones. As a result, the diverse weapon gameplay, which is the designer's original purpose i guess, is lose to the abosulute weapon damage.   There are also weapon upgrade missions for each weapon, some are good, but some are just really torture to a normal human.   The level is elevated very low, and when I passed the game, i was only level 5. I can find many many stuffs used in a high level, but let's go back to the point, i really cannot find myself a cause to play a higher level. Really boring! A bad design, I am afraid.
6815	0	a	I don't understand how this simple as hell, shallow and boring game, is as popular as it is.  I guess if you are about 8 years old, it is a good game to get.
6816	0	a	I realize I'm part of the minority here. I just didn't get what everyone else seemed to out of this game. Gameplay wasn't fun for me. The narrator wasn't great. Story wasn't there for me either.
6817	0	a	I feel bad leaving a negative review especially since the game is so beautiful (and the whole world wants me to love it). But the reason I am doing so is because the story is so vague - It doesn't make sense. The narrator has a great voice but thats all you can hear and after a point it gets annoying (I hate him calling the player kid all the time)  FInally, the most important thing in a hack and slash is the combat, and the combat was dull, it was just button mashing for me.  
6818	0	a	Might be alright if you have a controller, but otherwise it is too much like hard work for me to enjoy!
6819	0	a	Just finished playing through it for the first time and for me this game wasn't something I would recommend. Only thing I liked about it was the music and some of the combat. Story wasn't something that interested me or got a grip of me. Combat was so and so. Didn't feel difficult except a very few moments it was a bit hectic. Even if you used idols it didn't get to bad. The proving grounds were either way easy or some a pain until weapon upgraded. Graphically it was ok. It was just a game that I played through but didn't have any feelings afterwards like, 'that was a great game!' or the like.  I do not recommend this game as I didn't enjoy it.
6820	0	a	Very Beautiful. Nice little story. But the narator annoyed afer a while me. Also the gameplay is not that great. Kinda boring. The games delivers a great experience but fails to motivate me for the long term. What do to? Recommend or not? It is a great piece of art but I bought it to play and not a poster for my wall. I am sorry to not recommend this game :(
6821	0	a	I tried to get into this game twice now, but I can never stick with it. The game never really grabs me at the beginning. Im not sure if it is the isometric camera view or the on-rails 'adventuring' experience. On the other hand, the narrator is pretty awesome though.
6822	0	a	Its alright for a bit but then it just gets boring and glitches in the game are annoying like when you do the weapon challenges and you get stuck on a platform so you have to die over and over again just to restart. Not fun
6823	0	a	Steam Overlay doesn't work with Bastion on OSX, so the Steam controller is not working as well.
6824	0	a	Bastion is a good game: it's polished, has an original setting, atmosphere, and even original perspective from a third person narrator whom is in the game, but... It's just too repetitive for me. Yes, there's challenges for each weapon, optional trophies to make it more difficult (kind of like Halo 3 skulls), but the gameplay is too mediocre: it didn't really grasp my attention, it was just there. The story is also alright, the lore is semi-interesting, and some characters are cool but the way the story progresses feels too much of, 'Go here, beat the monsters, finish the level, go back to town, repeat.' I mean, most RPG games have that scheme but to me good games don't make you realize it. I feel bad not recommending it but I don't think it was worth the $15 I paid for.  7.0/10. I acknowledge it is a polished game with an original setting but the combat and story progression is too repetitive and boring to want to continue playing.
6825	0	a	I actually did enjoy this game for the most part, but I had to downvote it for the ridiculous calamity cannon challenge. It simply does not match the difficulty of the rest of the game and it really ruined the latter part of the game for me. In fact, I didn't really care for any of the challenges.
6826	0	a	This game doesn't work. I'm running it on Mac. I've done everything and then some. All kinds of suggestions the forms said. When I launch the game, no icon shows up, and the game hangs. When i try to quit steam, it tells me to quite Bastion (which steam says is running but isn't (I checked the system processes)). When the developer fixes this issue so that I can play their game one a 2015 retina macbook pro operated by a computer scientist, I'll consider changing my review.
6827	0	a	It’s always hard for me to give thumbs down to a game I had so much expectations for and really wanted to like, I think reviews should be honest, open and must examine most of the aspects, quality and details of a game, it is normal to see funny and one liner reviews on steam that do not even bother to analyze a game in depth, which is downright sad.  But again, I had such expectations for this title… it happened it is just really not my cup of tea.   Story
6828	0	a	0/10 crashes after new windows 10 updates
6829	0	a	Was alright at first, but got really repetitive later on and I lost interest. Didn't finish.
6830	0	a	Okay. This is a fun game, but I was able to complete it in 4 hours. And that wasnt me just hammering through the story mode, I did majority of the mini-games. So for that reason I cannot recommend at full price. But if it is on sale. Get it. Because it is a fun game, but not worth £10.99

Ok this is not so much a review as it is a “NOTE/WARNING to any one looking to pick up this game who uses a Playstation 4 controller (fairly native hardware to Steam on Mac) and a PLEA FOR HELP to the developers who are awesome so I hope you read this guys. So love this game first off and Steam is the 3rd platform I’ve purchased this game on, love it, with that said it maybe the only platform other people buy this game on and for a lot of Mac users we use the PS4 controller because of its native syncing to Mac and Steam, so could you guys PLEASE UPDATE THE GAME TO BE PS4 CONTROLLER COMPATIBLE! Not meaning to yell that, just want you guys to see it load and clear, because THE GAME IS AWESOME but completely broken when using another controller other than a Xbox controller, PS4 controller only has ‘up, down, triangle and square’ that works and no was to map the controller in game! please help guys, again love the game its a gem but could you map the PS4 controller like you did with Transistor (another truely amazing game) PLEASE! looking forward to your next project.

6833	0	a	This game became really repetitive very very quickly.
6834	0	a	Really great game - unfortunately some updates broke the game on Linux, and other updates fixed it.  This resulted in me losing all my save data.  Great game, bad QA department. Ruined the experience for me.
6835	0	a	i really enjoy this game. I really had a lot of fun and look forward to spaz2.  the world is fun to be in, the unlocking and economy really works in the setting.  the reason i can't recommend this is because the grind is so harsh in the beggining and just gets worse and worse from there. just got to the final chapter and that's it, i'm done. if you're a completionist this game will frustrate you.  There is about 15-20 hours of content that has taken me almost 50. That's how bad the grind is.
6836	0	a	The game started out sounding very nice. It sounded, and looked, from the trailers, to be very enjoyable. Then I bought it and played for a little while. The concepts are all there, they're all done as well as can be expected, and, if it were paced a little better, the game would be pretty good. The problem is right there, though - pacing. Half of the time I was playing, I was just mining rocks to try and get more money to upgrade my ships. When I finally managed to get into combat, my enemies would take a small amount of damage and just run from me. Over half of my combat time was chasing down enemies in the vast nothingness that exists everywhere in search of that one last ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ needed to complete the mission.
6837	0	a	Though initially i was drawn into SPAZ, after a few hours i realized that the bulk of the game boils down to grinding the handful of recycled randomly generated missions you will come across in every sector. Its not really avoidable, to avoid being steamrolled by each group of enemy ships you will have to grind data to ensure your tech level is consistently 5+ levels higher than them not to mention you'll need to grind for blackbox data to build better ships. Assuming youve stuck it out that long you'll find yourself with extremely limited hangar space, which means that in the vast majority of battles you are greatly outnumbered by superior ships.   I tried addressing the game's shortcoming with mods but the modding component of the game appears to be broken as none of them function and i cant be arsed to fix something that should be working when the game is just not compelling enough to warrant it.
6838	0	a	As a game inspired by Star Control, it desperately, desperately needs controller support. Instead it uses awkward mouse-aim + WASD in a top-down game, and ten hours in I haven't seen any ship or weapon that really takes advantage of that.   Speaking of ships and weapons, there isn't a wild diversity in either - you pick a size of ship, decide whether you want the slightly faster one or the one with slightly more weapons, and kit it out with variations on lasers, projectiles, and homing projectiles. Bombs are basically big missiles with long cooldowns, and fighters are just missiles that fire more often. Combine this with a tech system that results in weapons/systems you don't use much being typically weaker, and the game at hour ten feels very much like the game at hour one. Point your ship at the other ship and hold down both mouse buttons.  The great big open starmap looks good until you realize the only real variant from system to system is the level of enemy ships and the presence or absence of bounty hunters, which seem to exist primarily as arena locations and also as another way to slow down the player by putting bounties on their heads. The missions in a level 1 sector are the same as the ones in a level 35 sector.  The in-game chatter is terribly repetitive after only a few hours, though it can be turned off.  So yeah, kind of a dull game.
6839	0	a	The style and idea behind this game are appealing, but the game is made unpleasant by several glaring design flaws.  You only ever seem to have around 3 ships to control at once. That doesn't really give you much in the way of tactical options. You're frequently put into situations where you go up against way more ships than that, so it feels strange to have only one large ship and two small ships and be expected to feel like you're being strategic/tactical.  The issue with the tactical options is compounded by the need to grind a lot to have weapons strong enough to take on foes of a given tech level. The damage system is interesting, you have shields, then armor, then hull. Beams are strong against shields, cannons are strong against armor, and launchers are strong against hull. However, according to the DEVS THEMSELVES, a good strategy is to only focus on upgrading one of beams/cannons. What was the point of the damage model if you're just going to suggest people not worry about trying to match up the correct weapon based on the situation of the enemy ships? Because I didn't know about this, I was getting to the point where most of my time was spent grinding to at least 1.5x the tech level of the enemies I would go against. It seems like the designer didn't really think about how the damage and tech level system really affected the fun of the gameplay.  There's a lot of time spent just doing repetitive mission types over and over again to get data so you can level up your tech. It gets old after awhile, even though there's a decent variety of mission types, once you play a certain type once, it isn't really fun to play it again. The only thing to keep you going is a desire to progress through the story or feel like you're 'being productive', but really you're just doing the same stuff over and over again. It doesn't make for very fun gameplay.  The whole idea of the Bounty Hunters is also an issue. Bounty Hunters in space is really thematically appropriate, but the way it's implemented in this world just adds unpleasant busy work. Every time you do missions you accrue 'bounty'. Whenever you jump, if your bounty is high enough and your near a bounty hunter lair, you'll be attacked by powerful ships and probably will have to reload a save. The only way to get rid of bounty is to go to a lair and pay them, or complete 'arena challenges' which net you some Rez and relieve some bounty. The arena challenges are very fun, but I frequently found myself in a situation where I had maxed out my Rez so I just had to pay a bunch of money and never really felt a reason to play the challenges. It's just a resource sink without much fun behind. If it was possible to beat bounty hunters when they attacked you I would consider this fixed. There's plenty of other ways it could be improved, of course.  Other than that, there's just lots of little annoyances throughout the game that indicate a lack of polish. One petty example is that, on escort missions, the ship you are escorting might have cloaking, but will be invisible to you, which makes it difficult to tell where you need to be. Escort missions have other problems, like the behavior of the escorted ship (it will sometimes go in the opposite direction, won't follow you, etc...). This is just one example of a minor design issue. There's others; like the heavy reliance on saving and loading (breaking immersion and breaking up the flow of the gameplay).  Overall, it's insulting to Mound and Blade to call this game 'Mount and Blade in Space'. Mount and Blade lacks a lot of the issues that make SPAZ unpleasant (after a few hours of playing). Unlike games like Mount and Blade, I just never feel like I'm becoming more powerful. I don't feel like I'm interacting with the galaxy because all the solar systems are very closed off from each other.   If you're looking for a game that actually gives you a sense of strategy, tactics, and power, you should look into Starsector (formerly Starfarer), which is currently playable though in-development. I think it does a better job of providing the sort of experience this game was trying to provide.
6840	0	a	This game could have been good.The premise was excellent, but the execution was lacking. A procedurally generated galaxy which you explore with your fully customizable pirate fleet? Sign me up! Unfortunately, the game had some fundamental problems. The basic gameplay grew dull and repetitive far too quickly. More advanced mechanics were too slow in unlocking. The storyline had no meat and no hook.  However, if this type of game is your bag, this game is totally worth $2 on steam sale to see whether or not you like it.
6841	0	a	An obvious labor of love, and a love letter to Star Control 2... and a leading candidate for exemplifying the necessity of polish in games. It is so mind-bogglingly dull thanks to really poor pacing and a nasty set of balance issues that I really can't recommend it at all. Supposedly it's still being worked on, and I can see modders fixing almost all the problems with the game, but right now it's just garbage. There are ideas and systems in place that could almost certainly be fun, and they simply aren't, thanks to some bad math, for the most part.  As an addendum, I feel the need to point out that combat is mindless and broken. Examples: AI is brainless and employs its weapons for minimal effect, often failing to use their full complement of weaponry. Enemy AI uses a simple tactic of running away when their health is low, which can lead to endless chases if you happen to pick a slow set of ships. Your own AI is almost impossible to control precisely and loves to wander into range of enemy weapons, and shoot your allies. In a late-game mission, you are tasked with defending four generators simultaneously: attempting to do so will get them all blown up. But, if you concentrate all your ships at one generator, the enemy completely ignores the other three. The list goes on. DON'T BUY THIS GAME IN THIS STATE.
6842	0	a	This game tries hard to entertain, but does fall short. Having played games such as Flash Trek Broken Mirror before, this game did not amuse me as much as I hoped it would. Many of the tasks actaull got kind of repeitive in m opinion and it was somewhat confusing to start. However, I may just be overpicky since I am comparing it to the great Flash Trek Broken Mirror.  Rating: 5.1/10
6843	0	a	It's a no for recommend, even though I've enjoyed the game. The end game is wretched. When I say wretched, I mean it is nothing short of a chore. 'Hunting' down the infected aliens is less of a hunt, and more of a mindless chase. They run the opposite direction at speeds near yours, only they'll be at distances like 30,000+ . . .   The goal is to 'clean up' a system, or you're labeled as a ♥♥♥♥♥ for not completing the mission. The problem is the real ♥♥♥♥♥ is the coders that can't think of a decent combat. The combat will be over, long over, like ages . . . and ages . . . and ages over, yet another stupid tiny infected alien will spawn on the other side of the system. At this point, the only thing you can do is turn around, and have a mindless wait as you drag your ship slowly across the 'system' (a needlessly large grid) to get to the point where you easily pop the tiny ship.  There are great battles, don't get me wrong, it's the hell that is mis-labled at the game that gets my 'No' for recommend.  On top of the lame 'zit popping' adventure, there is a new element added to the targeting system, where the turrets refuse to aim toward anything you are choosing to shoot at. Something went horribly wrong with an update, and I seriously doubt it will ever be fixed.
6844	0	a	There's lots to enjoy about this game apart from the gameplay. Every system appears to be the same. Blast through endless (literally, infinitely spawning missions) of dull ships by shooting at them with your [weapon choice], fly through the debris and hoover up exp and money and crew members.  I honestly don't see why I even have to be at the computer. The AI could be taking care of this with a 'go to enemy and fire fire fire' routine... and in fact that's exactly what my AI teammates do.  That I would rather have this game running without playing it shows that it's not enjoyable to play, just to level up and find out the next % increase on my laser beam length.
6845	0	a	Would love to love it, but the game doesn't love me back.  It's fun and easy until you reach act 3. Then it is just punishing and takes all fun away. Cannons maxed, shields maxed, lots of point im secondary system, almost no points in unused systems... get wrecked by AI ships. Well, sometimes it's still pretty ok, but then you have two enemy ships with equal tech as yourself, but you don't need to know a lot about the game that this won't work. Searching for answers about how to deal with this brings up countless players having the same issue. Trying other stragtegies is no fun because of the random nature of the game and the fact that losses will end up in grinding money to get on track again. Add to this that every respec costs tons of data/XP and stops your progress for hours.  Very disappointed.
6846	0	a	Thought this was great!....then tedium set in...
6847	0	a	It's good at first, then you hit a wall and have to spend two hours to either grind the same event over and over, or restart and make a new world to buy a randomly generated upgrade that may or may nor be better.
6848	0	a	Fun to start with, then you realize this game is all about the grind. Horrible, boring, dull, mindless grind.  Oh yeah, and AI's favourite tactic is retreating, all the time. AI ship faster than yours? Combat never ends. What fun.
6849	0	a	I did not find the combat enjoyable one tiny bit. The ship handling is sloppy. The ships have tons of momentum and terrible acceleration so changing directions is a pain and takes way too long. You spend most of your time flying past your enemies and missing your shots, then trying to turn around for another pass, only to miss again, and then turn around again, and so on and so forth. Actually killing anything took way too long and was simply more trouble and aggravation than it was worth. I was mislead by an idiotic comment by a curator, describing the game as 'arcadey', it's anything but. Do not expect to get your space combat thrills here.
6850	0	a	I normally never both to review games on Steam, but in this case I'll make an exception. Maybe this game is a type of genre people enjoy that just isn't for me and that's fine, but the reason I can't recommend it is about 50% of the game could be flat out cut.   I've had this game in my Library for a long time and wanted to finish it as I'm a bit of a completionist. However, upon returning to it recently I cannot bring myself to play it anymore.   There seems so much to this game and based on what I saw before buying it I was excited to customize my ships and all that jazz but 6.8 hours into the game what have I actually accomplished? Very little.   Sure, I could be accused of not being patient or wanting maximum rewards for minimum effort, but in most other games during that time I'd have done more than float about a few quadrents listening to the same dam messages repeat over and over and over. Warp to a place, kill some guys, rinse and repeat.   There might be more to this game later but so far I've had so little fun I can't bare to get further. I guess if you really want to find a way to sink hundereds of hours into floating about doing repetitive tasks in the most unfun way possible this is the game for you.
6851	0	a	Unless you really, and I mean REALLY love arcade shooty games: Don't buy it.  There is no tactics, just firing random ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t at the AI.  Upgrades are Ok, but after 'Random ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t Topedonukerocket number 5' killed me over and over again I was just tired of grinding.  I'm six hours in and I'm not gonna touch that game again.
6852	0	a	Do you like spending a looooong time fighting your way through 999999 systems that all feel pretty much the same?  Do you enjoy mindless circle strafing and trivial aiming?  Do you like a ship customization system that basically amounts to little more than 'give your ship the overpowered machine gun laser'?  If so, you'll like this game. Otherwise, not so much. Say NO to strafing in physics-based space shooters!
6853	0	a	If you want to grind rice to make porridge, this game has enough grinding to do just that
6854	0	a	I do not recommend this game because it is so much work and so little fun. Grindy and unrewarding. Invest the hours in something more fun. Sheesh I though it would never end, really really had to force myself through it.
6855	0	a	Your ♥♥♥♥ will get blown up by swarms of space zombies no matter what you try or how much tech you have and the dumb as hell AI won't be of any help to you.
6856	0	a	This game's got nothing on Space Rangers HD. Go play that instead!
6857	0	a	I tried, I really tried, I just don’t like it. I need to keep trying, someday.
6858	0	a	Repetitive as f***
6859	0	a	I really tried to get into this game for several days. It is  really  grindy, and the amount of strategy involved seemed really small for how popular this game is. I must be missing something. Regardless, I paid the money and took the ride - this is my overall impression:  I'd pass on this title. 
6860	0	a	This game is decent. It's got a really good concept and the story is well fleshed out. But after a while the difficulty curve becomes steep and pushes you into grinding too much. There are a few things that could be done to balance this out but the game needs more things in it. It feels like it needs more polish.   Worth a few hours if you liked FTL or similar games. Otherwise I would skip it.
6861	0	a	This game could be so good, but you're so underpowered and even the lowest enemies take a solid 10 minutes of laser fire to kill. You have to constantly get these 'resources' called 'rez' for some reason to build ships, but each of your ships can only hold about 2 units of 'rez' before it has to take it back to base. But you can't make it back to base, because your ships are basically made out of paper and you have ♥♥♥♥ing flashlights for laser beams and you keep getting torn apart by every enemy in sight. So you have to keep using resources to build more ships, which keep getting blown up...  It just feels like everyone's having a party and I don't belong there. ♥♥♥♥ this game.
6862	0	a	I quite liked this game- the playstyle, the graphics, even the atrocious, cheesy writing. As a quick aside, they apparently even got that TotalBiscuit fellow to do a great deal of exposition, and while he’s not the greatest narrator of all time, it does lend a certain gravitas gravy to the cheese. Kudos all around.  However, once the zombies get introduced, I quickly lost interest. I was actually rather looking forward to playing as a space zombie, which doesn’t appear to be a thing, but more than that there seems to be a distinct lack of good ways to deal with them. I’m sure there’s something I’m missing, but I take umbrage at having to do research on a game to defeat zombies- I, like general use of zombies these days, am a little tired…
6863	0	a	Game goes fine until a mid-game 'change' (trying to avoid spoiler). After this, the game becomes nigh unplayable IMO. The simplest of missions will involve you taking down 30+ ships.....with your 4. They do come in waves somewhat, but thats little consolation. Your reward for this slaughter, should you succeed? Not enough enough resources to rebuild a single huge ship (the largest hanger size you can field).   The only other game i can think of that i've played where i hit a 'wall' akin to this was Diablo 3 in torment. Maybe some hardcore people enjoy beating their head painfully against walls like this, but unless you consider yourself one of them. Dont waste the initial 20-30 hours getting to that point. Save yourself the effort and just go bash your head on the nearest doorframe.
6864	0	a	dont get it cant play becuse it says i need to update divrs but it says the are updated fix this or give my money back thives
6865	0	a	You put all those upgrades and ♥♥♥♥ and you're still powerless, no meening in this piece of wasted time.
6866	0	a	A game inspired by Asteroids, but somehow fails at being anywhere near as good. Then it opens up some RTS element which it also fails to be good at. More of an 'experience' than a game. Unfortunately it's a bad experience!  Join Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needs  http://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews 
6867	0	a	Call me a casual but . . . it seems like this game needs a little more instruction in the beginning. I would quickly get to a point where I would fulfill the tutorial objectives, but then after that have no idea what to do. I tried experimenting with no success, and the game didn't have the draw to encourage me to keep experimenting. There's no indication if you're doing the right or wrong things. At least with other games if you suck you die. Here, you just kinda float around.  I tried to like this game, but after hitting a brick wall on a few different playthroughs relatively quickly, I shelved it.
6868	0	a	A grindfest with an unforgiving difficulty curve and just enough dark humor to make the first third of the game bearable. Even on lower difficulty settings against enemies of a lower level than you, this game can easily turn into an exercise in banging your head into a brick wall until one or the other breaks.  Ultimately the gameplay just isn't varied enough to keep up with the grind. Save your money and your sanity.
6869	0	a	I have had enough of this game slow progression. Its nothing but a slap in the face and a grind whether you are supply locked or starved &amp; forced to farm areas for goons or rez. The real kick in the teeth is being out gunned by lower tech, even copying you fail. Stealth meter missions are a joke because AI ships are ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and you ahve to micro manage them. This is the 3rd wall ive hit which is unprecedented for me in games for sticking it out this long is beyond me.
6870	0	a	I just couldn't get into it. I was up for some arcade action but was met instead with walls of cringey text. Perhaps it opens up after the intro phase, but I'll never know. It failed to hook me or engage me in any positive way in the time I gave it.
6871	0	a	Boring and repitive, a single fight can last for 30 minutes and after two of these I stopped playing.
6872	0	a	does not cope with modern screen resolutions
6873	0	a	The game is ok, played it for a little but most likley wont touch it again. Avoid if you can.
6874	0	a	Looks nice, but too wordy for me, and pretty unsatisfying combat. Stopped playing after half an hour. But I will let it idle overnight for those trading cards!
6875	0	a	Do you like endlessly repeating the same action for little to no discernable reward? GOTY
6876	0	a	Boring
6877	0	a	this game sucks
6878	0	a	Game looks like it would be fun, but frustrating and confusing control scheme with no alternative makes it more trouble than its worth. Sometimes an acquired taste isn't worth the effort.
6879	0	a	I heard alot of good things about this game, but sadly it just was no fun. The game just didn't really get me excited during the time i played; and it seemed repetitive with the quest just saying kill this, detroy this, and collect this. I felt like i was playing a boring RPG, and I couldn't bring myself to play more.
6880	0	a	Game's annotation says what it is open world sandbox, but truly you will always be clamped by the main story quest. This game also doesn't have enough side quests. Each 10 space systems you can find only 1 side quest, so this game turns to 'collect resource, kill 1000+ weak enemies to get tech lvl up' and then repeat it hundred times to complete another main quests and unlock new ships and new space systems. So if you really want to play old school open world space action game you should choose   Space Rangers  . This two games like earth and sky, like perfect ancient masterwork and new poorly made copy of it. Don't waste your time on SPAZ. It doesn't worth it.
6881	0	a	I expected more of a strategy game, but the bulk of the gameplay in Space Pirates and Zombies (SPAZ) is about twitchy 2D space combat.  I struggled to master the controls. I would have preferred a basic twin-stick control system, like Robotron. Instead, SPAZ features an awkward combination of using the keyboard for thrusters, and the mouse for direction and aim. The result is a game that looks like hockey pucks on an ice rink flying around, shooting wildly at each other. It's really unpleasant to play.  I've played the tutorial mission through twice now, and each time I have come away wondering why I would want to continue. The gameplay is poor, and the various elements of SPAZ don't come together to make a pleasing whole. I'm underwhelmed, and happy to set this aside.
6882	0	a	This game really should have been called Galactic Renegade Interlopers, Nefarious Desperados, Interstellar Nasty Ghouls, as grinding is all you do. You go to a system, see how much the local two factions feel about you, see what you can buy from the faction that likes you, chill out by a friendly mining station to get resources, see what missions you can do that don't ♥♥♥♥ off the faction that doesn't like you, go bribe the other faction so you can buy their stuff, find some way of getting more crew to replace the ones you lost bribing your new friends, and then when the system is done, either bribe some more to unlock the warp gates, or shoot your friends in the back. Story missions are massive spikes in difficulty requiring a lot of leveling from you. They didn't make a massive randomly generated galaxy for the fun of it, as you will be wandering around picking fights and strip-mining it to get the xp and tech needed. Just not for me as I don't have the time.
6883	0	a	I am trying to get into this game but I am finding the combat and movement controls very awkward. Most times if feels like you are just spinning around on one spot shooting things. Very little manovouring. Movement is similar and sometimes it's difficult to see if you are moving since there is usually a large planet in the background, which barely moves, so it throws you off. As well during combat there is little feed back visually or physically. Meaning your ship hardly reflects any damage or somehow impacts your movement. I know the game is created by a small team and is well done for what it is, but the above really is important, I think, for a game to have. I might give it more time. But I don't feel I can.
6884	0	a	bullet hell rpg that takes forever to see any real action.
6885	0	a	this game is not for kids!! it would be fine if not for all the unnessesary swearing ... you should release a family friendly version 
6886	0	a	Stupid. Not much to it. Boring. Don't bother.
6887	0	a	This is NOT for the casual gamers, sad though coz I was looking forward to it. It is quite complex, the learning curve is quite steep. You've gotta totally invest your time in understanding the mechanics of the game when you get started. Maybe recommended for the hardcore gamers, but for casual gamers, I would say 'avoid'. Not because it is a bad game, but because of its complexity.
6888	0	a	This topdown shmup isn't just a arcade top down shmup like astroids. The game has rpg elements where you have to do missions and upgrade your fleet. In Mount&amp;Blade style you have a fleet just control one ship in battles. It's a nice twist on the genre. But the problem is that the shmup gameplay is boring. The controls are bad. You need to play with the mouse+keyboard and the mouse is used for steering. Also because of the rpg elements the combat is slow and the missions aren't interesting. SPAZ has potential, but just isn't very fun.
6889	0	a	The worst game I ever played in my entire life. Everything is boring, nothing gets you entertained.  SPAZ is a space 'shooter' game and when you are used to control fast engines, in this game it's freaking slow and for the best part of the game, you're shooting lasers, because missiles are mainstream. You mostly take 10 minutes to kill a piece of sh*t with those lasers and again, when you think you're almost having fun, the ennemies are flying 20 000 km away but they won't leave the area, no, because you're having fun chasing them for nothing.  In the end I got with a ship I couldn't destroy because he was escaping me anytime he's almost dying. And when he's out of my sight, he regenerates.  The game has more than 100 areas to explore, all of them look the same and are infinite in length but empty of things. Each area has missions, pretty boring ones and repetitive.  It also has a level system, 100 levels it seems, but totally useless because every ability you increase does no effect! It's only useful for new engine parts: lasers, shield, cloak, etc. The level can also tell you how hard an area can be. But you will always die more than 20 times before clearing one. There's plenty of ships to unlock, each ranged by class: small, medium, large, huge. You won't get something good before getting a huge ship, that means, in the end of the game when you have nothing else to do.  However, mods can give a great visual but nobody gives a.. and only 2 mods are available: halloween and xmas. wow. I admit I played with a trainer but even with that it's a pain to play this horrible game.  2.5/10
6890	0	a	Stupid. Not much to it. Boring. Don't bother.
6891	0	a	We know that some classical games needs to be revived.But this is kinda sloppy. The game is imbalance and gets broing as it goes on. They should review their title again.
6892	0	a	Terrible game, not worth the money.
6893	0	a	First impressions... Pretty bored, it only took 60 minutes before larger enemies started swarming me, and when that happened I ended up getting knocked back to the lowest level ship in the game and had to sit there mining ores for literally a little more than 30 minutes
6894	0	a	Space pirates and zombies...   Although the ideas for a great game are there, the way they were implemented was a little off the mark, and it isn't very addicting gameplay, the story and voice acting is basically little to none. Although it is fun for a period of time, and if multiplayer was implemented as well as a much wider array of spaceship upgrades I can see potential.  I would not recommend SPAZ, i'd rate it about a 5/10.
6895	0	a	In short: it is boring.   Plus: Lots of customization, lots of ships, it feels like a polished product. cheap  Negative: Feels like a grind, not enough mission variety, not enough strategy involved, Combat is not that interesting.  I expected a mix of exploration and a deeper ship strategy game like the game 'battleships forever' but the latter is clearly not there.
6896	0	a	' There is potential here, the ship customization is nice. But the game also feels very grindy. Some missions are fun, others just feel like BS- Also the control sceme is somewhat awkward. '  The bit above was my original review, i wrote it about 3 or so hours into the game.  Now, having finished it after about 45hrs of playtime (that's a single playthrough, so if the game can keep you engaged, there is very good playtime value in it... Most of it was repetive/grind-ish missions however), i am somewhat torn.  In the long run it was better, than my first impression. Certainly not terrible. However, was it good enough, to change my vote?  I don't think so. On a more refined scale, i would have voted differently - a 6 out of 10 perhaps.  But with only 'Yay' or 'Nay' as possible votes, i'll stick to my initial negative vote. After all, after wrtitng that original bit, i stopped playing for a few days. Might havenever returned, but was really-really bored, so took it up again.  A few nice extras came up, but my two main complaints - grind and awkward controls - remained in place.  The story was ok for a open world-ish combat game, where no one really cares about story anyway. Predictable and very cliche, but enough to keep you moving from chapter to chapter.  Actaully, when changing chapters there were a few interesting changes in the mechanics. Late game even had something a kin to a basic strategic layer, with defense chokepoints and ressource management - very-very-very basic, but nevertheless, an interesting change of pace.  However, it did not do away with the grindy-ness. Rather the need for ressources increased. To progress the story i had to do the same missions over and over again (same objectives, slightly different maps). In the end i was just cherry-picking the missions, that i could do the fastest (cloak, destroy the target, get out).  I had unlocked all the ships, all the modules about half way through the game. Picked my favorites rather quickly too. Most new unlocks i only tried for a short while (one or two fights), found them inferior, to what i already had and never used them again. Now, i am willing to believe, that there is some bit of personal prefference involved - other player might select other ships at some point. However, there is also somewhat poor balance - some ships of the same class, are clearly and stricktly superior to others - more health, more equipment slots. Bounty hunter designs in particular seem very strong - perhaps a sort of power creep in the development process.  My main complaint remains the control scheme, even after 45 hours of gameplay i still wasn't fully used to it. I can't even rightly describe it - it's just not intuitive.  Basically the strafe controls are pivoted on the ship, rather than on the screen. And since the ship can be spinning all willy-nilly, depending on where you aim your mouse (which is where your target is, so you can't just say 'screw it' and steer with the mouse), the direction of strafing is kinda flipping around, so sometimes ushing left, will make you move left, while other times you push left, yet go right.  That made strafing completely unviable for me.
6897	0	a	It’s good, but they’ve put in waaaaaay too much padding. Getting to each quest location basically requires fighting your way directly through a half-dozen star systems, which don’t offer any new gameplay, just more identical enemies to shoot.
6898	0	a	- Too complicated system. learning takes long time - Bad scenario and game mechanics - Mining System is really waste your time - Ship control system is really bad  True OVERRATED GAME. I dont recommend.  
6899	0	a	A conceptually good game that ultimately suffers from being very grindy and surprisingly difficult. The grindy-ness is kind of just the nature of the game and if you can deal with the controls and feel immersed in the universe and enjoy the combat, you probably won't care. Most games are repetitve after all. But I found the universe to not be quite as interesting as advertised and the rpg-like elemnts of the game to be not bad per-se, but not really compelling or interesting either.  The difficulty is at least to some degree, a by-product ofthe awkward controls. This game needs controller support, it begs to have twin-stick controls. Its just too hard otherwise it would be a fine little game. A lot of people apparently adapted to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ controls but I just couldn't as a long time Geometry Wars type player I just can't get the hang of the combat........and thats the entire game so yea. Its slightly unfair of me to knock the game because I suck at it......but how much foresight and budget would it really have taken for them to include controller support? Ring Runner Flight of the Sages manages it at a similar price-point and would be the game I would recommend instead.
6900	0	a	The only reason i have this game was because it was in a bundle...the only reason i played it was for cards -1/10 Worst game ever.
6901	0	a	Has a YouTube celebrity narrating the intro.
6902	0	a	You know they made a turn-based tactics game out of the R-Type franchise? Pretty wild, right?
6903	0	a	Only ♥♥♥♥ing reason I played this was cause my fan broke and I was unable to play anything else. It's okay at best.
6904	0	a	My Games Rating: 2/10*
6905	0	a	Nice and Fun, wouldnt give it a great score, but it is a good game if you have nothing much to do
6906	0	a	Maybe if platformers are your type of game its worth considering...
6907	0	a	Hard to get into... Relatively complex game mechanics are not explained properly
6908	0	a	I do not recommend this game.  Gameplay: Way too repetitive. At the end, you're just holding down the mouse button while your turrets do the work. And the game likes to start throwing 'attacks' against you after the first few levels, keeping you from warping out unless you hit one of the menu keys quickly enough.  Story: Garbage. It also impacts the gameplay too heavily (prevents you from researching / building / etc. until you get past certain story missions), killing replay value. Also, way too long on the default settings.  Audio: S'alright.
6909	0	a	This games was very bad, the summery of this game is pretty mutch like the space-age of spore barley eny instructions, wandering around endless space untill you find something to kill theres pretty mutch no point to this game in my eyes. 
6910	0	a	Hard to get into... Relatively complex game mechanics are not explained properly
6911	0	a	The one thing that makes the game unplayable for me is the controls: your arrow keys move the ship relative to the ship's facing instead of your top-down view.  There is no option to switch this. 
6912	0	a	I really wanted to like this game and there's quite a few things that are good about it, but it's just not nearly enough to recommend this...  What is SPAZ?  This game puts you in a more or less randomly generated 2D galaxy. You can set the amount of star systems, the difficulty, the tech advancements and randomize the tech tree. That's pretty much it. I've played a game with 300 systems and started one with 150. I honestly don't see the difference, which already brings me to the biggest issue I have with it:  This game is utterly and truly boring. You are going to do the same thing over and over and over and over again. That is: Fly to a subsystem, complete missions to raise your standing with 1 of the 2 factions, which of course hate each other, in order to gain resources you need to (re)build ships, gather upgrade points and buy new modules like better shields, etc.  There is a main mission to follow, but honestly after 10 hours of gameplay I've not been able to progress this very much, since every main mission is multiple sub systems apart. Now, you've got to understand that these subsystems have a level requirement attached to it, which means you need to break a blockade to access a new subystem. That in turn means grinding out levels to get more upgrades and fighting against superior foes either technologically speaking or just sheer numbers. The next problem with this is that you only get new and better ships by destroying these same ships multiple times first to get the blueprints. In my first playthrough I just didn't get any good ships that would even survive against the enemy for a few seconds most of the time. It doesn't help that most damage is unavoidable and your ai ships are dumb as ♥♥♥♥.  In the end this means ginding, grinding, grinding...and that's not what I was looking for in a space exploration and combat game. Not to mention that after 10 hours there are still no zombies, so I can't even comment on how the gameplay changes after you reach that stage, but since I was finally able to complete another main mission, only to realize I need to grind another TEN levels to even GET to the next mission area I said '♥♥♥♥ you', as this is a bottomless pit. Even with just 150 subystems you're going to be doing this for 100 hours I feel. Not worth it, especially since the gameplay does not change at all throughout the whole game. The only difference is that you get bigger ships that move slower, but the main combat system and weapons stay the same. Pretty disappointed in this one. :/
6913	0	a	kind of sick of the tutorial database popping up literally every few secs... not ok...
6914	0	a	Despite being a solid game the usage of Green-Yellow-Red makes this game a nightmare to play if you have the corresponding colorblindness.
6915	0	a	Meh. Don't buy. Boring. Not even worth it on sale.
6916	0	a	knowing it was made by only two people means i can't rightfully tell you how bad this game is but im gonna do it anyways  it SUCKS
6917	0	a	now i understand why this game is called SPAZ
6918	0	a	You should not play this game. Especially not for more than $5. Ship control is exactly like Asteroid. EXACTLY. Combat is absolutely horrible. Graphics are on par with NES maybe SNES. The story is also far too cartoonish and corny right from the very start. Not a good experience even in the slightest.
6919	0	a	Black screen of death upon opening the game. Having to hard re-boot to get out of it sucks.  Can't play the game. ONLY game I can't play in my library.  Skylake i5 16Gb RAM AMD 290X

6924	0	a	Just not as good as escape velocity.
6925	0	a	Tried to get into the game but found it very boring.
6926	0	a	I came back to try this game. What is going on? I can not even beat the game on casual mode. Starting area every ship is faster and takes me rebuilding my ships over and over just to kill one. I use to like this game, I just don't understand why all of a sudden just kill one ship is almost impossible... on casual
6927	0	a	this is another crap 2d space rpg, cant get a refund because i played a little over 2 hours.  dont get this game
6928	0	a	Not Recommended !
6929	0	a	I don't know what to say. Everyone seems to like it - the graphics are nice but the movement is just a bit much. I hit nothing, ever. It is asteroids style with none of the accuracy I recall. Not for me.
6930	0	a	The most repetitive game I've ever played.  The devs did their best, but this Indie game couldn't convince me.
6931	0	a	It's pretty good in some senses. In other senses, it needs more variation. It really is just do the same thing over and over - or if it isn't, it's done a good job of tricking me into believing that it is.
6932	0	a	Its a grinder pure and simple. Story line is about as stupid and weak as you would expect. The missions are hack and slash rinse and repeat ad nauseum. Still its a fun game and the mods make it a little less of a headache. Worth 2-3 bucks but not more. There is a great feel to the game but the content can only support about an hour or two of game play. The problem is that the developers seem to want to make a 100+ hour game and decided to do this by copy pasting the same quest over and over and over again. You fly from one star system to the next and do the exact some thing in almost every single one over and over and over again. Still its a reminiscent isometric game and nostalgia has a high value for some even if it is by definition repetitive. Overall I'd rate the game 3/10.
6933	0	a	 What I liked:      Ship designs and variety in weapons     Space combat with your 4 ships     Starting out with small ships, working toward the big ships   What You Need to Know:      You mine asteroids for resources, ( can let the game automine for you)     Half of my playtime is me leaving the game to mine while I do something else ( you lose resources when your ships die     The halfway mark of the game switches to fighting only zombie ships ( I quit at this point, they are not fun to fight)     Zombie ships heal and can take over your ships really fast ( they are cool when mixed with other enemy types)     This game is very grindy ( not in the good way)    My Score:
6934	0	a	I'm sure this is a good game, but it didn't really grab me like I thought it would. It's basically a dual joystick shooter, and those for me have been over since Geometry Wars 2, which more or less perfected that formula.
6935	0	a	I will never ever ever play this peice of crap becuase it is just 2 bad 4 me
6936	0	a	Space Pirates and Zombies delivers some good space action. But with such a large amount of space to explore, there should be far less repetition and grinding and lot more progression. Side quests are repetitive but necessary if you want to earn enough Data and Rez to upgrade your fleet and stand a chance at facing the continuous onslaught of enemy ships.

6939	0	a	Space Pirates and Zombies has an ill considered control scheme that makes the ships insanely difficult to pilot. Also, mining takes forever and is mind numbingly boring.  Verdict: only for masochists.

6942	0	a	I would advise, don't try this game, until the creators fix those freaking bugs.  At a given point of the game (about lvl 60-65), you will have a main mission, where you have sneak with cloaked ships. But actually, you will never be able to do that, since ALL OF YOUR FREAKING ESCORT SHIPS ARE DUMB AS HELL. There is not effect in setting them to no attack mode, or anything else, you will always fail on the main mission.
6943	0	a	Do not bother spending money on this. It's their first attempt, and while it's admirable the flaws are staggering and game-breaking. Their concept of 'fun' and 'balance' are skewed heavily towards banging your head against a concrete wall and calling it 'strategy'.

6951	0	a	Breath of Death VII is an old school RPG where you find your party members and fight random battles with a turn based system. Part of the charm to this game is that it mimics the original Dragon Quest games in color, menus, maps and even the feel of the towns.   After each battle, each party member gets restored to full health, including dead characters. Even if you escape, you get full health. This makes the game streamlined and easy even on hard difficulty. To compensate for this, the game balances out by powering up the monsters after each round. Their attack strength keep going up by 10%. It puts pressure to finish the fight fast. There is also no run, but instead its relegated to a magic skill given to one character. One of the biggest enjoyments that I get out of the game is the ability to chose one of two bonuses every time a character reaches a new level. Do you chose this spell or that spell? Do you want +20 Max HP and +20 strength or +10 Strength + 10 Willpower +10 Magic +10 Vitality? After level 30, the game runs out of choices for you.  The challenge is in your MP / mana. You will get some back after each level, but outside of an Inn or a save point (you can save on the fly too). You won't be able to refill your magic. On the surface, fighting and button mashing make quick work of enemies. Deeper into any dungeon makes fighting difficult without using magic or techniques (both cost MP / mana). While battles are random, the dungeons have specific numbers of battles before the random battles get down to 0. So if you fight 20 random battles, you won't have any other random battles to fight. This works well, because you can go deep into a dungeon, have no mana left and need to walk back out of the dungeon. Having 0 remaining random battles ensures your survival. Since there is no sort of easy teleportation. A few dungeons force you to beat the boss and walk back. Luckily there is a run button.  Spells get upgraded. The heal spell can get upgraded to resurrect. Making it easy if a character dies that you're trying to heal, well they're just resurrected! There aren't items, but there are potions. You can't buy these, you need to find them in caves. They resurrect and give full health to any character. These are necessary if your lone healer dies. There is a health regenerating zombie though and a vampire sort of attack with another character.  The leader of your party is a silent (yet thinking) skeleton, a ghost princess healer, a vampire nerd and a prince zombie. They are all powerful in their own way. In battle, two of the characters can join forces for big attacks. The only problem is both need to be alive to do them. Its not a problem toward the beginning of the game.  About 7 hours into the game, I noticed there is a combo system. Sure its always been there. I just didn't find it useful. Every attack builds a combo. There are special combo boosts and breakers that when used will multiply the damage by the combo, but reset the combo to 0. It would be more useful if these specials weren't already the highest damagers in general. You can keep using them to kill the enemies quickly without having to build a combo.  When I played, I found normal (medium) difficulty far too easy, so I played on hard. On hard, the bosses became insurmountable. Like any RPG, grinding made any boss easier. The menu has a 'fight' command that will cue up a random battle for you! For the most part random battles are a numbers game. Not your stats vs their stats, but your remaining members against their remaining members. The party that outnumbers the other wins unless one of them balances out the numbers.   Bosses were a major issue on hard, which made for an hour long grind on many of them. One boss, I had literally run out of enemies to grind and couldn't beat a boss. I had to leave the dungeon by walking mind you and grind on over world enemies. Then walk all the way back to the boss with 0 enemies. It just felt unnecessary and hindered my ability to enjoy the game.  For equipment, Breath of Death is bare bones. You have a weapon and armor. No headgear, no accessory. Towns don't have more than a couple weapons and armor for your four characters. There are a few treasures here and there in dungeons. Treasures in towns get relegated to jokes, like 'A true hero wouldn't steal from a person, even if there's a bazooka in there.' There is no interaction with anything outside of talking to townspeople. Nothing hidden in book shelves or pots. It is sad how little effort got put into the details outside of readable tombstones in one lone graveyard.  The world itself feels big enough. There are around 10+ dungeons and 3+ towns. You won't get to travel the oceans or visit far off lands, but the dungeons are the real maps. Each dungeon feels big enough. There are mostly underground areas, a prison and the ruins of giant towns. You can tackle them pretty openly. The second area has three dungeons you can visit. Yet, with the fourth, it bluntly tells you not to go in there yet. It just seems like a cheap reason, when other RPGs would point out we need the X to continue.  The game really wants to hang its hat on comedy. There are funny tombstones and excessive references to classic lines in other video games. 'Hey listen!' 'Its a secret to everybody!' 'Master of unlocking.' 'Welcome strangah! what-cha buyin' 'I am error' 'Motherbound' 'Perhaps your prince is in another castle?' Even a reference to Bionic Commando that made me laugh, because that one was unexpected. The rest of the references have become commonplace on the Internet. Not only that, but there is a replica / parody of Zelda 2's version of Death Mountain. Other than that, the humor doesn't seem overwhelming. Sometimes less is more.  I just didn't care for the game's humor like I did with Cthulhu Saves the World. Breath of Death VII feels like it doesn't have its own jokes and relies too much on your knowledge from 25 year old dialog.  Then there are the game's other issues. Three years after its release, the game still has issues here and there. Enemies immune to poison, still get poisoned. Two dungeons have no music. That could be a good thing when all the other dungeons have the same music that overstays its welcome. Getting experience still seems glitched. plenty of times, I'd look at the status screen. I needed 4,000 more EXP, then beat another group of enemies earning 1,500 EXP only to discover that I still needed 4,000 more EXP. In a game where grinding is necessary, its an issue. I'm left with a feeling of knowing that I have to invest another hour into the game grinding before I'll face the boss of any area again.  If you don't want to get too involved with a 40 - 80 hour RPG, Breath of Death could be for you. With saving anywhere and refilling your HP after every battle, that makes for an easy game. Some people like easy! Some complain that the game is 3 - 5 hours, that's perfect for $3 in my opinion. For the $1 combo pack that I bought it in. I feel like I got my money's worth thanks to hard mode. As for this being a fun, entertaining game, it wasn't. I spent several hours grinding to overcome boss after boss. Maybe I made it too hard by playing hard mode and turned a 5 hour game into an 11 hour game with 6 hours of grinding, but I can only review my own experience with the game.
6952	0	a	After playing games of this genre my entire life, I was excited for a throwback to the style of other games that I loved. Unfortunately, Breath of Death VII didn't live up to my expectations.  The one original idea I noticed in the game was the battle mechanic that builds momentum each turn of the battle. Enemies get stronger, and you can build up a combo as long as you don't heal and just keep attacking. While an interesting concept, it ended up removing most semblance of the strategy that exists in turn-based RPGs and turning it into each battle essentially feeling like a race to try and see if you can kill the enemy or boss before having to heal.  That, combined with the short length of the game and the sense of humour that seemed a bit forced, made me fairly disappointed with this title. I would sooner recommend an RPG made with RPG Maker, or that you simply replay the games whose nostalgia this title is trying to capitalize on.
6953	0	a	Even if you are an oldschool RPG fan, I cannot recommend this with a clear conscience. The writing in this game is absolutely abysmal, relying on knowledge of video game memes and injokes instead of actually attempting to be funny. The setup to the plot is wasted; the idea of an RPG taking place after the apocalypse has been proven to be incredibly engrossing. Here, it is used as a fresh coat of paint over your typical NES RPG.  The combat is somewhat fun. Depending on your skill with RPGs, you'll either blaze through the game with no difficulty or get irreversably stuck depending on the levelups you pick. If you pick the wrong level up, you can potentially be stuck somewhere later in the game, with no way to reverse your choice. There is no feedback in battles as to what's happening.   If you are going to play one of their games, I would recommend their Penny Arcade games, or at the very least, Cthulu Saves the World. Don't buy this one, it's not worth the 3 dollars nor is it worth the sale price.
6954	0	a	First I played Cthulhu saves the world and liked it very much. Maybe this was the problem, because when I played Breath of Death VII, the flaws that Zeboyd Games learned along the way and fixed in later games became glaring.
6955	0	a	If this had come out in the 80's, it would have been amazing. If it came out in the 90's, it would be mediocre. And today, its not good. The combat comes down to fighting and healing, the story line is hardly mentioned (and is often half my motivation to play an RPG game), and the comedy, which should be the redeeming factor to all this, is  just okay.  'Nuff said.
6956	0	a	As a fan of both Japanese RPGs and parodies, I am surprised how badly this game fails at both. I'm not sure if it's appropriate to criticize level design or battle system (not to mention the story) - you don't expect 'You Only Live Once' to be a good platformer, right? But it also lacks humour. I am about half through the game, ad so far, there's been not a single decent joke. Mark Leung's ROTB was way better in this (playing it was still a pain, though). What this game does, however, is repeats most common flaws of JRPGs. One can think it IS the promised parody at work, but it's done in such unentertaining way, that any good JRPG of old (not to mention modern indies) with their inner jokes and self-parodies easily beats it. The JRPG tropes are widely presented - with equal parts love and criticism - in popular culture nowadays - from Eat Lead to Abenobashi to Sophie Houlden's 'The Linear RPG' to Robot Chicken. To make an entertaining game, it's not enough to put in a vampire wannabe and a world map that looks like Dragon Quest's. Not anymore.
6957	0	a	The game is not nearly as funny as the theme and title suggest. Its also very repetitive and straightforward. Why does it have more reputation than other generic rpgmaker type games is beyond me. For a more funny and unique retro style rpg with depth, search for 'Dark Scavengers'.
6958	0	a	Started out promising but quickly fell apart. No substance behind the parody, and much of it quickly becomes forced references and overused memes. As far as gameplay goes, the combo effect added some flavor but it's standard turn-based rounds. Eventually the dungeons get tediously long just to pad out the game, so I found myself using the 'Fight' option repeatedly to clear out the dungeons before treading past the entrance. And then BOOM it was over. Turn-based RPGs are like a zen garden to me, otherwise I wouldn't have finished.
6959	0	a	This game is not the kind of game that you expect a lot from. But as you play it it brings back memories of RPG's from years ago. This game is funny and better than I expected. However, the fact that it brings back memories of REALLY old RPG's is not something for it. I don't recommend it, unless it's on sale and you just want a small game to play with
6960	0	a	if you play a lot of RPGs, you will find this one kinda boring. kinda bland and youve probably seen it all before. I don't play a lot of RPG so i thought it was a decent game, but thats it OAKY
6961	0	a	Use a guide for leveling up. if you don't depending on what you pick when you level up, you will become stuck at a part so hard that you need to start a new game,
6962	0	a	You aimed for my funny bone, but you missed.
6963	0	a	Most of it's 'humor' is lame refrences. The fact that the battle system is fast, just turns fights into contests into who can damage who quickest. A boring couple of hours, just happy there was a run key so I can zoom though most of the game.
6964	0	a	You aimed for my funny bone, but you missed.
6965	0	a	Don't buy this, buy a pack of gum instead, it shouldn't be as dissapointing as this.   They have about the same amount of story, but the gum dosn't come with annoying 1dimentional characters, half-♥♥♥♥♥ jokes, or a boring combat system consisting of which number is higher without anny type of visual or even text feedback. (Is it that hard to add some descriptions, seriously). Also the progression kind of sucks, the flavour realy falls out of this pice of gum when you realise that basically every item and lvl up is a pure stat boost, with multistrike and heal being the only skills you need.
6966	0	a	This is a parody of the JRPG genre. I thought I would enjoy it, having both a good sense of humor (in my opinion at least) and being a huge fan of the genre.  Then I started playing it and found that the humor was not very, how should I put it, thoughtful (or even funny). It mocks the genre by doing the ridiculous things people associate with it, but not in any kind of exaggerated way. Instead, it just does them in an uninspired way and makes the characters barely comment in the most unsubtle of ways. Your brain won't go 'Oh, I see what you did there', but more like 'Alright, ha ha, I guess...'  At other times, which is in fact the majority of 'jokes', the dialogue is just referential. Quotes from other games or shows are used as is and once again, I think you're supposed to go 'Alright, ha ha, I guess...'  The story in itself is very poor and only serves to throw a joke here and there. The battle system quickly becomes boring, like the whole thing, and you'll notice there isn't any strategy to it, unlike the games it's supposed to make fun of.
6967	0	a	Everything that could ever be wrong with an RPG.  For a game that's trying to nod to Dragon Quest, I could not be more disappointed. Did the authors ever even play an old-school turn based RPG at all - much less from start to finish?  Everything is wrong. Equipment balance is nonexistant - you barely ever get new stuff - when you do, it tends to either micro-break the game, or make no difference. Treasure chests never contain anything of import. Map designs are god-awful mazes. Encounters are offensively easy (every difficulty except the super-hard difficulty) or ok-or-impossible (super-hard difficulty) - the randomizer swing, given their stupid fully-recover-HP-every-battle balance, turns the game into more of a slot machine.  The music is ♥♥♥♥ING AWFUL! Seriously. Who could ever dream of thinking this music belonged in a finished game!?!? I could ♥♥♥♥ out a better RPG soundtrack in a week (and have).  Add to it a completely underwhelming storyline that fails at being funny and you have an jRPG that fails at literally every single point that a jRPG should strive to achieve. It's like the wanted me to hate the game.  In that case - well done, Zeboyd! You've failed to do what 15 year old kids, RPGMaker, and 1 month of free time have been doing without pay for well over a decade.
6968	0	a	Good humor, functioning fighting system (typical turn-based RPG-style, nothing out of the ordinary), decent enough drive to make you want to play further and fight more enemies... until the dungeons that have been long, vast, mazes from the start begin to get ridiculously long and just too annoying for me to care much more about the game.  Great start, but the game 'design' is just extremely awful that some funny lines can't cover up the slightest.
6969	0	a	If you like babby's first RPG mechanics and clumsy gamer culture references intermixed with a classic RPG 'parody' with all the subtlety of a mall shooting, pick this one up.

6973	0	a	Can be unfair in battles.
6974	0	a	This type of game has a specific niche of people who would play and enjoy. Games like this put me to sleep. press one button to win a fight, no stratecgy or action whatsoever. Boring. While effort put in the game is noted, its just not for me. I bought based on reviews/bundl;e ( 2 games for under a dollar?) thinking it would be some sort of fit. but, just not for me. I will go out on a limb and assume Cthulu will be the same review. Sorry guys, its me, not you.
6975	0	a	Final fantasy mystic quest like turn based combat adventure. It has an awkward level up system and really bad graphics. Sure it tries to utilize retro graphics but it did not work all so well.
6976	0	a	Some interesting additions to the classic jrpg formula but very poorly designed map/dungeon layouts and tiles even by NES era standards, combined with lazy copy/paste areas (such as all tombstones in an area saying the exact same thing) you end up with decent ideas and character art with extremely poor execution of the game itself.   The idea of combat being able to be triggered in a menu makes grinding a lot easier, but the fights themself are so easy and you get overlevel so quickly, then add on automatic revives and heals between fights, it's a very easy game where every fight can really be won by simply mashing attack as fast as possible.  The combo counter and execution attacks is a great addition just never actually useful due to how easy the fights are
6977	0	a	To think this is my first negative reveiw...  Anyway all I have to say is that I would have been better off saving this 98 cents for something else.
6978	0	a	if u wanna play a good RPG just look to the great classics of the 90's. This ♥♥♥♥ is ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and uninspired.  The only good homebrew I can say worth your while is awesome Demon's Mantra and Demons Mantra II. Created in early 2000's.
6979	0	a	this some kind of christmas party?
6980	0	a	This is an RPG in the spirit and form of 8-but classics. And, as you may have already discovered, these concepts have not aged well. Compared to the balanced, intricate, funny, and often moving RPGs of modernity, this game has no merit. Don't get me wrong, I am a huge fan of these developers. I liked their next game (Cthulu Saves the World) a lot, and their next game (Penny Arcade 3) tremendously. But this is obviously a first try - a good way for the developers to gain experience but not actually worth playing.
6981	0	a	This game makes me feel like a 10 year old made this on RPG Maker X. Put more work into this please. Go big or go home. (and i mean this for the sake of just the battle system. wtf man)
6982	0	a	Try 'Chtulu Saves The World', it's a lot better!
6983	0	a	Both of these games uses the battle displays from ancient rpgs, think Earthbound, Shin Megami Tensei, or a numbered Phantasy Star (not online, the original games).   Both of them rely on pretty decent jokes, although Cthulhu, being the second game they made, takes the ham way higher, and as a result is mostly funnier. Even though you never see your charathers in the battle, its still pretty involving, with stat buffs and debuffs as well as mana preservation, although it isn't quite as stressful as the games it's actually based on.  The game helps you along with some major streamlining, especially in the inventory and telling you where to go next, although you can sequence break if you are willing to overlevel a bit.  Although if this is the first time you've played one of these in a while, the game will probbably seem monstrously difficult, especially with its unique health refill feature giving them an excuse to use a set monster encounter rate.  In all honesty, I think you should use PSN, GoG, wiiware, xbox arcade, ceirtain indie releases, a compilation game (I can think of several sega genesis sets that include three phantasy star games, not to mention other awesome things in other genres) to experience this sub-genre in pure form.  This game and its companion provide some light entertainment, but the gameplay 'outweighs' it, so you have a system that requires a degree of commitment to come to terms with, but due to the fact that you know it's a parody, you don't really have the motivation.
6984	0	a	Waste of money, time and bandwidth (even if it's tiny).  Unlike Cthulhu saves the world, this one is uninspiring, dull and boring. At least in Cthulhu saves the world, you have lots of humour even if it uses the same bad game system. On top of that, you can't have a more linear game than those two.  Don't buy this, get yourself an NES rom of Dragon Warrior 1 or 2 and it's a thousand fold better even if those two games are like 25 years old!  Cthulhu Saves the world, Breath of Death VII, and all those games made with rpgxp and the like should be free on the web. None of them are worth a penny anyways.
6985	0	a	worth the 25 cents I paid for it. not much more.
6986	0	a	i played this game on the Super Ness and missed it quite a bit but i suggest not getting it if you got windows 10 for it keeps crashing on me
6987	0	a	If it came out in the 90's, it would be interesting to play,but now i think it is old...
6988	0	a	This game is the ultimate grindfest. The graphics are ripped from Dragon Warrior. The menu system sucks ♥♥♥. Buy Weapons, Buy Armor, Sell Weapons, Sell Armor. Seriously they couldn't combine those options into Buy and Sell? You restore all HP after every fight, so basically sit one square outside of town and spam find fight. This is the worst possible mechanic you can implement into an rpg because it removes the majority of work for grinding.
6989	0	a	This is a medium-bad game I only recommend for rpg lovers. The nice retro/indie feel is here and the super cool final boss fight is probably worth $3... but there are so many long hallways and pointless fights and crappy gameplay mechanics that if you don't set into this game with a will of steel you'll never get past halfway.
6990	0	a	Terrible. Grind-fest. The game started out fun and light, but the difficulty quickly went through the roof which would seem to require hours of mind-numbing grinding to overcome. Needless to say, I stopped before that happened.
6991	0	a	monotonus, humorus but but enough so to make it worth while
6992	0	a	i beat this whole game and then i played cthulu saves the world and i wish i had just played that instead
6993	0	a	it was given to me free, but still its not like i was ever going to play it
6994	0	a	 Apparently after a nuclear war annihilates everyone, survivors live in the Kingdom Age where magic now exists?  Besides the strange intro, you are in control of a skeleton warrior/mage. The animations and gameplay are pretty much like Final Fantasy, except this game has way too much dialogue and it's extremely difficult.  It's okay but I wouldn't invest my time into it.  1/10
6995	0	a	Oh look, another Final Fantasy parody clone. I bet no one is tired of these yet.
6996	0	a	I was hoping that this would play similar to the early Ultima games. While the looks are there, the gameplay isn't. There's not a whole lot of depth. It does have some positives like game controller support and a very simplified user interface. Also the combat is nicely done. But if you are expecting an adventure along the lines of Ultima III, you won't find it here.
6997	0	a	One cool gimmick makes a bad NES JRPG playable for about an hour.
6998	0	a	This game.......yea. Don't buy it.
6999	0	a	It tries really hard to be an ode to old school NES JRPGs, and it tries to get rid of some of the archiac mechanics, but overall it just can't shed the badness of those games as a whole and it's brought down by that. ♥♥♥♥, man, I'm tired. I played this game well over a year ago and I hardly remember it. It went on for a long time and I never finished it and there was a lot of grinding, but at least you got healed after every battle!!! I wouldn't play it again though.
7000	0	a	Really short and full of random RPG jokes, cliches, and game design choices. There's about 5 hours of gameplay here and the ending is an abrupt CONGRATS YOU SAVED THE WORLD PLAY AGAIN ON A HIGHER DIFFICULTY OR TRY TIME ATTACK. Sadly not much replay value and it feels like an actual numbered game, as if it's in the middle of a series or part of some 'episodic' DLC series. I guess that was intended but it's still frustrating. I'd be more upset if the game wasn't so cheap.
7001	0	a	It's 2 EUR for two games, and I didn't even pay full price, so it's ok. Other way, this game isn't worth the money. There are some 'good' RPGmaker games out there, but this one is pretty limited. It's a straight forward short game you can finish in a couple of hours.  That doesn't mean it's an awful game in the end. The metagame isn't bad: the battle system is fast and original, the difficulty is well adjusted, the character stat-raising system is open and let you develop your characters at your own way. The best part is the jokes and references the developers put everywhere into the game xD  But the game itself feels empty: Few people to talk, no methods of transport, few towns (and all of them are quite simple) or places to go, no hidden items (you know, like 'press X at a garbage can to find a potion'), few sidequests aside from an optional dungeon...
7002	0	a	Ugly (even by SNES standards) uninspired graphics. Funny ironical storyline. Better play a  Final Fantasy  episode on SuperNintendo!
7003	0	a	Little attention to detail and frustrating gameplay balance.
7004	0	a	Short and boring, granted I paid less than fifty cents for it. Play Final Fantasy III or II instead.
7005	0	a	It's like playing a fast paced version of Dragon Quest / Warrior except with a bunch of old school RPG references and analogy's that any one under the age of 15 would barely grasp... unless that person is a dirty hipster... oh right and take away any sense of challenge and yeah, you have Breath of Death... part 7?   They must of canned the original 6 versions of the game and settled on this... sad.  Seems like this game is trying to cater to older gamers from a generation of when it was cool and unique to be a gamer but I've played and looked at better games in my youth...  I'd rather just boot up Dragon Quest or Final Fantasy on NES or SNES than play through this mess of text and obscure references at every turn... not that I didn't understand them... I'm pretty sure I was overanalizing everything in this game and after a while it just seemed like a lot work.   Once I ran in to the vampire chick and realized she's basically a reference to Lucca from Chrono Trigger I immediately came to my sense's and quit playing... and booted up Chrono Trigger instead. :)
7006	0	a	this game is mediocre
7007	0	a	when you walk in caves it does this 'moving effect ' that hurts your eyes 
7008	0	a	Okay, but not really worth the time. BoD VII is funny, but would have been better as a comic strip. Go play a real RPG, or play outside!

7013	0	a	It's a game. Meh. I honestly don't have anything of merit to say about it.  It's easily finishable in 2-3 hours, there's no story, no side quests, a bunch of obscure video game references, and cheesy dialogue.
7014	0	a	It pokes fun at those old school dragon warrior type rpgs from the NES era and is pretty funny. But... if also commits all the same sins it is laughing at. Expect to grind. A lot. Expect to die. Often. And do it all with purposfully bad graphics. This game should have been fun but it's just a slog from joke to joke and that isn't enough for me. Even at this price, I am not spending so much time and effort just to get to the next laugh.  If they ever made a cartoon I'd watch it though.
7015	0	a	Breath of Death VII is a first attempt at making a game. A bit of a messy one, but it was made by two people so... what the hell! I'll admit, I'm not the biggest of JRPG fans out there, and so this game definitely has a least-common-denominator effect on me as a gamer, but as far as JRPGs go... this game has some serious flaws.  For one, the game can feel very much like Final Fantasy XIII- where you walk down long corridors, run into random enemies, and deviate from the path only a little bit (but it can be a little frustrating at which path will take you to potential treasure, and which will take you further towards the boss... and away from the potential treasure). However, Final Fantasy XIII is better than Breah of Death VII (Oh, god, it's come to this. Next I'll start saying that I actually like Transformers) in the sense that the characters had unique interactions... and I'm trying incredibly hard to say that with a straight face. What I mean to say is, that there was a little variation in FF XIII's gameplay during the long, boring corridor walks. But BoD VII has one conversation per dungeon. Period. And I feel like making my same criticism that I made towards Soul Gambler. This game shouldn't be too difficult to have little bits of banter and fun conversation between characters, to pace the adventure. But it just turns into walking... and attacking.  But what about attacking? Let me tell you about Breath of Death VII's strategy in their game. Hit, hit, and keep hitting until they die. Until you get to the one bugger who doesn't take that. And you then realise at that point that all that 'free choice' you had during those level-up moments were actually not as free as you suspected. I just figured that each bonus would be balanced with another, and they are most certainly not. There are highly essential spells and attacks you HAVE to learn, and if you choose the incorrect ones (the ones that break your oh-so-special combo meter... you're screwed). This is a massive flaw in crafting an RPG that flows with the player, but instead demands the player pay close attention to what the game wants you to choose. Yes, I know, an RPG-er needs to pay strict attention to their bonuses, but a game should accomodate to the player's decisions. Or else the game sucks. Like Final Fantasy XIII sucks.  'But what about the other elements of Breath of Death VII?' you may ask. 'The sound's good, isn't it?' Yeah, sure, sound's fine. 'And aren't the graphics great?' Well, that's where I'd have to stop you and kindly let you hold my holy frag grenade as I sprint away from the conversation entirely. No, I don't hate 8-bit graphics. I personally think that older NES and SNES game graphics age far better than older 3D graphics like N64 and PS2. And I think the game's graphics on it's sprites, portraits, enemies, and world is just fine.   So what's my problem with the graphics? The blackness. Beyond the dungeons there is a lot of black nothingness extending for what I'd expect to be all of eternity, which makes me feel all the more... isolated in the game. And not in the 'I'm alone in a cave, and filled with suspense,' kind of isolation. I mean the, 'Well, that's where the wall ends, because the designers couldn't just repeat a bloody rock texture,' kind of isolation. And when you fight enemies, there's no backdrop or really any animation to it. When you travel down stairs or out of towns, there's a neat pixellated background animation for that. Couldn't the designers have done something to make the battles less... spontaneous-feeling? And add a bit of color to the battles? It just feels like lazy desing to me, that's all.  So, finally, it comes down to story. I'll dedicate this entire blank space to the substance of Breath of Death VII's story in these paragraphs -&gt; ( ). So, yes, there's basically no story. You find a ghost, you go on random adventures! Something about crystals! I think! The story ambles where it wants to go (and, for the most part, is relatively linear)- but heavily caters to the heavily game-reference-laden dialogue. I believe every conversation I had with every character had some sort of other video game reference. And a few made me laugh. Such as the little conversation Dem (by the way, Dem Bones? I laughed at that name when I first saw it.) had with Sara- where he just looked at her, and she said 'I'm fine'- and the game announced my relationship with Sara went up 10 points. I hadn't laughed so hard before in a game. However, the rest of the references in most of those conversations made me realize a sort of... predictability in the game. It goes from reading clever, witty dialogue to a game of 'Spot that Reference!', where the entire conversation hinges on some Zelda II 'I Am Error' joke.  I don't hate Breath of Death VII, much like I don't hate broccoli. But if you invited me to a dinner party and offered me sweet corn or broccoli? I'd pick the sweet corn, because I prefer the taste. But I wouldn't look at you strangely if you took the broccoli. Just as I don't think anyone who buys Breath of Death VII is mentally challenge. For a game made by two people, it's decent. It just happened to balance a bit to the 'I don't quite like it' side of my video game scale.
7016	0	a	Imagine, if you will, a sitcom. It's a sitcom about a topic you really like, so you check it out. You know these sitcoms where the laugh track is the only indication that something funny just happened? This is like one of these sitcoms, only without the laugh track. The title is by far the funniest part of this game. There are lots of jokes or, more accurately, things the devs thought would pass as jokes. The formula seemed to be as follows: - Take classic JRPG trope. - Put said trope in the game, with a note saying 'think of funny subversion later'. - Get bored and work on something else. The game ends up playing straight all of the things it's supposed to subvert, with a few schoolyard level jokes tacked on where there was space.  Now, imagine watching said sitcom (why are you doing that again?) with a controller in your hand. Imagine that every few seconds, the image freezes, and the only way to continue watching is to press the 'A' button between four and seven bazillion times. 'Silly me', you exclaim. 'I forgot to turn on the difficulty!' So you press the difficulty button on your remote, and you find out that you are already on the highest possible difficulty. You start the game over on 'easy', thinking that maybe there's a bug where the highest difficulty is actually the easiest one, and indeed, switching to easy has a significant advantage: You only have to press 'A' between four and  six  bazillion times because the enemies have lower health now. Anyway, save for boss battles, the difficulty is of virtually no consequence. You have lots of fancy special moves to use in fights, a combo count to build up, mana points to manage, which is all fabulous except for the complete lack of a bloody difference it makes. There's just no incentive to get into all these intricacies of the battle system when you fare just as good spamming your basic attack over and over. After each battle, your health is fully restored, so it doesn't even matter how often you're hit, as long as at least one member of your party survives.  'Well then', I hear you say, 'the battle system may be an unfortunate abomination of nature, but when I watch  Passions , I have to hit my telly every few minutes to get a clear image too, so that's okay as long as I can enjoy the story.' First off, go get a new television set. Second, to enjoy the story, there would have to be a story first. I haven't finished the game (in much the same way I didn't finish pouring that bucket of battery acid over there on my head), so maybe the story picks up somewhere after the two-hour-mark, but I doubt it. So far, it's been: 'You're a hero. Supposedly witty comment. Go east and kill something. Unfunny joke. Now go north and kill something else.' You get party members who are supposedly parodies of some kind. One wants to be a vampire! It's funny because everyone hates  Twilight ! Why aren't you laughing yet! Said party members provide the crucial addition of being able to push the 'A' button more often per round.  To summarize: I do not recommend buying this  sitcom  game. Want a funny video game? Go play Monkey Island. Want a nice, retro JRPG? Go play the first few Final Fantasy. They even have a few jokes in them, which is more than I can say about this. Want to donate two quid to charity? I guess this would count. I can't say anything about the bundled game, 'Cthulhu Saves the World', because frankly, when I think about 'playing' a second 'game' from the same people, that bucket of acid suddenly seems oddly appealing.  Just my two  cents  dollars, which I will never get back. - Betta George
7017	0	a	I don't know what I expected :/
7018	0	a	I wouldn't recommend this game as it is exactly the same as 'Cthulu is a Hero' except Cthulu is better. This one has less features and it's unclear why you are doing most things other then just 'because'. It is always very cheap which is nice and it has that classic RPG feel but, it also is very trope filled and it isn't as sarcastic about as Cthulu is. Buy Cthulu, not this game.  3/10
7019	0	a	A mediocre RPG littered with admittedly humorous references to better games. The humor doesn't quite make up for the horrendous level design, poor art direction, banal combat, and shoddy storytelling. I was finally killed by something an hour in, and didn't feel like loading my save file back up again. Overall, a fairly boring experience.
7020	0	a	I picked up the game a while back because I heard good things about it, and it was incredibly cheap. Unfortunately, the only thing the game has going for it is the dialogue - and there isn't much of it. There are no towns or NPCs after about the halfway point, so what started out as a witty parody of the RPG genre ended with a bunch of incredibly lengthy and boring dungeons that really highlight many of the design flaws the game has. Combat is unbalanced, each character only has one or two attacks worth using, dungeons are basically time wasting walks since there are no puzzles or objects to interact with, etc.   It was incredibly promising for the first hour or so, but it felt like the developer got lazy and/or ran out of ideas, which is pretty ridiculous considering it took me less than 4 hours to beat the game. It's a cheap pickup. but I just can't recommend it due to how much of a chore it became. Really hoping Cthulu Saves The World feels more like a complete game.
7021	0	a	I really draaaagged myself though this one, but I did play it through after it sat in my library for a while.  Design-wise, it's boring. The game's pretty much entirely linear, unless you want to take a long route to a treasure chest you can see across the way, which is just drudgery after a good while. The towns are practically all the same, with the same NPC's selling slightly better equipment... I guess they nailed that RPG trope. Woo. The dungeons are long halls with the occasional turn or dead-end. Really thrilling stuff there. Very few things in the game world are interactable with, which means the handful that are manage to be surprises when they shouldn't be.  The writing's a bore. The references are just blah while the attempts at humor are worse. The characters are just RPG archetypes wearing spooky monster costumes, teasing at crappy romance plots that hardly skirt amusing. The plot is forgettable; the bookends of the intro fmv 'Many years ago...' and the outro fmv 'insert spoiler here* contain bewteen them effectively no plot content. It's just, 'Hey let's adventure. Next town. dungeon. cavern. next town... yadda yadda.' Sprinkle in some boss battles that have virtually no weight in the plot, and that's it. Some of this curiously plotless content mocks itself, while at the same time not really managing anything better. It's kind of sad that way.  As far as retro RPG's go, this one presented only one surprising concept, the ability to customise your characters' abilities and stats on level up. Granted, *every* modern RPG does that, so that's uh... nice, I guess.  Yes, I got this game for nearly free when it was on sale, and yes, I invested time to beat it. But no, no, no, do not waste your quarter or your life on this.
7022	0	a	Witty little game but a bit simplistic. Would love to recommend it but I can't, it just isn't fun.

7024	0	a	The game is a parody of older RPG's, but it's not particularly clever or funny about it aside from a few one-liners. It mostly just uses that label as an excuse to put little effort into the plot, which is a real disappointment given how many RPG parodies manage to actually be entertaining while mocking the genre's cliches.  The game's real strong suits are its combat and levelling system. On each level up, you either pick between two or four stats to increase or two versions of an ability, allowing you to specialize each character. The combat is suitably tactical on hard, though the random encounters will become incredibly grating and tedious and you'll rarely reach the encounter cap. Whether you win or lose has more to do with whether enemies manage to hit the same character or use hit-all attacks than your own foresight.  If the selling points appeal to you, then go play any of the countless games made in RPG Maker that do them better for free.
7025	0	a	This game have one big promblem, it's boring (it's just my subjective opinion) Graphics: 0K, i like 16 bit graphics i can't recommend this and i can't don't recommend this. if do you like retro rpgs, like a pokemon, with 16bit graphics. than recommend yo this game but if you don¨t like the things that i said, i can¨t recommend it to you.
7026	0	a	I had a short bash at this and all-in-all its ok. It feels a bit like a demo in the middle of being made due to the lack of actual detail (such as the un-embelished fight screen) and the fact that it gives you an introduction to a game then puts you in without any backstory or an idea of why your doing this. Overall I woldn't reccomend but i'll play it some more anyway because im wierd like that. Also because i bought it with 'Chuthulu Saves The World' for less than 30p so I want to make sure I haven't wasted some spare change that i found down the back of the sofa on something worse than 'Tree Simulator 2014'.
7027	0	a	Honestly, there isn't much reason to play this game. The characters are not developed, an unoriginal story, jokes that are not very funny with just a few references here and there. Also the most important, the combat system, is prety bad. After just a little bit of grinding it all comes down to how fast you can press Enter on your keyboard. Even in boss fights!   Don't waste your money on this when you can find much better games for free. 3.2/10

7033	0	a	My Rating: 3/10  The story was okay,but was a bit made up as you go. This is my first Zeboyd game, and I have heard they are not always set in a realm of seriousness.  The game appealed to me at first because of it's Dragon Questesque appearance. Admittedly, I did enjoy it starting out, but the more time I put into it, the more tedious everything became. Battles were boring, the maps were unimaginative and very movement restrictive, and the towns seemed to serve no purpose other than a place to get mana and shop. (Villager commentary was mostly useless.) I just wanted it to end. I only beat it because I was near the end and didn't want it to end up as 'just another game I haven't finished.'  The game was not entirely faulty. I did enjoy the skill system, it made you think about your play style and what skills may be more beneficial in the long run. Also, as much as I dreaded random encounters, boss battles were fun, requiring quick thinking to take down the boss before his strength multiplier became too high.  I personally believe that there are better games out there, but if you want an RPG to play that is cheap (especially on sale, think I got this and Cthulu as a bundle for less than two bucks,) then give it a shot, but be forewarned; unless you like grindy and unnecessarily long dungeons, look elsewhere.

7035	0	a	Starts off strong but pitters away very fast. Feels like an actual RPG set to the speed of half minute hero; given attacks are fast, you heal to full after every fight, and you can save at any time.
7036	0	a	I'm sure if you follow a guide on how you're required to play you can have fun, but if you don't follow one you're going to have a broken save very easily, depending on what you pick when you level up will decide weather you breeze through the game or become stuck so hard that you need to start a new game, unfortunately I became stuck so hard that I would need to start a new game if I wanted to finish and thus had to quit after 5 hours of playing.  Regular attacks do very little damage, making mana consuming abilities required for fights that aren't ten levels below you, I eventually found myself without enough mana to survive a single fight in the middle of a dungeon. I reccomend you take mana increasements whenever avalible.
7037	0	a	This is very much in the same style as 'Cthulhu Saves the World', both in terms of gameplay and storytelling. Unfortunately, that means you have to love grinding through an area until you've killed enough of the same monster to move onto the next area, which will require you to repeat the grinding pattern to move onto the next area, and so forth, and so on.
7038	0	a	When first playing the game, the best aspect makes it's appearence quickly: The humor.  Cthulhu is a real anti-hero who grumpily tries to save the world and he has a lot of funny dialogue throughout the game. The fact that he looks so uninviting also leads to a lot of awkward situations amongst the townsfolk, resulting in a lot of clever jokes. Along the way, he will also make allies who contribute in their own way, such as his obsessed groupie that sees him as the most charming person ever while he couldn't care less.  During the combat, every monster has their own description with some funny line added to it. Townsfolk will usually react to whoever you chose to bring along. The dialogue between the characters are also my kind of tea, with lots of arguing and misunderstandings.   The sprites in the game are for the most part well done. They can get somewhat repeatetive in the dungeons, making it a bit hard to remember exactly where you are. The rooms can look way too samey at times, so I have gotten lost in many dungeons, unable to find my way back to the outside.   I thought the music was very good. It has the right atmosphere for each and every part they take in. I especially liked the male choir chanting inside the dungeons, adding a mysterious atmosphere to them. The town music is very calming and relaxing to listen to.  I like that the dungeon chests actually contains good items. In other games, you literally risk your life for a potion that doesn't even restore half of what you lost to get to it. Here, you can get impressive upgrades and lots of money. It made treasure hunting worthwile and fun.  The armor and weapon menus could definately have been polished. Comparing items is quite clunky, with you being unable to compare stats side by side. Anytime you buy an armor or weapon, the shopkeeper says 'Thanks!' and throws you back to the option whether you want to buy or sell. It would have been better to be able to stay on the page you just purchased something.   There is one huge flaw with this game unfortunately. And it is the combat system.   Anytime the party has taken a turn, whether damaging the enemy or healing themselves, the monsters gets an increased percentage of damage. This number is quite high, around 10%, which builds up extremely fast. This forces you to use your strongest and fastest abilities, as otherwise you are going to end up in an endless die/revive loop where the monsters will get stronger while you can't keep up reviving your party members that gets slayed within one or two turns.   It also leads to making many spells and abilities useless, since you don't have time to use them. One of my characters has so many spells that she never gets time to use. And it's not just one or two, she has about 6 different spells which basically spells 'Game over' for me if I even concider using them. Their damage output is just too weak to compete with the monster damage output. So each and every fight, I am constantly casting the same powerful spell. It unfortunately leads to a lot of scrolling in the menu, as usually these spells are learned much later. So you have lots of useless abilities and spells clogging your menu, which you have to scroll through each and every time you want to use an ability or spell. I haven't found any way to sort the abilities and spells, which would have been greatly needed.   As the combat is completely text based, there is also a huge lack of action on the screen. The monsters will just implode on themselves when they die and there's not even a picture of your members on the combat screen. Only when you make the choice to attack do you see their faces. Then the monsters just flashes when they take damage. The combats are very boring to watch, though thankfully you can scroll through the combat text quite quickly, ending some battles in seconds.  After playing this, I understand why they have a system which fills your characters HP to max afte every encounter - otherwise they would never survive in this game! The game really shows you no remorse once the monsters have taken a couple of turns. Forget being tactical, you simply don't have the time to waste. Forget about wanting to use a different spell than the fire one. If fire does 200 more damage than ice, you have to stick to fire. Each and every encounter.   To me, the combat system feels like a filler into a very short game. I love the humor, I love advancing through the story and reading the dialogue. But at the eight hour mark, thinking about combat makes me groan. Same old spells over and over. No thanks.   After eight hours of the game, I only enjoy it due to the humor and dialogue. But at this point, the combat system is so offputting that I am literally forcing myself to finish the game. So I honestly wouldn't recommend this to anyone. It all boils down whether I would recommend the game based on the story and seeing as the dialogue only happens after encounters, then it will be a no.
7039	0	a	An important thing first: This is not a bad game and it is worth its money, since it's pretty cheap. However, an even more important thing is the question: Is this game worth your time? And now after having finished it, I would say 'No'. In general this is a little RPG, resembling the old SNES-RPGs or games from the RPG-Maker, in terms of gameplay and graphics. You wander around, engage in some random fights (which become pretty repetetive), go through dungeons and level up. The Main Character is Cthulhu who wants to have his power back and the only way to achieve this is to become a hero (instead of destroying everything, which would be what he is used to normally). Well this sounds funny and some of the dialogues you will encounter are funny too, but I never really laughed about them and at some points the jokes seemed a bit forced. Well the humuour mostly is nice, some clichees of games are ridiculed and your companions will sometimes drop some nice one-liners too. And 'nice' pretty much sums up this game: it's just nice, overall mediocre. Besides the original starting point of the story the game isn't special in any way.  Maybe if you happen to be one of the rare cases of people who really do not have one single game left to play, you may pick this one up and play it. I started it and as a result finished the game. I didn't have a bad time playing it, but the 7 hours could have been spent much more wisely.
7040	0	a	Repetitive gameplay. The game is a standard JRPG built around humor, Cthulhu, monsters, satire, irony, whatever you want to call it, it can only go so far, but if you're making players walk through lengthy mazes that aren't challenging, but time consuming, then the game time isn't worth the cutscenes. I think if this were a little funnier I would be ok with watching a video of all the non battle parts of the game. The bosses aren't even fun. Bosses are supposed to be challenging and fun.   This game isn't terrible, it just isn't well rounded. No puzzles... It's hard to enjoy repeating battles over and over when that is all the game consists of. Perhaps if there were puzzles in the temples going on, it would break up and overlap with the turn based battles and make everything more fun, but you can make it through the whole game blindfolded, seriously just keep mashing A and keep walking in directions until you make it to the boss.  The game has some length, but if you don't care how it was made, don't turn the commentary on, it gets kind of annoying honestly.   Overall score: 4.0/10 (Not that it's not worth my $1, more that it's not worth my 4 hours... :/ )
7041	0	a	It's hilarious - the writers knew what they were doing.  Unfortunately, as a game it's just ♥♥♥♥. I would elaborate more on this, but I'm afraid it's impossible. It's just a 'press enter' simulator all the way, where you grow a beard fighting annoying trash mobs 90% of the time, being mugged every 3 steps you make. The boss and mini-boss fights are not better: you will most probably drop dead on the first try, but after understanding easy strategy against each of them you will pass without bigger problems. It's better to watch gameplay videos on youtube, I can't recommend anyone to play this. It's annoying and most of the time - boring.

7042	0	a	A parody of Lovecraft's masterpieces. It tries to be fun, tries too hard sometimes.  If you can bear with the spoiler amount in the title itself, I can summarize the topic as an evil thing loses its powers and tries to regain them by trying to be a nice guy once in a while. A santa with alzheimer, A mermaid with legs, A kitty who is actually an alien, and a hovering sword comes to his help. I did not finish the game yet, I am about to, but I dont think the other characters will be exceptions in terms of weirdness of the cast. Not really well thought or something, and mostly just interesting for the sake of being interesting. The story revolves around our hero, there are some 4th wall breaking moments etc. But actually let alone a few interesting lines in the graveyard, writing gets dull too easily.   Do we need such a title? Parody is basically a thing which is pointed towards too overrated things. At least that is what I am used to. Lovecraft is one of the milestones for western horror genre, if not one of the founding fathers. Nobody reads him too much, nobody mentions him too much, and in gaming, in movies, in books etc, actually if there is a thing, it is underrepresentation. So what is the point of taking a demigod from his book, and ridiculing him? I am not sure.  I am playing this with developer commentary. He seems like a fun guy. I enjoyed my time with him. And I actually think that this notes could be included in Narrator versus Cthulhu dialogue lines. A missed opportunity.  Music is mediocre. Good for a while, gets repetitive too fast. Does not get annoying. Nothing to shame upon, nothing to praise.  Okay, so what about gameplay. I am not that familiar with this kind of RPG titles, so my comments would be coming from a rookie in this genre. But I seriously dont think that having an algorithm as simple as the following for winning is a good sign:  -Press enter repetitively until all of your enemies die or one of your guys get about to die. -Heal, if there are more than half remaining, nuke two or three times. -Repeat.  RPG side is a bit lacking. With each level, you choose an ability out of two for each character. The maximum level is 30. So There are 2^30 'setups' for each character. This is not as good as it sounds, since most of the upgrades are just basic stat upgrades. Mechanics of the game is not well explained, I still did not understand what is making them insane is doing. I dont know whether water attacks work more against fire-like enemies. I am not sure what each Stat is doing, but I am only guessing. And enemy explanations are nothing more than 'witty-oneliners', so there are a lot of missing things here.  Other than that, getting interrupted by random encounters is just too disorienting for my tastes. I played Pokemon before, so I know that this is WAD, but I think experiencing this to the point of forgetting where was I in levels with labirynthine designs with no minimap, remembering it in some 10 seconds, then getting disrupted again... Till getting angry, is no good design.  There are potions. They resurrect or fully heal your party members. Especially for the Ape Princess, use of it is definitely needed. There are enough weapon finds out in the wild, so I did not spend almost any money. Imbalance? I think so.There is a 1UP mechanics which helps u to ressurrect at the same point....But I did not use it as well. Since it basically works like an autosave feature, but a limited one, so instead of using it, I just kept saving and reloading (savescumming) almost infinitely. Since most of the fights were pressing enter repeatedly, not saving does not help the feeling of thrill, only frustration. So 1up was a mechanism which is meaningless. Items were kinda ok, and they allowed flexibility in pressing enter countlessly strategies.  Most of the boss fights were just holding on type wars. Nothing is different except they got 20000 HP this time. Have 1 or 2 healer, nuke until done. A dumb but sadly a valid strategy for almost all of them.  If I were not obsessed about finishing the games I started, I would ve abandoned this borefest waaaay too earlier than this. I pushed myself to enjoy it, I am at about 8/10 of the game now, and I guess I will finish it in 1-2 days time. But I wanted to warn all fellow gamers that, times have changed, and being retro is not a virtue of its own. So I am writing this review after I became sure that this will continue like this.  Writing may be interesting for some, but if I want to read a good story, and only that, I should not be using Steam for that.
7043	0	a	Bought it for 89 cents,  I want my money back.
7044	0	a	The developer question marks around the game are pretty cool, they tell you what the devs intended to do, didn't do, couldn't do and why and provide context to how the game was made. This is my favorite feature of the game. Otherwise, I think it's average for a modern take on an RPG. I know I won't be able to finish it without feeling I'd be spending my time better with SNES and Chrono Trigger. That said, the developer commentary has kept my interest so far.
7045	0	a	Cthulhu Saves the World serves as a great tribute to classic JRPGs and the works of H.P. Lovecraft. It's funny. It's weird. It does what it sets out to do very well but it doesn't hold up quite as well when viewed simply as an RPG. Repetitive battles are to be expected but the combat does start to feel very sloppy as you progress through the game and realize that most of your moves will become obsolete. The story also does not do a lot to drive the player forward through the adventure. RPGs are time consuming... So in order to be worth your time investment, all the elements of an RPG (the combat, the characters, the story) need to work together to enrich the experience. Cthulhu Saves the World provides bits and pieces of fun but never really delivers a full and satisfying game. For a memorable retro RPG experience, it's best to look to classic titles such as Chrono Trigger and Super Mario RPG.
7046	0	a	This game got pretty good ratings in international reviews by both players and professionals. I like the Lovecraftian mythos, I like SNES style RPGs and I don't care whether it's indie or how good the graphics are, when the gameplay works. Therefore, I bought this game with some expectations. You certainly guessed it already: This game sucks hard! Or to be a bit more diplomatic: I really don't understand what's so great about this game. Sure, the idea is funny and maybe the story is interesting. But that's it! The combat is boring, tedious and repetitive. All you do the whole game is follow the linear story path, talk a little and fight. Oh, and there is the fighting. Did I mention that? Combat takes like 95% of the time, so it's really hard to get into any kind of story.  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!
7047	0	a	This game offers very little besides the wacky title.  What passes for a story is Cthulhu going around doing heroic things in his own way, which is sometimes something funny like saving innocent zombies from the thing controlling them but mostly things like returning a lost dog or healing an illness by finding magic water.   There is very little cast development, the characters stay mostly one dimensional and while the character concepts like a talking sword or an alien cat might seem interesting at first, very little is done with them.  The music is nothing worth remembering, not even the final boss theme was that catchy.  The dungeon design is bad, the only puzzles are barriers that can be opened with a button press and a falling/rising water level. The levels are designed to make the player get lost, probably to extend the short playtime, if you want to find the right way, take the path that looks the least like it will lead to progress.  Of course, the graphics are also nothing noteworthy, they go for a 'retro' pixel style, but this is just an excuse for being lazy with the graphics since they are nowhere near actually good looking detailed pixel art like:  http://i.imgur.com/buH9JjF.gif   The gameplay is one good aspect, you are often in danger of dying and all of your HP get's refreshed after each fight, even if a party member dies, thus making even a victory with only one fighter left standing worth it. The only thing to look out for between fights is the MP count, since it isn't completely replenished. This game also makes buffs and debuffs useful, even in non boss fights. You still have a lot of skills you rarely or never use though. The danger of loosing is sadly undermined by being able to save anywhere, although this might not be the case on harder difficulties.  Like any jrpg though, fighting get's tedious after some time and since there is little else worth looking at in this title, I suggest you avoid it.
7048	0	a	This just isnt my type of game but some people may like it
7049	0	a	The game looks decent, but sadly me and many others are having issues with the sound, there is no music playing and only a few sound effects are working.  The sound issues have been reported for a long time, and nothing has been done to fix it. 
7050	0	a	To start with the game is fun. Great humor, but the combat system gets very boring, very fast. You use the same 5 spells divided amond all your char more or less constantly, simply because it's the most effective. In a game like this, the combat system MUST be a lot of fun. But it's just to trivial. Avoid it, or get it dirt cheap.
7051	0	a	I though maybe the battles would look like penny arcade but I was sadly dissapointed and the maps are just tooo huge for nothing... not really what I was expecting and I am very dissapointed in this purchase ... I don't suggest to anyone to get this unless you havent played the other penny arcade games.
7052	0	a	Thankfully this is a rather short RPG because I don't see how anyone could tolerate it much longer than that. Pretty much every dungeon is exactly the same, big sprawling maze with random encounters and the occasional chest. The hardest thing about the game is finding the next level of the dungeon, really. Mobs generally aren't too tough and it's easy to be overpowered in this game. The bosses are kind of a joke; even the final boss took practically no effort at all. The story kind of stops caring about a quarter of the way through the game and there's no sense of atmosphere at all. It's not even that f funny, either. There's some jokes but they're far too infrequent for it to really be a comedy game. The last dungeon has a big difficulty spike which is a bit unwarranted but even then, hopping into an optional dungeon and then back into the last dungeon basically destroyed all the challenge I was having. It's just... bland. I don't like RPGs in general and only got this in a bundle, and it was short enough for me to not get bored of it, at least. I wouldn't call it 'bad' for what it is, but I certainly can't say it blew me away or anything.
7053	0	a	old feeling RPG like something from the NES days. its not my thing anymore if you like retro stuff like that pick it up.
7054	0	a	Usually games like this keep my interest for a long time but in this case I was a little dissapointed. The plot in this game is a bit bland and the pixel art wasn't amazing. All things put aside though I guess it was worth the thiry cents I paid for it
7055	0	a	This is pretty much a copy of Breath of Death VII, a game from the same guy(s). There are some improvements (especially puns), but other than that you are playing the same game again. Can't recommend it for that reason.   If you haven't played Breath of Death VII you might as well buy this one instead; it's a funny little rpg to waste some time with.
7056	0	a	Value for Entertainment: $0.75  Starts off pretty charming and funny, but then quickly becomes one-dimensional and boring. The gameplay is typical RPGMaker style bland turn-based combat, and there isn't enough story or character to really carry you through the repetitive dungeons and encounters.  Not a bad price for the amount of content, but the content itself is thin and shallow.
7057	0	a	The core gameplay suffers from information overload due to the minimalistic and text-heavy UI. While a little amusing, the writing wasn't super great, either. There were some innovations I respect, but it was a tiring experience.
7058	0	a	+ original characters + witty comentary that actually makes you laugh + pretty good storyline  - Gameplay is fun for a bit but gets too repetitive and labourious - Not much else to it  = Cheap fun and laughs but you'll get bored quickly
7059	0	a	Old school final fantasy gamepley, which is enjoyable to most, not really my cup of tea. However, Lovecraftian games are always my weakness. Sadly though, this game is not very Lovecraftian at all. Some familiar names pop up, and conditions like the 'Insane' effect try, but if you're looking for a good Call of Cthulhu-esque game, this is not it. Like I said, gameplay wide its pretty solid, with only some minor balancing issues. But story wise this games falls flat for me, and thats really what I was looking for in this single player experience.
7060	0	a	If this is what the legendary old RPGs were like, then I am happy, cuz I did not miss anything important by not playing them.  Con: - repetitive combat - meh story - dumb UI - gets old really quickly - only windows version  Pro: - some jokes are okay  I payed 31 EUR cents for it. Still feel that its overpriced. Anything more than free would feel overpriced.
7061	0	a	So, in hypocritical style, after recommending Breath of Death as a fun, satirical take on classic RPGs, I am NOT recommending Cthulhu Saves the World.   'Wouldn't a game whose premise involves the lord of annihilation and suffering plunged into the role of saving the world be worth a token recommendation because of its novel story line?' I can hear folks asking me. 'Wouldn't a game by the same developers as Breath of Death be similar?'   And the answer is a resounding 'YES' to both. Both games are nearly identical when it comes to level design, character progression, combat mechanics and funny/corny dialogue. I think the only difference is me - I'm clearly suffering from some sort of comedy RPG overload.   This game has been sitting in my queue, unfinished, for at least a year now. And everytime I try to pick it up again, I am immediately turned off by the repetitive combat, grossly oversized dungeons and scarce loot. I am just not ready for more of the same.   However, I still think the purchase of the bundle is COMPLETELY worth it. Maybe if you play Cthulhu Saves the World first, you'll have the experience I had playing Breath of Death (Read about it here:  http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197989795433/recommended/107300/) .
7062	0	a	A cute concept that was not fully explored.  The writing was good, but not plentiful. The combat was pretty standard. The leveling system was neat. The equipment system was too minimalist. A comparison to current gear would have been nice.  Can't quite recommend it.
7063	0	a	Story and dialogue aren't funny so it loses all weight there. Combat is weird and mostly unenjoyable. It didn't feel different from their other game at all so I knew I didn't have to play much to decide to keep going or not.
7064	0	a	Retro style can be charming and endearing. Or it can be a convient excuse to pass half-♥♥♥♥♥/bad art off as a style choice. Unfortunately this game seems to be the latter.   I chuckled a few times at the inside jokes in the openning segment, but the RPG elements are too dull/tired for me to endure to get to the only semi-humorous story.  3/10  (This is exactly the same review as I wrote for Breath of Death VII because they are basically the exact same game.)
7065	0	a	With so many classic 16-bit RPGs on Steam trying to capture the nostalgia of the 90s, it becomes difficult to discern the fun ones from the awful ones. This is one of the latter.  Gameplay is pretty self-explanatory for anyone who's played a turn-based RPG. The problem with this game is that it doesn't do anything particularly well to make it stand out from the crowd: generic monster types, humour that doesn't amuse, and a boring plot prevent this game from becoming what it could have been.
7066	0	a	Cthulhu Saves the World is an old school jrpg. The gameplay is pretty standard and those nothing really special. What tries to set it apart is it's story and humor. But that can be a hit or miss. It's oke if you are looking for a an old school jrpg and you can get it really cheap.
7067	0	a	First of all, I have to admit this is my very first time playing something like this, and I found out it's not my cup of tea. So if you're into retro 2D RPG games, this review won't be to your liking either.  Gameplay is pretty simple and the story does show a lot of fun. However, battles are overly simplistic and get rather repetitive pretty quickly. Story wise it's not very interesting. There is some funny interaction between the characters but I get the feeling it's merely the required minimum. The game is praised for it's humor. Let's get this straight: it's not hilarious. I didn't laugh, I didn't even snicker. It's just amusing. That's all. And not good enough to keep my attention/interest after the battles failed to do that as well. I guess it's similar to the situation when one types 'LOL' constantly without really 'Laughing Out Loud'.  Bottom line. If you're not into retro 2D RPGs you'll get bored. If you're into retro 2D RPGs maybe, just maybe and if you have pretty low expectations from a cheap game.
7068	0	a	I didn't play very long but I could tell after 10 minutes the game was repetitive and lacked depth.
7069	0	a	It is like the Breath of Death Vll. ➊ Not interesting... ➋ Old game... ↷  ...but the music is cool...)
7070	0	a	Game is boring and the combat is terrible.  (there are plenty of other, in-depth bad reviews about the combat, so I won't bother describing it here)
7071	0	a	its like if Deviantart users made a game. not fun; sucks; dont buy
7072	0	a	Cute but...
7073	0	a	I purchased it today and it doesn't work with Windows 10. The reason I buy games on Steam is because they should have them adjusted for the latest OS. Disappointed. They shouldn't sell games that the latest OS can't support. Also, the reason I use Steam is because I am not a computer tech and shouldn't have to be responsible for fixing the game to work with my OS.  I get the error message:  No suitible graphics card found?
7074	0	a	I mean it's cheap, but I expected to at least get a giggle out of it.
7075	0	a	good game on it's own system, but not so good on window 10 since it crashes all the time
7076	0	a	 Time of completion::  6 hours and 3 minutes  Date of writing the review:  04.March.2015  Difficulty I played at:  Easy  My YouTube channel:    link     My rating:  5/10 =========================== I want to start off by saying that never before this game have I played any sort of top-down game, let alone a top-down (old-school) RPG like this one, so I hold no nostalgia factor for games like this one. This is from the perspective of a man who has been PC gaming since 2002 (was 10 y/o) and is just introduced to this type of RPGs.  It's very difficult to give a good game a downvote, but even if everything else is done great, if your main mechanic (the combat) is done poorly, then the game loses all it's value and becomes bad and frustrating.  Let's begin with the praises first:  As I mentioned, most aspects of the game are done great, we will start off with the:   Visuals
7077	0	a	Boring and repetitive, overused and tired jokes.
7078	0	a	I like the humour in this game... but the game itself sucks. It's another Final Fantasy clone made with like rpgxp or something and they charge for that...  This game should be free on the web, I don't see the point of paying for this. Luckily, I only paid 50 cents, so no big loss. LOL  Don't buy this unless you know H.P. Lovecraft's universe.
7079	0	a	Don't buy this if you have a new computer running windows 8.  This game is only windows 7 compatible.  I blame microsoft for pulling the plug on the XNA framework project, XNA is only windows 7 compatible.
7080	0	a	I honestly can't take this game serously with even THE DEVELOPERS are not even fixing there mistakes because of their lazy excuses. There are many better Rpg's out there, but this one is just not one of them.
7081	0	a	Like an old JRPG but bad and not made by japanese people(prob the reason), leaves a bland taste in my mouth after a little bit.
7082	0	a	If you'd like to play an RPG that repeatedly breaks the immersion via breaking the fourth wall for the sake of a cheap joke, this is a good one to pick up on sale for a buck. That's really the only problem I had with the game, and it was enough to make it not a game for me.
7083	0	a	Aweful game. it someone gave you the game for free don't take it. it one of those cheap imatation games made with the 'RPG Game Maker'. it trys to imulate final fantasy (the early NES games) but it does a really poor job of it. not many pick up items. a few treasure chest. only saves in save lacations, but claims to save anywhere. you walk around and every no and then you stumble onto a 'Monster' to fight, usualy there are 3 to fight at one time. and each fight you use up your mana which you can only get back on a 'save' spot. you health does fully recover after you win a battle. if you lose you must either retry( from from the last save spot) or restart the game.  I bought this game bundled with another game for under $3,, i want my 3 bucks back...
7084	0	a	I was not a fan of this game, I know i should not have expected alot from a 98 cent ame but dont waste your money on this game
7085	0	a	Actually say when your game needs a controller to play.
7086	0	a	ouch.. This Game was recommended to me and given to me. I now have trust issues and feel ripped off. The sight of seeing this in my library keeps reminding me that steam needs both a red light and the ability to delete a game from my Library. The fact that people give this game mostly posative reviews must mean its eather one big troll or people have really lowered there standards.  0/10 Dont buy this horrible game. cons: -the level of detail reminds me of the old rpg maker vx -gameplay is long slow and sluggish -storyline is broken -dull coloring and to badly pixled  pros: -controller suport -reminds me of games i want to go play other then this one

7089	0	a	Crashes immediately after intro vid. 0/10. cannot play..
7090	0	a	this game is not for me...3/10.
7091	0	a	Final Fantasy round based strategy, the market is flooded with RPG maker hatched games like this and it really doesnt stand out.
7092	0	a	I don't want to write a negative review, as this game looks very promising, yet that is all. It LOOKS promising. I wouldn't know, as I wasn't able to play it. Everytime I launched, the game would initiate into it's cinematic backstory, and then right after the slide that says Cthulhu will return, the game stops working. I don't know if other people are having this problem, or not, but until then I can't tell anyone in good concious to buy this.
7093	0	a	Best game ever played would like to play Cthulhu saves the World 2 -10/10
7094	0	a	This game will mess up your steam bad and make it unresponsive. And the game wont even run.
7095	0	a	I have a couple of dozen games that were so bad I've created a garbage category (garbage is polite) and stopped playing them in minutes. Some I can't review since I haven't even put in the required 5 minutes they were so bad.  This one, I just couldn't get over how old/low the graphics are. And I'd say I'm an old school gamer.

7097	0	a	Both of these games uses the battle displays from ancient rpgs, think Earthbound, Shin Megami Tensei, or a numbered Phantasy Star (not online, the original games).   Both of them rely on pretty decent jokes, although Cthulhu, being the second game they made, takes the ham way higher, and as a result is mostly funnier. Even though you never see your charathers in the battle, its still pretty involving, with stat buffs and debuffs as well as mana preservation, although it isn't quite as stressful as the games it's actually based on.  The game helps you along with some major streamlining, especially in the inventory and telling you where to go next, although you can sequence break if you are willing to overlevel a bit.  Although if this is the first time you've played one of these in a while, the game will probbably seem monstrously difficult, especially with its unique health refill feature giving them an excuse to use a set monster encounter rate.  In all honesty, I think you should use PSN, GoG, wiiware, xbox arcade, ceirtain indie releases, a compilation game (I can think of several sega genesis sets that include three phantasy star games, not to mention other awesome things in other genres) to experience this sub-genre in pure form.
7098	0	a	I'll update my evalution later because i didin't played a lot this game.   To avoid crash game after intro viewing :  ==&gt; 'XNA Microsoft access violation error', &lt;==  you need to allow active on your system Windows Media Player.
7099	0	a	its a very boreing game. Maby if i was like 5 Reminds me of Old School Zelda but not as good..  If its on sale or your like seven and under it might be fun for you.. Keys are easy easy game to get use to. But it's soo slow.and when fighting it feels all the same.. So i would stay away if your older might not be the game for you. if you are a Zelda fan you will like it ,, But I'm sure if you get it on sale like i did for 99 cents well worth the 99 cents.
7100	0	a	tries too hard
7101	0	a	Unoriginal gameplay, uninteresting storyline, stale humour. I want to like this game but I just can't.
7102	0	a	Couldn't save anything.
7103	0	a	You get to play as Cthulhu. That's the only pro, and its just barely a pro, since that also means that you can be defeated, which...well...defeated Cthulhu's ideal purpose (which is to say, a mental assalant that cannot be killed and is barely seen. I'm very defensive over this as this game to me does Cthulhu wrong. Yes, there is a way to do him right and many games do it, but this one doesn't.)  Behold: its an 8-bit game. More and more I'm starting to find this art style to be absolutely lazy. You got games like No Mans Sky that exists with its amazing colors but this one? This one settles for blocks.  Right so its alot like Earthbound Zero. EBZ is very very hard, and is an RPG. CSTW is very very hard, and is an RPG.  So whats the big deal? Well, at least in EBZ there's a clear 'hey you're not ready for this area' line, in the form of the town Snowman, where you get terrifically powerful Wolves that you can't kill. Its its own area, right? But CSTW is like 'hey look you were fighing level 2's in this cave system, so here's a level 8 enjoy'  However, and this where the differences start: EBZ has a great story. This one does not. It came bundled with a second RPG in the same art style that I refuse to look at. Lovecraft fan or no, give this one a miss.  4/10
7104	0	a	The creators are wrong. You can not make a good RPG without a writer or an artist.
7105	0	a	This JRPG doesn't really do anything of value; while it does include some anti-frustration features, and pushes the difficulty curve fairly high, unfortunately on the whole the game is pretty much rote and boring; the storyline is weak, the game tries too hard to be funny and falls flat as a result, and it breaks the fourth wall constantly with very weak breaking-the-fourth-wall humor. An all around meh from me; you've played many better JRPGs, and there are many better games out there. This isn't worth your time.
7106	0	a	You cant alt-tab during cut scene Crashes if you press esc or enter during cut scene Crashes after shi.ttу cutscene Apparently you have to 'play' at least 5 minutes to write a review. This piece of sh.it game crashed at least 20 times during this 2 minutes that I was missing. Didnt even saw the menu because it constantly crashes. Piece of  sh.it/10   EDIT: apparently you need this rеtаrdеd player called 'windows media player' to be able to play this game. GOTY, cya  EDIT2: Registered WMP dlls, still crashes after reboot  EDIT3: 4 MONTHS passed, still not fixed. well, ♥♥♥♥ this game, seriously.
7107	0	a	It's one of the worst RPG's I have ever played.  I hate this game.
7108	0	a	**For people wondering, I beat this on both the android tablet and again on PC (offline, was overseas)**  Call of Cthulu Dark Corners of the Earth was a horror game, this was more like a cheap dragon warrior knockoff with hints of Cthulu as a splash of flavor ... a mere ruse of being called horror. The dialogue was poorly written, the story was laughable, and replayablility is nonexistant.  What could have been interesting and fun turned out to be nothing more than garbage.  I want to like this game, but simply cannot.
7109	0	a	its a pretty ♥♥♥♥ game tbh
7110	0	a	Very bad game if you can buy it for trading cards.
7111	0	a	While I appreciate the intention behind CStW, the humour fell flat for me and the gameplay-as-a-homage just served as a reminder of all the aspects of old school console RPGs that have been left behind for a reason, even considering the modern day improvements included. More hardline nostalgics might get more out of it but even at it's crazy price point I don't feel like the time investment is worth it.
7112	0	a	Can't take that game seriously, feels like story was written by a 14 year old.
7113	0	a	this is very similar to Breath of Death but with a few new features- you can fly and teleport around the world and swap around which characters are active per fight. They've also improved the graphics a little, but the story and characters just aren't as good as Breath of Death's. Wandering around a quirkily rebuilt post-apocalyptic world with a girl ghost hopelessly enamored with a mute depressive skeleton was more fun than this game's cascade of pop horror/cat owner references and boring protagonist.  As with Breath of Death, there are a lottttt of pointless battles and exploring that are a pain to get through. But my biggest gripe is that while Breath of Death's boss battles were fantastic and the one really enjoyable part of that game, Cthulhu's bosses are lame. It's very easy to build one set of characters for disabling/aoes (for trash mobs) and another set for groups heals/combo builds (for bosses), which (at least on Medium) made every single fight in the game a breeze.
7114	0	a	Painfully cheesy dialog. Ho-hum level design and battle system. Mildly charming and interesting artwork. Overall, nothing special about this old school JRPG except a kinda neat level up mechanic where each level the player is presented with a choice that affects character progression. For example, choose between gaining a lightning spell that does light damage to 3 random enemies or a lightning spell that does heavy damage to one enemy. Played through about 40% of the game before I quit from boredom.
7115	0	a	If game not starts on Windows 7/Windows 8. I found solution: 1. Install XNA 4.0. 2. Enable Windows Media Player in Windows Features. 3. Reboot. 4.

7116	0	a	i have no idea what i'm doing
7117	0	a	Nothing makes Lovecraft roll in his grave more than this game. I got it, expecting it to actually be clever, but soon found myself wallowing in misery and disappointment. It's supposed to be humorous, but the humor boils down to making silly faces and putting Cthulhu into only mildly ridiculous situations. There's a bit of fourth wall humor, but it's far from adroit. In addition, his out of character reactions only left me cringing. This is a god who makes people insane just by being seen, but here we have him idly chatting with mermaids. It's not funny, it's a failure to draw comedy from an emasculated creature of pure destruction. It's saddening that the only way they could conceive of a Lovecraftian comedy was to completely change the very fabric of what the elder gods are. The only relation this game actually has to Lovecraft's works is in name alone. You could name all of the characters and places differently, it would still be the same game.  Gameply-wise, it's as bare bones as an RPG can get. There are no mechanics we haven't seen since the 80's. Every battle can be won by mashing the fight button, and there's a good chance you won't have to grind either. Some of the maps are too long, and the encounter rate will have you groaning over the tedium of having fought this same enemy fifty times in the past twenty minutes. I explored most (I say most because toward the end I just wanted to finish and be done with it) of this game's maps, and there are very few secrets to encounter. In fact, there's very little to the game besides the main quest. There's a few game modes to unlock, but I haven't bothered playing them because of how soul crushing the main game is.  If you're an appreciator of Lovecraft's work, or if you think comedy should be witty, or if you like innovative RPG mechanics, this is not the game for you. You're better off spending your money on a hamburger, at least it won't leave you starving and depressed.
7118	0	a	Cthulhu Saves the World is an old-school JRPG, and by old school, I mean they ditch all modern innovations, ideas and sensibilities the have accumulated over the years. Which is the point, sure, but it just doesn't add up to much these days, unfortunately. The quirky humour occasionally hits its mark and the characters are, at first, a bit more interesting than the usual JRPG trope characters. However, there doesn't seem to be any more to them except the very superficial quirkiness.  Gameplay is the usual old-school JRPG stuff. That is grind. Lots of monotonous grind. In the most baffling design decision I've encountered in a while, your party is completely healed after a won battle, but your mana is not restored. It might not sound so bad, until you realise that without Techs and Magics, your party is consistently and constantly getting beaten. So now you either:   A) have to backtrack to a place where you can restore your mana or  B) win fights without using mana. Which is not happening, not after the first area or so.  Granted, the ability to save anywhere and start random fights almost anytime from the party meny are appreciated, but in the end you still feel like you are wasting your time. The jokes, characters and settings are interesting enough to hold your interest for an hour or two, but eventually the monotony of the gameplay and the frustration of the difficulty curve eat away at your enjoyment.

7120	0	a	I bought this for 1.29. It should be listed for that. Besides a few laughs here and there, this really isnt my cup of tea
7121	0	a	  Complete Rating: 2/10     Visuals: 1/10  Audio: 2/10  Story: 4/10  Gameplay: 2/10   Cthulu Saves the World plays like a bad copy of a random RPG-Maker game, the game is slow, not funny, badly made overall. The story doesnt make up for all the lacking stuff. If you're some kind of Cthulu Follower who prays every night, then this might be for you, everyone else, , do not touch .
7122	0	a	im not gonna say mutch, just that it was boring for me and the jokes were kinda to in for me, some may enjoy it though
7123	0	a	Requires Windows Media Player to play it. Not worth it.
7124	0	a	No, I do not recommend this game. I bought it thinking it would be so great but in reality I got ♥♥♥♥ed over see I was about and hour and a half into this ♥♥♥♥ game when all of the sudden I died and it ♥♥♥♥ing restarted from THE BEGINING it's horse ♥♥♥♥ is what it is but over all before the game ♥♥♥♥ed the dog I did enjoy it and the old nes feel was great until the game ♥♥♥♥ed over. I fought a boss fight and it didn't even load me back there like what the ♥♥♥♥...
7125	0	a	Not as funny as it thinks it is. Pretty much a standard JRPG boiler.
7126	0	a	Ugly (even by SNES standards) uninspired graphics. Funny ironical storyline. Better play a  Final Fantasy  episode on SuperNintendo!
7127	0	a	I didn't know you could sell rpg maker games on steam, maybe i should make some garbage and put it up here too.
7128	0	a	To paraphrase my other review of Breath of Death VII (same developer)--  'Okay, but not really worth the time. CStheW is funny, but would have been better as a comic strip. Go play a real RPG, or play outside!'  I think I spent a lot of time on this because I'm a completionist, and a fan of the Cthulhu mythos. But in hindsight, naw man.
7129	0	a	god this game is awful please dont play i want you to live
7130	0	a	Not worth your time, it's nearly impossible on the hardest difficulty, I've only gotten to the first boss on the hardest and it took way too long.
7131	0	a	I like a lot of Zeboyd's games, but this particular game is like the caterpillar before it emerges from the cocoon. For a much better experience, with better enemies, combat, and most importantly, pacing, then try their take on the Penny-Arcade games instead.
7132	0	a	Not as much fun but ... 3/10
7133	0	a	What sort of message is this sending our children? That Cthulu ISN'T a source of evil? I've banned my kids from reading Lovecraft, as I don't want SATANIC MESSAGES preached to my beloved. Imagine my surprise when I came home to my son scrawling CTHULU IS LOVE CTHULU IS LIFE onto the walls in my hallway. I'll see you in court
7134	0	a	Only for die-hard fans of the genre. Repetitive, meaningless to me.
7135	0	a	This game was painfull to play. I sort of expected that from the price and screenshots but I thought I would give it a shot anyway and I was sourly disapointed. I got to level 20 by spamming the enter key during all fights, speaking of the fights they have tried to do the same thing as Pokemon (And I'm sure a lot of other RPGs) Where all you need to do is walk to find a fight. But who wants to spam the enter key 50 times, every 30 seconds of playing a game? At least in Pokemon you had to walk in long grass... All the dungeons look exactly the same and the whole layout of everything (Menus, battlescreen layout and anything that you need to interact with at all really), are a mix of pointlessness and confusion. I mean, why is 'Chat' an option on the main menu? It would make sence if it was an online rpg, but all it triggers is the same conversation with an npc/party member, over and over again. Don't get me wrong I could never make a game at all and for that i respect the efforts that must of gone into this game, but it just wasn't fun to play. At all. I disliked the whole half an hour that i played this. I wanted to find quality in this game but when I couldn't I decided to look into other games of the same producer and I found that 'Breath of Death' was almost exactly the same. The same layouts, the same everything with an exception to a few different enimes and npcs. I was pretty much playing the same game, so it gets a strong No from me. Do not recommend.

7139	0	a	Aight
7140	0	a	I'm glad I got it on sale. I'll say that much.  I wanted to like this game. I'm admittedly a pretty big Lovecraftian nerd, and I appreciated the humorous nods towards the mythos. That's...more or less the only positive thing I can say about this game.  The story is garbage, from what little of it I've seen. The gameplay is in a generic turn-based RPG style. The map design is absolutely horrendous. Any stretch of any area looks exactly the same as every other. The tongue-in-cheek humor gets old. Very, very old. The game breaks the fourth wall in the introduction, and proceeds to do it constantly. To an annoying degree. The same jokes that were hardly funny the first time are repeated over and over ad absurdum. It felt like a chore just playing it.  If all of this sounds attractive to you, by all means. Get the game when it's on sale, or something. But I wouldn't recommend paying the full price for it.
7141	0	a	Spoiler in the title ruined my experience
7142	0	a	Tried to get into contact with the author on Twitter asking for help to complete the game. Apparently, there is none and developer has not been helpful in whatsoever ways.
7143	0	a	I mean, it's ok.
7144	0	a	Rpg maker.  Kinda wasted my money.   4/10
7145	0	a	  If you like badly written anime fanfics where most of the characters are mostly 1-dimensional tropes, sprinkled with some LOLSORANDOMness, taking place in the average RPGmaker 'My First RPG' stereotypical world, then you'll love this. If you like originality and not playing a game where the combat is subpar while the characters are either mostly non-memorable or annoying abnoxious, then you'll dislike the game.  Not a terrible game, but definitely not a good one. It feels like something a high schooler would make after binge-watching too many old anime series and hearing about 'The Call of Cthulhu' from one of his friends, thinking the character was meme-worthy enough to create an entire game around. The worst part is that Cthulhu is not anything interesting in this game, as he has been turned into 'Standard Anime Protagonist' with the twist of being somewhat evil/sassy. Think of the protagonist from the anime series 'The Devil Is a Part-Timer!' and you've practically got this character, but with some more sassiness and less inclination to have sex with the woman who is begging for his D.  2/10, would not recommend.
7146	0	a	30/100
7147	0	a	Gets a little repetitive, but if you like an arcade type game, it might be your cup of tea.
7148	0	a	I just found this to be boring and repetitive. The dialogue was funny, though.
7149	0	a	From the start, it looked better than it's predecessor, BoD VII. That's probably the reason behind all those positive reviews on Steam and anywhere else. It looks like SNES JRPG, and it has Cthulhu. AND it breaks the fourth wall like two minutes into the game! 9 out of 10! Both the Cthulhu mythos and the JRPG genre are so clichéd they beg to be parodied. Unfortunately, just throwing both into the mix isn't enough to make it amusing for more than half an hour. The game itself has so many little flaws left from BoD VII it makes itself a painful experience instead of a little amusing joke. It's probably worth the 23 cents I've spent on it, but not the time spent.
7150	0	a	While I absolutely love the cheesy premise, the game very quickly devolves into an extremely boring and frustrating routine of a random encounter for every 4 steps you take. You really can't carry enough recovery items to last, and fighting the exact same monster combo the 50th time within the same area is not my idea of fun.  In this case, being less faithful to the more frustrating tropes of very early JRPGs would have made the product much better.
7151	0	a	Enjoyd playing i silver and gold, after that u're playing vs peaople with aim bots and communucating telepaticly, not cool
7152	0	a	Status effects doesn't show up on enemies so I can't plan my fights properly (like focusing on the monster which isn't blinded). This is enough to turn me off the game.
7153	0	a	Some jokes are ok but story is lacking and consists of going to the next town and then repeat. While on towns, NPC dialog is almost inexistant. Should have been focused more on dialogs and less in combat. For example you will read almost no text while on dungeons, and very little on towns. After the first three party members everyone else joins because why not?  The combat system is atrocious: groups of ten enemies spawn and you have to spam All-damage abilities to damage all these enemies at a time. Eventually you can hit attack all the time and, most of the time, it works. And this goes on and on for almost every dungeon battle except for the final boss. Some times there is a tank enemy but that's all. It is a pity because these leaves lots of skill as useless: the game forces you to use the most powerfull skill for hitting one enemy and the most powerfull for hitting all enemies while fighting regular monsters.  Enemies will ALWAYS attack first because of their higher agility and you will end up attacking after them. Combat is so unbalanced that after every battle you get a refill of your health points! It would have been more sensible to make it work so the player did have to pay attention to his health points while on a dungeon. Instead of it, you only have to pay atention to it while on combat.  Enemy sprites are totally random: crabs, starfishes and then ¿goblins? on the beach where you begin. Suddenly it all makes sense: there are literally tons of enemies, very few of them having to do with Lovecraft. ¿Unicorns? ¿Centaurs? ¿Zombie cheerleaders? ¿DINOSAURS? They are there to add numbers, and they soon become indistinct.  Every dungeon size is massive. And dungeon layout is random: every dungeon is a labyrinth with very plain decoration, and exploring is oftenly not rewarded, so you go to a dead end and... go back. Game engine allows to makes bridges, so there are bridges going to dead ends! Duh. Basically every dungeon is the same.  User Interface is not very practical: when a character dies, all character 'windows' get red, instead of only the one who actually died. Also it gets green while on medium health. Equipment menu forces you to go again for equipping a second item.  Both endings (good and bad) are mixed into, one making no sense even if you read the developer comments. Sadly, I finished this game and I don't even have an achievement to brag about it.
7154	0	a	I want to like this game, except it crashes after playing the first cutscene. I emailed the developers. After 4 months without a response, i figured it was useless
7155	0	a	The concept was appealing but I don't think it worked out well in this games case. The humor is a bit too try-hard for me and the battles became repetitive quickly along with their themes. The dungeons were just big mazes with too many random battles to remember where you were going imo. So yeah, I only finished the game bc I'm a completionist.  In short it's not the whacky horror parody rpg I hoped for...
7156	0	a	The game is retro and worth a laugh (or three, if you are familiar with the works of HP Lovecraft). However, there's only one plot and it's pretty linear. Only the choice of companions has some effect on the gameplay.
7157	0	a	CLR20r3 crash after intro, even tried install windows media player that I learn from forums people meet the same problem, still not working. So not recommend.
7158	0	a	This game is funny and has its moments but I put not recommended because theres too much rpg walking, the maps aren't obvious to navigate, its designed to be difficult to remember so you get lost multiple times doing something simple, some of their jokes are at lacks of good content or distractions from actual story, and its not obvious that you can walk under bridges or ramps so you back track repeatedly wondering if you missed something. And even then its alot of the same old boring tiles. Buy it if you like free rpg games that are poorly made. I mean it has novelty yeah but when theres other games I can play I don't wanna waste my time here that often walking back and forth five times lost.
7159	0	a	First thing you'll notice with this game is the need to turn off all bloom, effects, and everything, so you can see what the heck is going on. Second thing will be the terrible controls. Third thing will be how utterly random everything seems to be (what enemies spawn when, where, and everything in between).  Add to that how the game will berate, or downright insult you when it thinks you're not using the stupid 'slowmo' that gets you killed more often than it saves you (because making things slower won't change the bad controls or how much inertia they decided the game needed) often enough, and quite frankly, I really can't recommend this exercise in frustration.  I'm sure I could get better with more practice. I'm also sure it wouldn't be particularly fun to do so.
7160	0	a	Game menu looks wierd, key bindings do not work, the actual screen to show the key bindings is messed up, once you go into the water, you cannot get out, it seems, this is an entirely broken game
7161	0	a	I've fell for recomendations but tbh this game is boring as hell. No campaign mode, no upgrades, there are LOTS of better twin stick shooters on PC. This one is pure garbo
7162	0	a	Launch at startup.  - Worked at first, but tabbed out to close other applications that I didn't need. - Tried to get back in the game, but was no longer responding and proccessing was at 0%. - Tried launching again, freezes at startup. - Tried guides by developer, or adding to ask the following questions because none of his methods was working, but obviously he declined. - I'm not smart with game developing, but this needs further development.   Also, my current res. is 1366x768  I want a refund for now.
7163	0	a	This game is only good if you can buy it for less than the price of geometry wars: retro evolved. GW:RE outclasses it in so many different ways: better bomb system, better combo system, and better enemies; but, the problems that this game has can be easily fixed with one or two balance patches, but the devs seem to want to use their time putting in community reccomendations for game modes and ♥♥♥♥ instead of fixing these.   Some specific gripes:  Bombs are terrible. They are never usefull when you can get them, unless you can kill a bunch of virus in a small period of time, because the enemies that you killed to get the combo to get the bomb were probably all the enemies in the bomb's radius.   Enemies are unbalanced. The clustery things that turn red when you shoot them are a direct upgrade from the 3 little ball things, but they sacrifice speed for survivability: this means that it takes so much more effort to kill them than it does to kill literally any other enemy other than cubes. The green ball things that dodge your bullets are absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t; you could be in a perfectly fine position, then 4 or 5 of these ♥♥♥♥ers spawn in, and suddenly you have to use all of your slowmo to kill each of them individually, and if you miss, you have to resort to killing them outside of slowmo, which poses the same problem as the clustery things- you're using more and more effort to kill something that shouldn't take that much.   Enemies use too much rng to spawn. Enemies in this game spawn in seemingly completely random patterns, and take .5-1 seconds to spawn; this means that if you're being overwhelmed in a game and one or two dudes spawn right next to you, you either have to use your slowmo to move out of there, or you instantly die, and you've probably already used your slowmo to survive being overwhelmed.   Cubes have too much health for their size and impact on the game. The cubes in this seem good on paper, but when implemented, are absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing broke as ♥♥♥♥ in practice. They have the same problem as those other ones I put down, with taking too much effort to kill, exept these ones seriously punish you for not having the answer to them right when they come into play; they need to spawn in when you're in a position to get a bomb fast, otherwise you have this huge death-square coming for you and you can't deal with it without leaving every other enemy unattended.   The combo system is trying too hard to be original. Honestly this part could be very easily fixed if the devs understood why most games use either the 'combo is constantly going up as you kill enemies and resets when you die or something' system or the 'combo goes up pretty fast but instantly goes away in a small period of time after you don't kill something' system. The system that waves uses is trying to make the latter better, but fails miserably: you need to kill 3 enemies to get one stack, and that will only happen when you're being overwhelmed by enemies or during an ambush of like 10 dudes. It rewards you for being in situations any sane person shouldn't be putting themselves in, which results in you needing to be lucky/really really good at twin stick shooters to get high scores in survival.   The challange mode is absolutely infuriating for completionists. Not being able to go in and pick which levels you want to do and not do is just ♥♥♥♥ing terrible. Having to do that one level that you always ♥♥♥♥ up on when you're doing great in one challange run makes me want to stop playing this.   TL;DR: This game is poorly designed and needs balance changes and you shouldn't buy it until the devs fix what I've complained about. 3/10 outclassed by geometry wars in almost every way.  Edit: the music is pretty ehh as well, thought I should mention it; easily fixed by turning it off and turning on your own music.
7164	0	a	Make an ok bullet hell shooter... ....and set a max score reaching which literally terminates the game  FOR WHAT PURPOSE
7165	0	a	This game is way to 'laggy' for its world. I mean come on, only geometric figures and this can't run smoothly on a decent machine...?
7166	0	a	Is there somesort of refund? I just don't like it.
7167	0	a	It's really just a time waster. It looks nice, but there's literally no point.
7168	0	a	+ Interesting game modes + Nice style  - Will not recognize my controller - Only 2 weapon types - Only a single map - Has no power-ups to speak of - Slowmo isn't very satisfying - Music is uninspired  It's an addictive game if you can get past the bare bones, but you're better off elsewhere in this genre... *cough* Super Stardust HD *cough*.
7169	0	a	The developer has known about a crashing on startup issue for a while and hasn't fixed it, what a shame. Was nice that they pinned a how to fix thread to the community discussions page nearly TWO YEARS AGO (January of 2013), but the link to a fixed version of PhysX is now dead! At a loss, I uninstalled PhysX as another discussion thread suggested, no avail.. Until this is fixed, this review will stay negative as a warning.
7170	0	a	why is this game not working? please help me as soon as i start the game the screne becomes black and the game stops!!!!!!
7171	0	a	Can't see anything, to much useless sparkles. Ennemies spawns right under your nose and instant death. Can't upgrage. Just rolling and nothing more.
7172	0	a	Hey, let's make a twin stick shooter. We'll have basic geometric shapes and techno music, and a lot of bright flashing lights. I guess we could also add a mode where you don't shoot things and just run back and forth. That should be enough; time to publish!  Not worth the $10. It's almost as generic as you can get with a twin stick shooter.
7173	0	a	Boring and frantic arcade shooter. Maybe fun on mobile devices. $5 way too much. Unbearable soundtrack. What's this doing in 201x?
7174	0	a	The controls are completely buggy and make it UNPLAYABLE.
7175	0	a	I wrote my opinion on this game in a forum post well-before reviews were added to Steam, so I'll just copy-and-paste it here:   Well, Waves is a dual-stick shooter that is aesthetically similar to Geometry Wars 2, but that's about it.  I'll sum-up what I think the main differences are:    The ship in Waves has weight to it (unlike GW 1 &amp; 2), so you can't just turn on a dime.   You can slow-down time (which also grants you a point-bonus per enemy you kill while in slow-mo). This ability recharges at a decent pace.   You have bombs, but they works rather differently: When you get a combo of 10 kills, you can use a bomb (you lose it if you lose your combo, though). As you can imagine, there can be a lot of enemies on screen, so getting a 10x combo is mind-numbingly easy to do again and again.   There is a Level &amp; Experience system, which is used to scale-up the difficulty for a particular play-session. I find it adds absolutely nothing to the game, and there's no reason to even pay attention to it as you're playing.   That said, you can basically play it with your brain off by just going around in circles, and spamming bombs over and over again because of how quick/easy it is to constantly get 10x combos. And not long into a session, there'll be enough enemies to constantly net you those 10x combos that it won't even matter what direction you shoot in anymore.  At least, that was my experience playing it the other day, which was the first time in just under one year. I only played the main mode during that session (Survival mode), and on my very first try, got the achievement for attaining the highest score possible. So all Waves left me with was a main game mode that was way too easy to top-out, and a few other game-modes which I distinctly remember not liking very much.  So yeah, I feel that those looking for a Geometry Wars fix will find Waves somewhat disappointing. It's not a bad game at all, and might even be a decent distraction if you could get it really cheap, but it left me feeling really underwhelmed - both a year ago, and when I picked it up again the other day.   Edit:  I made a silly.
7176	0	a	Beautiful, catchy music, but chasing something as ephemeral as a score is deeply unsatisfying.
7177	0	a	It's yet another twin-stick shooter that has a few specialty modes. That'll either appeal to you or not.
7178	0	a	Does not work. Mouse is excessively sensitive. I cant turn game on.
7179	0	a	why does these balls have to spawn ON you?  why is there no weapon upgrade if there are hundreds of targets?  so all in all a fairly poore game.
7180	0	a	Holy heck this game is bad. For starters, the graphics are too noisy. After a minute or two of playing you can't tell enemies from powerups and not only does this cause deaths and frustration, but it's so blatantly trying to rip off of Geometry Wars that it's not even trying to hide how poorly it was handled.  The game is uninteresting, mechanics are beyond boring, and the scoring system is fundamentally flawed such that it favors luck over skill in almost every scenario.  Finally, the music and robotic voice are interesting at first but like the rest of the game, become annoying after the first few games.  Save yourself the time and frustration and play something else.
7181	0	a	It's an o.k. frustration, rush,rush, game but the difficulty progresses way too fast. Worth about 5 minutes of play. Not my idea of a fun game at all.
7182	0	a	It's ok.
7183	0	a	It would be hard to make worse game design decisions if you tried. It has so much potential, but the unruly randomness built into the game fails!
7184	0	a	It's another one of those more casual arcade-y games that, while not necessarily bad, is somewhat pointless.
7185	0	a	Badly optimised. I can reach 30 fps max on lowest graphical settings on a laptop with nvidia GT 555m and 2nd gen i7 processor. I know it is not the best pc around but this game should be playable on it. Come on, it's a bullet hell with balls...
7186	0	a	Runs crazy slow in 1920x1080 even though I have a laptop with a gtx 860m graphics card, 12gb of ram and an i7 processor. I love the game but the performance makes it unplayable for me. If it was fixed I would whole heartedly love this game!
7187	0	a	Ticket to Ride is a great game with plenty of replayability. There's no one set strategy to playing, which makes online play fun and engaging. Most of the players online are speedy and will play through the entire game, even if they're losing.  The addition of achievements has added some of the fun into playing with bots back into the game, even for long time players like me.  Unfortunately, the lastest update has virtually broken the game. Not because they changed the design or moved where things are, but because the client won't manage to stay connected for more than a single game, if you can manage to get the server to stay connected that long.  I can't, in good concious, reccomend this game until a massive patch is pushed through. Pick this game up, with a few map packs, while it's on sale, but have patience.
7188	0	a	I cannot unfortunately recommend the latest update of this beloved game.  Put quite simply, the AI has changed from somewhat rational and predictable humanlike AI into completely braindead train-layers who will overlay multiple routes to get from A to B. Further, the layout of the game screen and buttons has changed, making gameplay confusing.   The prior iterations of this game were sublime; this one is a drag.
7189	0	a	The last update is a disaster. Instead of normal online game you now get something with 'notifications' that spam your inbox (sound effects notifying your turn were obviously found not useful and are now used when you end your turn), graphics wants to bite your eyes out and whoever did the design forgot to play the game at least once to see how it works (adding new ticket always showed you where the towns you need are, now you can't see it because there's random stuff flashlighted on the map)  Don't fix something that ain't broken?
7190	0	a	This is a great board game with lots of replayability, especially if you have all the expansions. Prior to the latest update, I played this game for well over a hundred hours both against strangers online and people on my buddy list. However, since the latest update (both here on Steam and on the Android phone app... yes, I own both) the game is extremely unstable. Crashes are so frequent that the game is nearly unplayable. If the game manages to stay open long enough to play, there are often numerous server disconnections during a match. Play is frequently plagued with audio bugs (sound effects that are supposed to play once, but instead play endlessly on a loop until the match ends) or animations freezing.  Until a patch is issued to fix these problems, I can't recommend this game.
7191	0	a	This was a good game. However, they have updated it a couple of times and each time the game got worse. The game itself is good, though it would be nice if you could change the diffulculty settings (it's fairly easy). The artstyle was better in previous versions, but the worst part is that the settings don't work anymore (for example the fast speed button is broken). And worst of all is the increasing amount of banners, pop-ups and other commercial in-game activity that cannot be shut down. Verdict: good game, but increasingly annoying interface. Buy on sale for low price.
7192	0	a	New update interface is horrid, confusing to launch and keep track of games.  The gameplay itself and the board game are brilliant, but we found ourselves cursing this new update.
7193	0	a	Before today I would have enthusiastically recommended this game. But the newest update is horrible.   They seem to have touched every aspect of the UI, and none of it for the better. The artwork went from rich to drab, everything is smaller and harder to read, and they've moved virtually every visual element for no apparent reason.  The AI has been lobotomised. I just beat it 173 to 38 while not paying attention.  I can't stay connected to the servers.  This new version looks and plays like crap. I can't fathom what prompted them to invest time and money in such a significant overhaul of such an old game. But if they were going to do it, you'd think at the very least they'd make sure it was an improvement.  I had a game I was perfectly happy with, and paid good money for, and now it's gone. I don't see myself continuing to play this unless I can figure out a way to roll back the update.
7194	0	a	The game is fun as a board game but whoever developed this should be fired. The game does not work well with steam (it doesnt acknowledge that you can play with your steam friends). Also I received this game as a gift and when trying to play online with my girlfriend (who is my friend on steam) the game said that I hadn't bought the game. If I can play the game solo that means I have the game but yet it says that I don't have it. Developers should work to make this game better.
7195	0	a	I want to recommend this game, it's great. But the latest update screwed everything up! The new interface is not good, The voice acting is gone and it has some crashes. As soon as they removed the latest update I will be able to recommend this game again.
7196	0	a	This pains me to have to not recommend this game. It used to be awesome. I played it for many hundreds of hours on ipad before getting it here. I played this game once here before the updates, and it was great other than not being able to use my ipad account to play here. It's understandable though, so not a huge deal. Just really didn't like having to start over in karma.  I can't even get into a game to play anymore because nobody wants to play with low karma players. I know how to play, I just don't look like it before I even start to play. This is only an issue NOW because before it didn't matter what your karma was, they couldn't kick you out for it. I get why people would want that feature added, so it's great for those who don't have to start from the beginning.  I tried starting my own game. The new game making system was just tacked in there, and there are loads of new options which aren't very clearly explained. The UI is horribly messy. On the old system, you could make a game for 5 people and start it before you get that many people with the push of a button if you changed your mind or didn't want to wait for that many people. You can't do that anymore. You just have to wait for the board to fill up with the specific amount, or go back and change the settings and then wait for people to show up again as doing that removes the game you had already created.  I never got the chance to experience what the online game itself was like after the update though as the game forever said it was waiting for new players. There was no button to start the game. I was just left waiting for something to happen. 10 minutes waiting for something to happen when you have your game seats filled is rediculous. I couldn't even tell them what was going on as the chat wasn't working. It's very broken. I don't know if this is just the mac version of the game that experiences these play glitches, but it wasn't very enjoyable.  So, here's to hoping they fix this once brilliant game. There was no need to retrofit new gameplay options in. If it aint broke, don't fix it.
7197	0	a	This is a fun game to play with friends, I have many more hours playing the actual board game.  Draw cards, place trains, complete routes for continental domination.  HOWEVER, the online playerbase is not big... at all. And a fair number of players will only accept you in game if you have a certain rating or higher.  I do enjoy the game itself so I bought the DLC.. have not yet played on any DLC maps. Most players just play on the classic map.  It would be nice if there was a reward or achievement system to make the game a bit more gratifying.. but there is not.  If you have friends that like it and want to play, I sure won't stop you. But for the price of this game, I would say invest elsewere.  5/10
7198	0	a	A new Version is out. Sadly, now it's very buggy and feels unpolished.  Furthermore, the DLC prices are very expensive. The new board India costs currently just as much all the other boards together. I can't really understand it, because I bought the complete pack and now it's not complete anymore and I will never pay so much for a single board.  I change this review, when the bugs are fixed. This game needs a Patch for all these little problems. Because, I like this game and the loading times are now extremly improved.  If this game is on sale you can already buy it. :)  But not for the regular price for the actual status! :( There are sound bugs, cursor bugs (invisible mouse), (high score bugs?), crashes and more and still not patched.
7199	0	a	Was a good game until recent 'update'. Now it is much slower and more cumbersome with useless graphics and sound. Want the old version back. This is poorly done.
7200	0	a	Ticket to Ride does not want you to leave. Ticket to Ride wants you to stay... forever.  Okay, a little overdramatic. But I've had this game since the original version, and while the original version had its issues, the new one is just awful.  First, I do like the timer idea. It keeps one person from holding up the game. It's great... when it works.  When it doesn't work, one player accidentally gets disconnected from the game, does not get replaced with a bot, and then forces the entire board to wait as their would-be time slowly ticks down. Want to leave? Sure... provided you don't want to reflect negatively on your karma score. If you want to keep your karma (or, heaven forbid, keep playing), you have to stay there until the bot comes in. Woe if this happens at the beginning of a game and the timer is set to fifteen minutes. Hope you have other things you can do.  I have also had the timer count down when it wasn't my turn. I have twice had one player accidentally get disconnected from the game, causing a massive chain where everyone got kicked out. Just when I'd gotten some decent tickets, too, dammit.  Graphically, the game will continue to highlight the cities of tickets I didn't keep. After I complete a route, the board remains darkened. The time continues to count down while it shows me what routes I finished. Little stuff that, while not game breaking, is very irritating and shouldn't be happening for a game that's been around this long.  There is no report bug option in the settings for individual games, nor one I can find to report players while in a game. Report after the game? The forum button for Days of Wonder doesn't work.  Oh, and the kicker? Neither does the exit game button. You are here... forever. And if you do manage to leave, it sends you a message that you have a turn waiting. Even if you have clearly finished all of your games.  If these issues are fixed, I would happily and heartily recommend this game... it's a one of my all-time favorites. But while this buggy, time-wasting version is active, I think I'll just have to break out my tabletop copy of the game.  ETA: As of March 19th, I can exit the game. Sweet escape! Unfortunately, others are still having the problem, and the rest of the gameplay issues are still broken. Sigh...  EETA: April 24th, after the newest update: still having graphical glitches and Steam notifying me I had an unfinished game after it was clearly over. At least I didn't get kicked out the online game this time.  EEETA: After the June update... nope. Still having graphical bugs and just got kicked out of the game due to sync issues. Again. Keep trying, Days of Wonder.
7201	0	a	This was a great game, perfect in its simplicity, but as others have said, the latest update is terrible. The mobile version has also stopped working for several of my friends, who purchased the game separate of their PC versions. I thought of doing the same, but I'm glad I didn't. If you're going to charge people for both the PC and mobile version, it's a bit of a jerk move to suddenly change the framework of the game so that it doesn't work for mobile users.
7202	0	a	Can not recommend after recent update.  AI will just hoard cards until there is nothing left in the draw pile - not enjoyable anymore.
7203	0	a	Didn't like the new version.  The animation finishing a run was annoying.  The ability to bypass the score counting is gone now. Wastes too much time.  I won't be playing much now.
7204	0	a	The latest update (11/19/2015) adds animations and sounds that are distracting and reduce my enjoyment of the game and cannot be turned off. The new map has added details that are (at least initially) distracting. I was playing this a lot, but I think I won't be playing it as much now.
7205	0	a	At the beginning it was really a cool game, remind me the boards games I got at home. I decide to replay this after a couple of year off...  I did try all the different bot and maps... and i was really frustrating, game feel slower than before, bot were not at all playing objectives, they just build road beginning with those who get the more point till they don't have wagon left. 6 games, none of the bots made an objectives... -_- I like this game, but playing with those bot no way.   If you want this game play online with human being, seems ok but don't buy it to play alone.
7206	0	a	Over the last month there has been several server issues effecting most players, there doesn't appear to be anywhere to get support and haven't been given a time line to get this fixed.
7207	0	a	Ticket To Ride has always been one of my favourite board games, so I decided to get the PC version, too (including all DLCs). As a player, you have to build railways between different cities, according to the route tickets that you drew at the start of the game. It's a great game that, at its core, has a lot of replay value thanks to all the different routes you can play and the different maps and other game mechanics it offers. As a bonus, the art is great too, giving you that awesome industrial/steampunkish vibe that goes so well with... well, with the whole train theme.    Pros 
7208	0	a	windowed mode cannot be resized... just why would you not have that standard feature. otherwise nice and relaxed game. but the fact that windowed mode is the same 90% of your monitor renders that mode useless for casual gaming while doing other stuff on your pc
7209	0	a	This game was okay.. Never great, never horrible but okay.. Was worth getting when on sale... Was not quite stable when it was new, but it was forgiving in crashes, you were able to rejoin games, sometimes without missing even 1 turn to the computer in online games, and as they worked on it, it got more and more stable.. It's an occasional, few games every month or two type passtime, but not anymore. The latest update not only totally revamped the interface, but it broke the game worse than ever before.. Now, any error, disconnect or glitch in the game and it's over... Might as well throw in the towel because you won't be able to finish the game you started and glitches will happen a lot.... Since the last update, out of about 10 games attempted, I been able to finish 2. At the time of this review, this game is in the worst condition it has EVER been in, years after it's release, and I've not only given up on the game, but I'm giving up on anything Days of Wonder puts out in the future, because it takes a truly incredible level of fail to completely break something this late in it's life cycle.
7210	0	a	The game itself is fun, but the connectivity was never amazing, and it now doesn't work on OSX at all after a random update.
7211	0	a	In principle I can recommend this game to everybody who enjoys the original board game, as it is a very good digital realization of a very good analog original. Enough has been said about the game mechanics etc. in other posts, and just as most I do enjoy a nice round of planing, scheming and backstabbing against/with other real players.  But there's another aspect which forced me to give a negative rating: Under Ubuntu 14.04 (as well as all other Linuxes according to the TTR steam forum), the DLCs do not work any more after the last update, meaning I cannot play on the additional maps I paid for! The publisher is aware of the problem, yet a solution is not in sight.  As soon as this problem is resolved, I will change my review as the game itself is fine. But as nothing has changed over the last two months, I can't help do feel deceived so far.
7212	0	a	The update has ruined the game. The server crashes all of the time! I like the new graphics but am considering not playing for awhile until the bugs are worked out.
7213	0	a	Buy the board game version instead. This game is built in Java and I don't have to tell you why thats a bad idea. Steam page doesn't mention this either...
7214	0	a	Say's it's touch friendly but is terrible on the surface pro 3. Have to play in windowed mode as otherwise it displays only a quarterof the screen! Also can't play online due to an unspecified error, shouldn't have bought the complete pack without trying it oit first. The iPad version of the same game works much better
7215	0	a	Ticket to Ride is a great game, and worked fine for a long time.  Unfortunately a recent update (November 2015) has made everything so much worse, and it's honestly one of the worse updates to a game I've ever seen with tons of bugs. Now there are graphical glitches, buttons don't work, there's multiplayer connectivity problems, the AI is worse, unnecessary route completion animations are present, the end-game score count is slow, and so on. Until these are fixed I cannot recommend the game in its current state.  There was nothing to warrant this update, so I don't understand why the producers would trash a game that was working extremely well. Seems like a waste of time and effort. Don't fix that which isn't broken!
7216	0	a	If you liked the Ticket to Ride game for windows,I would not buy this package of all the games.I did and I'm sorry.The game crashes continually,and it does not look the same[and the robots cheat]Very dissatisfied!I would like a refund and my old game back,but they[at steam]don't seem to want to be gotten a hold of.[tried many times,and ways.
7217	0	a	Does not work in SteamOS even though it is a supported platform. Game starts, but you cannot proceed beyond the game menu.
7218	0	a	The latest update is bad. Also, it's not recognising my DLC. The game was great until the latest update. Wait until they fix it.
7219	0	a	Horrible AI. The computer players seem to care less about completing their routes and more about getting as many trains laid down as possible. Very frustrating when you're working on a couple overlapping transcontinental routes and the AI ends the game before you can complete them.
7220	0	a	The latest update of this game is a real let down. It worked wonderfully before. As many folks have indicated, the AI is horrid. Previous AI was more human like. All it does is lay down tracks. I don't think I've seen the AI pick additional destination tickets aside from the first ones it picks. I wish there was a setting for choosing the AI's pattern/thought. Why did they feel the need to update?  As it is, I can't recommend it. The board game itself is great, but I don't enjoy it like I did before the update.
7221	0	a	It was better before the update. If there were setting to toggle some of the new 'features' it wouldn't be too bad.
7222	0	a	I have played this game for ov er three years and love it. Then someone decided to make this game harder to play and even egt on to it if you have an older v ersion of software . I cannot get on tho the qame today when i click on play . Yesterday I must have lucked out and foun \d the right combinAtion after many tries. I have noticed that when i WAS PLAYINFG NO ONE LIKED THE NEW SET UP' I HAVE NOT WON A GAME ON IT YET BECAUSE I NEV ER KNEW HOW MANY OF THE COPORED TICKETY\S I HAD TO USE. THE ONLY WAY I GOT ON IT THE FIRST DAY WAS BECAUSW\E i HAD HELP FROM AN IT MAN. iT DOES NOT WANT TO PLAY IT SAYS BECVAUSE i HAVE cHROME , SO I HAVE DELETED CHROMWE AND IT STILL SAYS i HAVE CHROME . NOT A HAPPY PLAYER ANYMORE . hARD TO RECOMEND THIS GAME IN THE PRESENT STATE .
7223	0	a	After a year of good use, Ticket to Ride has ceased functioning. Support is had to access. I have tried what is suggested in forums and have no way to directly inform Steam or Days of Wonder of my problem.  Steam initiates normal logon, but then cuts to a black screen--no messages.  At Days of Wonder all attempts to 'play' directly similarly lead to a non-even, a white screen invoting me to check out or purchase products.  Both show my account in good standing. How do I access an EFFECTIVE repair. I've spent 90 minutes trying what you a;lready suggest.
7224	0	a	A year and a half or so ago, I would have given this game a thumbs-up.   Sadly, that's not the case now.   From a table-top player of the game, it does fulfill that need for a single player version of the game with AI.  The AI is usually on it's game, and can provide challenges just like a human opponent.   But what merits a negative review if the game is so pitch perfect for an electronic version?  The interface. The backend. With the update that came out that year/year and a half ago, the aspects of the game that were controllable by the player were rendered completely and utterly useless.  No longer can we select player colour, or the player avatar. Completely locked out.  Want to turn off the irritating and mind-numbing music? Good luck. That too doesn't function correctly.   Now Kris, you may ask... did you try uninstalling the game and reinstalling?  Yes, several times. With a reboot, cleaning the registry, all the temp files, complete rip and reinstalls. Nothing.  As I said, I did several times, each time with a different tack, trying to force something to reset in the hopes that  I could restore functionality.  Even a complete uninstall, removal of ALL files, cleaning the registry of entries, a complete reboot, and a ful reinstall did NOTHING.   And apparently, I'm not alone with this issue. Posts in the Steam Forums and on the DoW forums point out these issues.  And what is done about it? NOTHING.  Oh, we did get new content though, so it's not abandonware.   If you want to buy the game, please do. It's a wonderful translation of the board game and has infinite replay value. Just be forewarned that you can't do anything other than play it, as I've explained above.
7225	0	a	It was fun until the latest update...
7226	0	a	This *was* a B- game, and one of the games I played most on Steam. Replayability is endless with all of the expansions one can purchase for reasonable in-app purchase fees. Problems include annoying notifications in-game that NEVER shut up, information you need being covered up during game play, and the point breakdown takes forever at the end of the game (you can bypass this, but then you never get the stats, just the final tally). Most annoyingly, perhaps, is that even though you paid for the app and even though you paid for new expansions...THEY NEVER STOP GIVING YOU ADS. Constant ads for their other games and non-digital games NEVER stop.   But the reason a B- game turns into an F (i.e., not recommended)? It STOPPED WORKING. It can't be opened all of a sudden, and Days of Wonder (maker of the game) have not responded to customer service requests.   This is a broken game. Do NOT buy.
7227	0	a	While the game itself is good, the singleplayer AI is extremely stupid, and you cannot adjust its difficulty. Even when you make it blatantly obvious what you're trying to do, the AI will never intentionally block you. Beginner players with no strategy at all aside from just trying to connect their cities have a high chance of winning. Players who are actually good at the game will almost always win.
7228	0	a	Used to be a good game. Then they revamped, added more DLC, and added pop-up ads in the game. Are you serious?
7229	0	a	fun game based on the popular boardgame.   HOWEVER!  seems to not work and is full of crash bugs. all it does it start up and crash OR it just shows a white screen for the map. 
7230	0	a	Love the game and everything works until I try to play an online ranked match. I get constantly disconnected and my karma is ruined :( I haven't had this issue with any of the other games in my library and have tried the game on two different computers on many different networks. This is definitely an issue on the game's end and not mine. If any has any suggestions on how to fix this issue please let me know because I would love to keep playing this game online.
7231	0	a	Several errors when playing, and multiplayer seems to be highly broken. I love the original boardgame but in its current extremely buggy state I cannot recommend this. I submitted my refund after the frustration of dealing with it and perhaps in the future if they fix the bugs I may try the game again (but I'll try a demo or evaluation copy first, because I want to keep the number of games I request for a refund to a minimum).  Developers: You have a great boardgame to do a video game version of, please double back and iron out the bugs in this game and in the multiplayer and I'm pretty certain you will sell many copies of this. 
7232	0	a	Absolutely love the board game but they scrapped local co-op when they ported it to PC :( After that i'd give it 5/10. Buy on special (right now I see it for $2) otherwise save your money and get the Board game (better multiplayer experience despite no matchmaking service).
7233	0	a	This was a nice little game that was just fun to play until they updated it. The update resets your hall of fame and requires more clicking to get anything done. Totally ruined this game by adding a bothersome interface and adding nothing of value. Stay away from this one.

7236	0	a	Game randomly gives Java errors or won't start a map because reasons...
7237	0	a	This game crash all the time on linux (I can't even start a game). The support from Days of Wonder is the awful, 3 messages in 3 months and still no answer.  Don't buy if you want to play under linux/steamOS
7238	0	a	Removed support for my platform overnight. To be re-reviewed if Linux/SteamOS support comes back at some point, maybe.
7239	0	a	Help .... Ticket to ride -Europe can not find tutorials in the game ? I have no idea to play with this DLC.
7240	0	a	Way too expensive for what it is and not suited for PC  Buy on iPad and save money
7241	0	a	Worse than mobile version :\
7242	0	a	I love this game but it has stopped opening in Steam. No fix works....
7243	0	a	Having just played SmallWorld 2, I've seen how good a board game game can be and.... this isn't it.  The board is very, very hard to make out (in terms of telling what routes have been built on), the sound is awful (guy talking at you like he's on cocaine) and the music gets repetetive very, very quickly. Didn't seem as buggy as small world 2, but as a game it's lacking in everything but gameplay.  And I'm a gameplay guy. But this game...... yechhh.  1.5/5
7244	0	a	This is an awesome game and I enjoyed some time with it. Even though I wouldn't recommend it for two reasons:  1. The AI is too weak. 2. It's nearly impossible to play multiplayer matches due to the lack of enough players.
7245	0	a	Broken on Mac with latest release. Another great Days Of Wonder release.  Exception Type: EXC_BREAKPOINT (SIGTRAP) Exception Codes: 0x0000000000000002, 0x0000000000000000  Application Specific Information: dyld: launch, loading dependent libraries  Dyld Error Message:  Symbol not found: _kSecAttrAccessible 
7246	0	a	If I had friends to play with it might be good. But I don't. 0/10
7247	0	a	Can't get any of the achievements without the DLC :(
7248	0	a	Clearly people giving good reviews are fans of the board game cause I can understand what this game might be fun as a board game with a few friends but as a pc game it blows! The sound effects and music drive me insane, the tutorial goes on forever, the AI opponent seems to be set on 'Pwn Noobs' mode and doesn't interact with your strategies, and the gameplay is just repetative.  Mediocre experience at best,.
7249	0	a	I love Ticket to Ride as a board game, and I enjoy the iPhone app, but this is a terrible PC port.  The settings screen is tricky to find, and even after clicking on it, it takes a while to load and the buttons aren't labeled. There are icons with no indication what changes will be made by clicking on the icon. And the changes can't be made in game. For example, I wish I could've found a way to speed up the animations, but I was unable to do so. The game moves at a snail's pace.   As I was trying to get to the settings sceen to look for the options, an annoying voice kept talking to me about the settings. Every time you switch which map you're considering using, a new voice starts up. There must be a way to disable these in the settings, but again, since nothing was labeled, I don't know where it is.   This is a good game, but a terrible PC port.
7250	0	a	Cannot get it to run on Mac Maverick or Yosemite.
7251	0	a	Stupid game, doesn't follow it's own game logic. Hard to play the game that way!
7252	0	a	I've not played Ticket to Ride much, but I feel like I have a grasp of it. Like the description says, you can learn how to play in a matter of minutes but it will take a lifetime to master.   The basic idea of the game is to build more train lines than your opponents, this is done by matching the colour of the line with the colour of a train cart. You get different coloured train carts out of a deck of cards.   The game has a very good built in turtorial video and lessons which explains this all in an easy to understand way. It can look very daunting at first but it soon becomes apparent that it is a very simple idea behind it all.   Sadly from my 3 hours playing, I haven't once been able to find a match online against anyone, mainly because I get an ingame error message when ever I try and find or start an online game, so my review is based purely on the single-player aspect, and while I haven't actually won a game of Ticket to Ride, I did enjoy my time playing.   I'm not sure who this game is aimed at, but since there is a physical board game for Ticket to Ride, I'd say only pick this up if you enjoy the board game, but I can't really recommend this game for anyone else, £6,99 is a bit much for this, and £14,99 for the complete pack is utterly silly.
7253	0	a	Recommended for those who want to play Ticket to Ride but can't find a local game store near them to play with others.  Otherwise, would recommend either a console version of Ticket to Ride, or the board game itself.  The drag and drop methods feel unneccesary, as if it was made for mobile devices in mind. (gets tough with a touchpad) Oddly no controller support despite console versions existing.  Content wise, the full price feels lacking compared to other train strategy games on Steam.
7254	0	a	Love the board game, but on the Mac it simply doesn't seem to work.
7255	0	a	2/10 good game feel, but was unable to successfully enter any online matches or participate in any interactive experiences which could be described as a 'game.'
7256	0	a	Would not work with Win 8 and my ATH Radeon HD 4600. Tries all the steps in the help guide without success.
7257	0	a	For a fairly complex (albeit dragging) board game, I'm not sure why the UI appears to have been designed for a four year-old...
7258	0	a	The Steam version of this program is TOTAL CRAP on a Mac. I TOTALLY REGRET making this purchase!
7259	0	a	i played with my friend, had no idea whats going on, and i still won! wouldnt play again.
7260	0	a	it's really really bad.
7261	0	a	I've played this game as a parlor game, it was great! But the PC-Version isn't in a playable state... I've tryed everything but I can't click on anything in the game. Not by using the Mouse or any key on the keyboard. I haven't ever bought a game on Steam that is that buggy and unplayable.  I recommend to safe the money and instead buying the original parlor game!
7262	0	a	The Steam version of Ticket to Ride is different from the Days of Wonder version of it. I cannot pick up extra destination ticket cards. For me the maximum is 4 of them. Elise, the other player, can pick up much more. Sometimes Elise pick up 7 destination ticket cards. I don't know what is happening. Can someone explain me?
7263	0	a	Rubbish! Uninstalled.
7264	0	a	Ticket to Ride is a competent enough adaptation of the classic board game. Game play is quick and smooth, as is to be expected. The style of the game is fair, if a bit cluttered. However this is all based on the player being able to get past the god-awful menus. Every menu has voice overs describing what options are available. Often each menu has but two or three options. Switching maps, more voices overs describing each map, often with horribly caricature ethnic voices. There is simply no way to turn the voice overs off and has been off putting enough that I've only been able to stomach playing two games. A pity as I really wanted to purchase gift copies for family and friends for online play.
7265	0	a	I very highly suggest you stay away from this title. Discovered game-breaking bugs - the worst of which literally made the game unplayable. Just buy the table-top version.
7266	0	a	This is an absolutely awful implementation of the game.
7267	0	a	Its boring. but for children UNDER 7 jears. i rcommend. but for me (12 jears old) no i do no.
7268	0	a	no idea how this is considered a game
7269	0	a	Update 2016-02-09:  Below is my original review of the game, now that there has been a 'patch' I feel the need to change my original review from 'recommended' to 'don't buy'. Unfortunately the latest update has not only changed the main controls and the layout of the board, but simply broke the game.  Now it takes about 5 minutes to simply load the game, it just starts with a blank map where you can't do anything and the music and sound effects are blaring. When it finally loads the process of selecting a map is anything but comfortable, where before you could simply switch through the maps, looking at the different layouts with a click, now you have to enter a submenu to rotate through (not a deal breaker on its own, but remember, I've just been exposed to 5 minutes of waiting for things to react at all).  Now within the game itself the board layout has also change, for newcomers probably intuitive enough, for those who have already spent quite a lot of time in the game a nuisance.  All of the things I've mentioned above are not the reason I can't recommend this game though.  The reason you should stay away until they patch this game: after you've finished a round the game just hangs with a white screen, no reaction at all, nothing. Couldn't even close it properly and had to kill it through the taskmanager. I'm definitely not willing to spend 5 minutes waiting for the game to load, navigate through submenus to pick a map and then have the game crash after one round.    Original review:  After finally being able to start the game, I have to admit I almost forgot the trouble it gave me when I first installed it... or well, rather when I installed it for the first 7 times. But only almost. If you have an AMD graphics card be prepared for trouble, this thing is a b* to get to run on new machines.  It's certainly not a fan of up-to-date graphic drivers, nope, this game shows its age while installing (not while playing, mind you)  In case anyone is reading this after having tried and failed to install and actually start this game on a windows 7 machine, here is a rather usefull link, just scroll to the end of the page an follow those instructions, all but step 4. DO NOT COPY THE FILE, just leave it where it is and skip ahead to step 5.  http://steamcommunity.com/app/108200/discussions/0/846943418815498457/#p2  In case it still won't start, just try running it in compatiblity mode for windows XP, that's what did the trick for me. Now all is fine.  But back to the game itself. It's fun to play and way too easy to waste an enourmous amount of time with it. The campaigns are fairly short and one little campaign won't cost you days or hours of your life, but if you are like me and can't stop after a loss... or a win, well a short campaign of 10 minutes can turn into 2 hours.  Some of the maps are rather confusing at first (yeah, well, who reads or acutally listens to instructions, right? yep, neither did I), especially since the DLCs seem to have other rules when it comes to train placement. If you're not interested in the DLC anyway (it's hit an miss btw.), than it's rather straighforward. The video on steam pretty much covers all the rules and the gameplay.  Would I recommend this? Yeah, I guess I still would, but only to those who know how to open a command shell, 'cause if things go wrong, that's pretty much the only way to get to enjoy this game.
7270	0	a	Just played a few hours because i was curious how this game would be on the computer instead of the board game, the rules are same and the tutorial is easy to pickup but....  the bad: the game is full of advertisement for other/new games. the complete settingsscreen isnt working, i can't login change colours nor sound settings etc. because there isnt any progress saved and i have to change my username every game, the game feels very unfinnished.  I guess it could have been a good game when everything is working properly, this game will go into the bin for me I'll stick to the real boardgame.
7271	0	a	While the game itself is quite nice and a faithful adaptation of the board game, the pricing policy for the additional maps is an outrage. For the price of two simple additional maps I could get all of 'The Witcher', for instance. All sense of proportion has been lost here. Go buy Mini Metro instead!
7272	0	a	Fun game... but the online version crashes continuously... the scoring is erratic... the destination cards are NOT randomly dealt - you'll see the same combinations of choices over and over again. KICKS YOU OFF the game constantly... just a really poor online game - like 1990s technology!! 
7273	0	a	This is a very faithful recreation of the Boardgame. I would, however much rather play the boardgame or at least the tablet version with pass and play. It turns out that TTR isn't really all that captivating without other people around.
7274	0	a	This game does not work. No amount of installing/reinstalling both windows files and game files has helped.   DO NOT BUY.
7275	0	a	Medioce port of the superb board game.  Fails to follow standard WIMP environment conventions - many interface items are clumsy and counter-intuitive.   Net coding is poor - takes way way too long in early rounds when players are mostly just double clicking for cards.  Chat box dissapeared after a couple games with no explanation or apparent way to restore it.  Default player name was taken from email string - for many this is a real name - as a developer you should ALWAYS be getting consent for this first.  Willy nilly decided I was under 13 years of age and need to submit a fax with parental pernission to access - LOL GET REAL - I was 13 a LONG time ago - can't fathom what their thinking was.  Core mechanics are consistent with the board game but there is no improvement either - the same double lane board is shown even when 2-3 player games exclude them - why?  6/10
7276	0	a	Removed support for my friends platform so I am unable to play with them. Very annoying.
7277	0	a	A timing/logic puzzle game with a steampunk flavor. I picked it up in a summer bundle, tried it, found the puzzles too bland to hold my interest.
7278	0	a	These puzzle-platformers are hit-or-miss for me. Lots of people like this game, so maybe it is me. Maybe I just wasn't in the right moo when I played this game, because it never really grabbed me. A good friend, who usually has the same tastes in gaming, really enjoyed this game. But I found the puzzles too arbitrary. I know, it is a puzzle game. What did I expect? That's why I'm trying to give the game the benefit of the doubt and say maybe it just didn't click for me. I usually like this type of game but maybe it went a shade too far into adventure game wacky puzzle territory for me?  In any case, life is short and Steam is full of great games so I don't recommend this to others.
7279	0	a	Controller support: Great! Physics: Wonderful!  Gameplay: Couldn't really get into it. Lots of puzzles that put you through all the motions of moving fluros around even though you know what you want to do.
7280	0	a	Yeah, no, stay far clear of this one.  Where to even begin. Okay. So, you know how most puzzle games are supposed to work consistently so that solving puzzles when you know the solution isn't a matter of luck? Not Vessel! Be ready for your fluros to randomly die in the middle of a puzzle! Be prepared for the AI to go off the rails and do something completely different than you were expecting! (Especially the light and dark fluros). And you know how physics-based puzzles are generally inconsistent to begin with? Guess which game is entirely based around its water physics? Yeah...  I mean, I wanted to give this one the benefit of the doubt. It does try to avoid physics-based puzzles for the most part, and there are moments of clever ideas. But far more often, puzzles are just a matter of screwing around until you figure out what to do, at which point you actually have to get the game to cooperate long enough for you to do it.  Honestly, I think the best part of the game may be the cave section before you get to the lab for the first time. There's a decent mix of platforming and puzzling there, and the puzzles can get pretty clever at times. I will go on record saying that I did play this first bit before purchasing the game and it led me to believe the game would be pretty decent (granted, I bought this years ago and never got around to playing it until just now, so...) but it goes downhill soon after. The puzzles in the factory all revolve around lava, the most dangerous of all the liquids in the game, and there's just a lot of dying in this zone... one of the protoplasm blobs literally requires you to just charge through some of the lava and hope you don't die. Every guide for this game has the same stupid solution.   The orchard area is... alright. There's a lot less dying, the puzzles revolving around the blue and red goo and the drinker seed are pretty clever, nothing's too obscure to the point of being frustrating. But then the mine area... jeez, what the hell. This is where the game shows its worst side. There are fluros who are attracted to light. But they're really finnicky and basically impossible to control, it's hard to get them to go where you want them to. On top of that, the first half of the area you're mostly spending time in the dark, with the glowing liquid lighting up the area around you, but you still have to do a lot of maneuvering in the dark regardless. Then you get the dark fluro, which is even more finnicky and has a habit of jumping off in random directions to escape the light, instead of going where you want him to. One of the protoplasm blobs and the last puzzle in the mines involves guiding these guys and they are just pests. Ugh.  I won't say this game is devoid of good design because it's about half balanced between the good and the bad, but there's more than enough of the bad to just make it a rather unfun experience... even in the good parts of the game there's still a lot of waiting around, the puzzles in general are rather tedious. I never felt inclined to keep playing the game much, and on top of that I switched computers in the middle of playing this game, which apparently doesn't cloud save, so I got to redo a good chunk of the game, which was great fun let me tell you... no...  The graphics are okay, a little dated. The soundtrack and sound design is nice, but it's licenesed music so I can't give anyone on the development team much credit. The story is pretty thin until the ending, which is just... terrible...  And there's really not much platforming here, either. A few puzzles have a little bit of platforming but it is definitely way more on the puzzle end of things. The game map is just a long string of puzzle rooms, too, there's almost no point to having these big open areas where nothing happens.  I'm kind of rambly in this review, I guess, but I don't feel interested enough in this game to really sift through my thoughts. It's not very fun, it's kind of boring, occasionally frustrating, and only mildly entertaining at even the best of times. Definitely skip, you can do a lot better in both the puzzle and puzzle-platformer genres.
7281	0	a	First and foremost this game is about half puzzler / half platformer, so be prepared. Some of the platforming can be just as challenging as the puzzles, especially on the mouse and keyboard. It does have an indie feel to it, and some of the progression suffers a tad, as in some places you can find yourself wandering around unsure of where to go next, most notably a section in the Factory, due to the counter-intuitive little map shown above the goal machines. I won't spoil it, but basically the map is backwards. The Journal in the game that vaguely tells you where to go next does its job, and that's it. It doesn't hold your hand.  The graphics are really pretty, with an almost watercolor feel in places, and the backgrounds steal the show from the nearer sections to the screen and main characters. I'm only past the first section, but I've already felt the overwhelming urge to break free of the puzzle's 'prisons' and go outside and run around the lush looking town and landscape. Another game set in this universe as some kind of RPG or Action RPG would be amazing.  Coupled with the graphics is a really good soundtrack. The sound effects are almost TOO good and eerily realistic for the cartoony looking style. The music is really well done and fits the game nicely, ranging from artsy downtempo thematic music to more industrial techno type stuff, always matching the setting and action, or lack thereof.  If I had to gripe it would be about the controls, especially on the mouse and keyboard. There are certain elements that require the player to grab a device and rotate it. If you've ever played Little Big Planet you won't be surprised. What DID surprise me was how long it took me to figure out that when using WASD, you really do have to use all of WASD when spinning certain circular contraptions around to get the speed up.   What I mean is that if you're using a thumbstick, you naturally progress Up, to Right, to Down, to Left, and Up again as you spin the stick, but when using the keyboard I had to learn the hard way. I don't recall any other game requiring me to go from W, to D, to S, to A, back to W in a motion like that, and it's really challenging. I do like the mouse's use in aiming the player, but I may have to change to a gamepad before too long if the puzzles increase in difficulty. The game says on the home screen that a gamepad is recommended.  Overall, the game is a lot longer than I expected, and the style isn't really even 'Steampunk,' but more of a neat hybrid that still incorporates liquids, hydraulics, and temperature. Some of the sections are engineered solely around the puzzles, and if you step back and take a look at these sections you find yourself asking why someone would build these mazes and dangerous pitfalls in the first place. This can sometimes ruin the suspension of disbelief, but once you accept it for what it is it's really a rad little game. I've noticed a bug or two with certain machines' physics getting out of whack, but there's an option in the game to reset a puzzle if you've screwed up or boxed yourself in. Other than that, it's polished up well and a lot of fun.  **EDIT**  After dicking around trying to get achievements I changed it to a thumbs down. The devs gave up caring and haven't fixed some bugs that make the game literally unplayable. On some puzzles the physics engine breaks down and you have to reset it just to get a random thing to happen. Multiple achievements are so finnicky to the point of frustration, not in figuring them out, but in MAKING THEM HAPPEN. If you're just going to throw out arbitrary random achievements without testing them or making sure they work correctly then you can suck it. A perfect game would allow a player to do a solid run with NO DEATHS, in the way Limbo does, but not here. Half the puzzles and achievements towards the end require you to look them up online just to make sure you're trying to do them correctly, and then you find out that you are, and it's just the game that's broken. No fix is coming, so what started out as a joyful experience turned into hair pulling anger. I hate crappy devs that pull this garbage.
7282	0	a	This looked like a cool game, I love steampunk puzzle platformers but it was apparent from the beginning few puzzles that there were still bugs, puzzles weren't really puzzles because I was able to basically break them with a few quick movements like finding the correct sequence to flip levers so all are green when you can just slightly tap them and move out of the way. The colliders seemed to be off as well, as I was hanging onto a rotating lever after I had fallen off the platform and I was just stuck in a loop going round and round. Bit more testing/polishing is required for this game I think.
7283	0	a	A puzzle platformer based on fluid dynamics. The steampunk setting is a plus, but the controls are way too floaty and a constant source of frustration. Most of the puzzles are suitably hard and new gameplay mechanics keep on piling up until the very end. Shame that the numerous platforming elements leave a lot to be desired.
7284	0	a	With its quirky visual style, I really wanted to like this one, but terrible controller lag, in what is just another switch-flipping game means I'll pass.
7285	0	a	The game is a fun at first, with interesting physics puzzles to solve.  But then it gets stupid, with puzzles that are more about reaction time and your ability to deal with lots of things going on all at once, than physics problem solving.  Not recommended due to this bait-and-switch.
7286	0	a	
7287	0	a	Switch puzzle/physics games have always had a special place in my heart. You can usually find them piled next to things like my mental versions of political figures I dislike, or my memories of Star Wars Episode II--you know, things that I like to take out every so often when I’m bored in my head and burn just for fun. It took very little time for me to determine that Vessel would be added to this pile.  Yes, I’m a little (maybe a lot) biased. I did just admit that I don’t like these kinds of games--but maybe let me explain a bit about Vessel and myself, and you may understand why.  Vessel is inherently a game where you play as some nameless white guy who runs around and hits switches and pulls levers. I suppose he has some backstory of being some great inventor, but it doesn’t really matter to the game at all. I could have been playing as Calvin, the bag-boy from the local grocery store, and the game wouldn’t have changed much. In fact, I think I’ll just start calling the inventor Calvin. At least it makes *me* laugh.  So Calvin is sitting in his lab, possibly reminiscing about his past achievements--the invention of a strange aquatic creature called “Fluorous--when one of the Fluorous lock him out of his lab, leading him on an… “adventure (by the loosest definition of the word)... where he must get back into his lab. Along the way, he’ll hit switches. He’ll open doors. He’ll pull levers and walk through more doors. If you’re lucky, you’ll get to spray water at something in random orders until, eventually, it might open another door. This inherently is the problem with most puzzle games in general but specifically Vessel--what is my motivation? What is my goal? Why do I care? I know nothing of the character, he isn’t that likeable, the Fluorous aren’t really interesting, and after 5 minutes I already know exactly the kind of game I’ll be playing.  “Oh, but what of the water physics? They’re neat, aren’t they? I suppose to some degree they are, but what does it matter? I’ve never understood why physics justify the existence of a game. Physics are simply that--physics. Companies sell physics engines, but gamers don’t *buy* physics engines, and most puzzle games are essentially just that--an excuse to display a physics engine. If I wanted physics, I’d walk onto my porch a drop a rock off my balcony. “Does gravity still work? Yep, it does. Fascinating.  One might argue that Vessel displays impressive, or at least “stylistic artwork. To some degree, this is true--while the design did not appeal to me at all, I can recognize that work was put into the game’s visuals, lighting and layout. While the rooms are basically boxes with switches and buttons, they do try their best to appear interesting, with pipes running everywhere, cave-work in the background, and dynamic shadows/lighting. Yes, one might say that the game is “artistic or “beautiful. I could also tell you that the Sistine Chapel is “artistic and “beautiful, but I wouldn’t tell you that it makes the Sistine Chapel a good video game.   I guess the biggest crux I have with Vessel and most puzzle games, is that I have to ask the question, “Why? Why would I want to do this? If you stripped away the graphics--if you stripped away the lighting and soothing music--the actual game “experience is equivalent to someone locking you in an empty white room filled with buttons and switches, and a PA box overhead says “you can leave when you figure out how to open the door, and at that point it’s up to me find the correct order to hit all the switches and pull all the levers. Yes, there are generally clues, and yes it exercises problem solving--but so does a textbook--and ultimately at the end of the day, I’m just implementing procedural inputs into a linearly designed path that I have to follow to get to the next set of required procedural inputs and on and on until I can finally see the credits roll. Being a stubborn gamer, I usually do just that--however this time, I decided to break the mold and find my own escape from the crushing loneliness of the underground steam maze.  Once I obtained the ability to create Fluorous seeds, I soon discovered that the game allowed you to create an infinite amount of them--better yet, it did not despawn the old seeds. Thusly, I set out to see how many seeds I could create before the game crashed. In truth, I had more fun swimming through my seed sea than any experience I had solving Vessel’s puzzles. After 15 minutes or so, the game crashed, and I finally had my freedom.

The water physics used in this game uses up a ton of performance. Platforming with such choppy frame rate is pretty irritating.  The puzzles use these water clones a lot and getting them to not kill themselves is just frustrating.  I love sidescrolling platform puzzles and I loooovvvve water physics but this game doesn't nail any of this.  Graphics are also not all that impressive.  Adunno, I'm not feeling it in this game.
7289	0	a	This game is impossible without a game controller, even though there are controls for keyboard and mouse. Would probably be great if I had working controls, though.
7290	0	a	Vessel is a liquid physics-based puzzle platformer that has wonderfully gorgeous graphics, beautiful and memorable music, and a vibrant and interesting world to explore. Unfortunately, the core gameplay mechanic of using liquid physics to solve the game's puzzles doesn't feel like it was well implemented.  The player must manipulate creatures spawned from various liquids in order to solve puzzles and advance in the game. However, the liquid physics engine seems rather imprecise and flaky, as liquids and creatures will occasionally behave in odd ways. This, in turn, makes some puzzles frustrating, as it is difficult sometimes to tell if you tried to solve a puzzle incorrectly, or if you had the right idea only to have it messed up by some weird anomaly caused by the physics engine. This is especially true (and highly irritating) in the game's latter stages.
7291	0	a	It looks interesting but it's unfortunately pretty boring.
7292	0	a	this is an ok game. It keeps introducing new mechanics and elements throughout the game, but somehow still managed to be somewhat monotonous.   Game is easy until the last section, which is oddly hard. It's difficult to controll the green liquid and get the fluros to go where you want them to in this section. it feels like you lose the control you've been perfecting throughout the rest of the game.   It has a lot of slowdown. My computer isn't the best but it has run more complicated games than this just fine. It just has a lot happening with the liquid dynamics, and background and foreground all moving around. It made the game unplayable at points. I had to keep it at a really low res to play.   To summarize: Just another platform puzzler. Somewhat more unique than most. Not a very interesting story or character, though. A lot of 'upgrades' that don't really do much and feel like fluff. Lots of slowdown on ok computers. somewhat frusting at times because you don't directly control the solutions. Not worth 15$.
7293	0	a	I was a little fooled by the trailer in thinking that this was more action than puzzler, but it turns out it's literally 'Move to next area, solve the puzzle, move to next area, solve puzzle' rinse wash repeat. The puzzles/mechanics of the game aren't really all that great either, because the game literally feels like every other indie platformer I've ever played. At least the ones that I've played that I enjoyed had something in them that made them different or unique/interesting, instead of the same old 'here's interesting glob number 5, now use this to solve the next area' over and over again. Suffice to say this game was a bit of a letdown. Had an semi interesting plot, but even then, I don't think even that merits a playthrough even.
7294	0	a	Needlessly convoluted puzzles that require more menial repetitive work rather than intelligence and imagination. Awkward controls and animation. Cute art style and music (though the one piano track has also become quite repetitive). Was expecting something better to be honest...
7295	0	a	game is unplayable; bugs lead to crashes on loading a game every time after a certain point.
7296	0	a	Not as good as I expected. Poorly designed and the puzzles aren't creative.
7297	0	a	Horrible game with boring, tedious and repetitive puzzles. Skip it
7298	0	a	For the most part, this game features clever puzzle design with interesting fluid mechanics. Story doesn't really add much, but doesn't distract either.   Unfortunately once you reach the final puzzles, the game's mechanics and fluro AI stop following their own rules, and your well thought out solutions fall flat while dumb luck sees you though. That leaves a bit of a sour taste to an otherwise enjoyable game.  If Vessel 2 shows up in the near future and I can get it cheap, I  might  give it a second chance--but I can't help but feel a little burned by this one.
7299	0	a	Being a huge fan of puzzle games, I can say that this is easily one of the most boring puzzle games I've ever played. There is barely a story, and puzzles don't makes sense half of the time.
7300	0	a	Games doesn't feel fluid, physics isn't enjoyable and pace is slow and boring.
7301	0	a	Really Boring
7302	0	a	Quite monotone and boring.
7303	0	a	boring platformer with monotonous music, i expected much more...

7305	0	a	The art style and presentation is cute and unique, the gimmicks and mechanics of the game are cool, and the puzzles are absolutely insipid and confusing. Not confusing in the good way either. I will say that the one shining point of the game is the boss 'battles.' They are actually more puzzles in and of themselves, but very hostile ones that you will feeling not unlike The Doctor in the way you outsmart them.  Pass on this. You've played a puzzle platformer before, right?
7306	0	a	Don't be fooled, the Inconsistent Puzzle and Platforming Really throws off the few unique elements this game has, a bit more work and this game could've been great instead of subpar.
7307	0	a	It is a beautiful game, the puzzles are great, however, a good game need far more than just puzzles....

8185	0	a	The good news is that the light RPG elements are actually pretty entertaining and kept me playing for a few hours. There isn't a ton of depth to them, but they're thought out well enough to give some focus and direction to what you're doing on the puzzle side of the game and break it up a bit. The story is nothing to write home about, but it moves the game along.  I might've kept playing it on and off despite some annoyances (e.g. fighting multiple enemies at once that spam status effects effectively forcing you down an upgrade path that gives you an easy way to clear things like blind/poison), but my inability to see what was going on really started to get in the way after a while. This is one of the few games where my partial color blindness has been a significant problem (especially with the blue/purple gems), and it could've been avoided without even adding a color blind mode. Just making the different gems different shapes would've made an enormous difference. It also really, really doesn't help that things like the poison symbol cover up most of the colored area of the gems, which makes it a lot harder at a glance to tell what you need to match them with to clear them.
8186	0	a	This game looks cute and beautiful, and seems to be a nice match-3 game mingled with RPG element. However, if you are looking for a game like the Puzzle Quest series, you won't find anything that can even see the dust at the tail of PQ; you should get 10,000,000/you must build a boat instead, which are much better than the Legened of Fae. For the first several levels, the game may be interesting, but after that, the combat becomes quickly repetitive and the story progresses very slowly. The seemingly level-up system does not work well, as it does not give you the feeling of becoming stronger and more versatile in battles (the effects of the combo spells and summons are not worth the efforts for casting them). In addition, most monsters in later stages have special abilities, which makes the circumstances in combat chaotic. The music is just so so; the sound effect is alright at first, but after a handful of battles this rapidly become old and annoying due to the lackness of variation.
8187	0	a	This started promising but the controlls and the level up grid got too frustating.   The story is cute but the sphere grid system needs to be reworked.   I wanted to like this game and I am a big fan of the puzzle + story genre.
8188	0	a	Fairly good game. Terrible dialogue. I first played this about two years ago and it annoyed me a lot. It is basically bejeweled, but with a story mushed in. The battles are fun at first, but eventually get boring and tedious. I find myself wondering why I put myself through the battles when I know there is another right behind it.   4.5/10
8189	0	a	Recommended to wait and see if any bug fixes are coming before purchasing.  A nice idea for a game that is hampered by bugs and a couple typos two years after release. The biggest example I can see is that only the first save file works, so unless you find this out beforehand, you'll lose all progress when you close the game. The last update was about a month ago which is nice fo a game released in 2011, but the lack of developer communication on the steam forums could be a bad sign for bug-fixing.  Otherwise, when the game works as intended, it's a pretty fun Puzzle Quest-styled game where you can just play in short sessions. Like with Puzzle Quest, the gem-switching combat is the main draw rather than the story.
8190	0	a	This game is kinda crap. Annoying enemies, slow transitions, music that loops abruptly and too often, and far too many battles per stage. Making large combos with gems serves no point since your mana capacity is extremely low, so the bejewelled-esque half of the game has no depth to it.  Also, you have to match gems to WALK. Why.
8191	0	a	What do you do when the latest puzzle quest is a stupid Pay to win scam? You find an alternative.  Legend of Fae is one alternative, though this actually was released well befored Marvel Puzzel Quest, but I have just learned of this thanks to an Indie Royale Bundle. While I'm not generally into match three games, match three hybrids always catch my attention (self Note, need to play more Gyromancer)  Despite Valve's tendency to improperly label games, this is also an RPG of sorts, due the battle system and skill tree.  The game is about a girl named Claudia, with a disease that caused her to loose her leg, and now due to a replacement leg she gained, caused her to walk with a limp. Since she isn't able to farm like her parents, she ends up staying with her Uncle who is an engineer and has a magical latern that we later learn that only Claudia is able to figure out. This latern, for some reason allows her to match color gems and gain mana 'Puzzle Quest style' for spells (this may have been explained somehow and I may have just missed it). Though, gems are switched with a horizontal cursor like Tetris Attack, which unfortunately can put you in a position where you can't match the gems you needs for half a minute or longer, which is awful admist battle. While the story isn't going to win any awards, it's certainly a much more interesting start than 'The world is under attack from the Big Bad' (which isn't to say that won't happen later in the game).  The game overworld is a linear path that does appear to have some forks/deviations later in the road. Each level involves moving Claudia to the other end of the level, encountering battles along the way. Movement is performed by matching a total of 4 purple gems to move her to the next section, which could be another walk point or battle. Battles are fought by clicking the enemy you want to target and ordering an elemental Fae friend to attack it, provided you have enough mana from matching corresponding gems. You eventually encounter varying enemy types, such as defensive lizard type enemies that cast barrier spells to protect the enemy party and flying enemies that can only be attacked once they are knocked down by your wind elemental. This adds a interesting layer of strategy, requiring you attack certain enemies before others and do so quicky, but this also means they are pratically invincible if you don't have wind gems in the proper place to line up. The flying enemies are rather annoying since you are sometimes in scenarios of matching random gems for lengthy segments, causing you to potentially lose at the target time and be attacked in the process. (This is a decent challenge actually, but iritating when all your enemies are flying). The fact that attacking is so dependent on elements (and there's no alternative means of attack) means that you will often run into situations where you don't have the gems you need to attack, dodge, or heal yourself in time, and the best strategy is to constantly spam gem switches just to get new gems. This goes against the games spellpower mechanic, which rewards you with extra damage for only swapping gems that cause chains.  You can also succumb to status effects such as poison (which causes damage and corrupts certain gems) or blindness, which makes all but the grey focus gems black, requring you to use any mind gems you already have on the field (From previously matched focus gems), constantly match random gems until you can match focus gems, or wait until the blindness fades. Another reviewer mentioned that the difficulty of the later game essentially forces you down a specific skill path, which, if true, essentially defeats the purpose for a custom skill tree. I have somewhat witnessed the fact that you are so often bombared with status effects, that it can be impossible to match the gems you need to survive, or at least you may be able to survive, but you certainly won't beat the expert time limit. Thankfully, you can easily respec at the cost of one spare part (which unfortunately, is costly since you only get one per completed level).  The art style is pretty, and evokes memories of well animated 2D adventure games. Unfortunately, that art only looks so good at it's native windowed resolution, as fullscreen stretches the game to pixelization, and there are NO resolution options. Other bad design choices including the annoying poison effect, which makes affected gems partially purple (as shown in the first Steam screenshot), which is very confusing in combat and makes it harder than needed to remove the effect and the total lack of colorblind mode or different gem shapes to make the game more accessible (thankfully, this isn't a direct problem for me, and at least different gems have different colors). The soundtrack, while fitting for this game and servicable for a budget title like this, is largely forgettable right down to the battle music, which sounds like they were going for something exciting, but doesn't get there. It's not remotely bad, just meh.  I played the game on hard, which may have been a mistake, as when I got to level 18, I reached a point where my speed wasn't able to keep up with the constant bombardment of status effects and attacks - no amount of healing spells could save me, especially when the cannons from the gremlin cave took 3/4ths of my health, and the only way to mitigate this is through matching purple gems to dodge their attacks, which of course, the game was stingy to provide them to me when I need them most. Considering I can only swap gems left and right, and can't do so in every direction like other similar games, this is cruel when your survival depends on it. This makes me wonder if the dev playtested the viability of all the skill tree setups - as it seemed impossible to complete, and I was matching gems very quickly. This is the part where I'm unsure to give this game a Yes or a No, as it is pretty good, but this major drawback makes it too hard. Normal difficulty is likely more bearable and you may need to find a guide on the best built (I'm thinking it's going to be the earth tree) .  I think I have to lean towards no based on my experience with the hard difficulty - playing it made me feel that the developer didn't properly make sure that any skill path is viable to complete the game.
8192	0	a	The last time I played a match 3 game, all I could think about was 'I sure wish I could only swap tiles horizontally while trying to hit elemental weaknesses'.  Legend of Fae not only has mediocre graphics and reuses the same sounds as Valdis Story but tedious and tiresome.
8193	0	a	its a bit too glitchy to play hard mode
8194	0	a	A lot like puzzle quest, in that it's bejeweled with some extra ♥♥♥♥ tacked on to make it even more addicting. The kind of game you resent for not being really very good, but still you find yourself playing for hours.
8195	0	a	The game is inherently not bad, but the formula is executed in a boring and not very exciting way. I would expect a bit more hence I cannot recommend, but if you like a slower interpretation of 'match 3' games this one will be ok for you.
8196	0	a	This puzzler is a limited form of Bejewelled with a weak clicktext plot to 'motivate' you to play their version of Bejewelled. Click the orbs to put the same colours together, with the mild added goal of collecting different colours to progress the story along (which you will probably click through).   Graphics: Simple but workable enough. They didn't go retro and they hired an artist of some kind, although the assets are fairly low quality.  Gameplay: Bejewelled. Ripping off someone else's idea for a game doesn't get thumbs up.   Technical: The game works and is stable but there's no graphics support for 4K. The game is simple enough that it can run on a tablet or in a web browser.  There's no justification for this being on Steam and no justification for asking to be paid for porting a tablet game to PC. There's no justification for just ripping off Bejewelled. If you like Bejewelled, play it. Or Candy Crush. But if that appeals to you, you're probably not on Steam at all.
8197	0	a	This is the new Bad Rats. It's terrible. Don't buy it.
8198	0	a	This game is not very good. The game is incredibly short, the artstyle is not that great after 15 seconds and the controls are completely awful and extremely slippery.  Plus the game bugged out on me repeatedly.
8199	0	a	It can't seem to find its own style, it tries too hard to be Castle Crashers, while trying to look like Limbo. Trying to be hilarious by being whacky solely for the sake of being whacky, it just doesn't have any flair. Jokes that an unwell 3 year old could write between brain operations with all the charm of a half eaten burrito hanging shamefully out out of the bin from the night before.  The controls are sloppy, nauseating and plain awkward. You know you're doing something wrong when every level feels like the ICE LEVEL! Slip slide and clunk your way across the same looking backdrops with a slightly different colour hew each time.  I'd put this in a room somewhere with Bad Rats as company, equally as poor.
8200	0	a	This game was so unbearable. I could've beat it in less than 2 hours, but the clunky and slippery controls prevented me from enjoying the game. I really dislike the style and look of this game, maybe they shouldve made it more of a comic book/cartoony look. The most I remember from looking at this game are the dark shadows contrasting against the bright background, to it's disadvantage.   I remember nothing from playing this game at all. I just remember being really unsatisfied. Don't buy this game full price, but just don't buy this game at all. I can see that this could've been way better than what it was, but sadly it just sucks.
8201	0	a	quite possibly the worst thing anybody could spend their money on

8209	0	a	Fowl Space has a creative concept, but the developers haven't put enough time into the game. I found myself not touching the keyboard, yet having the chicken continue to move and shoot on its' own. I hope for future updates and bug fixes, but i won't play more until then. To anyone who thinks this might be a good game, well, it's 49 cents for a reason.

If that string of words does not immediately grab your attention, then there is no reason for you to play this game. The game is capped at 25 FPS, the level design is unchallenging, and the sound design is very, very weak. Fowl Space is a Flash game that should have stayed on Armor Games.

8224	0	a	As the wise Uncle Yem i have proven this game to be classic piece of knish from last night that mama forgot to put in the fridge cause her shows were on and had better things to, then when you get up the next morning you smell the onions and the rotten potatoes and think to your self..'mama is a piece of ♥♥♥♥ just like this knish lying here on the table'. So this game is my careless mother's responsibility in cleaning up the left over knishes.

8232	0	a	Boring, and I could find something similiar for free on a flash games website.  From the short 11 minutes I spent playing this game, I didn't enjoy it. Obviously.  The mechanics were clunky, everything felt like it was in slow-mo. This weird goo-spitting gun on your back you use to attack enemies with a chance for blind them and have them run around confused and blind. You can also charge up the gun to do a shotgun blast. The amount of pellets depends on how long you hold the attack button.  The goo-gun isn't fun, it doesn't have any kind of impact. You just click, some goo spits out, possibly hits enemy, apparently they take damage and after consecutive goo-shots they die. Great.  The game's level design is boring and there's a shape-shifting background that will probably give players a feeling of motion sickness because it's always shifting and fluctuating 2 different colors that change based on events happening in the game.  I got this game intially because it seemed crude, quirky, and fun. Also because the banner 'FOWL SPACE' with that cool-looking colored chicken next to it looked pretty rad. Though I felt a little silly after noticing everythings black and white on the foreground, then grey in the middle-background. Then the actual background is two random colors. So visually the game isn't appeasing to look at, at least. They didn't do anything artistically interesting with the colors. The idle animations on the vikings look pretty nice, but everything is blown up and blurry and fuzzy. Clearly wasn't made for full screen. the second you window the game it shrinks down significantly and then you can see how the actual and only resolution for the game is.  There's random collectables in the game, like you can collect mens and womens underwear and bra's? For some reason..  And you can collect hats, which. I guess the hat collecting isn't that awful, at least it's something you can look for and switch up your appearance a little.  I think it's kind of funny how there's a speedrun timer in the game, cause yes. Someone's going to run your buggy, slow-mo game with enemies that do too much damage (roughly 4-5 hits and you're dead, the vikings do some pretty spammy moves that can come cross as cheap as the game moves too slowly and they move significantly faster than everything when doing their spin attacks. Which since your running speed is ♥♥♥, jumping's the only option and since the attack is pretty anti-air. ...you get the idea.)  I don't know, I guess I expected a fun, quirky, fast-paced and short game. Turns out the game was in-fact short. Because I stopped playing it pretty quickly, ending the game immediately.  Also the music is boring and bland and runs on a pretty glaringly obvious loop that just adds to the overall dullness of the game.   Regardless, this game isn't fun, I bought it on a really cheap price and it wasn't worth it. There's much better games out there for you to play, like you know all of those free to play games on steam? Play those! Wicked fun! and FREE!   Hell, flash games are fun too. Here's one of my  favorite flash games to-date.  [www.kongregate.com]   Bada boom, you have a flash game, fowl space is a failure of a game. And it costs money. And that game I hyperlinked is a successful flash game and is a fun platformer, it's a touch buggy and a touch slow. Still a good time and still will kill a few hours and you'll feel kind of cozy and nice once you beat it. So now that you played a nice flash game, DON'T BUY this BAD flash game! Yay!   Anyways, thanks for reading my review, hope this helped in your decision in whether or not you want to buy this game. Have a good one.
8233	0	a	This... this is a game... a really really bad one. I honestly think it could have been something that could have been kind of funny but... instead they decided to make as many sexual puns as they could. So many in fact that I don't even think a 10 year old who just discovered what this dangly thing in between his legs are, would cringe while playing this game. The gameplay... is way o forgiving, there is a death counter but it doesn't matter because no matter where you die there is no punishment you spawn literally right where you died with full health. Honestly dying is a Pro Tip I give for you 'MLG' gamers out there. Bottom line this game is horrible, the music assualts your ears the gameplay is horrible and THE JOKES OHHH GOD!  1/10  10/10 IGN

8235	0	a	Fowl Space is a platforming game that wants to mix classical games with the platformers of today but is it a game you will want to check out ? In Fowl Space you play as a chicken who goes to a Sun station to destroy it. But is it good ? The game has to be one of the worst platformers on Earth. The game has a terrible platforming segments that barely work and one of the shortest games on the planet clocking in around an 1 hour of entertainment if you can call it that. The game is played like a 2D side scroller with some shooting mechanics attached to it. The game is so easy you can finish it in around an hour. The game is riddled with bugs that make some segments hard to beat. If you liked the game in the first place theres some challenges rooms to play but theyre so boring it will make you want to shoot yourself in the head. The game has a painfully dull soundtrack that will make youre ears bleed. Graphiclly the game looks like nothing special all of it is black presented on a coulour background the platforms and where you can go mix with the enviroments and it becomes difficult to navigate. Overall this game is amazingly bad and how did they mess it up is beyond me. Bad music, mediocre graphics, and bad gameplay overall this game is a game that you should pick up if you like bad games but to everyone else STAY AWAY i give Fowl Space a 2.5/10

8237	0	a	The only problem with this game is that instead of being a couple of 4 and a half ton floppy ♥♥♥♥♥ shooting white substances in the face of the bad guys you can only play as one. No one wants to be this lewd alone.
8238	0	a	The controls are very slippery and even non-responsive at times. You'll often find yourself stuck in midair -- unable to move until you get hit enough times. The enemies and level design are boring and generic, and, unless you find old internet memes funny, there's not much to laugh at either. I got to the boss for the second stage before calling it quits.

8240	0	a	This Game Is Fowl Get It Its A Joke
8241	0	a	Phone App and should be labeled as such.
8242	0	a	 ...What?   No really, what? This is the whole thing? The replay value only lasts for about 3 minutes.
8243	0	a	Fowl Space is a weird game with familiar gameplay and a strange art style. It is a basic 2D shooter that seems easy but fun. That is until the game start to lag and it only gets worse from there. The movement controls start to act up and continue to move after you let go of the button. Worst of all I encountered a game breaking bug at the end of the second level where the boss zoomed out more and more until the game said level complete even though I did not win. This also prevented me from continuing to play due to it somehow preventing me from selecting level and pressing resume just continued the glitch. Even if you get past all of this the game can’t be more than 3 hours long because it only has 5 levels and I completed the first two in less than one. Even for only 5 dollars it doesn’t seem worth it. Just avoid this game and look at my other recommendations if you want something better.
8244	0	a	This game made me feel many emotions none of them was joy. I bought it because it was 49 cents. every one thinks that what you squirt is milk... trust me it is not. DON'T GET IT.

8247	0	a	Achron is a very interesting concept for a strategy game. If you like seeing entirely new mechanics for games, Achron is definitely something to pick up. However, obvious pitfalls make this game incredibly...tiresome.   The Good:  The time mechanics in the game are interesting, and  mostly  intuitive. Travelling throughout a 7 minute time period (5-6 minutes behind, 1-2 minutes ahead), you can see things that have happened, and can  actually  change the events that have happened. If you have problems with understanding, 'What happened with that group?' you can just rewind to see why that occurred. The interface is also intuitive enough so you can understand when some things happen. Movement, orders, and normal actions doesn't deviate from the norm in top-down strategy games, so a player that plays other top-down strategy (Supreme Commander, Command &amp; Conquer, etc.) will not see any kind of problems getting into this game.   The Bad:  The interface needs some serious tweaks to understand your actions, and what your actions in the timeline are affecting. Its also extremely hard to tell when your changes are getting propagated to the present when it has nothing to do with unit on unit combat. If you (or another time traveller) jumps back to the past, makes a change, and you (in the future), could see a change that doesn't exactly make sense (such as a building or unit not getting built). While you do have the ability to jump into the past and see the changes why, the user interface incredibly lacks when, why and how things are getting modified.   Pathing in this game is also a joke. Most games, you can just right-click the location and they will path around obstacles. However, in Achron, if you right click on the right side of the map, and in the center is a one-entrance gully, which they have to go to the North or South to avoid, they will enter the gully, and get stuck on the eastern edge of the gully and stop, without trying to repath. Also, groups have hard times keeping together, since formations do not exist. Friendly 'nudging' to get out of the way of a building being built, or a tank trying to get through a line of friendly soldiers, does not exist. Even with this garbage pathing, one unit can only have five orders active at one time.  The unit creation queues are also a joke. You can manage it once its in the queue effectively, and the queue is hard to understand, with health bars on the queue for some odd reason. Its hard to tell if something is made for a purpose or not, and the creation of buildings with the wrong unit mentions 'at a higher cost,' but fails to tell you how much it costs. Also, if you place down one building, that area is not 'reserved' for other friendly units to not build buildings on that spot, so you'll run into the issue that you might build where a building is going to go.  The fact that you can't stop Major characters from moving to repair/help build unless they are leagues away annoys me considerably. I can't count the times in which the main characters (that aren't supposed to die) broke formation to heal a front-line unit, and ended up getting killed, requiring me to go back in time to tell them run away.  Teleporters are also really terrible. Rather than teleporting units as close as possible to the specified point, they are teleported anywhere within a 20 block radius from the chosen point, creating problems that units end up on top of impassible terrain, or in the middle of canyons, unable to get out, even with a nearby teleporter.  The game also takes control too early for major objectives, using the simulated 'future time' (1-2 minutes in the future) to determine when an objective is finished. Because of this, it causes major characters to die because the computer takes control of the characters and moves them out of formation, requiring you to go back in time to rectify it after the unskippable cutscene ends. Also, unskippable cutscenes (which doesn't pause the game while doing it) in game.   The Ugly:  Its evident that they worked on the time-manipulation system for 90% of the time. Maps are built incorrectly; they have impassible 85 degree inclines with textures that resemble a rock formation rather than walls that are textured properly. The large walls, which are blended together with the floor patterns, make the inside of ships and buildings look like outside with just really steep walls.  Voice acting and story, I would say that its really dumb. Okay, that's being generous, the storyline is probably one of the weakest things in the game. Game introduces Tyr, an AI, but people talk to it like a person when it comes out, makes it confusing when Tyr is introduced as an AI later on. When you encounter another AI later on, everyone treats that same type of AI as the enemy, despite Tyr being that same type of AI. Events in the game occur in reasonable order, instead things happen that suit what the storyline needs at that point in time. Even when a chapter switches, which makes you go to another race and control it (ala Starcraft), is disjointed, problematic, anti-climactic and dumb. Character moods are inconsistent, and flat. Voice acting is lifeless, and I find myself skipping cutscenes just so I don't have to listen to characters that I don't care about drone on and on, making me more sleepy than when Ben Stein is talking.   Overall:  Achron is a great and new game element into a game that would be great as a concept game, but fails to excite with lackluster AI, UI, Storyline and Voice Acting. 3/10.
8248	0	a	The game will run past the Create Profile screen, it will not actually create a profile. I cannot get the game to run past that. Uninstall.. Reinstall.. No Change.. Even on my other computers.
8249	0	a	Game is probably too complicated for those not willing to invest much time learning it.
8250	0	a	Unplayable due to constant crashes to desktop.
8251	0	a	Cool concept attached to a terrible sub-par RTS. Do not recommend, even if the concept allures you. It did me too, but it wasn't enough to save the game. The pathfinding is gross, the unit animations are practically nonexistent and the units feel no different from each other.
8252	0	a	Are you looking for a strategy game which involves intense tactical action across time? If you are, then you can keep looking, because this isn't it.  Interestingly enough, the main issue with Achron is the time travel mechanics themselves. In theory it sounds about right: Use future knowledge to plan your strategy, or fix past mistakes. It worked well enough for Prince of Persia. Where could it possibly go wrong?  Time waves. That's where it first starts going horribly wrong. In theory, you should be able to jump to the past, make a few fixes, and then jump back to the present and see the results, right? Wrong. You have to wait for the 'time wave' to hit, and erase the incorrect present. And how long would that take? Well, as long as you've jumped back. The time waves only move at double speed compared to normal playing. During that time, you have to play in the past, at double speed, or at least re-watch it. You can't keep playing in the present, because as soon as the time-wave hits, many of your orders will actually be wrong for the situation, if they remain valid at all. And that's assuming that the units to whichyou need to give orders even exist in the present. You can't just wait, either, because the present doesn't stop, and by the time the time wave reaches that 'future event' to which you were reacting, it is already, itself, far in the past. So, even if you only make one change, and let everything else play out without interaction, you still have to play in the past just to continue from the same spot that was previously the present. It probably wouldn't be so bad if time waves moved at 5 or 10 times the speed of normal play.  Most of the time, it's best to just play in the present, or even a bit in the future. If you need to 'undo past mistakes', save games work much better than time travel. Of course, this all goes flying out the window once you have an achronal enemy. The AI seems to thrive on playing in the past. And every time the enemy makes a change, you have to go back and re-watch the whole thing, because it's enough that one of your units moved 3 inches left for most of your future commands to not work. And there's nothing more annoying than taking out the last of your enemy units, only for a time-wave to hit and suddenly your whole army is gone and you don't know why. Be prepared to watch the timeline UI VERY closely, because it's not too obvious when major changes occur. And, of course, if you notice it only when it hits the present, then it is far too late to go back and fix things, since, as said before, time waves are VERY slow.  Once you get past the idea of having to replay or at least review the same section of time over and over, you're hit with chrono-energy. In a time when most RTS players pride themselves on their click-rate, you get a game that actually tells you that the number of clicks you have is limited, and horribly so. Forget micro-managed tactics, it'd be too easy for the enemy to screw them all up by changing one tiny thing, and it would cost too much chrono-energy to undo and redo them when that happens. It probably wouldn't be so bad if you were just limited to not making too many CHANGES to the past. But, as noted above, you are often forced to play completely in the past, unable to jump back to the present, so you're actually being limited on the number of actual practical things you can do throughout play.  But the worst part isn't in how little control you're allowed, but rather how the game tries to compensate for it. It seems like decades of RTS evolution were thrown down the drain, and instead you get a control scheme that is worse than what Dune 2 had. Since group commands cost as much chrono-energy as individual commands, you're supposed to organize units into 'hierarchies', where giving orders to 'the leader' gives that order to the rest of the group. As tedious as it is to arrange these heirarchies, it becomes even worse to control them. Beside having to keep track of 'whose the leader', be sure that a command asking them all to move to one place will send them all scattering in all directions. And yeah, by the way, if going up against an achronal enemy, you can be sure your leader will be targetted back in time, rendering all of your commands invalid. Sure would have been easier to spot major time waves if the 'advanced timeline UI' had an indicator for 'given a command to a dead unit'. The units also have individual AIs so that you won't have to give them commands to do every little thing. Too bad the AI is horrible, forcing you to waste tons of chrono-energy trying to tell your units NOT to move. Too bad there's no 'stop' command. There's an 'idle' command, which basically means 'stop doing what I say, and go commit suicide instead'. I'm not asking for Supreme Commander level of unit AI and control here, I'd just settle for my units following orders. And all that is AFTER you've the 'undo' command - the command you are going to be using the most, as you repeatedly replay the same section of events.  Once you take away the utterly broken time mechanics, what you're left with is a rather poorly balanced strategy game, with really poor controls. There are a few units which are clearly more powerful than anything else, and they aren't significantly more expensive to create. In fact, some of them are actually cheaper than other units. A group of 5 octoligos or twin MARs can take out most anything. Except for an army of MCBs or black birds. Units with self-repair tend to have the most broken balance, as they are neigh-invincible, so long as you can convince them not to move too far from each other (See: Horrible controls). I guess that's the reason only the humans have them. I spent most of chapter 3 just making sure the one MCB I had was free to join the fight, since it was usually a game-breaker. Oddly enough, I got an achievement for it, even though it was the most obvious thing to do. If you're thinking of creating mixed armies of aerial and ground units with anti-air and anti-ground, you can forget it. It would require too much micro-management to use these properly, and that, as noted before, gets screwed over fast, thanks to the time mechanics. You'd think the per-unit AI, given that it's probably intended to reduce the need for micro-management, would do something useful, like targetting aerial units with anti-air and ground units with anti-ground, but it seems to more often do the exact opposite. Fact is, it's better to just have a large enough all-purpose army, which can simply be told to go from point A to point B and destroy everything in its path. That tactic works WAY better than it should. Probably because, no matter how many times the enemy replays the battle with the overly large army, there is nothing it can do to prevent the resulting annihilation.  The main counter-measure the game offers to the 'large enough army of all the same unit' is limited resources. And most maps sure do limit resources. Of course, there's nothing like using every last resource to build a huge army, destroying all of the enemy's units, and then getting a surprise mission to 'build this and that' with resources you no longer have.  So, having covered how bad the game is all on its own, let's get started on the bugs. And this game sure is rife with them.  Let's start with the simplest one: Windowed mode does not work. I mean, it works, but the graphics are scaled based on the total window size, including the title. This makes the top of the screen be cut off. Too bad that's exactly where your resources are shown. The thing is, this should have been the first thing that should have shown up on even the simplest QA. It's like no one even tested if the game manages to go to windowed mode.  There's more I'd like to say, but it seems I'm out of room in this review (Why is this limited?). Suffice to say, there are worse bugs, but not enough space left. You have been warned.
8253	0	a	This game shows a highly innovative, I'd even say genius mechanic of time travel in a real-time strategy - something no one has done before or since (up to 2015). In short, you can give orders to units in the past and in the future, and there are 'update waves' which travel at about 3x faster than normal time. Also you can teleport units across the battlefield with teleporters and into the past/future with chronoporters. So, basically, you can do tricks by sending units into the past to help their older doubles and so on - use your imagination. This sounds like an amazing game decades ahead of its time, but sadly its poorly designed tutorial and heavily scripted missions will turn off most players and make them drop the game in frustration. I heard good things about multiplayer but you won't find anyone thru the lobby, only thru forums of this game's fans, which are in short supply.  I could endure only the demo and 3 missions, even restarted the game and played them once again to understand the mechanics better. And though I did understand how this game works with some effort, I doubt many gamers even would.  Too many units are introduced too fast. The tutorial popups ask you to do stuff but don't let you do it before you press OK which actually hides the instructions about what you need to do. The scripted events take control off from you unexpectedly, place new units and give orders to other units, creating even more confusion than the already complex time-traveling system. While the control is taken away from you, characters are talking and the battle goes on. This feels like a nuthouse. Sometimes you aren't even sure if what has just happened is a bug, a scripted event or a game mechanic in action.  I found the story trashy, though if you have nostalgic feelings for Star Wars (I don't), you may find it ok, as even the main character has the name 'Luke'. The 2D art is amateurish and, together with this Star Wars-like setting gives this game a 'trashy' feel, like it was a school project done by teenagers - while the ingenuous combat system of this game deserved so much more. The 3D units are hard to tell from each other. The ground is covered with big uniform textures taken from some free online libraries, with strange lighting and huge, almost unit-sized bumps and long black shades in which smaller units get lost. The huge low-polygonal terrain objects look ugly next to tiny, much more detailed units. The air units hover so high above that you can't see where exactly they are located in relation to ground units (and their shades are shifted) - and where you need to bring your anti-air units so that they could fire at those air units. The controls are clumsy, the GUI is poor, with too few tips. The music is pretty good though.  The game introduces an interesting mechanic of grouping units with hierarchies of command - which also allows you to save on orders while giving orders in the past or the future (the number of orders you can give is limited by 'chronoenergy'). But hierarichies don't work well, as units following a leader don't have a fixed formation, tend to spread and walk in ever expanding crowds which leads to edge units getting killed with no one helping them because the rest of the formation is out of range and won't come to assist other units in the formation.  Save files get corrupted and don't load, so if you fail (e.g. in the very first mission 8+ marines must survive in a fight which comes unexpectedly) you may have to restart the whole mission. Missions are long and heavily scripted, sometimes the instructions are given while you are busy fighting and fail to concentrate.   Voice acting is amateurish and lifeless, as if the actors were bored/annoyed with the story as much as I did. When you click on the timeline (an innovative tool to show the battlefield's states up to 5 mins ago and after), it takes the game 1-2 seconds to load the state of the battlefield at that time point which makes the whole thing feel clumsy, especially when you are already stressed by struggling with this complex game and its heavily script-influenced mission objectives.  Btw I bought the game some time in 2014 and it had all graphics glitched on my laptop (AMD Radeon HD 7670M video card), but it finally ran on my new desktop computer which has GeForce GTX 970. I think the devs need to try a Kickstarter campaign to get funding for Achron 2 and make a proper game on the same concept this time.
8254	0	a	Don't be fooled. This game might look interesting with its time travel mechanic, but that's precisely where the interest ends. It might be interesting if an actual  good  RTS used these mechanics, but instead we have this. It's as if the developpers spent all of their time working on the time travel mechanic and simply ran out of time to make the rest of the game up to par. However, if you are interested in video game design, then I would in fact recommend this game as a learning experience. Pick it apart, see where it fails, come up with a better system to utilize the time travel mechanic, possibly.
8255	0	a	Don't get me wrong, this game's concept is great, but the game just isn't finished.  The graphics are extremely unoptimized since it uses a custom 3D/game engine.  Moreover, the tutorial goes way too quickly: rather than introducing the elements of the game one by one, it just throws everything it's got at you right away. The game does nothing to explain how to make effective use of time manipulation mechanics (e.g. why you should never stay constantly 1:30 from present), where buttons are, what they even do, an introduction to the game's story, etc.  Supposedly, the campaign broke in a patch, so hardly any singleplayer except if you want to play against bots. That said, this game isn't really worth buying/playing if you never understood it in the first place.
8256	0	a	Look at all the reviews! Save yourself! Don't buy this game!  Such a great concept, but such a bad game. Starts off slow, and you will be too frustrated at the game to figure out if it picks up. It seems like a time travel game would have amazing amounts of freedom to beat each level however you would like. But not this game. You must click exactly how it (very vaguely) tells you. Don't exactly understand how you were supposed to click? Then you can wander aimlessly for hours, because you aren't going to beat the level until you move your troops exactly where it told you. The second level is best described by the constant beeping (a bug that constantly checks to see if your units are in the right spot, and beeps if they are not), and slow wandering of your troops around the map. Also included are two unavoidable deaths so you can learn the game mechanics, one painfully slow click at a time. I was really excited about this game, but now I am just frustrated that I own it.
8257	0	a	Would have loved this game to be good. The concept is amazing, but the gameplay is just so unpolished and so.. boring most of the time, I just can't recommend it.
8258	0	a	Mutiplayer doesnt work
8259	0	a	The overall mechanic of traveling through time seemed like a no-brainer for a really cool RTS title. Achron just seems overall really boring to me.  If I could get my money back, I would.
8260	0	a	This is hardly a game.
8261	0	a	Unplayable due to bugs. Avoid.
8262	0	a	Was really looking forward to this game.   IT DOES NOT WORK. WILL NOT LOAD.   And if you DO get it to load.... don't waste your time, look it up on youtube if you really want to see it.  -3/10
8263	0	a	its bad. real bad.
8264	0	a	Quite possibly the greatest disappointment of all time, even if you think it's a good price at £4.15 for 2, it isn't. The game is tedious, overly complicated, looks awful and does not give you anywhere near enough satisfaction for your actions because half the time it seems so random.
8265	0	a	Interesting exercise in time twavellin', or rather time alteration as you don't actually move your units back in time, but you go back in time and move your units. Sadly the 'RTS bit' is not very satisfactory; in particular the animations/graphical depiction of combat are/is very unjolly. You barely notice that units shoot.
8266	0	a	Great concept! I really wish I was able to like this game. I overlooked the graphics, the horrible sound effects, the bad menues because ♥♥♥♥ing time-travel based RTS! How awesome is that! Well, I played, and made it halfway through the painful endless slow-♥♥♥ walking that was the tutorial level... to die in the last endless walk and have to completely restart the mission, at that point, I said 'No' and uninstalled the game.  If they made or re-made another achron with nicer asthetics(Not graphics, asthetics) and probably just made it with a new and better game engine, it would probably be a groundbreaking 10/10 RTS, but it just isn't, because it's lacking in everything that isn't gameplay.
8267	0	a	I was excited for the novelty of this game and was ultimately disapointed. I didn't give it much of a chance, but it wasn't very fun from what I played.
8268	0	a	There's a neat concept here, but sadly no content to use it on. The game has a very limited stock level set, unfulfilled promises of a level editor, and absolutely barren multiplayer servers. At the end of the day, even with its intriguing visual style and gameplay concept, it's just not worth it.
8269	0	a	Poor controls and very boring. Feels like an early access game that was abandoned before any content was added. Also, multiplayer either doesn't work or nobody plays, probably both.
8270	0	a	It has a Xotic kind of feel to it, but doesn't offer anything remotely that good. There's supposed to be a multiplayer element, but without any people playing it, this game doesn't have anything to deliver, except disappointment.
8271	0	a	inMomentum is one of those games that is a crebral feast of a platformer. Visually intensive as well as staggering in scale and scope. It makes you put every ounce of your capacity of lateral thinking into dancing and skipping across the massive, suspended maps in the fastest times possible, and punishes your dumb ♥♥♥ if you messed up a jump.  This is a GREAT game. But sadly.......inMomentum is a huge disappointment.  The game's trailer touts its 'Competitive First-Person Racing', 'Various Game Modes' with 'Over 30 Achievements'. But at time of writing the online multiplayer does not work, this in only one mode of play, and the achievements might as well as place holders because they have no funciton. Basically the game is not finished, and this almost throws me into a rage, because this is a FANTASTIC game, but if I can't play with other people Its nothing but a pointless time sink. I had bought this game with one steam friend specifically in mind who would go bananas for a game like this. But I can't play with them because the online is essentially broken.   So until the developer fixes it, inMomentum is an awesome, paid beta.
8272	0	a	I want to like this game, but there are a few things holding it back:  1) It just doesn't feel tight enough. Slipping at the same hurdle for the hundredth time is fine if you have a solid system where you can count your mistakes and rectify them--think Dark Souls, Super Meat Boy et al--but when you're slipping here and floating there it makes for a very frustrating experience.  2) There's nothing to the single player. Honestly, it's not worth bothering with unless you're aiming to practice for multiplayer, because what you get is a set of empty arenas.  3) They've made some strange graphical choices. In places it's borderline beautiful--a cross between Mirror's Edge and Marble Blast--and then you've got this horribly saturated collection of glares for an avatar.
8273	0	a	MULTIPLAYER IS NOT WORKING. ♥♥♥♥ING STEAM CHEATED ME.
8274	0	a	Feels like a poor version of Mirror's Edge. In this you have no sense of weight or presence and the controls just feel too floaty for my liking. Shame because graphically it certainly feels like a mix of Rez and Mirror's Edge. Honestly I wouldn't recommend this.
8275	0	a	It's like a bad Mirror's Edge.
8276	0	a	The default controls are really awkward and difficult to get used to. They can be customized, but there's just so many of them it is not really worth the effort. Just expect a steep learning curve if you play. This flaw could be easily fixed if the game just had controller support.  Once you do learn the controls, you realize the game doesn't have much to offer. There are only 12 levels and you do exactly the same thing in all of them. The two solo game modes are literally identical, and the 4 game difficulty levels create no perceptible changes to the levels, so they might as well be identical too.   The game clearly tailors to multiplayer races; however, no one is every playing multiplayer so the main source of content the game offers can never be accessed.  Solo is boring. Multiplayer is impossible. inMomentum is an all-around failure of a game.
8277	0	a	A nightmare. Feels like they took the Xen platforming sections of Half Life 1 and based a whole game around them. Clunky and awkward and miserable. Certified Bundle Crap.
8278	0	a	I wanted to like this game. The videos made it look like great fun. However in practice, the controls were abysmal.  I instantly struggled with them, and even after a few minutes of trying and patience, the situation didn't seem to be improving.  If the controls were made more intuitive, then this probably would have been a fun game. As-is, I honestly don't know, because I gave up in frustration.
8279	0	a	inMomentum, a 1st person platformer based on running around a level collecting spheres. There is a large focus on speed, as you are encouraged to blast though the levels as quick as possible; as you are only fighting a timer. Unfortunately, the game feels very clumsy. While I'm sure you could master it in time, any time I tried to pick up any speed or do anything interesting I would fall into a pit (the levels are made of very small platforms and 90% pits). The only way to complete the level is to slowly walk though it in order to be careful, which in turn becomes very boring.  Would not play again.

8281	0	a	it seemed like an ok game but the controlls are slugish
8282	0	a	Absolute garbage. I went into this with the thought that it would be a freerunning super speed simulator. It isn't. It's clunky, unresponsive and just through-and-through terrible.
8283	0	a	I bought this game from a bundle and this game looks nice for me for once.I play this game and I disappointed. Gameplay so bad, running and jumping mechanics not good.If you big fun like this game maybe you like it but you dont like kind a this game you dont buy it.
8284	0	a	Poor controls, bad perspective, and graphics that are just so so.  The idea of a vertical first person racer sounds fun, this isn't.
8285	0	a	almost worth it
8286	0	a	First-person platforming. Just let that sink in. A game where you can't see your own body and have literally no point of spacial reference is going to create some problems. A game that lacks any kind of polish or feedback on top of this is going to create more problems. A game with poorly-placed checkpoints on top of depth perception issues and a lack of shimmer is going to create exponentially more problems.
8287	0	a	i wish this had controller support
8288	0	a	I've craved this game for a long time, and when I finally bought it, I was left very disappointed.  In a game where the gameplay it's uniquely about jumping and running around, if you built a physic engine that makes you feel as heavy and agile as an elephant, you did it wrong. Terribly wrong.  If you like jumpmaze things buy DOOM2, then play the Jumpmaze mod with Zandronum; it's easier than you think, full of tutorials and, despite obvious engine's limitations, you can fill it up with HD textures and fancy effects so that even if it will never look as good as inMomentum, it will be an enjoyable jumpmaze experience. Definitely better than this.  Average aesthetics, not remarkable, not despicable.  +Sound Effects &amp; Music -Physics Engine +Concept -Execution  If you need ratings:  Graphic: 7 Sound: 7 Longevity: ? Gameplay: 2 4/10  I am aware that a 2 is a very low rating but... As I've already said: if it's all about jumps and the physics are bad... They did it wrong. I recommend you to try the demo before buying it, if you like the game and feel comfortable with its physics, I guess that 10$ could be a fair price.   http://store.steampowered.com/app/284460  Deadcore does what InMomentum tried to achieve, but does it right. Buy this instead.
8289	0	a	Played for 30 minutes and never felt any momentum. Very floaty and unprecise. Better stick to Defrag!
8290	0	a	If you expected a game similar to the Mirror's Edge Time Trial mode; prepare for (major) disappointment. The idea is there, it's just isn't executed in a fun way. The graphics are clean, which I like, Mirror's Edge used the same sort of style, but besides that it really can't be compared. Do like me and go play Mirror's Edge instead of wasting time and money on this thing.  How many times have I used the words Mirror's Edge now ? Mirror's Edge. I lost count. Mirror's Edge !  [Rating: 67/100]
8291	0	a	Slightly bruised Mirror's Edge methadone. If you like jumping first person platformers with annoying tutorials, then give this a shot! Right after you're done eating raw fish and redecorating the cave you live in, Gollum.
8292	0	a	I do not recommend this game
8293	0	a	The controls are awkward, unusual, inadequate, badly implemented, and nearly impossible to use properly. Even if you rebind the keys, there is simply no way to execute multiple commands while using both the mouse and keyboard to move about the game world. Sometimes it is necessary to use power-ups, and having five fingers in each hand is simply not enough for inMomentum. I am certain that after excessive amounts of practice, it becomes possible, but I am not sure if the trouble is worth it. There are barely any sound effects of any kind. You will hear the occasional beeps and bloops every once in a while, but that is all besides the continuous uninspired music. The game does not give you any indication that you are actually running around and jumping. There is no feeling involved with the movement and game physics. It is as if you are gliding from place to place, then floating, gliding some more, all with odd physics that do not blend well with the game's setting or anything that makes any sense at all. Timing your glides and floats so that you land on the platforms requires mostly luck, as the controls are incredibly imprecise, and do not allow for the player to develop any real skills or techniques in order to accomplish each level rapidly and properly. inMomentum does not have any story or introduction as to why you are doing this gliding and floating around on platforms collecting orbs and doing time trials. There is no campaign of any kind to speak of, and the only aspect of the game that provides feelings of accomplishment are found in online leaderboards for the two limited game modes available. The game is so bare bones, in fact, that you will wonder if it was actually finished, and if the developer should actually be expecting money for it. inMomentum is a cheap, unfinished, unpolished, bore. Play it every once in a while for five to ten minutes at a time in order to maximize your fun with it.  inMomentum is mediocre.
8294	0	a	Someone took the worst part of FPS games, jumping puzzles, and made an entire game out of it.
8295	0	a	(Rage)quit the game near the end of the second level after getting stuck for close to ten minutes. Should've probably just slowed down the time and taken it nice and slow, but I felt like trying to go fast. Perhaps too fast for my skill level. The (quite uninnovative and bland) tutorial also accounts for a large part of my playtime.  Might be fun with friends, but apart from that the multiplayer seems to be dead. The single player content (just speedrunning the game trying to get to the top of the leaderboards or trying to farm the achievements) also doesn't seem too interesting to me, although I like both of those things in games where the core gameplay resonates with me more deeply.  Had some problems with the movement (lots of it due to missclicks, didn't quite get used to space as the shoot button, but then again how should I rebind the keys otherwise when there are two separate jump buttons?!) or maybe I just didn't grasp the basic mechanics behind walljumping as sometimes it didn't seem to reset when I thought it would/should.   Honestly feels more like a platform for making a game / a playground rather than a complete project. Aesthetics were passable, but in my opinion nothing too special.
8296	0	a	Data Jammers: FastForward is a computer themed arcade style game where the player controls a 'Data D.O.O.D' though a racetrack full of hazards and opponent in order to hack into 'Ouroboros' Watching this video, the game seemed fun and something about it reminded me of playing arcade games when I was young. Despite wanting to like this game, I cannot recommend it.   Like many computer themed game, this game has nothing to do with actual computers and is only there to facilitate a convenient Tron-like art style. Zipping along the racetrack as such is fun at first but quickly loses it's luster and ultimately feels a bit like a gimmick. Where this game fails is the fact that it's procedurally generated and that it throws everything at you. As a result playing this game is a bit of a chaotic mess which puts you in situations that often feel unfair. I feel this game could have been better with intentionally designed challenges instead of throwing the player into a sloppy mess.   The game does support USB controllers fairly well. If you're looking for a challenging (and sometimes unfair) arcade game that you can play with a USB controller than this might be a good title but don't expect too much.  Score: 5.5/10 
8297	0	a	Data Jammers is a fast paced, arcade-style game where you drive along a track, avoiding obstacles and aiming for powerups. I came in with low expectations after having played Brainpipe, and I was right not to expect much.  As with Brainpipe, most of the game's skill depends on twitch reflexes. You're given some warning with the faster obstacles, but not enough to avoid hitting them. At other times, I simply became trapped by the obstacles and had no choice but to hit them. Some will actively try to kill you. Even on the lowest difficulty, they're tough to deal with when the game moves so quickly. You can fire a weapon, but you only get three shots. I spent most of my time frustrated. This game at least seems to have more depth than Brainpipe.  It's still not any fun, though, and I couldn't recommend it when there are better free games on Kongregate. Don't buy this one.
8298	0	a	In game you are auto running like most of STG. You can use slider get out of the red way and dodge attack from enemy, green way give you some support or points. 'A' buttom to destroy the enemy near you.  I gave a 'nagitive' to recommend it because I think this game is not so much fun in my personal opinion. I think this game could be better, such as adding some shooting elements that will make it not so drab.  =======================================  支手柄，在高速路上躲躲去，绿色的线路有加血或者护盾，以震开贴身的机器人，第一关boss是个打钉机，没什么难度。 游类型属于四，就是个躲躲去的应游 ，是添加射击元素也玩些，pressure这带射击的竞速游（其实也是竞速）。 个人感觉挺无的一个游，没有亮点，出于个人喜好，推。
8299	0	a	This is a kind of racing game, if you can sort of imagine Guitar Hero but without the rhythm or music.  Few graphics settings, and unfortunately there's overscan if you go into fullscreen which makes the pointless game even less playable.  Graphics quality is poor, controls boring... generally a very weak game overall and not worth paying any money for.
8300	0	a	You'd be better off playing something like AudioSurf. This game is very boring. All you do is dodge obstacles along a road.  Yawn.
8301	0	a	$10 for a half hour long, moderately fun game that feels like a much more toned down version of N2O. Only get it if it ends up being part of a bundle or if it goes on sale for $2.50 and you happen to be really drunk at the time. It's just not worth the full price.
8302	0	a	Lacking in fun gameplay, menus that hurt your brain, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly simplistic mechanics.
8303	0	a	Data Jammers: Fast Forward, as its name imply, is a fast paced action arcade game that is very similar to audio surf in style. In Data Jammers: Fast Forward you travel on a high-speed digital highway collecting ring like object for points while dodging and destroying enemy vehicles that include strange flotation devices and bizarre cars; you get points for doing any of these things. The game is very fast paced, and your success is highly dependent on how fast your reaction time is. Data Jammers: Fast Forward is challenging that’s what makes it fun, however, the levels are extremely repetitive. There is quite a bit of enemy variety but after a few hours everything seems to blend in and the enemies you use to find challenging becomes a rather chore to kill. The sounds effects and musical score are boring and the boss fight isn’t all that inspiring or difficult. This is an average indie game.
8304	0	a	+fun manuever game but nothing to keep it interesting to continue longer... -detected my xbox gamepad but unable to control with it...
8305	0	a	Expensive game! I've played around two hours and that's completing every level around five times. I have a hard time figuring out the point of it, and I have a hard time recommending it unless you want some easy achievement. But even on the achievement side this game has some of those stupid leaderboard achievement.
8306	0	a	Very boring 'runner' game. Dodge enemies/obstacles or use one of your few bombs to destroy them.
8307	0	a	Not worth it, great if you get it from a bundle or something like that 6/10
8308	0	a	Here's a little bit of trivia: this game shouldn't exist.
8309	0	a	This is a slick little game with a nice feeling of speed, but there are a few frustrating things about it that for me ruin the experience. It's too hard to tell what lane you're in due to the perspective, could be easily fixed by making items float a little lower. You can't see far enough ahead to make intelligent decisions, because it's physically difficult to change lanes in a timely fashion. I beat the first boss without having any idea how I accomplished it. And finally, I got stuck in a loop after a crash which just auto-crashed me and ate up my remaining lives. C-
8310	0	a	This game has a nice, Cyberpunk endless runner theme. Even though overall controls are mostly solid, the game started off ok, but became more annoying over time. This is due to the camera angle that isn't always great at showing you what dangers and forks in the road you need to see, and I often got knocked into the lane I didn't want to see and ended up loosing out on chains of coins for points, taking damage, or worse, dying. There's an interesting variety of enemies here, some run down the track on the same lane infinitely, some mirror your actions, some sap your health from long range. Then you have two extremely annoying monstrocities near the end game, a flying enemy that is near impossible to kill and can damage you quickly with overhead laser beams, and another that knocks you into the air. The second one isn't that bad, and in fact, can help you 'skip' much of a level by having it constantly juggle in the air. But with the combination of two said enemies, you can find yourself in near death, or more often than not, insta-death situations. This can happen in chains in some section of levels, draining your non-replenishable, three lives very quickly. You also have a smart bombs to kill enemies in a small AoE Range - however, often times, this attack misses enemies that are real close to you, which is unacceptable when you have limited bombs.  I personally think you can avoid this game, unless you are a big fan of 'endless runners', though technically, the levels do end and in fact, the game game usually be completed in less than an hour. The awful camera, floaty controls, obtuse level design, and annoying enemies made this game a bit of a pain for me. Data Jammers: Fast Forward definitely got something right with the interesting and challenging mix of enemies and level obstackles, but the end result had more more fustrated than entertained.
8311	0	a	This game is very so-so. Plays like an arcade and probably would fit better in one of those machines, where you just insert a quarter to play until a game over. I got this in a bundle, don't think many people would buy this alone. It's very short and I personally don't see much replayability.
8312	0	a	Horizontal shoot-em-up with about a dozen platform levels spanning four stages plus unlockable difficulties and challenges. You have a single-target beam and a multi-target arc beam at your disposal, can choose which to power up with drops and switch between them, and the direction you're facing, with the press of a button.   The only problem with the game is that the maneuverability and inertia are quite poor and really affect your performance. A decent game otherwise, with learning to use both beam types at the right time being essential to progress and survive. Leaderboards for pretty much everything and the game looks great. Doubt I would buy it again if given the chance though due to the terrible piloting.
8313	0	a	Generic and technically flawed twitch shooter that has the irritating gimmick of confining the player to a small and oddly shaped space. It's underwhelming in all ways, and a shoddy console port to boot. If this game was a piece of classical music, it would be performed in the tempo of garbaggio. Avoid like the plague. Avoid like a loan shark. Avoid like a psycho ex-girlfriend. Pretend you never saw it and buy Jamestown instead.
8314	0	a	I've played in previous version of this game - SpaceTripper. And i have to say that visually it was more stylish less color-mess then this one. I like old one a lot. Not this one =(
8315	0	a	I'm not sure why I got this again on Steam when I was pretty meh on it on PS3. Never beat it before, and finally beat it on easy. The sheer fact that you're required to just jam the fire button as fast as possible to have a chance to beat the levels within the time limit makes the game not fun. My entire forearm is sore, and that was with taking breaks between levels. It's short, ridiculously hard, and it's hard to tell enemies from powerups, and enemy spawns are sometimes hard to see as well. I'd avoid this one.
8316	0	a	The game locks up when my controller is plugged in. That aside, it's quite a fun game, wish the developers would support it. Difficult to reccomend.
8317	0	a	I consider Alien Zombie Megadeath, the other game from developer PomPom, one of the best arcade games of the latest years. Unfortunately I cannot say the same for Astro Tripper. Presentation aside (it's even more basic than AZM) the game is basically a defender inspired shooter but it's extremely difficult and frustrating. There are three difficulty levels, easy, hard and extremely hard. I've played at hard difficulty (never played a game in easy mode in my life) and I haven't been able to finish the first training level after a dozen game overs. Enemies spawn everywhere, they shoot a lot, some of them collide with each other suddenly changing trajectory, the play area is extremely narrow and, just to add some frustration, you can fall over the play area so you must be extremely careful while maneuvering your ship. Being a defender clone you also have to press a button to flip the ship direction, easier said than done given the overall difficulty. In the end it's not a bad game, it's just badly calibrated and for this reason I could only recommend it to hardcore space shooter lovers. Go play Alien Zombie Megadeath instead.
8318	0	a	Not bad, just bland. I died for no apparent reason on the 3rd level and had to start over at the 1st... I found that to be a good stopping point.
8319	0	a	The game is poorly optimized (my card is GTX 680). laggy and framedrop make it unplayable. Do not buy until it is fixed.
8320	0	a	Hardcore! =(
8321	0	a	After playing this game for only a short amount of time, I immediately found out that it was absolute rubbish. 2/10 stars.
8322	0	a	Honestly this game is trash It's just a Resogun mimick. Resogun is awesome though :D
8323	0	a	I musta been astro trippin' when I played this, cause I don't remember it at all. Still, thumbs way down.
8324	0	a	1/5  An unsurprisingly uninspired SHMUP.
8325	0	a	This had a game breaking graphical crash about 30 minutes into playing, it was totally unplayable in this state and it never self corrected(even the title/menu screen was messed up). I've racked up over one hundred hours on the Xbox 360 version of this and it never crashed in any way ever.  The nature of this game and it's design mean any significant instability is thoroughly ruinous, the score multiplier system and belt progression rely heavily on not dying at all. Perfect play really is key in this game, as such even if the crash was not permanent(until a shutdown and restart) it would still be game breaking...  This was and always will be one of my favourite twin stick games of all time but not in this unstable state... I'm absolutely gutted! Refund request pending....

8326	0	a	Playing Mutant Storm Reloaded is like falling into a nightmare or audio visualizers and 80s sitcom transitions. The abundance of hideous and unnecessary visual effects almost seems intentional to try to hide the uninspired mediocrity of a twin stick shooter hiding underneath. Blurry textures, a nauseous camera, laughable transitional effects between levels, and an overwhelming feeling that the developer lacked any real vision when creating their game make it unpleasant to play just a few levels, let alone 'complete' the game by grinding through the seemingly endless supply.  A few ideas, like dynamically raising the difficulty based on your performance, are novel enough, but the implementation is so unclear and arbitrary that none of them can salvage an experience that was doomed from the start. I could forgive the numerous poor choices made with the presentation if the gameplay was at least moderately decent, but unsatisfying shooting, awkward level designs, and frustrating (and boring) enemies did absolutely nothing but remind me of how many other games I could be playing.  Twin stick wave based shooters are a dime a dozen, and Mutant Storm Reloaded ranks among the most prosaic and unquestionably substandard I've played to date.
8327	0	a	This game is really very bad. I should nearly complain for a refund. If you know anybody with this game please make sure they are not mentally or emotionally damaged.
8328	0	a	Bought this since I was such a big fan of the original, but it was a bit of a let down.  The controls in this are much less smooth than the original, and the visuals are much less trippy. Unfortuantely Pom Pom no longer seems to sell the orignal version except for some iPad remake. In anycase I'd recommend the orignal 'Mutant Storm' if you can find it, but would avoid this 'Reloaded' version.
8329	0	a	The difficulty level of the Hidden Object parts are LEGENDARY only for the bravest of brave to attempt. The images on the store page for this game look widescreen, but clicking the video shows the game is 4:3. This is normally not a big deal in puzzle games, but in this game its a HUGE deal due to how tiny the objects that need to be found. Playing on a widescreen you may literally need a magnifying glass to find objects, doesnt help that some areas have multiple areas with no indicator as to which scenes contain what objects. Even worse is that some objects are literally a few pixels in size due to its older ratio where that might not have been a problem for widescreen users combined with many objects being very low resolution this game will pose obstacle of herculean proportions. Items also spawn randomly, so go ahead and stare all day for a missing item, it may not even be on the screen, or it may have spawned behind another object since its random. This leads to reloading the game alot to reset objects to random positions hoping the objects spawn in an area that is visibly clickable. Even completely visible objects are hard to click due to them having such a teeny tiny clickable area that may have you clicking all over even though you feel your clicking right on the object itself.   The puzzles are at just the right difficulty not to impossible but challenging enough that finishing them feels rewarding. Oddly though many of these cant be skipped, there is no guide in the game like other games to help you so players may end up stuck unable to ever continue the game. Worse is that with some puzzles the pieces may be missing. Meaning the pieces spawned off screen, so you may need to reload the game many times to finish a puzzle to reset the locations of pieces.  The story is awesome with very good voice acting, this saves the game from being a total disaster, but the gameplay elements are so buggy their almost broken making it a very tedious and exhausting gameplay experience. Pretty sure the game like the title screen hasnt been updated since 2012 so guessing what bugs are there will be there forever sadly.  Rating: 2/10 Value: $0.99
8330	0	a	The things to be found are tiny. Very frustrating and makes you wonder throughout the game exactly what you're doing with your life. Very simple and short story. Very casual casual game.
8331	0	a	A good idea, but far too buggy and far too short. The writing was not the best, either. I'd give this a solid C.
8332	0	a	The gameplay is ok, and the art has some nice late-90s CD-ROM puzzle game aesthetics. Unfortunately, there's very little game to play. I'd swear the cut scenes are a full half of the game, and they're horrible. The template is: 'bwahaha, foolish girl, I tricked you into cleaning my [space]!' 'Oh how dare you, you churl!' 'Relent, miss! Out of guilt I will actually do what was requested of me.'  But seriously, almost every scene is your character being tricked into cleaning up after people. And you're the only female character. You play a girl who goes around cleaning up after men. It's actually the whole story.
8333	0	a	Valve, please. Just give us one more option besides a 'yes' or a 'no'. A half-hearted 'mneh' or a a shrug icon or even a thumb pointing sideways.  Because that's how I feel about The Clockwork Man. Not angry or frustrated enough to condemn this hidden object game, but not impressed enough to turn my thumbs upwards either.  There're certainly some aspects to praise about the game. It comes with a fairly unique hint system, built into the game's clockwork sidekick. It uses charges to help the player find more difficult objects, and recharges slowly over time so it doesn't make the game too easy all at once. The art is nice at least, and the game is mildly spiced up with other kinds of puzzles in-between hidden-object-finding sessions.  On the other hand, there just isn't much else to the game. I finished in about two hours, with some help from the hint system. The puzzles are nice, but they're also obvious (and overdone) to the seasoned puzzler. Upon completion, The Clockwork Man offers a freeplay mode, but those are for Hidden Object maps that you've already played by then.  The biggest disappointment had to be the setting. It promised an alternate-history steampowered Victorian world, and it delivered that in the first few moments. But then you're sent to an under-developed tropical island where little to none of that ever comes into play. Your 'global' adventure only consists of a few moments in your Victorian home and the rest of it on a single generic tropical mystery-island. The only steampowered clockwork wonders you'll experience are your sidekick Sprocket and   what you discover during the short finale  .  Hidden Object game enthusiasts will like this more, but they'd be better off with The Clockwork Man Bundle, which consists of this game and its sequel (which appears to at least have more Victorian steampunk elements). For everyone else though, whatever the second game is like, I can definitely say that The Clockwork Man is underwhelming and not worth a full-price purchase.
8334	0	a	 Charming HO game, but ultimately frustrating
8335	0	a	Primarily a hidden object game that includes a few other minor puzzles, such as placing items into your inventory, combining them and then using them on the environment.   The art is nice but set at a smaller box resolution, the Steam overlay doesn't work and the story and voice acting are rather dull. That leaves you with the meat of the game, finding objects! The environments are nicely drawn and you have a list of 10-20 objects or so to find in each scene. A robot ally can spot items for you at the expense of some of his slowly replenishing energy--the game's form of hints.   Objects you need to find are repeated quite often considering the game is only about two hours long. There's a free mode after finishing the game where you can spot to your heart's delight, and playing the game again is supposed to shift the scenes. I don't know why anyone would want to because it's a bore.
8336	0	a	While Clockwork Man has an interesting premise and pretty visuals, it's far too short to recommend it. My play time is inflated from accidentally leaving the game running and spending some time on the unlimited HOG mode. Maybe if you really love hidden object games and get it on sale with the other Clockwork Man game, I could say 'go for it', but don't expect much out of it. The scrolling/zooming function isn't really as big of a deal as one would hope, and the story is not particularly good (although it's hilarious how everywhere Miranda goes, people ask her to clean up a big mess) and it ends on a cliffhanger that isn't resolved in the sequel!   And why are all the men in this game so fat???
8337	0	a	Pixel hunting (to the point or thinking you've cliked on something, that wasn't it apparently, get to the point of using the bot for hints and yes that was it but apparently you didn't click in the right spot..), no intelligent support for widescreen, crashed on me during the final cutscene (and reset my save so I am NOT doing it all again to see if I missed anything)..  The scrolling and the zoom-in are a false good idea.. more annoying than nice, since foreground objects will move over the background stuff and hide it.  Graphics are nice as a whole, story is ok.. but can't recommend this one. Much better stuff and more fun to be had elsewhere on steam, indenpendently of price.
8338	0	a	The game is too short and the story is totally dull. The hidden object scenes are ok, but the rest of the game is fogettable. Don't bother with this one, you can play The Clockwork Man: The Hidden World though - it's much much better.
8339	0	a	Not a horrible game, but disappointing at how little game time there actually is.
8340	0	a	The video game equivalent of highlights for kids.
8341	0	a	Very short to play and not too much story. Not recomended unless very very cheap.
8342	0	a	Find the object game. Massive shortage on actual puzzles, half of which I had to skip due to bugs.   Dull but (thankfully) short.
8343	0	a	The story is intreaging and all, but the screen is small and I can hardly decipher anything from my usual distance from the screen. Like another HO game I have to stick my face to the screen to be able to see clearly. It's very tiring. I got irritated many times playing it. I wouldn't really recommend it.
8344	0	a	It's a nice game, but there's hardly any game time... I mean, I accidentally left it running for a day, so it recorded as 9 hours, but I think it's closer to 1,5-2 hours of gameplay. Bit disappointing, especially for the price. Looks good though and it's a good game, so get it on sale!
8345	0	a	Initailly thought this would be a Burton-esque steampunk P&amp;C adventure but despite the grand music, it turned out that The Clockwork Man actually is mostly a hidden object game with the occasional puzzle. Unfortunately the setting of the adventure, New Coventry, is much like its real-world equivalent and full of people with messy, run-down houses so the hidden object bits are frequent and rather tedious. However, unlike the world in the game, attractive women don't tend to run around enthusing about how much they like to clear places up.  Backgrounds were well drawn, though the designers elected to do the trick found on a zillion visual novels and show interactions between characters by sweeping them in from the sides. It's kinda cheap looking. Music was good, though didn't loop well and tended to be a bit jarring when it did. Story was overblown, though on the plus side   the annoying little R2D2 thing ended up dead.   Yay!  The game takes about 2-3 hours to complete. At about £2 an hour (that's about $10,000 for those in the colonies), it may not seem like wonderful value. Artifex Mundi tend to do this sort of thing better.
8346	0	a	You go from one hidden object scene to the next, not much game play in between. This is a very short game, I only made it to 3 hours by letting it run while doing other things. For my taste the main character is rather annoying and not the smarted cookie out there. Also, some of the item to search for are multiple times in the scene, so that you don't only have to find e.g. a lipstick, but the right one. For a true HOG fan, this is ok, but for anyone new to the genre, there are better games out there.
8347	0	a	Meh.  The puzzles are okay, the plot is shallow, and the character art is dreadful. Miranda is okay, but everyone else looks like stiff mannequins with dead eyes. But the hidden object gameplay, that mostly consists of forcing miranda to clean other peoples messy houses (they leave like mangoes and butter knives everywhere) can be pretty relaxing, since it's mostly your eyes working. I would probably recommend it if they spent some more time making a more interesting story. This one ends suddenly just when you start to get somewhere and its buh-bye.
8348	0	a	One of the puzzles was broken, it lacks other gameplay elements that you usually find in other hidden object games. In this game there is dialog then you have a hidden object puzzle, pretty much all the way through the game, only a few other puzzles

8350	0	a	The hidden world is a good name, this puzzle game should be hidden so it never sees the light of day. Like the last game, this game suffers from low resolution objects, objects that are a few pixels in size, and objects where clicking right on them may be a futile effort. Playing this game is similar to being locked out of your house while drunk take all your keys off your keyring throwing them wildly about then attempting to find and pick up your door key with your elbows.  The voice acting is very good, but the story isnt enough to keep anyone playing, in fact this game is good at putting you to sleep. Puzzles due to the low resolution, and being finicky, are just so tiring to complete making the game experience feel labored without satisfaction. There is no way to skip puzzles or solutions, or hints, or a guide in this game which can lead players stuck unable to finish the game.   Rating: 1/10 Value: $0.50
8351	0	a	It's always annoying when technical issues get in the way of enjoyment of a game. I'm doing this to compliment or complain about design decisions, not coding errors. Where's the fun in pointing out that someone forgot to add a colon somewhere in the thousands of lines of text that make up the framework of a game? Still, sometimes games are so badly compromised that it must be mentioned. Clockwork Man: The Hidden World is one such game. It tells the story of Miranda, a young scientist bent of uncovering the secret behind her parents' disappearance nearly a decade earlier. She'll travel to Thule with the help of her clockwork robot sidekick - a small golden droid who speaks entirely in bleeps and bloops, turning him into a sort of combination C-3P0 and R2D2.  Sadly, this journey is hampered by both design errors and technical gaffs, which I'll detail as we move through the... Hidden Object Criteria!  Criteria 1: To what degree do the puzzle screens look like a thrift store vomited on my monitor?  Oh, it's bad. Extremely bad. While the game tries to keep the items true to the steampunk Victorian setting, there is no excuse for how absolutely covered in garbage the game's screens are. One particularly dire example gives a quaint Irish cottage the character of a trash yard, with empty pots, furniture, and bits of food scattered over every concievable surface. Then there are rampant cases of size-cheating - in one case I was asked to look for a pocket knife which was hidden in the spokes of a wagon wheel, making it something along the lines of eighteen inches big. This is all made worse by the developers' decision to include 'scrolling' hidden object screens, in which the player is forced to scroll the screen up/down or left/right to find all the items. I'm baffled by this choice, since it takes the baseline concept of hidden object games - put 20 items on a screen and have the player look for them - and increases the amount of trash-covered space they have to look through by threefold. Absurdly, this massively increased difficulty is accompanied by one of the slowest-to-recharge hint buttons I've ever encountered. Also, during once stretch of playing the game the hint button glitched out on me and flat-out refused to recharge, stranding me alone with some of the most annoying difficult hidden object scenes ever.  Criteria 2: Are the searches justified by the premise/story?  Absolutely not. This is classic 'find a load of nonsense, get one useful item' design. Occasionally the game offers some meagre justification, such as 'clean up all the bottles in this yard' or 'help me find all the food I've squirrelled away', but by and large there's no rationalization given for any of Miranda's searches.  Criteria 3: How well do the various puzzles and object searches meld together to form a coherent whole?  It's a compelling enough narrative - villains are on their way to Thule, where Miranda's parents were last seen, and she's got to go along to stop said conspirators from ruining that paradise undisturbed by history. The journey isn't structured particularly well, opening with Miranda exploring a mine, then flashing back to an extended sequence of searching through offices and attics a few weeks earlier. The developers are trying to use the cinematic device of starting with the action and then zipping back to tell the story, but the mine exploration isn't notably more thrilling than searching for old documents and artifacts hidden in a house - this is a hidden object adventure, after all, and the 'thrilling' scale is only ever going to get so high. While the hidden object puzzles don't usually make the most sense, at least the puzzles hit in nicely with the setting. Repairing a submarine and unlocking alien technology seem like the kind of things that could be solved with clever puzzle design, and they are - but the lack of a skip button could prove terribly frustrating to players looking to just enjoy a pleasant story and some object hunting.  Clockwork Man: The Hidden World has too many missteps to easily recommend. The HOSs are needlessly complicated - beyond their sheer size, they also feature parallax scrolling, meaning that different planes of the background move at different speeds, covering items at different times. Good luck finding a snake when it's only visible for a few degrees halfway to the right edge of the level! Glitches in the hint system mean that sections of the game drag on far longer than they're welcome, and sometimes the music gets stuck, and continues playing a single set of atmospheric effects in every screen. It's a mess, and the story just isn't good enough to be worth slogging through to experience all of it.
8352	0	a	It stopped playing right in the middle of a puzzel. five pieces missing, started over 3 three pieces missing. over and over It wouldnt lt me play on.......and no way to get help. unless this is it......sharri101
8353	0	a	This game is a big step up from the original Clockwork Man, but doesn't quite go far enough. It's more involved with the story and puzzle-solving, almost like a direct rip-off of the Samantha Swift series in that regard, but towards the end, you solve a series of rather challenging puzzles, then it just ends abruptly. The visuals are better this time around with limited animation in some scenes and more varied settings. If you're a huge fan of hidden object games and can get this really cheap in a sale, it's a 'maybe', but I don't strongly recommend it. You're better off with Midnight Mysteries, Alex Hunter, and Samantha Swift.  While the adventuring aspect of the story is okay, I wasn't very fond of its morality. I think it's weird that a child-friendly hidden object game is making statements about how it's wrong to want to live longer and death is great. The first Clockwork Man's story did the same thing. I would've like to have seen more focus on its Steampunk elements than all the philosophizing about the human lifespan.
8354	0	a	The voice acting is crisp, the art is lovely, the setting interesting, the puzzes creative, and the plot entertaining. All these things are easy to fall in love with. Unfortunately, there is no way to love a letterboxed hidden-object screen.   So I don't.
8355	0	a	The game didn't display properly on my monitor, unlike every other Steam game I've purchased. Windowed mode made the game screen too small to view the hidden items.  The puzzles weren't too difficult (although they are un-skippable), and there is a good clue system.  Overall, the game felt a little short.
8356	0	a	This game keeps glitching out on me during the dove puzzle. I tried to log out and log back in. It just keeps missing different pieces. There is no way to skip this or pull the missing pieces. The game sucks. Don't buy
8357	0	a	I am unable to get past the picture puzzle, everytime I start over there is always one piece missing and cannot go forward, have tried numerous times.
8358	0	a	The game itself looks well done but there is gliches. When a puzzle comes up it is often missing peaces and you cannot skip the puzzle making it so your stuck. If you quit the game then restart it diffrent peaces are missing. The closes Ive come to finishing it was having 2 peaces missing but there is normally 3-4. Very fustrating
8359	0	a	hate it!
8360	0	a	It's better than the first game, but that's not saying much. The first one was absolutely terrible, while this one is merely awful.  The hidden object scenes very inconsistent in difficulty. Most of the objects are glaringly obvious but there's often one or two that are tiny and blend with the background, making them almost impossible to see. This is only made worse by the low resolution. The difficulty progression is also way off; many of the early scenes are far more difficult than ones later in the game. The items in the scenes are quite boring and the player is often required to find multiples of the same object. Some objects are mislabelled, quite badly so in some cases.  The puzzles are for the most part pathetically easy, although, again, some are much harder. And again, this seems to have nothing to do with progression through the game; some are just randomly hard for no apparent reason. Some puzzles lack context, meaning that the only way to solve them is to randomly try things until something works or just wait for the hint bar to charge.  The story is fairly bad, although well acted, and the ending is just rubbish. Perhaps the most annoying thing about it is that it has nothing to do with the story of the first game and in no way addresses the cliffhanger ending from the first. I thought that perhaps it would tie in later on, but nope, it's like the devs just forgot the first game exists. Which in all honesty I can't blame them for since the first game is so atrocious.  Apart from the gameplay itself there are numerous other problems with this game. There are instances where puzzle elements appear almost completely off screen; and by almost completely I mean that only a single pixel is visible. Some objects in the hidden object scenes are behind parts of the interface and so are not visible at all. The click detection is frequently so picky that it refuses to acknowledge that the player has clicked on an object unless the exact couple of pixels that it is happy with are clicked, leading to a great deal of wasted time looking for objects I had already found and clicked on a few times. Also the sound is somewhat bugged. I found numerous instances where lines of dialogue did not play, and at one point the ambient sound in one scene got stuck in a loop and continued to play in every other scene after that.  Having played many HOGs I feel I have a good basis for comparison and I would have to say that this one is not worth it. Not even if it were free. There are many other HOGs that are far better and much more deserving of your time.
8361	0	a	Managed to make it through the first episode :o( because had to have that to install this one. Not bothering to complete this game too frustrating. Again I am looking for tiny objects and the hint/help button doesn't work just makes a noise with no results it just goes to reload for the next time. Don't bother with next time the other indicator says they is no help for this location. Have to go online to use a walkthrough if I want to complete it. Too many object searches with not actual travelling through cities, buildings with hallways etc. just leaping from single places and rooms over maps with no roads or paths, adventure lost. Into the my krap file it goes.
8362	0	a	Clock Work Man (Hidden) I have asked three times for help in the puzzle and nothing. I have restarted three times and still puzzle is not working. Too many hours and a dead end. Now I can't find the refund button, so I'm just going to throw the money away and delete it.
8363	0	a	damn thing wont start!!!!!!!
8364	0	a	The ending credits are longer than the game itself. 3/10
8365	0	a	The concept is fun and addictive at the start, but in all it doesn't feel like anything more than a Flash game; the only thing it's missing is a Newgrounds logo. It's a well-made game, but most of the levels are just user-made garbage with lots of unfair traps and the physics can be wonky at times. I also got the occasional crash.  Buy this on sale only; it's worth about 3 bucks in my opinion. It's got a good amount of content and the concept is entertaining, but in spirit it feels like any other Box2D Flash game that has been flooding the Internet for free since 2006,
8366	0	a	It's not that Snuggle Truck is  bad  per say, it's just...not very good.  Taking the Trials HD side-scrolling rollercoaster arcade racing formula, adding a basket of fluffy stuffed animals, and polishing off any of the more challenging or demanding bits, it's biggest fault is just how obnoxiously boring it is. Its personality is lost in a deluge of repetitive, tedious levels, designed in such a way as to be just obnoxious and tedious enough that they become a monotonous chore to complete. The challenge feels mostly arbitrary and poorly planned out, existing as little more than to cause you to replay levels numerous times but providing no satisfaction when you finally achieve a faster time or medal.  I wish I had some more elaborate criticism to add, but that's honestly all I can muster. Snuggle Truck feels like the cute but entirely moronic cousin of games such as Trials and Joe Danger, full of bright colors and upbeat music, but hard to spend more than a few minutes with before you can feel your eyelids start to close.
8367	0	a	Snuggle Truck is a relatively fun casual deliver x stuffed animals in x time game. It has a nice amount of content, levels and an awesome editor meaning the community can make levels giving an unlimited amount of playable content. However, the game itself has too many minor errors making it not worth the hassle and here is why:  Pros:   ♦ Decent Graphics and Sounds (These are alright for what it is, they are not amazing but fit the game) ♦ Medal Concept is Great (Unlocking medals for completing x goal in a level is nice as it gives you something to do in the level and adds a nice amount of content to the level) ♦ Gameplay is fun and works with minimal glitches (Driving through the level and delivering x stuffed animals in x time just works. It is pretty fun if you are the type that likes to be number one on the leaderboards and must complete all level challenges. If you don’t like playing a game for leaderboards or completing challenges, then you probably won’t find this as fun as I did) ♦ Easy to 100% with Achievements (Has a nice number of easy Achievements which are mainly unlocked by just using features of the game and completing the game) ♦ Steam Trading Cards (This is always a bonus) ♦ Each level design is unique (This is nice as every level feels different and no two levels feel as though it is a repetitive copy of the last level) ♦ Decent level editor (Amazing level editor that allows anyone to create a level and upload for anyone to play. This is an awesome feature as it adds an potentially unlimited amount of levels and content to the game) ♦ Truck and Stuffed Animal skins are very detailed (Custom Skins are designed very well for what they are and add a nice little bonus to the game) ♦ Price is reasonable ($5 for a game is decent as if you look past all the cons you’ll get your $5 worth)   Cons:  ♦ No Steam Cloud Storage (I’ve had to restart this game 3 or 4 times for the sole fact of no Steam Cloud Storage and me always losing my save file. You could say I should’ve backed up the savefile, but there is no easy way to tell which games you own have SCS. Therefore, as the game progresses by completing one level to unlock the next, SCS would be relatively beneficial. Plus, If a game is on Steam and doesn’t make use of this free feature, then in my opinion it shouldn’t be on Steam) ♦ Method to activate custom skins is annoying (Firstly to be able to even use them you have to go and enable them in a “+more menu. The “+more+ menu doesn’t lead on to what it is until you click it which is annoying as I had no idea what It was until I clicked it. Though, once you’ve enabled all the custom skins, you have to then get into a level and click the truck until your truck has the skin you want. This concept would be fine if it didn’t mean you had to waste a play through just to enable a skin. The skin should be able to be enabled and selected from within the “+more menu) ♦ Lacks Steam Workshop (This is bad as the game makes you upload to their servers and for some reason created levels don’t always stay. I say this as I created a level a while ago and started playing Snuggle Truck again only to find my level deleted. Plus, custom levels not moderated properly as the only way is by a star rating which doesn’t explain much. With Steam Workshop levels would be moderated by the community via ratings and comments etc and would be more likely to stay in the game)  ♦ Has DLC activated automatically (This is a weird concept as the game calls certain features DLC but you can’t actually buy any DLC for the game. This confuses me as to why it’s even called DLC) ♦ Custom level highscores don't load and you have to quit the game to continue playing (When you click the highscores in Custom levels made by users, it just shows a spinning loading circle and does nothing else. You can’t close out of the spinning loading circle, meaning you have to close the game and re-open it if you want to continue playing) ♦ No way to delete a Downloaded Custom Level (This is annoying as I stated not all levels are moderated. Therefore, if you download a bad level there is no way to easily delete it within the game. This is annoying as it fills your list of custom levels with a lot of potentially unwanted ones making it hard to find the ones that you actually enjoyed and work) ♦ Has impossible times in highscores rendering them broken (Highscores just work, however some scores are obviously impossible and hacked in some way. There needs to be some sort of moderation of highscores or a global reset to make number one even achievable) ♦ Pressing escape to go back to the main menu at times loses the mouse cursor making the menu unusable (This is annoying as not being able to use the mouse on a menu means you can’t actually select anything. This ultimately means you have to close the game and re-open it to continue playing) ♦ Alt+Tab brings up a pause menu that doesn’t act properly (When you press Alt+Tab and return to the game it brings up a pause menu, which is nice ingame but out of game on the menu it still comes up and trying to return to the game or close this menu doesn’t function properly) ♦ Makes use of Steam Global Leaderboards via Steam Stats but they don’t function (This is a nice feature to have, but for whatever reason there are no entries in these leaderboards and one of the level entries is “Test which shouldn’t be the case)  Overall, even though gameplay seemingly works and is fun, the game is cheap and has a decent amount of content, I can’t recommend this game. I can’t recommend it because there are too many minor errors within features of the game that should have been eliminated in early beta stages. Plus, having no cloud storage is a big factor for me not to recommend a game like this.
8368	0	a	I can't really say Snuggle Truck is worth playing on anything apart from a mobile device. There is no point to this game being on PC since it would be perfect on IOS.   The aim is to finish an obsticle course in the quickest time while also carrying lots of 'snugglies' in your trunk, so there is alot physics involed in not letting your truck tip over.  The game only explains the keyboard controls, however you can play with an xbox controller (and I recommend you do, if you play it).   User created levels will add replayability here, but don't waste your time playing.
8369	0	a	i like the idea of this game, especially as smuggle truck where you’re transporting immigrants across the border. unfortunately the steam version is only stuffed animals to “da zoo, is very noticeably buggy, and i don’t enjoy the levels that much either. luckily i got it through humble bundle for android 2, so i can install smuggle truck on android where it’s less buggy. if you’re like me, you may as well run the steam version long enough to get the cards and actually play it on android.
8370	0	a	Once upon a time I played a flash game where you drove a motorcyle over ugly blocky terrain and did tricks and stuff to get through increasingly difficult levels.  This game isn't half as engaging as that flash game was, so I got bored of it pretty quickly. The levels I played were all just straight drives from left to right with slightly modified landscape. Boring.
8371	0	a	In this game you're the proprietor of a white van with tinted windows. Your goal is to drive around the town and recruit various children who are loitering around the school after hours to help find your lost puppy. When you pick a child up it is then your duty to brutally and savagely anally ♥♥♥♥ them. This is the 'snuggle' part of the game. You then must drive down a secluded road miles away from their home and dump them off in the middle of the woods.
8372	0	a	Just another port from a free mobile game. Way too simple to enjoy for longer than 20 minutes. It used to have an offensive gimmick when it was called Smuggle Truck, and you were smuggling Mexicans. Now it's even worse.
8373	0	a	Rubbish!  Hill Climb Racing Fail!  Android games are better than this.
8374	0	a	♥♥♥♥ this casual piece of manure, belongs on phones and nowhere else.  Ok, it's not that bad but seriously who would seriously spend money on this?
8375	0	a	Go buy yourself a hot coffee, then, remove lid and put it in your car. Now, drive a bumpy road somewhere with jumps and watch your coffee being spilled all around. That's what this game is.

8377	0	a	Games like this has been done multiple times before this one. Snuggle truck is one of the worst ones though. It doesn't add anything new to the 'genre' and the level design is horrible. It feels like something that was done as a school project in 2 days.
8378	0	a	Snuggle Truck is a physics-based driving game where you must deliver your cargo full of 'Snuggies' as fast as possible to the zoo. On your travels you will encounter various obstacles and will have to overcome them with the various power-ups that you are provided with.  Snuggle Truck's gameplay is decent, and can be challenging if the player wants to unlock all the medals the game has to offer. However the game has definitely lost character since its late production change from 'Smuggle Truck' to 'Snuggle Truck'. Rather than using a rundown pick-up truck to smuggle immigrants over the border you have to transport stuffed animals to a zoo in a similar fashion. In other words, they are both the same game.   Overall, Snuggle Truck is an average game which has sadly had its unique concept ripped out from underneath it via censorship of Apple. Like many games of this nature it is great for those that are looking to lose a few minutes. I would recommend 'Smuggle Truck' instead as I believe this is the game that Owlchemy Labs wanted their audience to experience. You can only access the original from their website.
8379	0	a	A simple racing/physics game.  Your goal is to get one or more stuffed animals to the finishing line (with a raising flag a la Mario) in the shortest time possible.  The simple premise is good, but the art/sound direction leaves a lot to be desired. Words cannot describe how irritating it is to listen to those pesky stuffed toys' squeaks. My goal quickly changed to tossing those animals on the ground then to roll all over them, back, and forth, back, and forth.  Overall, there's not that many levels, but the last ones are quite challenging. Then you can also create your own levels with the built-in level editor, and even download levels made by other players.
8380	0	a	Pretty much a phone game to it's core, barely done any improvements on PC version if any at all. Resolution is upscaled pretty badly and the meniu is just eye mauling. However it's pretty good for little kids, it's a mobile game, but it's still blows mobile version on 24 inch monitor in their mind.   Either way would not recommend spending more than 1$ on this.
8381	0	a	The camera is too zoomed in, you never know what obstacle is ahead of you, which means you either have to repeat the levels over and over to get a good result or you need stupidly good reaction times.
8382	0	a	Has a brony mode. Buy it only if you don't want to be on my freinds list.
8383	0	a	While fun, not very fit for a PC game, buy it on mobile instead.
8384	0	a	I bought this game because i wanted more steam games and it was like four bucks. I don't know why i did it. Should've stopped me.
8385	0	a	Too childish. I can't play such a game. Maybe if you want this for kids, it might do.
8386	0	a	Basically, a 4$ flash game. A good one, but still not worth the price (cause of lenght and gameplay).  SCORE: 40/100

8388	0	a	Snuggle Truck is like one of those Trials flash games made by some bozo. It seems like it should be fun in a Trials kind of way, but the physics are absolutely not up to it and the truck just kind of clunks around the terrain in the introductory levels before you uninstall it.
8389	0	a	Snuggle Truck is physics-based vehicle game where you need to keep you cargo in your truck. It's ported from mobile platforms. These kind of games used to be flash games on the pc and you probably have a flash game somewhere on the internet that is the same. But the absolute worst thing about this game is that it has a brony mode.

8395	0	a	This is a $5 version of Happy Wheels. It's not even worth the $5 either. It's not a bad game, because it's stealing for Happy Wheels, but it's not a good game because your losing $5 for something that you can get that's better for free.
8396	0	a	A game about balancing the contents of your truck as you go over terrain on a 2D plane. It's simple and difficult. But it couldn't hold my attention. It felt like I was playing an old flash game from the 90s. Something that you'd play around with on a lunch period at school.   They also try to push the stuffed animal thing a bit to far like it's some hilarious joke and I just wasn't on board.
8397	0	a	A simplistic mobile game with awful controls.   PROS: -Graphics are amusing  CONS: -Controls are awful and heavily oversteer (in a game with 4 buttons total that is all about speed runs and control...) -Mobile game -Awkward, exaggerated physics  The game itself is extremely simple: you accelerate your truck (going from left to right) with a bunch of animals loose in the back. As you hit bumps, jumps, etc, you have to even out so the animals dont fall out of the back of the truck.   Sounds simple, but due to over-exaggerated physics and awful controls this one leads to a frustrating experience. The 'Easy' levels were enough for me.
8398	0	a	Great music, great visuals, but more frustrating than it is fun.
8399	0	a	A game with Bronies in mind. Amusing for 5 minutes and that's about.

8401	0	a	There's really not much to say for Snuggle Truck... It's an okay mobile game but there are plenty of other games (both casual and hardcore) where your time would be better spent.
8402	0	a	Do i even need to say anything about this one ?
8403	0	a	Extremely amusing little game, but far too little content even for just $5. Fun lasted for about 30 minutes. There's only so many times you can drive along various bumpy trails and watch stuffed animals fly around before the comedy in it dies out.
8404	0	a	It's like a well-made flash game that gives about half an hour of fun. Once you start achievement whoring it's not so fun though, because the physics can feel very unpredictable. Nothing is more frustrating than thinking you've done everything right only to lose all your cargo because you hit a quirk in the physics.  Ultimately the novelty is fun for a short while, but any further than that and the charm wears off fast. I got it in a bundle and I still wouldn't recommend it for any price.  (Also the reason why my play time is so high is because the game wiped all my save data when I only had about 10 or 20 medals left, so I had to start over. I won't hold that against the game, but it was still very frustrating)
8405	0	a	I would happily pay for this game to not show up in my library.
8406	0	a	Don't buy it. Unless its on sale for under $1.00. There's not much to it. You just run around and get zerged on. No new content. Gets old real fast. No replay value. its worth about $0.99.
8407	0	a	I was one of those fools who picked this game up during a christmas sale where they gave out free stuff for achieving things in games you owned. I miss those days even if they were shameless reasons to make you buy games.  This game has bad reviews for a reason. I wasted hours trying to get that achievement and never did. It was impossible to keep enough people together and my biggest issue was the exponetially increasing respawn rate. die once, 20 seconds, okay, 40 seconds, um, alright, 80 seconds, seriously, 160 second, what the, 320, ARE YOU KIDDING ME. trust me, after multiple attempt for one silly achievement it getss annoying.   The game has little depth, boring combat and was barely worth playing even with good friends. don't ever buy this crap. Even if it's free. well, maybe if it's free and you want to punish yourself.
8408	0	a	Paid like 20cents or something for this game a few years back while it was on sale. It would easily be worth 40cents to get it off my library. Quite honestly it's a masterpiece, if we're speaking of it on a scale of turds.
8409	0	a	Its crap, just basically the same thing for every mission
8410	0	a	This game is one of the worst top-down shooters of all time. The enemies are boring, the music is dull, and the action is dumb. It is lazy game design at its worst. I only got this for the steam badge thing that was going on at the time and hated playing the game that now, 2 years after that Christmas achievement was being given out, I am giving it a negative rating. Only buy this game if you are making a top-down shooter and want to see exactly what NOT to do. This isn't even funny-bad, it's just boring and a slog. Don't buy this game.
8411	0	a	 More frustrating than fun
8412	0	a	I believe I picked this up in a bundle of some description. I gave it a shot, but this game's interesting ideas are let down by poor controls, dodgy graphics and boring, clunky mechanics.  The best part was to be the co-op aspect... but no. Get Alien Swarm or Left 4 Dead to experience a good co-operative game.  Not recommended. Another game I wish could be removed from my Steam Library.
8413	0	a	Oh my god this game is fu­cking unplayable pig­s­hit. Imagine Smash TV / Total Carnage / Robotron 2084 where you can be hurt by your own rockets' splash damage, and enemies have guns that fire relatively quick-moving bullets. Also imagine that your gun requires reloading. This game is f­ucking dogs­hit singleplayer, and I guess you can sorta play it multiplayer, except there are literally tons of games that are more fun so you might as well play those games. This game is so fu­cking awful. With game designers like this roaming the streets of Argentina it's hard not to root for another Dirty War.
8414	0	a	This game should be bunched up and thrown away. Play Magicka instead, it is better in every conceivable way.
8415	0	a	Played multiple stages and they are all the same. Same objectives over and over again. Pretty boring pretty quickly.
8416	0	a	its boring dont get it im wasted by time dont waste yours
8417	0	a	Not my kind of game. It's basically a last stand kind of game with multiple missions in a mission (don't ask). So you keep a button pressed and run around. It's no fun whatsoever.  [Rating: 62/100]
8418	0	a	Another game left to rot.
8419	0	a	Ehh... well if I have to be honest, I don't really like this game at all. Sure its fun doing survival with mates, but there's better games for that. The campagin is really boring, didn't really made me want to play it, even with other players.  I do have good times though, so if you happen to have friends who'd play with you with this game for good price, might as well, but I find it hard to recommend it to any else.  So yeah, either get it while cheap, or just stick with other games that offer same gameplay.
8420	0	a	Wow. This game is terrible. Ganky controls, and no possible way to chat with co-op players without voice. Add no ability to regenerate health and exponential backoffs for respawning (literally leading to 1200+ seconds between respawns -- 20 minutes; literally, I got up and made dinner while waiting to come back) and you have a ♥♥♥-blasting bowl of terrible called 'Bunch of Heroes'.  It's not worth wasting your $2.50 or the 20+ minutes you are going to spend trying to get the steam achievement.  This game sucks!  0/5
8421	0	a	Not so much...  I bought this game thinking that it would be fun to play with friends. However, it turned into us running all over the place trying to find and complete the objectives without much fun or success. Add in the large number of mobs to the chaos, and you'll be lucky to complete the game.   Lame Game.
8422	0	a	One of the least polished twin stick shooters around. Avoid this game if you can. It's not even worth it when it costs a dollar or two.  The game has poor shooting mechanics, and a very bland and repetitive style overall. Good concept but terrible execution overall.
8423	0	a	When I originally bought this game it was on sale and part of the winter achievements for the steam holiday event. This game is a top down shoot and kill with story objectives or a survival mode (which was part of the holiday achievement). I found that most of the time there were so many projectiles being shot at you and with the horrible hit detection made the game frustrating to play. The screen regularly lags with too many things happening on the screen despite having a computer that more than could manage it. In retrospect had I not gotten caught up in the winter event I would never have bought this game, which is a deep regret.

Normally I try to balance a negative review with some redeeming features, but my attempts to play the game were met with frozen screens, crashes, clipping issues, and other sundry problems that left a sour taste in my mouth and a tiny several-dollar-hole in my wallet. Dollars that could have been used for more useful things, like propping up a table or flinging at homeless people.  What I'm saying is, don't buy this game.

8432	0	a	Fun things you can learn about Bunch of Heroes when played at 0.5x speed:  - Your shots aren't missing, the hitboxes don't match up with the (incredibly ugly) models. The laser manages to go through things and not damage them at times. (The laser fires a single beam straight through everything in its path. This is p. egregious when a glowing trail is fading and enemies are unscathed in the middle) - The enemies get more invincibility frames than you do. - Even when given twice the time to trigger, achievements rarely pop properly. - Some of the enemies actually fire completely independent of the direction they face in. A few spawned pointing south, I'd run around them as they finished an animation, and BLAM shotgun from the eyes in the back of their head. - It's still not worth a) paying for b) playing at all or c) even trying when sites like Kongregate or Armor Games have 500 ♥♥♥♥ing games that play better than this in FLASH (probably with better art design) for free
8433	0	a	I purposely bought this for the Steam Holiday Achievement metagame, and so far it has annoyed me endlessly. I'm not going to review this because the way it handles keyboard and mouse camera movement literally makes me sick to my stomach via confusing and sudden top-down camera whiplash. So essentially, I spent $2.50 on digital ipecac. But I will say that the hour I spent playing survival mode for the achievement indicates that this game is not worth the nausea at all. Don't Buy This, Not Even For An Achievement.

8441	0	a	I could go on about how bland and poorly executed this game is, but I'd rather just share this story:  At one point I died because I lost control of my character and he backed into a group of enemies. While waiting for the respawn timer, I left my house to go to the 7-11 down the street for a loaf of bread, came back to my house, and used the bread to make a sandwich.   When I returned to my computer with my sandwich, I respawned.
8442	0	a	Rescue cheerleaders, destroy zombifiers, and protect areas at all costs! These are just some of the repetitious objectives you will find in Bunch of Heroes. It's an okay 4 person coop top view shooter that lacks a few key ingredients: 1) You better invite your own friends because no one plays this, 2) The weapons are underpowered (or the aliens are overpowered) so killing one alien takes a lot of bullets, 3) No weapon upgrades.  There is a small assortment of guns, but they are really stingy on the ammo so most of the time you are left with the default weapon running away while you repeatedly reload. Health packs and power ups seem few and far between as well.  The game could have been improved by offering a tiered difficulty system depending on the number of players in the game, much like Borderlands. It does have game controller support and achievements which is a plus, but in the end, I recommend avoiding this one.
8443	0	a	Christmas achievement doesn't actually get awarded. No health drops from enemies and there's no other health regeneration system. Respawn timers double on every death, meaning you're easily waiting for several minutes as the waves progress.  On top of it all, the game does absolutely nothing special and I've personally played at least a dozen flash games that do similar things but better. Don't buy this game.

Here are a few:  Muddy art direction Very simple and boring gameplay Poor balance (some weapons are useless, respawn timer is exponential and so you can end up waiting literally HOURS to respawn) Identical characters Barren multiplayer (because it is a bad game)  Don't even buy on sale.
8452	0	a	I got bored of this really quick, and to be honest it wasn't even fun with a friend. What annoys me the most is that fact that when i got it and downloaded it it worked, but now it just dosen't and i can't figure out why. Honestly if this game is on sale you might want to bother otherwise don't, just don't. Do yourself a favor and don't waste the money.
8453	0	a	Funny but repetitive.  That's the best summary I can think of for Bunch of Heroes.  The game is an isometric/top down type of co-op shooter where you defend a town from aliens.  I got bored after 15 minutes, maybe because I played alone. But I can't recommend this game, it's just kind of useless to play alone and there's no plot, except to progress in being a hero and killing aliens.  Artwork is nice and fitting for the comical tone of the game.  Meh. 5/10
8454	0	a	This game is simply boring...
8455	0	a	Not worth the money,no freaking way.I payed full damn price of 9.99€ and this crap is what i get!?
8456	0	a	Simple (not necessarily bad) but boring and with some design flaws that are apparant from the start. Didn't continue after finishing the first round. They forgot to add the fun to the game.
8457	0	a	Bore of Heroes. Don't buy this crap.
8458	0	a	terrible game when I played it back in the day the achievement was unwinable for the winter holidays so I hope the developers never develop a game ever again.
8459	0	a	bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥s
8460	0	a	I haven't played many bad games in my life. But this is one of them.
8461	0	a	You got guns and there are zombies. Blow them up until they eat you.  I can see how this game could be fun with the multiplayer online aspect and such but personally it still falls flat. I've played other games of the same type and they were tons more engaging and inspiring. I could still recommend this for others for mindless fun but only if you can get this game between a dollar or for free.  Update: Even with a controller it was still horrible. Bunch of Disappointment.
8462	0	a	Dual joystick shooter with absolutely no redeeming qualities. Spongy enemies, unsatisfying gunplay and incredibly repetitive objectives. This is like something you'd find on Xbox Live Indie Games.  'It could be fun with friends if you're all drunk!' I hear you scream out. Yes, but there's also everything else that's more fun to do with friends while drunk, such as contemplating generative grammar, writing formulae for how fast paint does in fact dry, and sending Valve emails to please remove this game from your library.
8463	0	a	Bunch of Heroes is probably the latest ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game to have graced the indie scene. This game literally has no balance between single player and multiplayer, the game will always assume that there are 4 people playing and therefore the game will always scale towards 4 people. This makes single player survival pretty much impossible, not only that, but the gameplay itself is monotonous and utterly trivial. The special ability of each character is complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and will get you killed almost every time. The entire game mechanics is a ♥♥♥♥ing joke. The only few useful guns in this entire game is the laser gun, rifle, chain gun, and one gun that shoot sparkly missiles. You don’t regenerate health, mob variety is ok, but their artificial intelligence is laughable at best. Save your money and don’t buy this disgrace of an indie game. It is very unlikely that my review of this game will change after I beat the campaign.
8464	0	a	not worth it.
8465	0	a	Its ok but a much better interface much like a fps would be welcome but unless you like that top down shooter crap like Nation red and many others I say don't bother with this game.
8466	0	a	If I was to make a game that was as bad as possible, it would probably turn out like this.
8467	0	a	This game sucks. Very repetitive, aimless, and most of all unfun even with multiplayer.
8468	0	a	In this thrilling adventure of [NOT ALIEN SWARM], our heroes must face their biggest challenge ever! ♥♥♥♥♥♥ health/respawn mechanics!
8469	0	a	My Games Rating: 2,5/10*
8470	0	a	Abominable. Terrible controls, repetitive gameplay. I'd say more, but there really isn't anything else to comment on.
8471	0	a	This game is terrible. Seriously, don't buy it. Any other co-op shooter would be a better use of your time and money. I will give you five dollars to not buy this.
8472	0	a	Pretty basic twin-stick style shooter. Apparently fails to grasp that people playing a shooter want to, y'know, shoot - so hobbles you with low ammo on the decent weapons and constant reloads on the basic pea-shooter. Tedious. The art design is nice enough but it's not worth buying, even heavily reduced.
8473	0	a	I believe that the developers of this game originally planned the title to be Bunch of Bad Game. However after performing poorly in focus groups and test markets, they changes the name to mislead customers into believing that it is infact not a bad game.
8474	0	a	time to uninstall this forever
8475	0	a	This is not a very good game, but if you're looking for an exercise in frustration, this is the game for you!
8476	0	a	Terribly flawed, not fun at all, even in co-op. Avoid like the plague.
8477	0	a	This game is so poorly balanced that.,..jesus. I can't even. Just... Just don't ever buy this game. Don't ever play this game.
8478	0	a	Its bleh....
8479	0	a	This game tries to borrow gameplay elements from other games, like surviving waves of enemies. Unfortunately it is not appealing for some reason.
8480	0	a	Buy this game if you like ♥♥♥♥ games.
8481	0	a	I never touched this game because of 2011 Winter Sales. There was an achievement event those days and somehow i get this game and started to hunt an exact achievement. I formed a party with some unknown guys; i've literally wasted my time because getting this achievement wasn't so fun. And then, this silly game didn't count my achievement, even i did it properly.  After a while, tried the game again but no... That wasn't fun at all. Then, uninstalled it... maybe forever.
8482	0	a	There is something wrong with this game... I get bugs with it... it frezzes and quite a few other problems. Also I did not notice till I got it, it's a pay to win. &gt;&lt; So I blew my cash on a game that more other games would give for free, so you would burn real cash on extras in the game. Lame.   I don't think anyone should buy this.
8483	0	a	Don't buy if u must pay more than 0,49 €.
8484	0	a	this game sucks. only played it cause my poor cheap friend jason teo bought it to make it look like he had money
8485	0	a	Must have of any gamers collection 10/10
8486	0	a	Feels like children game. If you add drugs, booze, and sex, it still feels like children game.
8487	0	a	this game is ♥♥♥♥
8488	0	a	What an absolutely despicable game! Hope i didn\t pay for this. Uninstalling is too good for this, it should be removed from my Steam account completely.  It't not worthy of being called a game.
8489	0	a	♥♥♥♥. Not 'The ♥♥♥♥', a piece of ♥♥♥♥. 4 hours of my life I will never get back. Take the $2.50 you could spend on this game and pay a big dude to kick you in the pants. Would be a much better investment.
8490	0	a	probably the worst game i've played. my dad gifted this to me ages ago, so i tried it out.  in multiplayer, the players were always just bots and i could never actually join the game. singleplayer was almost unplayable, for some reason.  don't waste your money
8491	0	a	Do not waste your time with this game. This is one of the worst games I have ever played on Steam. The controls are clunky and the music, enemies and artstyle are all very uninspired. The difficulty ramp up is very slow and they don't introduce enough new gameplay elements to keep the game interesting.  If you are looking for games of this ilk, you can do so much better than this. Alien Swarm, for example, is infinitely better than this, and it's a free game.
8492	0	a	Not very fun, even with friends.
8493	0	a	If you're going to play solo, don't even try. Just don't.
8494	0	a	One of the worst games on Steam without a doubt. A total joke, a laughing stock. A complete and utter mess.

8499	0	a	Very passable experience. Feels cheap in every way possible.
8500	0	a	Who? What? Why...
8501	0	a	turn and run this game is a 1 out of 10 , bad game, bad control, bad netcode, bad music, bad graphics. i bought this because valve dangled a carrot during the winter gift grab. in other words : extortion.
8502	0	a	Fun coop game, could easily be better refined though. As playing with randies is no fun :(
8503	0	a	Not worth it. Play Alien Swarm instead!
8504	0	a	This game is almost impossible to play in Single Player mode. I would not recommend getting this game unless you have 3 other friends who already own it and will play it with you. ***
8505	0	a	I'm not going to say that there is nothing redeeming about this game. It is fun to just kill zombies and aliens willy nilly. However this is completely lost in a horrible re-spawning system where every time you die, the wait to re-spawn doubles, friendly fire that is completely unavoidable and unable to turn off, half your weapons cause exploding damage that pretty much means you will hit one of your friends and a complete lack of healing. I played the game on easy and spent more time dead than alive because apparently difficulty doesn't matter in this game. You will die.
8506	0	a	Another game where using the interface is about as pleasant for me as ramming a rusty nail through my palm. It looks fun and it probably also is - for those people who can use monkey controllers. For people like me, who require keyboard+mouse input, this game is unbearable. I tried jumping in to get the holiday achievement and failed miserably. Then I tried the campaign and failed even more miserably before getting anywhere. After about two minutes into each try I was frustrated and annoyed. It is not that the game fails absolutely - I just never got a chance to see if it is any good. The interface is simply keeping me out.
8507	0	a	More boring than doing homework. No joke.  Enemies are bulletsponges that dont offer any challenge. I'd rather not explain why this is so boring and just tell you to not touch this mess. Buy some other horde mode game
8508	0	a	DO NOT BUY. This is one of the most boring and awful games I have ever had the misfoturne of playing. Anyone who has not played this game has a better life then me because I have actually had to suffer through what I relectantly have to call a game for lack of a better name.
8509	0	a	A fairly challenging game that doesn't take itself too seriously, but the missions are repetive in their nature, and most of the achievements requires a notable amount of grinding to accomplish (beat x enemy y 1000 times). Only buy if it's a discount.
8510	0	a	It is a funny and stupid game to play with friends, gets old pretty fast but you and your friends can come back to it every now and then for some mindless entertainment.
8511	0	a	This game is boring, dull, and otherwise unimaginative. Not worth time, money, energy or any combination of those.
8512	0	a	Awkward controls and repetitive gameplay
8513	0	a	Looks beautiful but plays horrible. Single or multiplayer it doesn't matter....it sucked. The game was a cash grab by the dev/pub that fell short on promises. Avoid this game.
8514	0	a	Possibly as bad as Bad Rats.
8515	0	a	Multiplayer does not work properly.
8516	0	a	Pretty basic and not very exciting. Graphics are decent. It's just not super fun to play.
8517	0	a	Pretty clunky game. Wave-based top down shooter. Probably only fun with a player 2.
8518	0	a	This may look like a fun and colorful arcade shooter but it's actually a poorly realized mess with frustrating gameplay mechanics. Also, the developers of this game haven't done a damn thing to support this game. Get 'Nation Red' instead.
8519	0	a	This just handles so badly in every way. It doesn't do well with sticks or a mouse. It's hard to tell when you're hitting an enemy. It's hard to figure out secondary objectives, the enemies never stop spawning so you can't clear an area and think. There isn't anything good to say about this game.
8520	0	a	Isometric shooter, really nothing that makes it stand out. It has four character classes which other than slight variations in the special attacks pretty much play exactly the same. There is no leveling or skill building of any kind. No local multiplayer, online multiplayer is nonexistent and I can't blame anyone for not playing this. There are also several broken and unattainable achievements. I doubt those will ever be fixed since the game has been out for 3 years now and the developer hasn't corrected them by now. If it wasn't for the Holiday Sale of 2011 I would not own this game. I highly recommend anyone even slightly thinking about buying this game to pass.

8540	0	a	I was not expecting much depth or variance in the gameplay, but what I have experienced left me underwhelmed to say the least.  Yes, the game is simple, fast-paced and these are the only pros I can think of about this release. Other than that SS D XXL has nothing that could keep me playing for more than 30min. Even the absurdity of connecting various weapons is not enough when the game is repetitive and lacks the 'spark' to keep me engaged.
8541	0	a	Disgrace to the Serious Sam Franchise...  0/10
8542	0	a	Even as a huge Serious Sam fan, I simply can't recommend this game.  For starters, there's a HUGE game-breaking bug with the XXL version that causes the game to crash on start-up after you play it for the first time. Restarting your computer, even uninstalling and reinstalling the game, none of it works, and even after 3 years the dev team hasn't been able to fix it.  Besides that, the whole gun stacking mechanic sounds interesting on paper, but in practice you just end up wielding a bunch of shotguns and rifles together and the magic quickly wears off. Explosives are even more dangerous here than they are in the 3D games, because you have an extremely limited line of sight meaning that usually by the time you can see an enemy, they're already rushing towards you and using a rocket launcher will just get you caught in the splash damage. The grenade launcher is also useless for this same reason, since it's main use in the 3D games was lobbing a grenade into a horde of advancing enemies.  Melee enemies are also hideously broken. Just one kleer can do a ton of damage, but unlike in the 3D games they can occupy the same space and deal damage simultaneously, meaning you can have about 6-7 kleer running and lunging around beneath you, and if you end up dropping down (probably while you're distracted with another horde of enemies) you might as well have fallen into a pit of instant death spikes.  Serious Sam's trademark of having massive hordes of strong enemies rushing you simply doesn't translate well into a 2D platformer, or if it does, the devs haven't done a very good job of translating it.
8543	0	a	Seriously goofy side scroller. Got boring real fast.
8544	0	a	Quirky design and decent soundtrack but didn't really enjoy this in comparison to other game sin the series. I felt the side scrolling got dull quick especially after getting a couple of guns. 5/10
8545	0	a	Serious Sam DD XXL 2013 Crashes upon startup. Wish this game were atually playable
8546	0	a	Let me get this off my chest, I HATE this artstyle. I think this is one of the worst looking games I've ever seen. If they had only chose a better looking art style then I would like this game, but it's way too ugly and unappealing
8547	0	a	Boring 2D platformer shooter. Mindless, repetitive, not worth the time or 99 cents. I think the positive reviews are from paid shills.
8548	0	a	Looks like one of those crappy flash games. Terrible controls. Awful scrolling and zooming. Worse interaction with environment. Impossible to know if you'll land in a higher terrain after jumping... Very bad. Only the lame humour can be enjoyed. I don't know how they got the license of the franchise to do such a crap  Oh! And a bug in Windows7 will crash it when starting sometimes! Do not forget the bug
8549	0	a	I am a big fan of the Serious series and looked forward to this stupidness! It turnes out to be a horrible console port of some kind. The UI and menus are gastly and hard to navigate. I can't decide wether the game itself looks good or bad. Last, but not least; the gameplay was meh.
8550	0	a	not worth
8551	0	a	Do not waste money on this awful game. Its just a shameless attempt to cash in on the Serious Sam name. £6 is a total rip off, and I couldn't even recommend buying it in a sale. Fortunately I got it free with my retail copy of SS3. I always try to be fair and find something good to say about a game but in this case I honestly can't think of anything. Its difficult to aim with a mouse and jumping doesn't always seem to work when running. Enemies have an annoying tendancy to spawn in your exact position, even when you're moving around, making it impossible to avoid taking damage. The story is non existent (it makes SS1 and 2 look like works of Shakespeare), and its very short. I got to the end boss in 2.5 hours, although there are some challenge modes if you really want some replayability. And its nowhere near as funny as it thinks it is. There are dozens of other indie games more worthy of your time and money, so please, support those instead.
8552	0	a	Cheap, crude, and simple, Could've sworn I played this exact same game on Newgrounds ten years ago.  In fact I'm pretty sure that I played better games on Newgrounds ten years ago.
8553	0	a	I hope steam will allow you to discard games in the future.
8554	0	a	I do not recommend this game because of its really badly displayed monsters that dont fit in, just 'classes' it self as a serious sam game, when really its not. It doesn't have the intense feel of the collection. Then theres the Cheap mechanics. Terrible. It's like your Typical rubbish flashgame that took a day to make. Although my harsh words it has a FEW good points, The gunstacking and the meh level dept, Although the dept is good the bad controlls makes you not want to play it, I only played it for 5 minutes and found it bad! If you bored buy this if your not go get the other Amazing intense super serious sam games that are just... just pure awesomeness. They tried a project but they were to eager to finish and they didn't make the good touches. Apart from guns.
8555	0	a	its a fun game but xxl dont work for me :(
8556	0	a	Game starts with system language as game language by default, and there's no way of changing that, other than renaming the folder in the game directory. Controls are dumb. Aim assist is on by default, reticules fail to provide a simple solution for the problem, which would be just 'aim in the direction of the mouse cursor'. Secrets consist of dumb 'lol useless box internet meme' crap, and the blood effects are not satisfying at all. Sound quality of the voice snippets is questionable as well.  I may have played further if these obvious problems didn't exist, but I don't see why I should waste my time with it.
8557	0	a	Uuuuh, just a bad sidescroller. There's nothing good here. Get Metal Slug, get Intrusion, get Megaman, but avoid this one.
8558	0	a	Awful - the graphics are poor and it just isn't fun.
8559	0	a	IT WAS AMAZING.  Take SS and make it 2D. Done perfectly and as fun if not more fun than the official installments. Give it a try. However I will not recommend, simply because I believe this game should be free for what it is, or at least bundled with the other fan projects for one fee.
8560	0	a	its not serious sam but i guess its fun if your into that...
8561	0	a	Looks like a flash game, plays like a flash game. If it hadn't come with one of the Serious Sam packs, I would never have bought it. Simply put, there are better side scrolling flash games out there, none of which I would pay for. Save your money.
8562	0	a	It sucks and looks horribly.
8563	0	a	This wasn't the worst Serious Sam game I've played, and it had some fun ideas (you build your own guns off of parts you find, you can find and carry a jump pad), but I would recommend playing Contra instead. Especially Super C. That game was awesome.
8564	0	a	no online coop, nuff said.
8565	0	a	this game sucks balls
8566	0	a	really really bad gamethe person who made this should be fired and beaten to death with his keyboard this qwould have been good for 1992 but this is just lazy abusing a fransich name in the hope to get money out of it
8567	0	a	2D action platformer wich sells solely because the brand 'serious sam'. Has cardboard cutout graphics and the original sound effects ripped of its original game. Didn't enjoy playing it.
8568	0	a	I'll just stick up with my HDs for now..
8569	0	a	Has some cheap thrills.
8570	0	a	This game is entirely too easy. It's practically devoid of any challenge. Everything about the game makes it needlessly easy. You start off with aiming assistance and a nice big line of arrows aiming for your targets. You can climb higher, meaning enemies can't reach you and they run around uselessly. So the typically destructive kamikazes run around screaming while you pick them off from a higher platform. And then there's the weapon stacking. They let you fire multiple weapons at once. That sounds awesome, but it makes the game practically impossible to lose. I turned off all the assistance features and restarted the game on the hardest difficulty and it was still one of the least challenging games I've ever played. And I'm not exactly a champion speedrunner, I'll still go down like a truckload of anvils if I play sidescrollers like Contra or Alien Hominid. Serious Sam games are chaotic shooters, but they do challenge you with tricky enemy types and ammo rationing. The designers are clearly Serious Sam fans and I wish them luck, but they weren't able to replicate the challenge of the Serious Sam games.
8571	0	a	This is kinda halfway between yes and no. It's not really a bad game, but it's not really good either. The only thing that stood out to me is the 'gun stacking' mechanic, which is silly enough to be fun for a little while. Instead of switching between different weapons you pick up or just dual-wielding, you also pick up wrench items that each allow you to literally bolt another gun onto the increasingly ridiculous/unwieldy tower in your hands. They all fire simultaneously, of course. There is something to be said for running around with a stack of multiple shotguns and tommy guns with a chainsaw hanging off the end, but once the novelty of that wears off the rest of the game is neither here nor there. It's just...meh.
8572	0	a	This game was fun to co-op until we encountered numerous gamebreaking bugs. I don't know if we were just unlucky, but the game became almost unplayable. We fixed it after hours of testing stuff and lots of frustration. I do not think the game was fun enough to deal with these annoying bugs, so I cannot recommend it.
8573	0	a	I bought this game a long time ago for a decent amount of money, but since it's a long game, I postponed playing it... Until recently.  Many of the 'recommended' reviews here are from people who spent a very, very short time playing Avadon. Had I written such a review when I was only a couple of hours into the game, it would have been positive, too. It was very fun at the start... but then it became profoundly NOT fun.  You see, early on, you have a couple of quests and a couple of locations. You have various characters, you find items, battles are nice, you get better loot, your characters work in synergy... And then the game suddenly becomes a chore. Quests pile up. The quest texts never get updated. There are no indicators anywhere about the people you need to visit or return to. No indicator of what you need to do. I spent a lot of time going around and talking to people, only to find out that a quest isn't over. The loot doesn't scale up. Your damage doesn't scale up. And the game difficulty (I played on 'normal') suddenly switches to 'most frustrating game ever'. You die. You die a lot. You are too weak. You need luck with the RNG, and you need potions and scrolls in greater amounts that you can obtain. Your abilities are on a large cooldown. Again, not enough potions to alleviate that. To add insult to injury, you spend vitality on abilities and vitality *does not recharge by itself*. You need to basically go back to the Avadon fortress on a semi-regular basis. There's no real quick-travel system, so every time you want to do that, you're looking at about five wasted minutes.  About 15 hours in, I seriously contemplated quitting right there and then; but I said to myself 'you spent more on this than on many other games, so you NEED to finish it'. I had a quest to follow a warrior into the woods and clear out some spiders. 'Some' turned out to be about four nests of four to five spiders each. They were teleporting spiders which cast corrupting spells and thus did a lot of damage-over-time. Took me an hour to finally win that sidequest. Okay, I said, this is one of the harder battles; let's continue. Then I found what was an almost unbeatable Shade. Somehow managed to get that done as well. Then I found an evil Drake that spawned minions *and* mind-controlled several tough soldiers (EDIT: forgot to mention that it was HEALING those soldiers, so every time you came close to killing one, it would be healed to max HP; repeat 4-5 times, while your characters die and you've spent all of your potions). That... that was unbeatable, and it was the turning point at which I resorted to cheats: bumped my characters to level 30, then constantly used healing, shields and ability cooldown reset.  I gave up on the sidequests. I have no idea where I found most of the people and what I needed to do next (again - the quest system is extremely rudimentary and doesn't tell you anything). Even with constant cheating, it took me a total of 40 hours to finish the main story line.  Disregard the 'recommended' reviews, honestly, and check the achievements:  Only 1/3 of the total number of players met a certain NPC called Redbeard, and that happens *very* early into the game.  Only 1/50 (a measly 2%) of the players finished Avadon. Two percent. Wow.  You see all those &lt;40hr reviews? Yeah, they recommended a game they never finished. If it's so fun and great and awesome, why did they stop playing? Because of the issues I mentioned here. Let's not even get into 'OMG BEST GAME EVER!!11' reviews from people with 1-5 hours in.  Skip this. Honestly. Even if you get this in a bundle, it's just not worth playing. Get an RPG that's actually fun.  If you *do* feel masochistic and try to play without cheating, I'll give you a tip: in this game, Dexterity rules. Get it to a minimum of 25.  Highly not recommended.
8574	0	a	The game doesn't have great visuals nor any music ingame, but that isn't why I give a negative rating. It starts quite interesting and the design of the first 'dungeon' is really good. Levelling the first ten levels makes your character a lot stronger plus the story and characters get you interested in more. I'd say after around half of the game it falls apart. The levelling gets boring and the combat tedious as every enemy uses special abilities every round to increase the difficulty. This is just annoying and slows the game down to a halt. The locations are overly reused and the story rushes towards the grand finale without making much sense anymore.  Overall it's a not really bad turn based RPG, but it's simply not worth your time eventually. There are better RPGs out there and you should be playing them instead.
8575	0	a	A disappointing turn-based RPG.  I heard many great things about Avernum/Geneforge, two game series from the same developer, hence I had high expectations about Avadon. Unfortunately, this game features a really poor writing style, lame character design, terrible graphics, and no music whatsoever.  The game world is quite huge. Sadly, this just mean very, very long empty corridors and roads. The RPG elements feature a nice, if very simplified, skill tree, equipment and looting system. You can also recruit a few people in your party which you have full control over them. While the combat is turn-based, the rest of the game plays in real-time.  On the bright side, you can solve many encounters through dialogues, instead of fighting them. The game also has a well designed user interface and plenty of tool tips for about everything. Plus, for players who love hoarding stuff, you get to loot absolutely everything in the game, from trash lying on the floor, to bones and flesh from your fallen victims. And if your inventory is full, you can always unload all your trash to your other party members.  Despite all my love for turn-based RPG's, I certainly can't recommend this game to anybody.
8576	0	a	Not Spiderweb Soft's best work. Not even close. Boss fights can be HORRIBLY unbalanced. Been trying to beat the final guy for over an hour, on the lowest difficulty setting with a max level party and the best weapons/equipment in the game according to what info I can find online. Attacks that did ~80 damage to the previous boss now do at most 14 damage to him. His health bar hasn't moved a single pixel in the last twenty minutes. And the kicker? I've been using the cheat codes every single turn. Pretty much have to, the boss gets 5 actions most turns which he uses to apply conditions to all 3 party members. He keeps magically yanking his own soul out to create golems that make him completely immune to specific types of damage. Have to spend 2-5 turns smashing the golem before being able to touch him and most hits are registering damage in the single digits. Pure frustration.
8577	0	a	A good idea but the clunk interface, dull leveling system, and booooring quests make it not worth the money. Maybe on sale get it.
8578	0	a	If you are a core RPG fan, and like indie titles (missing a lot of polishment compared to publisher games) revert the recommendation to yes. But I found particularly the in-battle game UI very unusable. It's extremely simple to perform an action you haven't intended to, and I frequently did. That was a deal breaker for me. (I played around 10 hours outside of this Steam account).
8579	0	a	I do enjoy other Spiderware games. Just this one was Meh. Little to no actual unique customer creation. It feels like a bad mashup between turnbased strategy and diabloesque character skills, which simply left me completely underwhelemed. The skill tree is probably the most obnoxious part of the game, as it forces you to spend a massive number of points on skills your not interested in so you can put a couple points into the next Tier up.
8580	0	a	Boring and soulless cRPG. Even if you like other of Vogel's series (Geneforge and Avernum) you should pass on this game, because it falls short in comparison. If you don't like other Vogel's series, then you'd rather enjoy hitting your balls more than playing Avadon. Annoying combat and interface, huge and empty world, boring dialogues and story. The setting is another fantasy, so I won't even mention how banal and unremarkable it is. Even if you get this game for free, it's not worth your time.
8581	0	a	I played this game for a very long time. Looking back, I'm not totally sure why I continued to play. I don't remember playing the game with fondness; instead, I remember repetitive, lifeless turn-based gameplay. Maybe it was just that the amount of games available for Linux at the time was quite limited, and I needed something to pass the time. Anyway ...  Of particular note, I think, is the moment I stopped playing this game. I'm going to try to talk about that moment with some abstraction, such that it doesn't spoil anything about the game. In (what I believe is) the last fight in the game, a new dynamic is introduced that none of the other fights in the game even came close to touching upon. This would have been fine if other fights in the game had other, interesting dynamics, but combat in this game is largely a static affair. So, when I went into this fight, I expected the fight to follow the same formula as every single other fight in the game. After a few attempts, I figured out what was going on, and realized that the dynamic that was being used made it nearly impossible to win the fight using my max-level characters.  I never played the game again.  2/10. 
8582	0	a	I really love Jeff Vogel's old Exile/Avernum games in the great sense of open ended exploration. There were secrets areas to stumble on and the game was not afraid of giving you nearly game breaking powers to reward you for making it to the end of that hidden dungeon. The new isometric games on the other hand feel much more constricted and linear. The lack of an explorable world map means you never get a grand scope and end up just completing missions people give you in basically the order they're given. It still gave me that old style RPG fix a bit, but the limited customizability was another strike against this game. As always, the writing is quite good given the large amount of content written.
8583	0	a	There's a difference between making nostalgia fuel and deliberately worshipping the worst elements of old-school game design. Hideous UI design, sluggish combat, and a disjointed, nearly nonexistent story all seem to be misguided attempts to revive 'the golden age' of RPGs. What finally made me give up on it was realizing that the game could repeatedly be crashed to desktop just by trying to open the inventory of a summoned creature. Was this thing debugged? Or is quality control what ruined gaming?
8584	0	a	Game was simple but fun until the end. Trying to engage in the fight with Redbeard at the end was as frustrating as the message boards promised. That element really soured it for me, so I will probably not buy another Avadon game.
8585	0	a	I bought the game on a whim, and I'll admit I haven't played it much, but it definately didn't grip me at all in the first hours of play. Maybe it gets better later, but I don't really feel that's a good defense of any game.
8586	0	a	As far as old school, Ultima-like RPG's go, this is one of the best. It's very heavy on the dialogue and lore - which, unfortunately, falls a bit short. The questing is ok and the character creation and design is interesting. I can't put my finger on why this isn't a very fun game, and maybe it's just that; I find it slow and boring.   5/10  - are you into playing RPG's like you did on your Windows 3.1 or your C64, there's a chance you'll enjoy this. I'll give it another try sometime.
8587	0	a	No one ever universally upvotes 'Not Recommended' reviews, cause they want to come here to see others enjoy their game, usually. That being said, I'm not writing for upvotes, I just want to make a few things clear; this isn't the type of game/genre I usually like. I played it shortly, didn't personally enjoy it, and thus, can't recommend it. So why am I writing a review on a game that wasn't made for my tastes? Because I played it, and I'm recording my thoughts.  Its audience is likely a niche one, fans of the old-school isometric RPGs of the 90s will feel relatively at home with good graphics, some modern gameplay mechanics, but that's about as far as it goes for me personally. No music, clunky, jerky movement and animation(if any at all). Walls of text constantly pop up in my face, which I wouldn't normally mind except none of it was interesting; the characters, the setting... and the controls just make me feel limited. The premise seemed alright, a fortress feared by all destined to put a stop to a warring world, but lack of customization or character depth led me to find nothing about the game worth being drawn into.   While the gameplay itself seems solid, and definitely nails that oldschool RPG, and I give it credit for (i believe) one guy doing it all, Avadon just hit no buttons for me with its lack of atmosphere, characters, story or art.

8589	0	a	Sorry, i wanted to like this game a lot, but i don't. It feels like your not in charge. This game made me feel like i'm the president's janitor. Whenever something important happens ( like revenge for your teammate , fighting the bad wizard) the game makes the choice for you what you want to do. This makes everything you do seem inconsequential, if it's important the game Makes Sure You Make The Correct Choice. You are just left to clean up.
8590	0	a	I think this game is hard. I am playing on normal and it was easy at first, then it got a little harder, then wham it gets flat out unfair and not fun. I liked everything about the game at first, then shi* hit the fan. A couple other reviews said the same thing. I love rpg's and figuring stuff out, but you hardly have a chance to beat this game, it's ridiculous.
8591	0	a	Every time I tried to get into this I'd run into a game breaking bug.
8592	0	a	it was a good game with graphics
8593	0	a	I like to give games a chance to see whether or not they're any good for me. I gave this one a shot and I did not like it.
8594	0	a	Don't be fooled by its close resemblance to a classic Baldur's Gate/Fallout early PC era RPG. This game confuses narrative depth with bloat, loading every conversation with paragraphs of poorly written and cumbersome dialogue. The combat is so shallow and unvaried, you'll have experience everything it has to offer halfway through the first dungeon.
8595	0	a	I like old school RPG games like Fallout 2 etc. However I did really try and like this game butit was just too slow, takes far too much time to get anywhere, and objects on groud are hard to see and find. Maybe 20 years ago it would have been ok, but just too ugly and boring.
8596	0	a	I'm biased because I'm not typically a fan of these kind of games, but rough graphics, poor sound design, fairly cheesy writing, and to top it off, some terrible font choices for the tons of required reading make this game a firm thumbs down. I could probably play some more, but I really didn't want to.
8597	0	a	I was hoping for something more akin to the avernum but with a new start. I was disappointed. Avernum exceeds in mechanical complexity (mainly their many skills available) and setting depth. Avadon seems to be lacking in comparison. The skill tree is woefully simplified and uninteresting and the setting isn't as engaging to me. Just pick up one of the newer Avernum games.

8599	0	a	While it's an improvement over the previous Spiderweb titles, it still feels dull and repetitive.
8600	0	a	This is absolutely one of the biggest disappointments I've ever had on Steam. Please - check my reviews, I'm no troll. In fact, this may be my first bad review. However - this game is a mess. It hangs up, saved games aren't reliable, the screen settings aren't reliable... read the forums. The most posted involve the game bugging and not continuing (in any of a number of ways/quests). What's sad ISN'T that a game has bugs (though for a coding as old as this, it almost is) but that NOTHING is done to alleviate them in the years its been out? This game is continuing to be sold - they rewrote it for Ipad - and it has the same quest lockups/resolution issues! I'm sorry to say it (because I've TRIED to like this game) but it's not worth it. Look elsewhere.
8601	0	a	Retro doesn't mean laziness in development. Tried it, won't play it again.  Awful sound Awful graphics Awful dungeons Awful system Awful story
8602	0	a	Starts off fun but gets so incredibly boring and difficult. There is also too much text too read and the game is just slightly too barebones for my taste. That's not to say it is awful, it is quite fun with an old school fantasy RPG vibe and I like developing my character, it gets quite fun! The story is also pretty good. All in all if you like this kind of game and it is cheap go for it, if not purchase a non indie RPG
8603	0	a	Didn't get past the walls of boring tutorial text. Perhaps is great game behind walls of boredom?
8604	0	a	I couldn't get by the TON and TON of reading. Between that and the small graphics, I'd prefer to play this on my phone than on Steam.
8605	0	a	Some ones attempt at making a CRPG in modern times.
8606	0	a	I don't know if it stops interrupting you to present walls of text, or when it does if it does, but the whole interface was frustratingly slow to work with and the constant stop/start textvomit killed it for me.
8607	0	a	Kind of scraping the bottom of the barrel for RPG quality. Wish I hadn't purchased this.
8608	0	a	Don't get me wrong, Avadon is a pretty decent RPG, and has all the strengths I've come to expect from Spiderweb (strong story, good humor, etc). The thing is though...I just couldn't get into it. I can't even really explain why, it just wasn't for me.  Its by no means a bad game. Its just a game that I can't see myself playing much.
8609	0	a	Plus: If you are into the long long drawn out RPGs, you will likely enjoy this one. Be prepared for a ton of reading and a lot of old school back and forth turn based battles. Minus: I play games to play. If I want to read a fantasy novel, I get a book. Mediocre graphics. Boring battles. Lots of overhead work. 2/10.

8610	0	a	I like oldschool RPGs... This is a sorry excuse for an RPG in general. Not much else to say. I would stay as far away as possible.
8611	0	a	many fun, lots stone, bring family here, no buy, is mine.
8612	0	a	WARNING - i payed for this game, yet cannot play it, and there is no way to contact Steam. DONT BUY IT!
8613	0	a	too slow, i wasn't interested in the story. stopped playing mid way through.
8614	0	a	some kid's high school computer science project lookin good
8615	0	a	This game is alright I guess. Grid-style turn based combat, text story, monsters, do jobs for your leader until the sort of obvious plot comes about. Character skills are pretty normal and generic, as are most enemies. The story is kind of unexciting as nothing truly interesting happens and the game hints at just about everthing right from the start. This game isn't BAD by any regard, there's just nothing to wow, entertain, or surprise in any aspect of it (aesthetic, story, gameplay).  On the other hand, the game is thankfully lacking in serious flaw. No respec can slightly screw you over but you can just cheat for that, and the game lets the player be smart with stacked upgrades and things (dodge chance, for example). Only a few optional bossfights are truly hard (played on Normal difficulty), although the problem is that this is often due to RNG deciding whether or not the boss wants to 1 shot a party member.  This came out on iPad first apparently? Not bad for a mobile market littered with awful games, especially with its VERY impressive 40hr+ length! But on PC you probably have other things to play. Pass unless you want a loy-key RPG to pass some time with.
8616	0	a	Playing this game is agony. I don't think I've ever not cared as much as I don't care about this game. Story is so boring it's awe-inspiring. 'Moral Choices' are a joke (Literally no penalty at all for stealing). Combat is tedious as hell.  Just get some friends and play D&amp;D instead.  Don't buy this game.
8617	0	a	I played Exile and I liked it. This is no Exile. I have no idea why I put in 118 hours into this game.   The Good The story is interesting.   The Bad The tactics part is horrible. Enemy shoot through walls. Things that look like they should block your shot don't . This is the worse tactical rpg I ever played.  The spell/power system is just bad. In most battles you get to use a skill once. Mind you I didn't finish the game after 118 hours so maybe you can use abilites more than once after you hit 119 hours. Note I know the game is only 45 hours or so. My play style might have made my characters way overpowered. Still combat was rather boring. There wasn't enough RPG in the game. There were a bunch of times the dialog options were lacking or just didn't matter. There is no point to having multiple choice questions if 90% of the time the choice doesn't matter. The loot system is very bad. Early on I got some good gear. I used the same gear for about 95 hours because I never find better stuff. Most of the loot I find is just junk The interface is functional but bad. I can't pick something up without it going into my bag. This is a problem when I wanted to put it in my quick slot. I should be able to grab it from the ground and drag it to where I want.   I'm done with this sieres but I might play some other spiderweb games. Like I said I liked Exile. Go play that or Planescape Torment. Final Fantsy Tactics is another good one.
8618	0	a	Avadon is a great game initially which quickly becomes a complete chore. Quests stack up and become really tough to manage, it's difficult to find NPC's once you've completed a quest (in a really huge map), quest journals don't update properly when you've completed a quest, etc. It's a massive, massive game with a lot of potential. Hopefully Avadon 2 is better...

8621	0	a	For me, the failure of Avadon is in the setting. It's crapsacktacular, with every significant NPC being a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and all the various factions being murderous, amoral thugs. I simply got tired of continuing the game in the face of hating everybody in it.

8624	0	a	It's on sale for $0.29 right now, but you're better off just buying a gumball instead. It's four cents cheaper and you can blow bubbles.
8625	0	a	I do not recommend this game for anyone over the age of 8. There is little to no challenge even on the highest difficulty, the voices are dreadfully squeaky and annoying and the music is barely tolerable. I bought this game for 29 cents and I still feel as if it was a complete waste of money.
8626	0	a	so bad i want my money back cant even play multi player
8627	0	a	It gets boring after 2-3 days of playing it because gameplay gets quite repetitive.
8628	0	a	Unless you enjoy talking balls that make engine sounds and jump around in a small arena, I would not get this game. I only paid $0.29 for it, but I just don't like it. I closed the game after 5 minutes and never played it again.

8634	0	a	A kids game that is not even better than Pajama Sam.
8635	0	a	It's a cute game to play on free time, but it's more fun to play with friends but many people are reluctant to buy it also online servers are very RARE almost no one playes it, it'd be fun with more people but on your own it gets a bit too repetitive
8636	0	a	Probably the worst game I've bought. I was glad to have gotten it for only $0.50 on sale. Right now I can run crysis 2 on high with DX11 on at full fps but this game lags like a benchmark running on a potato. I'm not the only person to complain about this. Perhaps if you fix it, it might be worth your time.
8637	0	a	Its a horibol game not fun game play so just buy a better game
8638	0	a	this game is good, but its not the best  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
8639	0	a	Again a bundled purchase. not somthing i like
8640	0	a	not what i expected 
8641	0	a	'Game of the Year 2006!' - A very very dismal year. This game has it all: horrendous optimization, the tinniest voices my ears will never hear again, the disgusting artwork, and o top it all off I bought this game  twice , I want my $0.88 back and all 31 minutes of my life back. 10/10 would hang myself with my laptop charger before getting this game for free. Thinking back on this, I do wish I killed myself before playing this atrocious pile of code called a 'game'.
8642	0	a	IGN 10/10 good story. Can´t wait for the GOTY version to release. Most annoying menu screen ever btw. Get bubble gum and stick it in your dark hole, you´ll have more fun.
8643	0	a	Gumboy Tournament is the multiplayer version of Gumboy: Crazy Adventures. You're a gumboy, which is basically a ball that can stick to surfaces, also the gumboy is able to jump.  Your goal in the game is to collect more diamonds than your opponent does. You can play vs bots, local vs a friend or online. Mind you though, there probably won't be any player online to play.  Gumboy Tournament is a neat party game, especially for kids but you probably get bored with it pretty quickly. The game is cheap (normal price: 2 bucks, in a steam deal it could be 0,30 cents) which is the right price for the game but in my opinion it's not enough to recommend this game.   
8644	0	a	if you like this you're either a baby or an iphone gamer
8645	0	a	Does not work on windows 8.1
8646	0	a	A friend of mine bought this game for me and another friend. All three of us loaded it up and played it for about 10 long minutes. Gumboy Tournament is the most worthless game I've ever played in my entire life.   We play a lot of games together .. we're great friends.. I mean we have fun just talking in skype. I used to think we could have fun no matter what the game was as long as we were playing it together. Gumboy shattered that belief and wasted 10 minutes of my life that I will never get back. I lost some respect for my friend and I wish I could erase it from my game history and my brain.
8647	0	a	It's looking like good game for little kids but not for me.
8648	0	a	Nope. Just nope.  I played it back when it first came out. Not sure if it's improved, but I'm not bother going to try. When you launch a game, you need to be prepared, and these people were definitely not. Matchmaking didn't work most of the time and they had one server somewhere in east europe to which I had a ping &gt;400ms.
8649	0	a	imagine getting gangrene on your ♥♥♥♥♥ then having to cut it off with a dull filet knife  that is getting this game to work on multiplayer  
8650	0	a	THIS GAME SUCKS. BOUGHT IT FOR A REALLY CHEAP PRICE BUT IT'S STILL NOT WORTH IT COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY. REALLY SUCKS.
8651	0	a	it makes sticky noises when you roll around. stay away from this game.

8653	0	a	Good game if you get it work. Badly optimized garbage. Devs, don't make anymore games, ok?
8654	0	a	wow coudlnt play with friends 0/10
8655	0	a	I remember playing it outside of Steam, it was great. Too bad it's Steam version has extremely low framerate for some reason which is important for such a fast-paced game. There is no way to solve this problem.
8656	0	a	Very boring and dull game. Maybe fun for 5 year old kids.
8657	0	a	I won this in a free giveaway and I now see why it was free. Just a few minutes and the annoying voices broke my ears. The objectives are pretty much pointless and not really fun. Dont even know what to rate so ?/10.
8658	0	a	I'm single so this game suck,.. if u have friend buy this game , this is so interesting
8659	0	a	This game sucks so bad, that makes Bad Rats look like Titanfall (but no seriously, Bad Rats was really fun, that i made 3 hours from the first launch, even i unlocked an achievement).  I am sorry for the people who bought it for full price. Atleast i spend 20 cents for this.
8660	0	a	Holy mother, this game is absolutely pointless and pathetic. The conrols are irritating, the music and voices are annoying, and you can beat it in less than half an hour. I only bought it because it was sale for 29 cents, and its not even worth that. Even if you think that you can 'appreciate' an indie puzzle game like this one, you definitely should not buy this unless it's for a younger sibling or as a joke gift to a friend.
8661	0	a	i didn't think i would ever regret spending 29 cents on a game but frickin crap.

8670	0	a	Lame. You play as a sticky ball that rolls along the edge of things and tries to beat other sticky balls to the objectives. It sounds lame because it is. It has local co-op, which I didn't try, but I'm sure that would still be lame. But do check out the video for this game in its Community Hub, which is hilarious.
8671	0	a	Pretty ♥♥♥♥.

8674	0	a	what the ♥♥♥♥
8675	0	a	Why it runs on 30 fps only in full screen?
8676	0	a	Well first up, WARNING: This game doesn't work in fullscreen, it just locks your system up. Developers apparently didn't bother testing on anything but a junky old 1080p monitor.   Artwork style in the game rating out of 10: MSPaint. Seriously, the graphics are that bad.  Gameplay: Well it's like Wizball (kind of - instead of bouncing, you're sticky and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) from the 1980s but competitive and not particularly fun or interesting. There's no real story mode, you just go through levels competing against other players or the AI. You roll around the walls of the map and collect diamonds to get more points than the other guy. In the era of Grand Theft Auto 5, Ark, The Witcher 3, Skyrim, Star Citizen, and so many other incredible games, they give us MSPaint with sticky balls. Correction, they ask for us to pay them for sticky balls, it's not even free. Even if it was free, you wouldn't want it.  Technical stuff: Absolutely atrocious - doesn't work on modern systems. Video options are limited to turning off the background and running the game in full screen. Bonus: If you run windowed, and switch out, the game locks up and stays stuck in foreground. Alt+F4 is your friend, thankfully. Kudos to the developers for allowing us to exit the game.   Don't buy this. Play one of the F2P games from the Steam store instead.

8684	0	a	If your response to this game is anything other than wanting to violently bash your nose against a wall, you clearly see something in this game I don't.
8685	0	a	Honestly, the game completely lacks any and all substance. It's bland, forgettable, boring and tedious.   In the game, you play as an unnamed adventurer/trader, that sets forth to do one thing, become the Master Trader of the known universe/galaxy. One of the first missions is to find some chick that will give you a million credits on loan in order for you to buy a ship and start trading. You have a deadline when to get the million credits needed, and this formula repeats itself several times throughout the game, so much so that even the multiplayer is basically only that. Oh, and no one plays the multiplayer. In order to GET the million credits, you have to buy some commodities on Earth, and go to the Moon (which is just clicking a button) and selling your merchandise. Or you can do contracts. More on that later.   The trading system is very simple. You get to one of the merchants, you see the commodities they have for sale, and you buy it. There is a bar graph showcasing whether the market price for the item is declining or not, however the graph is pretty much nonsense, seeing as there's no trend whatsoever, and seems to be entirely, 100% random. To add to that, the trading is a pretty pathetic source of income, as even if you get lucky, you won't really earn a huge profit on anything you sell.   You can also find random commodities strewn throughout the worlds you find yourself, so there's no real reason to actually BUY commodities, as you'll find some semi-valuable stuff just laying on the floor in the map, free for the taking. Items range from wool to fetuses and radioactive metals and whatnot, and the 'illegal' stuff is more valuable than the legitimate trading commodities. The game doesn't punish you for owning or selling illegal commodities, which was a wasted opportunity for some amusing gameplay as an actual smuggler. Shame.    The second source of money is through doing contracts or helping people out with arduous tasks. To get a contract, you have to go to the bar, where the barman will give you a target which you have to kill. This is where the game gets a slight instance of gameplay, by introducing an FPS arena, however, this falls flat as well, because the gunplay is so barebones it physically hurts to play through the FPS stages. The missions where you help people out aren't much better, as the case often is that you're simply collecting or buying X commodity and bringing it to some random dude or chick. Again, incredibly tedious.  Also, the game came out 2008 if I'm not wrong. I originally thought it came out around 1999, when Freelancer came out, but holy ♥♥♥♥ 2008????????????????????????????????   The music is obnoxious and not memorable in any way (read: elevator music), it features abysmal graphics, the little mechanics the game has are horribly unrefined, the economic system is non functioning, trading is next to useless unless you get some very rare, expensive commodities from missions, and the entire game feels like a chore.  Overall, I'd give it a 3/10, would not recommend unless you have literally nothing else to do in your life.
8686	0	a	This Game isnt even worth 50 cents
8687	0	a	This is a waste of time... The only positive element is the trading (buy low and sell high in another market), but the layout and the other elements ruin this part totally. Would not recomend this to anyone.
8688	0	a	This game blows. The idea is great, but the execution is just plain awefull. I understand this is an indie title, but the graphics, gameplay, sound, just everything suck. Travelling between planets is just a click, you never even see your spaceship takeoff. The npc's look lifeless, and never change their facial expression. The enviroments are small and boring. The shooter levels are almost all the same, and play like a shovelware crap shooter. No strategy or anything. You cannot buy weapons for the fps stages, but you can by generic crates of weapons to trade. This is beyond dumb. I can't believe anybody enjoyed this game.
8689	0	a	Ever since I played the original Starflight, I've always had a soft spot for space trading type games. While Space Trader: Merchant Marine has a good trading foundation, it feels severely unpolished and overly repetitious. The game is essentially a hybrid shooter with trading elements. The gameplay is fun, but after the second chapter, you've pretty much done everything there is to do. I'd say most people will get bored with it after the first couple hours. The graphics are definitely dated, the limited voices are horribly comical, and the music does not fit the game at all. With another 6-12 months of polish, this game could have been decent. As it stands now, it is completely forgettable.
8690	0	a	If you just want something to kill time then its an ok game, very basic FPS scenarios that you can do when collecting bounties and such in missions and basic buy cheap/sell for a profit system...the only downside to this game is there is not a sandbox mode...which ends up making the game dull and redundant when you have to start from scratch every time you complete a mission.  Def not worth the full price...worth the 49 cents I paid for it while on sale.
8691	0	a	Space Trader Merchant Marine was released in Oct 23, 2008. It boasts a score of 89% from a review by GameFocus saying, ''One of the best indie games of 2008. An innovative and addictive experience. Addictive, very fun and innovative are the best words to describe the game and the bottom line is this is a welcome addition to any gamer's library so buy this game and enjoy it.'  This is very akin to the how 'reviews' reflected Bubsy 3D on its own packaging, to those that remember.  The game is broken down into four different areas, exploration, trading, time management, and fighting/bounty hunting.  The exploration is very limited, your only goal being to find crates of goods floating about, merchants, and the bar keep. The problem is that once you've gone through it once, you know where it all is, no variation, same boring bland walls, ect., and it honestly starts to feel like a chore.  The time management is very simple. Go to X location from y location = z time spent. You have a set amount of time in every 'chapter' to complete a set $$$ quota. Besides the time spent traveling through the travel menu, any time spent at a location does not diminish the time that you have left. And as thus, does not really give you any time pressure.  The trading is a joke, as, all you do it buy what's not doing well, and travel, and get guaranteed profit. It hardly reflects actual market value in the real world and makes the game largely unchallenging.  The fighting/bounty hunting is terribly bland and cycles through the same maps. Stupid AI, overpowered guns, and cheap kills, makes it horrid.  Now, all that said, this was made in 2008, 2-0-0-8, to be sure. Other games that were made in this period were:  Fable 2  Fallout 3  LittleBIGPlanet  Rock Band 2 Gears Of War 2  Spore Grand Theft Auto IV No More Heroes Left 4 Dead Professor Layton &amp; The Curious Village   Compared to that list, the time period the game was released, and actual content in the game... it makes it look mediocre, a joke, something that belongs in a 2000 release.
8692	0	a	Space Trader Merchant Marine is that strange situation where two very different genres have been combined together in the hope of hitting that once in a lifetime combination that everybody agrees is pure genius, like Vampires and Teenagers, or Ninjas and Cheerleaders. Space Trader doesn't quite hit that special recipe however.  Space Trader is a combination of a numbers trading simulator and a first person shooter and by far and large the biggest problem is that playing the game you have trouble telling which of these two aspects feel the most tacked on.  The trading part of the game is simple enough. You travel between various planets in the solar system, each planet has a a few merchants each selling a few goods. You buy as much as your bank account and cargo space will allow and then travel to the next world. Space Trader has no real in game economy however and everything is decided by the almighty Random Number Generator. The challenge of choosing which products to buy is virtually non-existent as all items for sale lists how below normal market value they are next to their name. There is also a legal/non-legal system in place however it has no real effect in game making the actual buying and selling of products extremely dull and predictable.  You explore the various locations on foot, in a first person shooter aspect. The various trade hubs allow you run around a small area, collecting various sellable items littered about the place, trade with the local merchants and take on a number of missions. The missions mostly come down to 'Bring X items', 'Transport X items' or, the more common, shooter mission. The majority of the missions in the game, and perhaps one of the easiest ways to make money early on in the campaigns is the various bounty missions which are your basic FPS. You spawn in one of a few predetermined maps, kill a few henchmen and eventually a boss will spawn. All the while you can pick up loot that you can sell out in the proper game, and weapons, health and shields that'll help you on this mission only. The shooting is fairly poorly implemented, even for it's time. The weapons feel like pellet guns, the enemy AI is non-existent and the whole experience usually boils down to just sniping at enemies from around a corner.  The music throughout the game is a high speed techno beat that, while I am sure some of you will love it, made me play with the sound off after a few sessions. There is no voice-acting and very little ambiance. Even gun shots and hit sounds leave much to be desired. Graphically the game is nothing to write home about but not much below what you would expect from an indie title either.  All in all, Space Trader Merchant Marine is a game that tries to do two things and fails at doing either in an acceptable fashion. It's not a very good trading simulation and not a very good shooter. It doesn't sound or look very good and it doesn't feel very good. This is a game that can easily be skipped.
8693	0	a	I bought this game for 50 cents when it was on sale. I should have spent that 50 cents on a bag of chips. Or a soda. Or maybe a bottle of that pure water stuff. It's playable until you realize your entire goal is to buy ♥♥♥♥ and then sell it for more money.  ...anyone wanna buy this? c=
8694	0	a	At first this game seems like fun, especially for its low price. While I admit that I enjoy playing it, there is a ridiculously unfair difficulty spike during the FPS missions. Basically, anytime you have to go kill someone, you get tossed into this terrible FPS minigame where the guns are crap, your controls are crap, and the AI is beyond unfair.  Worst of all, if you fail an important FPS mission, you have to travel to another planet, then return to the previous planet to attempt the mission again, thus wasting a lot of time (the game uses time units to create an artificial challenge). I don't have a problem with that, except in the third chapter you are forced to make $20,000,000 for this woman who put a bomb on your ship. After you make the $20,000,000 you get an option to kill her instead. If you fail at killing her you have to travel away to reset the mission. But what happened to me is when I traveled away I ended up running out of time and failed the entire chapter.  The reason I kept failing to kill her is because she is unfairly strong (combined with the crappy FPS gameplay and unfair AI). But what I don't understand is that the game plays off your failure as though you actually failed, and not as though it's just resetting you back before you attempted the mission. So why doesn't she just blow up your ship? If your failure happens in real time then she should be aware that you're trying to kill her and it would make sense for her to just blow up your ship and kill you - except she doesn't. But the time factor still remains and you can still lose by running out of time (remember the time limit was for you to make $20,000,000 for the woman you're now trying to kill).  I don't know, maybe it's because I'm fresh off a rage quit, but the unfair FPS gameplay and unfair use of the time restrictions really ♥♥♥♥ me off. I was honestly enjoying the game up until it pulled this crap..
8695	0	a	Not even worth the 50 cents I paid for it.
8696	0	a	Might be worth 50 cents, but I certainly didn't think it was worth the $5.00 I paid for it last year. It had a lot of good ideas, but just seemed very limited for this type of game.
8697	0	a	There are shooters, there are mercantile games, and then there's this, which tries to be both but is ultimately neither. If you were about to die of boredom, I'm not sure if this game would save your life.
8698	0	a	I only played 6 minutes of this crap and already I knew I'd hate it. I'm by no means a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥ but this hurt my eyes just looking at it. I want my 50 cents back.
8699	0	a	The trading and shooting is great. The problem is the terrible missions. 99% of the time is spent running around without knowing what to do and then failing the level even though you've talked to everybody and aced all their requests.
8700	0	a	It's clunky, unforgiving, and takes away all your money once you make 'the deal.' It makes no allowances for overshooting a financial goal. Removes any desire to play more unless you simply like looking for the best way to make deals.
8701	0	a	A game that mixes trading and FPS shooting. This may sound really good game but nom beliie me, it isn't.  First of all, everything is so bad about this game. The graphics, voice acting, musics and of course the gameplay itself. The gameplay is pretty much scavenging for stuff (and by stuff I mean anything you can sell, like wigs or drugs. Great game to teach yo kids to deal drugs.) and selling them to guys who pay the most and buying stuff from them and then trading them to someone who pays more and... Well, you get the idea. Oh, and every now and then you get to shoot somebody.  Speaking of that, the FPS parts are terrbile. This game would have been much better without the shooting parts even though the trading is borinf and repetitive.  Not worth the 50 cents I used to buy this game. One of the few games I entirely regret buying.
8702	0	a	It's a trading game where you're inexplicably asked to kill a guy to get your ship, then tells you afterwards you can take bounty missions. Bounty missions have infinitely respawning enemies that do lots of damage to you. Trading appears to simply be buying something with a red arrow on one planet, then selling it someplace with a green arrow on the other planet. There does not appear to be any space travel, just a quick cutscene warp.  If this game becomes amazing a couple hours in, I'll never know about it because there was nothing there to hold my interest that long.
8703	0	a	Okay.  Yes, it's an 'old' game from five years ago, so you can argue that the graphics shouldn't be expected to be cutting edge...but the modelling and textures and the like look considerably WORSE than Unreal - a game that came out _ten_years_before_ Space Trader: Merchant Marine.  I admit that I'm a fan of Elite-style games: a hybrid of space flight/combat and trading simulation - WC:Privateer, X: Beyond the Frontier, Freelancer, Frontier: Elite II, etc.  ...this is NOT that type of hybrid, despite the implication of the title.   This game tries to weld FPS and trading together, and does NOT do a very good job with EITHER.  1) The trading is simplistic, static and easily exploited. For each 'sector', there are a small handful of commodities, only a similar number of bases/trading hubs to buy and sell the same at, so you could probably chart out all the prices on a Post-It™ note...or even commit the best 'trading routes' to even a dodgy, old and forgetful memory.  And you won't have to worry about breaking the economy with your efforts - apparently each base has such large demands and supplies of EVERY commodity that even a huge shipment moved by yourself has NO effect on prices on either end of your run. Your only restriction to making money is finding the best profit margin, and the size of your cargo hold (&amp; working capital).  ...but hey; you don't even really need to worry about trading to get up these thinly-justified goals for earning - a) you can usually find piles of items just sitting in nooks and corners on the trading hub maps, which you can then sell to collectors for a decent starting stake, b) you can also pick up a considerable amount of cash from doing the bounty (aka FPS) missions - not always from the up-front wages of that, but from looting commodities from the 'hideout' of whatever low-life you're supposed to assassinate.  2) As others have said, the FPS is similarly unchallenging - the maps are limited in quantity and variety, the 'power ups' are uninspired (and ephemeral), and the opposing AI is laughable, resulting in no point in any gameplay strategy apart from sneaking quickly to a good vantage point and then sniping everyone just aimlessly standing around.  As such, you have two poor component-games, that barely feel like they should even belong together; the overall story is threadbare and challenges even the most credulous willing suspension of disbelief.  Normally, I have very low standards to play a game (gfx, music, v/o, story, etc.) but this game managed to sink below even those unchallenging requirements.  Do not even bother with this on a steam sale - the ONLY reasonable justification I could say for buying this game would be to bump up your XP from sheer quantity of game-ownership, and even then, a heavy discount would be necessary.  ...but even so, I would under NO account EVER suggest you PLAY this 'game'...
8704	0	a	You may recieve a coupon for 66%, or even 90% off this game. DON'T DO IT. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, DON'T.  The best thing about this game is the word 'Bananabis', a hybrid of Weed and Bananas.   the rest is... Think one of those offbrand ps1 generation titles you never hear about, then make it ten times worse with no cohesion at all. Don't waste your money, even if it's 50 cents.
8705	0	a	Do not get this game. Everything about it is terrible, from plot, to graphics, to gameplay. While the premise sounds interesting, it is so completely linear and shallow it provides zero entertainment.
8706	0	a	Interesting concept for a game, but was unplayable on a mid-to-high level machine which has specs way above the recommended. Graphics were choppy even for an older title. Not worth the price, even on sale.
8707	0	a	Don't buy it. It's not what u think, just go and buy the x series.
8708	0	a	Cheaply made game. The mechanics are outdated and both the fps part and the trading part are lacking.  
8709	0	a	Too many bugs, slow frame rate, stupid gameplay...
8710	0	a	I bought this game for 25 cents in a discount bin. The key worked in Steam and I can share with people this...Game, thing. You should buy this game if you like;  FPS Creator Freelancer (Not the space ship flying part) 10th Grader Writings.
8711	0	a	Who wouldn't want to fly between 6 planets that look nearly identical, while trading exciting wares like 'General Merchandise'? Adding multiplayer was a true crime because it forces two people to simultaneously undergo the torture that is playing this game.
8712	0	a	This is not a good game. I got it for about 50 cents a while back, and I don't think I got my money's worth.  The graphics are just awful, reminiscent of the Nintendo 64. The first person combat is terrible, forcing you into boring combat with AI that is either braindead or headshots you before you can see them.  The trading is.. well, trading. If you like space trading, you sure as hell shouldn't pick this up. Go for the X series instead.  It is one of those few games I wish I could erase from my Steam library, because just uninstalling it isn't satisfying enough.
8713	0	a	For the love of whatever diety you pray to, don't get this game.  This game seems like a garbage student project that they threw up here (literally and figuratively).   The trading aspect is boring, the ship mechanics are nonexistent, 'Upgrades' are bought and sold like normal trade goods, trade goods are completely arbitrary, and the first person moving and gameplay is rubbish that you'd have found 10-15 years ago, In a $5 bin at a Walmart. And the trading sections are 'timed' arbitrarily, or at least timed in the freaking TUTORIAL.  The first person SHOOTER segments are complete garbage, moving is sloppy, animations through the whole thing are rubbish and the items are scattered around like some kind of crappy 007 Goldeneye ripoff.  I wouldn't even let my friends/family play this game. I hope you don't either. Unless you can somehow get this for under a dollar, I wouldn't even contemplate getting this. And if you do, do it for the sheer laugh you... might... have. Or if you are Masochistic...
8714	0	a	| 4.5 out of 10 |   For the whole game , you'll spend your time move around 9 different maps ( very small ) , hunt down criminals whose look alike (even some of them have the same last name) to become a master trader.  I do not recommend STrader:2M if you are not into bussiness nor strategy.
8715	0	a	Shifty shooter levels and shallow trading. The combination fails to inspire, I'm afraid.
8716	0	a	Good idea, bad implementation
8717	0	a	i bought on sale for 50 cents i know its not the 50 cents but its not worth it DO NOT buy it
8718	0	a	I tried really hard to come up with a redeeming quality for Space Trader: Merchant Marine, but I just can't. There aren't any. It doesn't do anything right: the combat mini-game is terrible, the trading itself is terrible, it cuts you off from content with a dull storyline, the graphics and sound would be more at home in a game from 2001. It's just bad.  Every time I see this game in my Steam Library I die a little bit faster.
8719	0	a	Space Trader: Merchant Marine is a bipolar game. On the one hand, it tries to capture gamer interest as a commodities trading game, where you would buy and sell different commodities seeking to make a profit. Yet, the game developers seem to realize the major flaw with this game--it gets boring quickly. So they made a hackneyed attempt to spruce it up by adding a bulky, vastly inferior First Person Shooter component with graphics that are reminiscent of Doom. I think the developers should have focused solely on the trading aspect, because consumers do realize the commodity trading simulation is the major draw of this game, and certainly not the FPS aspect.   How would I improve the commodity trading aspect? I would offer unlockable merchants when certain conditions are met (i.e. a million dollars worth of legit inventory, or x number of cargo holds added to your ship), or create another category of goods. What about the trader's personal reputation? What if the trader's reputation changes over time, as he deals in certain types of goods, and that influences pricing of wares from the NPC merchants? These are some simple ways to spice up the trading simulation, and I'm sure the game developers could implement these additions quite easily.  As it stands now, the game will capture your interest only until you get bored and tired of the commodity trading aspect. How long will depend on personal tastes.
8720	0	a	If you're looking for a good FPS, this is NOT the game to run to. The controls are clunky, the weapons barely do anything at all to your enemies, the enemies to way too much damage to you, and unless you grind up to 1000 shields, you won't last ten seconds in the combat segments. The HUD isn't well thought-out either, using numbers instead of bars or icons for your health and shields, forcing you to take a crucial moment to read out your health and shields while the grunts pound them away. The graphics aren't appealing, either. The characters look only semi-realistic, fitting into the 'Uncanny Valley' making them look actually really creepy, and the world models are too blocky and low-res to be serious-looking. The story just feels like an excuse plot, too. This game is definitely NOT worth the $4.99 normal price. If anything, 50 cents feels just about right for the little time and effort that was put into this game. Seriously, there must have been NO playtesting at all on this. The only thing I do like is the trading, and even then it's not enough to save this game. 2/10.
8721	0	a	Stay away... No free mode, just campaign. All you do is grab free stuff lying around the planet for free money, load your ship with the most steeply discounted commodity (infinite stock, static prices), and make millions flying it to the closest planet. Missions are lame. All you do is talk to people and walk around to find an item/person. There's also combat, which is a bad quake clone with abysmal AI. They devastate at close distances, but at long range they're pathetic. Radar means they can't sneak up on you. They won't even attack you 90% of the time you're on a different floor, so snipe away with the assault rifle and you automatically win. You have limited time to reach the campaign's money goal (money disappears after chapter), and time passes depending on the distance you travel. If it wasn't for the missions sending you to certain planets, you could just travel between two close planets. No economy to speak of, reused maps, and no space flight/combat. Lame.
8722	0	a	Terrible. Just... ugh,  This game looks, and at times plays, like Sonic Adventure, a game originally released for the Dreamcast in 1998. This game was released in 2008. Take Sonic Adventure, remove all charm, combine it with the crappest of Doom clones, and then set it on fire, and you'll still have a better game than this.  Full price is £3.49, I think I bought it for maybe half of that, and I still paid too much. Steam should expect my bill in the post. Ugh.
8723	0	a	Somehow I really doubt Space Trader can actually be interesting to anyone. Unfortunately, the multiplayer won't even work at all, and trading stuff alone with no reason doesn't seem to be exciting enough. Selling bananabis to random freaks could probably be tempting, but I'd rather save the money. Honestly, there's no visible way to get any pleasure out of this game, it's extremely bad.
8724	0	a	It has it's ups and downs. While I wasn't completely disappointed with the game if I had it to do over I would have skipped it.
8725	0	a	Hands down the WORST GAME I HAVE EVER BOUGHT ON STEAM.  DO NOT GET THIS!   Please! Just stay away!
8726	0	a	clunky with a bad UI definately an older game
8727	0	a	At first i thought it wa going to be a Mature or Teen shooter but its all making people fell good blahhBlahhBlahh help theam with there problems blablahblah!
8728	0	a	If this was remade on a newer engine, the concept of the game is kind of genious, and i would be very VERY interested in giving it a shot.  But this game has simply aged like the olsen twins (commence your google image searching for 2 very tired looking twins in their 20's). The FPS segments are hilarious. The other reviews rave about them for some reason, but they remind me of halo 2 maybe?  Unfortunately, this game just visually is a dinosaur. At the time of this writing it's about to hit 7 years old, and it feels 10.
8729	0	a	This game seems like a cheap arcade game somehow made it to PC. The gun handling is the derpiest thing I have ever seen. There is a lack of options and a repetitive storyline. Kill people, trade, kill people, trade, kill people, trade.  The NPCs are unresponsive and say the same exact things to you every time. The game gives you the illusion of being able to talk to certain characters but really you just choose when to say the predefined phrases. The combat is horrible, and doesn't make any sense.  Overall rating:  Graphics: 2/10 Gameplay: 1/10 Story: 3/10  My final rating for this game is 1/10. Do not buy this if you expected a qualtity shooter.
8730	0	a	This game is old and it shows. Very opened game with ground combat, no space combat. I could not get into it because the graphics, physics, and combat were too dated for my liking. The game takes the normal buy here and sell there will a sprinkling of shooting people in the face.   You might enjoy this game if: Like old, and I do mean old, shooters paired with trading. 
8731	0	a	I enjoyed it, but its only worth the 50 cents I paid for on sale
8732	0	a	Online game dont really work...And the singlerplayer gives no mean. Its boring. Bad graphics. Nothing good...
8733	0	a	Why is this. This. This thing here?
8734	0	a	I really don't understand how this game made it onto steam. -10/10 never again.
8735	0	a	Waste of time and disk space
8736	0	a	Simplistic and not really very fun. There are much better trading games out there.
8737	0	a	THIS GAME DOES NOT WORK! Pressing start game takes you to some 'Space Trader Console' which does not allow you to see your mouse (the mouse moves behind the window) meaning that you cannot see what buttons you are pressing. You also only have the ability to copy, delete or quit the console, quitting quits, copying does nothing, and neither does delete. You also can't even type into the console, so it's not even a very good typing simulator.   If you like to pretend to be a professional haxor by looking at a console, then this is the game for you.  I was bought this by my ex-friend who wanted to troll me. I have consequently lost 12 minutes of my life, and a friend who I once liked.  10/10
8738	0	a	A poor resource trading game with awful FPS missions.   Pros:  + You pick and choose which way to do some missions  + some of the characters are quite interesting.   Negatives: - everything else - the FPS sections are absolutely awful, non-skippable and punishingly hard. - 90% of sidequests are fetch quests,   I continued playing after the first level as it felt as if it was building into something quite enjoyable, but it didn't...
8739	0	a	I couldn't resist picking this game up for 49 cents just to see how bad it was. I wasn't disappointed! Have you ever heard of that movie  The Room ? It's supposed to be the  Citizen Cane  of bad films. Well if that's true,  Space Trader  is the  Mass Effect 2  of terrible space games.  It's hard to even describe exactly what makes this game so bad. Some games are so buggy or broken or just unplayable that they accumulate terrible reviews. Not  Space Trader , it works totally fine! I couldn't find a single bug. Its problem is just a complete lack of ambition at every level. Everything about it is just earnest, straightforward and completely incompetent. It's almost like it wasn't made by a person at all but by an outside observer of the human condition - someone who just fundamentally misunderstands why humans enjoy things. Like, I don't know, a Martian or a hyper-intelligent dog or a robot from an 80's movie.  The main mechanic of the game is an arbitrage simulator, kind of like Drug Wars - you know, that game for the TI82 graphing calculator that you could play in math class without getting in trouble? The main difference is that in  Space Trader , it's pretty much on autopilot since the game marks the good deals for you. Also it's not about drugs, it's about such exciting futuristic commodities as 'Manufactured Goods' and 'Copper Ore.'  The combat mechanic is even worse. It's floaty and unreal, like trying to go back and play an old sprite based shooter from 1993. True this isn't a brand new game, but it  is  from 2008. That's the year  Bioshock  came out. Think about that for a second.  Space Trader's  gameplay was out of date by over a decade even back then.  I think my favorite ridiculous detail about the game is in the dialogue. They got the perspective wrong, so when you're talking to the lumpy NPCs, you seem to be at about their nipple level. Sometimes... lower.   If you have two quarters burning a hole in your pocket and you want to see just how bad this game is, give it a shot. On the other hand, you could just use the quarters to do your laundry instead.  The Room  is available on Netflix if you need something awful to watch while you fold.
8740	0	a	A terrible terrible game - poor FPS missions, poor trading, poor storyline, poor environments, just terrible. Avoid at any price!
8741	0	a	No. Just No. This game is bad, ugly, and borning. Avoid.
8742	0	a	this game is a ♥♥♥♥ing time killer, i swear if you ever want to play a cheap game, seriously just buy this during a sale, i can tell you this game is not worth the full price of 5 dollars. trust me this game is only worth 50 cents. the only thing this game is good for is teaching you about the stock market in different places and learn how trading works. the graphics are ♥♥♥♥♥♥, the music sucks balls, and the gameplay is just run around, buy stuff, sell stuff, shoot stuff when your out of money, repeat. seriously. thats all you do. if anything this game is just to kill time or to send to your friends as a joke.   Total Score: 4/10
8743	0	a	Space Trader: Merchant Marine, I do not understand how you got 89% from Game Focus...  The title sounds like one of those old school space trading games. Let me tell you that this game does not involve space in the slightest. The screenshots give you an extremely misleading view on the game, I read all the negative reviews, but i thought it just looked like plain classic awesomeness.   I was really dissapointed.  The only goal in this game is to sell random things. The stock market doesn't even make sense in this game either, the graphs show the possible profit, but they aren't even real, they're just there to make it look a bit cooler. I got this game for 40p, I think, and I feel as if I wasted way to much money on this. It does involve some shooter parts, but these are as bland as the trading itself. The guns you are provided with have no ability to upgrade, and you have no choice as to what gun you get. It's like a really, really, really bad Quake 3 Arena.   Just don't get it. Do yourself a favour and go buy a bar of chocolate or something.
8744	0	a	Not a bad attempt to recapture the awesomeness that was Privateer, but the game lacks character development, engaging story, and the ability to just do what you want, when you want like Privateer did. I got this one on a huge sale (like, a few dollars) and I wouldn't have wanted to pay more.  biggest design flaw is how the game is broken down into 'you need X amount of credits to pay your debt in 3 weeks' and while you can do whatever you want in those 3 weeks, if you dont have enough credits, you have to REPLAY THE CHAPTER.  Id have to vote no on this one not because its a horrible game, but because it didn't give me enough reason to recommend it.
8745	0	a	i played this for ten minutes... its bad
8746	0	a	Well game would crash every time I tried getting past the starting menu with a 'can't use values or keys with 'a' '........and I didn't do anything. Someone else had this problem and they couldn't find a fix. Apparently judging from the rest of the reviews I didn't miss much, as this 2008 budget trading shooter has poor trading and worse shooting, leading to an overall boring and repetitive game. So I guess it was a blessing in disguise. 0/10.
8747	0	a	It's just......bad.
8748	0	a	I'd rather drag my ♥♥♥♥♥ through a mile of broken glass then play this game for anylonger than i already have.
8749	0	a	This game lacks serious depth, it's the ♥♥♥♥♥iest mix of a trading game (which you can only travel to trade between 2-3 places) with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ actions missions which you just run around in circles shooting.
8750	0	a	when you find a game where the main steam picture is a 89/100 rateing from game focus (idk who they are) there is little hope and you get what u pay for
8751	0	a	this game is really bad the set up lvl is stupid. Even after 10 mins i thiught that this game sucked. So, really, if you want to waste money than this is the game for you.
8752	0	a	I made my goal, but failed it, then it asked to restart, I tried to reload, can't reload, game saves point by point. lost hours of progress, super fagety.
8753	0	a	♥♥♥♥♥
8754	0	a	Its Just Not That Fun At All
8755	0	a	At First it seems like a nice game to play, but, If you are looking for a 'Space sim', this is not your type of game.  Some FPS missions are broken by infinite respawns which makes it insanely hard to capture their Boss.   The Challenge Mode is insanely difficult to unlock the other missions.  Co-op mode is only for Challenge mode. So don't bother buying this game for Co-op.  This game is pretty hard for kids, so it is not recommended for Kids even though it is rate E.

8757	0	a	Holy ♥♥♥♥ this is bad.
8758	0	a	Horrible graphics, lame gunplay, and the most predictable economy in history, the only things that make this game a challenge is the boss difficulty spike and the ridiculous time mechanic.
8759	0	a	Better things to spend your money on.
8760	0	a	I personal do not like this game at all. The shooting part is ok but the rest just seems boring.
8761	0	a	This game needs a lot of work on graphics and content. However, if the time was put into it then I can see it been an enjoyable game to play. Keep working on it guys.
8762	0	a	If this was a game on a BBS during dial up days... I would have liked it. I got it for less than a dollar. I should have tossed that dollar towards a homeless man.
8763	0	a	It's like Freelancer, just someone removed all the fun..and good voice acting..and actual space flight...  This is just a FPS Game, disguising itself as some trading game.  Only get this game if it's free. Even 25 cents is too much for this junk. Thankfully I got this game for free. If I had spent anything on it, I'd actually feel bad.
8764	0	a	This game had such an interesting premise, and such interesting potential. I wish I could reccomend it, but alas, it's faults outshine what it gets right.   Despite the name of the game being 'Space Trader', the most valuable and worthwhile jobs are actually bounty hunting jobs. And to say that the combat is lacking is an understatement.   The campaign mode resets your progress at the end of each chapter, eliminating any cargo or money beyond the final objective that you managed to save, as well as eliminaing all incomplete quests. The idea of growth and becoming a better and more important trader should have carried, but because of the artificial reset, fell very flat. I stopped playing the campaign after seeing my progression removed for no reason.  And the free for all mode is lacking: from what I can tell, there is a mode that is basically unlimited time and complete freedom, but in order to get it, you have to beat the first challenge which is impossibly difficult.   If even one of these issues were different, I would consider playing again, as the premise is solid and fun, but the execution here is not worth the time.
8765	0	a	| 11240 | Space Trader is a interesting idea of a indie game, travel around the galaxy and make profit, too bad the execution is not as well done, still a fun game for a few hours. In this game you are a nameless trader who just got the license to trade, but all you need is a ship, and so across 5 chapters you get to become the master traders dealing with corrupt officers, betrayals, and trade wars. The graphics are somewhat ok for a indiegame and the music is not bad but there's only 2-3 songs at all. The trade mechanics is very simple you buy stuff and go sell it at another planet for profit studying random events like drug busts making drug kind of items sell for higher and etc, but if this was a real trade game you would be able to negotiate for a better profit, you can't in this game. You can also partake in bounties, or fight the guards scanning your ship for illegal stuff in a simple fps kind of like unreal tournament, but not even close to good, still it does it's job. For 5 dollars this game is maybe worth it if you ran out of stuff to play, but you're probably better off buying it during a sale or bundle for less than a dollar.
8766	0	a	This... might have had potential if it had had much more thought and effort put into it. As it stands, it is a 'trading' game with FPS levels 'added in' in order to make it so you can get money... or something. The trading system is okay I guess, It could have used a good deal of refining.  But the combat? (which the engine is obviously built around) It is unforgiving to say the least. plus you get three tries at a target and if you fail, thats it.
8767	0	a	horrible, hard to follow and multiplayer doesnt work
8768	0	a	One of the most boring games I've ever played in my life.
8769	0	a	My experience in this game so far is best characterized by an interesting, persistant bug, that probably has something to do with my oddly-sized screen resolution. There is a custom mouse cursor, and the part of it that I click with is about a finger's width above the top of the displayed cursor.  IE, I must hover my mouse about a quarter inch below a dialogue option until it highlights, to be able to click on it.  This is the level of care and precision that I'm finding in this game. Decent concept, feels vaguely Mass Effect-y, with more trading and less talking. Not very complicated. Could have been polished a bit more. You could probably waste an afternoon with it, if you wanted to.
8770	0	a	Clunky graphics, controls, plot, and mechanics. I don't think there is one redeeming factor about this game except the limited number of offerings in the 'space trading' genre
8771	0	a	It starts fun but gets boring fast. This game is poor..
8772	0	a	Yeahh. Showed promise in concept, but more chaotic FPS than anything. Poorly polished. Just didn't keep up to snuff.
8773	0	a	Tried to set the resolution to 1280 x 720 then AVG detected an unknown intrusion attempt relating to 'Identity'. It then quarantined the excecutable. Not gonna risk it, submitting a refund request to Steam.   http://oi61.tinypic.com/pb1fm.jpg 
8774	0	a	This game is not very good. Granted some of the ideas the devs tried implmenting where new and interesting at the time but the implmentation was poor. This game's economy is very basic. There is no joy or challenge in trading in this game, once you figure out how to make money you can pretty much keep doing the same thing forever. The FPS portions are lack luster, they look and feel like they where ripped straight for the 90's back when we where figuing out what worked with FPS games and what didn't.
8775	0	a	The game doesn't know what it wants to be. It's supposed to be a trading sim, but there are a lot of segments that you have to assassinate a target. The first person shooter sections can be fairly frustrating and the rewards and pacing of the game in general are pretty terrible.   Feels like a prototype project the devs wanted make to test a lot of different elements, rather than making a fun game.
8776	0	a	Part trading game, part FPS, it fails at both. The trading element lacks any subtlety or deeper strategy than 'buy low, sell high.' The FPS portion is incredibly repetitive with laughable graphics and mechanics. It's hard to believe this game came out in 2008. In 2008, you could buy Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and it looks light years better than this. This game barely compares to games that came out a decade earlier (think Half-Life). Save your money - if you want to do space trading, go dust off your copy of Freelancer or X Rebirth; if you want a shooter, go download pretty much any other game that involves a firearm.
8777	0	a	The game is locked to a selection of low resolutions, the textures, animations and audio are all downright poor. The gameplay is fairly uninteresting. There's little to recommend it, except that it does occasionally have some pretty scenery.  You can check out my first impressions here:        The Backlog Reviews - Space Trader: Merchant Marine&nbsp;
8778	0	a	I hoped this was good but it isn't The FPS part is complete ♥♥♥♥, and so simple you could even win without trying The merchant part is retardly simple and not fun
8779	0	a	The game isn't that worth it even for 50 cents.  I'd save your 50 cents and get something off the community market.

8789	0	a	Too much pointless running crap around.
8790	0	a	Sort of fun for a bit. The story is uhh, there I guess. Basically I am not sure what is going on but there are people to sell things to.  Shooter element is really, really bad.  Probably worth while for a dollar...
8791	0	a	One of the worst games of all time. Graphics are appalling lack of logic and mathematics that gives a whole new dimension of stupidity.  The game works on chance. Of the challenges you will have nightmares. It is here that chance determines whether to complete the challenge or not.  I do not recommend the game even if it was free.
8792	0	a	No. no. no. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Ok, let's start with the beginning. I was just about ready to let off the fact that this piece of ♥♥♥♥ game should've been an iOS game all along, yeah, it's THAT complex, but ok, I let that slide, I said, why not give it a chance. And from then on, it NEVER STOPPED DISAPPOINTING! I would need a whole ♥♥♥♥ing book to detail precisely what's wrong with this game, but I'll try to keep it short. You never know what the ♥♥♥♥ are you doing. The game is never clear when it gives you a mission, the 'quest log' which is a two line snippet of every mission on the ESCAPE SCREEN is ♥♥♥♥ing laughable at. NO INFORMATION WHAT SO EVER! You don't know where to go to find the person, it just say 'HE'S ON THE MOON', well gee, ♥♥♥♥ING THANKS THEN! The 'planets' themselves are a ♥♥♥♥ing joke, it's only one level the size of your average living room... And even then you can't find who you're supposed to talk to to finish your damn quest. Logical conclusion, MANY QUESTS ARE BROKEN! The 'trading' part of the game, which is it's main gimmick is simple as hell, but guess what, no information there as well, I couldn't figure out what the ♥♥♥♥ the information it gives me on the screen is, and I'm not that dumb in real life, I got a good results diploma every year in high-school, but still, this game is a complete mistery to me. Interwoven along the 'trading' part is some random shooting sections thrown out of nowhere, as a result of some 'missions' you pick up randomly from strangers... you get insta-teleported to the 'mission area' and ista-teleported back when you kill a guy. That's about as deep as the missions go. ALL OF THEM, hit missions, 'kill this guy'. Gun play is TERRIBLE, enemies bullet spongy as ♥♥♥♥, is basically DOOM with better graphics, let's put it that way. You CAN NOT save them game when you want, it has it's own stupid auto-save at the worst times mechanic, and then when you fail the main chapter mission, IT RESTARTS THE WHOLE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ CHAPTER, god forbit it takes you to the previous auto-save. That was the drop that filled the glass. I lost HOURS of progress because of it's stupid MORONIC saving system. This game is a royal mess. It doesn't know what it wants to be, it tries to be everything, from trading game to RPG to FPS, and it fails miserably at ALL OF THEM! Coupled with a badly constructed game, it makes the whole package a MASSIVE FAIL. DO NOT BUY, under any circumstances, these filths don't deserve a single cent! It's like they tried to make EVERY single bad decision a game developer can while making a game, then after they finished, they released this ♥♥♥♥♥torm! DON'T BUY EVEN AT GUNPOINT!

8803	0	a	a terrible and poor piece of workmanship.  even the nintendo 64 had better graphics and animations than this. the gameplay itself is so dull and boring that i lost my interest after a short time.  its not worth 10€, 5€ or even 1€ its just a game to avoid at all costs.
8804	0	a	This Game Is Terrrible Dont even brother to read the reviews. I got Bored in the tutorial expect for the fat guy in the wheelchair.Emotionless. I didnt even get a trading card. I got this game for free. I want money for the space taken up on my harddrive. This is a terrible game. Has no plot. Npcs are emotionless. Why are you still reading this review. I wouldnt recemmend this game if it was F2P. I felt like killing myself.   This Game Is horrible.  Go buy a real game.  I would pay money to have taken out of my Libary so I didnt have to be reminded of this terrible game.  Do you recommend? I wish there was a Hell No option
8805	0	a	This tries to be both a first person shooter and an economy trading game...it does both badly. Its poorly executed in every way possible. The controls are bad, the economy is a random crap shoot, the fps levels are generic and monotonous. The story is so bad it seems like it was written on the back of a 6th graders trapper keeper. And whoever voiced the characters should be court ordered to communicate vie hand gestures only. To top it all off the character models are hideous. This game is not worth .50c play some free flash games if you need to kill time that badly.    1/10 I suppose I would play it if my choice was play this game or be locked in an airplane toilet for 6 hours but that's only if I didn’t have a year old newspaper.
8806	0	a	Oof, has not aged well. Fun, but buggy and doesn't perform well enough to be enjoyed past it's glaring flaws. I wish it was better, as it's premise is airtight and fun-sounding.

8811	0	a	This game is so poorly-done, it would probably not even be worth your time as freeware. The concept is great; but the execution leaves you with a 3d scavenger hunt that is always the same game twice, and offers no real variety or immersion.
8812	0	a	The game sounds and looks awesome but when I try to play it constantly mini-freezes like a laggy streaming movie. This may be because of my stock video card I'm not sure. Whenever I hover over a button it causes it to freeze for a moment :( I can play other games fine like Skyrim I just turn down the graphics and they run smooth. Maybe it the audio I couldn't figure it out. I tried to quit at 3 minutes but then I couldn't write a review so I went back longer just to spare the next poor sap who buys this game. On sale or not what good is it if you can barely even play it...
8813	0	a	So this game literally won't let you reload anything. If a mission goes wrong(the place where i stopped and uninstalled was where i had to transport to a guy to get a code, and assumed my character would automatically tell the other npc, whereupon i realized i had to actually remember it, it wouldn't let me transport back and it ruined the whole mission and I couldn't get to do it again. This is either sloppy design or trying to prove some stupid point, but just not worth playing. It's cheap for a reason.
8814	0	a	This game was terrible and not worth the time. I picked it up as a part of the Meridian4 pack when it was on significant discount.  The story basically isn't there. There are objectives given at the start with poor resolutions at the end of a chapter but no real development. There's intrigue with a corrupt trade police but it doesn't actually go anywhere. While the main character does change over time, he doesn't feel like he's in any better a position at the end than when he starts despite significantly different circumstances.   The time constrains make pure trading unfeasible, so you're going to be doing a lot of FPS arenas to make your goals with the bountys.   The only good thing I've seen about this game is in the later stages with Jupiters moons having variable travel time depending on their orbits. That was a nice touch.
8815	0	a	I gave this game a chance. I really did. It came as part of a bundle of action indie games. While it was not one of the games I was really focused on in the pack, I though 'what the hell' and installed it. I was looking forward to a simplistic versioin of Privateer. What I got was a buggy, low quality game that I can honestly say does not stand up to most free flash games.  There are only two real activites. Trading, which is very simplistic and requires very little strategy beyond taking advantage of the news events they throw at you, and paper thin combat / bounty missions.  Inbetween those, you are lost most of the time. The final chapter is especially riddled with problems since you have very little clue as to what to do and a very tight timeframe in which to do it.  I have played through the whole of the game, but I cannot recommend it. Even it you only pay fifty cents for it. I can see that the developers had some great ideas, but their lack of quality execution just killed the project. 
8816	0	a	The problem is the terrible of the time is spent running around without knowing what to do...
8817	0	a	If trading items back and forth for a small profit is your jam, you may want to try this empty husk of a game for less than a few bucks, but otherwise there is simply not enough here to be an enjoyable experience for anyone.

The only good thing I've seen about this game is in the later stages with Jupiters moons having variable travel time depending on their orbits. That was a nice touch.
8825	0	a	Absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Seriously. Dont buy it.  Fails as any sort of trading simulation, has combat that has less depth than the first DOOM game. The majority of the game is spent staring at lists of buy/sell prices, or the litirally 5 minutes worth of 'content' that you can see by walking your avatar round the worlds least-interesting and empty spacestation.   Avoid. At all costs.
8826	0	a	Oof, has not aged well. Fun, but buggy and doesn't perform well enough to be enjoyed past it's glaring flaws. I wish it was better, as it's premise is airtight and fun-sounding.
8827	0	a	despite the name, this is actually a very ♥♥♥♥♥♥ arena shooter.
8828	0	a	When i heard my friend bough a game for 50 cents, I though 'wow! 50 cents for a game, thats like the worth of 2 steam cards!' But after purchaseing and downloading this game, I wish I bought 2 tradeing cards then this game.The point of the game is to buy/sell stuff to get profit and travel around to other planets and fight people. That sounds cool and could turn into a epic game.but First thing that confused me was the graphics. This game was released in 2008, compared to Oblivion (and that game was released a few years before) the graphics on the backgrounds are okay, however the character modules are HORRIFIC. They dont have any face movements, except the neck joint. And ok... Let me go into a rage for a second. THE VOICE ACTING IS ONE OF THE WORST THINGS EVER!!! Ok... I need to calm down. The voice acting sounds like it was poupoursly bad and its not even synced to the text.Trade is nothing to say about its okay Next, sound. The music during tradeing is a generic loop of boreingness wich makes me tired. The fighting music sound like a motarcycle going off but muffled. The combat is gimicey by that i mean that they just shoehorned it in as a extra. Im all out of things to say except DONT BUY THIS GAME. I would rate this game 2/10 but with a plus 2 if you get it as cheap as me.
8829	0	a	I gave this game a chance. I really did. It came as part of a bundle of action indie games. While it was not one of the games I was really focused on in the pack, I though 'what the hell' and installed it. I was looking forward to a simplistic versioin of Privateer. What I got was a buggy, low quality game that I can honestly say does not stand up to most free flash games.  There are only two real activites. Trading, which is very simplistic and requires very little strategy beyond taking advantage of the news events they throw at you, and paper thin combat / bounty missions.  Inbetween those, you are lost most of the time. The final chapter is especially riddled with problems since you have very little clue as to what to do and a very tight timeframe in which to do it.  I have played through the whole of the game, but I cannot recommend it. Even it you only pay fifty cents for it. I can see that the developers had some great ideas, but their lack of quality execution just killed the project. 
8830	0	a	This game was terrible and not worth the time. I picked it up as a part of the Meridian4 pack when it was on significant discount.  The story basically isn't there. There are objectives given at the start with poor resolutions at the end of a chapter but no real development. There's intrigue with a corrupt trade police but it doesn't actually go anywhere. While the main character does change over time, he doesn't feel like he's in any better a position at the end than when he starts despite significantly different circumstances.   The time constrains make pure trading unfeasible, so you're going to be doing a lot of FPS arenas to make your goals with the bountys.   The only good thing I've seen about this game is in the later stages with Jupiters moons having variable travel time depending on their orbits. That was a nice touch.

8835	0	a	So this game literally won't let you reload anything. If a mission goes wrong(the place where i stopped and uninstalled was where i had to transport to a guy to get a code, and assumed my character would automatically tell the other npc, whereupon i realized i had to actually remember it, it wouldn't let me transport back and it ruined the whole mission and I couldn't get to do it again. This is either sloppy design or trying to prove some stupid point, but just not worth playing. It's cheap for a reason.
8836	0	a	This Game Blows Ccoocckk - 10/10 IGN
8837	0	a	BEWARE!!! Won't Work on ANY Windows 64-Bit system..
8838	0	a	A little bit of fun, but the interface and long-winded trading bored me at long last.
8839	0	a	This is another one of those run and gun type games. It's not bad but it's not good either. There are a ton of bugs and I don't think anyone is going to patch them.
8840	0	a	i spent 10 minutes jumping aorund, then i uninstalled and played another ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game like this one.
8841	0	a	Do not buy this game it is absolutely terrible, it's incredibly dull and the trading system isn't even any good you can just bounce between the earth and moon continually buying and selling the same things for constant profit.  The gunplay is also extremely basic and tedious during the few times you get to actually use your weapons.  It's also done in a weird chapter/challenge system instead of making it one continous story or an openworld/sandbox system which seems pretty arbitary.  Didn't try multiplayer but considering the rest of the game i doubt its any good.
8842	0	a	although i play this game and enjoy it beacause its vintage i dont recomend to buy it  cons *small enviorments *save-load doesnt exist (only autosaving which is useless) *if you lose you must repeat the whole chapter *bounty missions take place only in 2 diffrent place's *Every chapter is timed and the timmer goes down with every travel (planet,bounty hunting,mission teleporting) *The whole game is buy sell... nothing more  *around 2-3 options when you speaking whith a NPC  *i plays on a small window and you cant play it in full screen (belive me its really tiring for your eyes) *graphics are bad for a game of 2008 it is more like game from 80s (goldfinger was far better than this and it was a game that realished 1986...) *In every travel a stupid android pop up and say NOT GREAT AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH   I dont recomend you to buy it,i think its really not worth the money even if its in 4 euros if you going to buy it dont waste more than half of its price
8843	0	a	Shouldn't have passed the development stage.  Stay away, and this is why:  An interesting idea which starts out very nice, but is let down by shoddy graphics, poor game mechanics and linear gameplay. I'd rather say 'Dont waste your time, let alone your money' but then again as someone who loves space trading games and the idea of creating an inter-galactic transport empire, it appealed to me. I was just very very let down by this title.  If you really want to be a space trader in a multiplayer dynamic virtual economy, I'd recommend EVE Online, Star Citizen or Elite Dangerous so you can properly go for it. If your just looking for single player you could always try something like Freelancer with a mod or 2.
8844	0	a	Do not list a game with multiplayer and coop if it doesn't contain either. The game itself is fun, but it is false advertising nonetheless. There is a multiplayer option, but it's more broke than the lowest economic percentile. Not even the powers of hamachi can fix it.
8845	0	a	If trading items back and forth for a small profit is your jam, you may want to try this empty husk of a game for less than a few bucks, but otherwise there is simply not enough here to be an enjoyable experience for anyone.
8846	0	a	low gfx and play
8847	0	a	This is basically a stocks simulator, as a friend of mine pointed out. I found this tedious within less than 10 minutes of starting up the game. I paid 50 cents for it thanks to a coupon, but I still want my 50 cents back.
8848	0	a	It's the repetitive gameplay, the thin narrative and the dated shooter mechanics makes the game not worth it at all.
8849	0	a	Hard to believe that the Space Trader version I played on my old Palm PDA was MUCH better than this version. I was looking forward to a more indepth experience when I bought this but was very disappointed. Do not buy...
8850	0	a	1993!  This game is just not my kind of game, it is very boring and the graphics are a disaster! It feels like it's made in the 90's. I don't know why steam includes this game in their store?! It takes a long time to get into the game and i'd rather put some time into trading up my items from Counter-Strike: Global Offensive than trading space merch with bots.  I however think this is a great game for the people who wants to play retro games and have a lot of time.
8851	0	a	I legitimately can't think of one good thing about this game. cons: 1. Diss proportionate models 2. Horrible looping music from the god damn 90's 3. No real tutorial 4. The Fps game doesn't work properly 5. The UI is cancer 6. The game costs money 7. The game exists 8. I bloody recorded it.  10/10 would uninstall MULTIPLE BLOODY TIMES!!!! 
8852	0	a	The game has an interesting concept, merging a space trading game with some first person action elements and missions, and even a bit of mystery (Where the heck is Lieutenant Dan?), however it falls short on many levels.  Firstly, as a trading game it is pretty weak. The economy simulation has a very limited number of commodities and the pricing mechanics are reasonably predictable. Go to destination A, buy the highest priced goods that have the most recent lowest price, possibly split the cargo hold between the two top picks, then travel to the next destination to hopefully (and almost always) sell it at a higher price then repeat. It's fairly tedious, and there is no buy/sell commission/overhead so you just sell off your entire inventory whether it is a profit or loss, then buy up whatever is the best deal on the current planet even if it is one of the things you just sold them, fairly unrealistic compared to any other trading games I've played as there is no buy-ask spread whatsoever. There are 5 missions in campaign mode and the first 4 are more or less like tutorials more than anything and have only 2 or 3 destinations which is pretty suboptimal for a space trading game really. The real game is campaign mission 5 which has 4 destinations and a bit of a story to it (albeit a weak one). The biggest mystery in the game is trying to find Lieutenant Dan, which is a bit challenging, but also rather disappointing when you do find him.  You then go on contract hitman jobs to kill various bad guys you've been either sent to take out, or that you opted into by taking a job through the bartenders. The contract hits are incredibly repetitive due to there only being about 3 or 4 small maps that they play out in.  The FPS enemy AI is 1990s quality, and the action isn't that great. The meat of the game is in mission 5 which is the longest and has the most trading destinations (4 total). You're on a countdown timer from 500 hours with each travel you take consuming some number of hours with which you must meet the trading objectives. Problem is, from the start you can't trade anywhere due to a military presence halting trading, so you have to travel around to make money from hit jobs to then pay off the authoritarian police state guys to leave so trading can resume.  The rest of the time you end up running around the levels collecting crates full of random commodities like Super Mario and selling them. It's very tedious and gets boring quick.  I finished this game just to see if there was anything at all exciting about it, but it was somewhat disappointing. If it is a space trading game you're looking for, this sure isn't it.
8853	0	a	It's been a while since I last played this, but I remember my opinions on it.  I really wanted to like this. I really did. But the lack of explanation in what things do, why even bother going on 'missions' when trading was so much safer and profitable, the blandness of it all... I couldn't.  It feels like I'm playing an alpha. So many small things that could make the game great wasn't there. It feels like part of the dev team wanted to do a space exploration fps while the other wanted to do merchantile trading and this was their compromise. Half of two things with next to nothing in terms of correlation. Like they literally just smashed the two bits together mid-production and called the end result good enough.
8854	0	a	Been trying for hours now, but it just won't let me complete chapter 2!  It's mildly fun, but the forced FPS sequences are so poorly made and the overall trading is way too easy, for this game to be any good. The concept i pretty good though, so 3/10

8857	0	a	Penguins Arena: Senda's World is a really fun multiplayer game, but it's not worth your money.  Penguins Arena is a multiplayer game where you play as Penguins and you fight other Penguins to be the last penguins alive.  The game has an SP mode which is you fighting Penguins in an endless mode and most of it get's boring after a while and the only way to enjoy the game is to play with real people and this is where all the bad begins.  The game is completely dead. I tried joining a server, but no one was playing and it's quite sad cause the developer has been updating the game, but sadly there's no point in buying this game.  The audio design is also no that good, the soundtrack is really annoying and most of the time I turn it off when I start playing.  The game is really fun, but playing solo is not fun and unless you have friends who will play with you, don't bother with this game.  Pros: + Fun gameplay  Cons: - Dead Online - Boring Solo mode -Terrible audio design  Final Rating: 4/10 - Not worth it  If you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked about the review.

8860	0	a	I have no idea how this abomination got over 600 positive reviews.  Multiplayer only 'arena' shooter with zero multiplayer. Seriously, no one is playing this.  'Arena' is a peanut sized island where you get catapultet into the water and die everytime a returded penguin farts in your general direction.  Rounds end in about 10 seconds because you either get thrown into the water or just commit suicide out of boredom.  No animations - The returded pengiuns just hobble around.  Crap graphics - looks like 3D stock models drawn in paintbrush  Crap physics - It takes my returded pengiun 10 seconds to hurl his retured snowball at another returded pengiun.  Annoying 'Surfs up dood!' 3 second loop music in an arctic themed game.  Probably took me longer to write this review than it took them to make this game.  Only play this if you're a returded pengiun.  Final verdit: Smelly fish
8861	0	a	A cute game, where you must protect your penguin 'tribe' by pushing all the other tribe members off an iceberg (global warming, people!)  Interesting concept, fast gamplay which involves hurling bombs, fish and snowballs at the opposing penguins.  Since Steam requires you to say yes or no, I'm afraid I'll have to give it a no (even with the pitiful amount of time I've spent on this). The reason being - as can be seen from other reviews - the multiplayer is a barren wasteland. The AI isn't much fun, and doesn't look like anyone is playing this anymore...  I picked it up for free, but wouldn't recommened unless it sees a massive surge in popularity.
8862	0	a	Penguins Arena Sedna's World is an extremely barebones king of the hill shooter. You play as a penguin throwing snowballs and other, slightly different colored penguins trying to push them off an iceberg and into the shark infested waters below. The maps are fairly varied with some being big arenas with lots of trees covering the edges making them long and sometimes frustrating to end and others being so tiny that a single explosion will throw half the players into the murky depths. Some of the maps even have collapsing glaciers that makes the play area smaller the longer the game drags on.  There is no health for the Penguins your only weapons are the slow firing snowball and your rather weak punch. Your 3rd weapon, which is both the best and the most risky, is yourself. By running and jumping you can pick up speed and by hitting other penguins transferring that speed into them sending them flying with incredible force. Of course, if you miss or get hit when moving that fast you'll often end up killing yourself. You can also pick up various power-ups on the map ranging for a brief invulnerability to snowballs to a small supply of rapid fire fish or an exploding fish that functions much as a grenade.  Graphically and musically the game is nothing impressive and there is no storyline, no voice-acting or really anything other than your basic deathmatch. The few different modes available only really allow you to change the number of teams in the match and whether or not your additional lives should run around as bots, fighting until you die and take them over, or simply be additional respawns that can't get themselves killed.  Although Penguins Arena is a fun little multi-player game it suffers from a number of rather major faults. The lack of any additional modes means that it gets repetitive within a couple of games and the lack of anyone else playing it online means it's only really fun when you can manage to gather a bunch of friends to play with, the bots available in single-player are simply not up to par.  All in all, not a game I'd recommend you get unless you plan to get it with a couple of friends so you have someone to play with and even then I doubt you will get through many matches before the repetitive nature of the game forces you to stop and go find a better alternative.
8863	0	a	If you want to waste money on something completely ridiculous which you probably won't spend more than a few minutes on...  then lock your money away untill you regain sense. But if you fail to do so, you might as well buy this.
8864	0	a	Luckily I got this for free. Is a bit too silly and penguins aren't really that easy to control. I'll leave this one for the kids.
8865	0	a	I never thought id be at a point in my life where id review about penguin game, but here i am. What can i say, I had coupon on the game (as way as other games) and i had nothing better to do. About the game. Its like the cousin of super smash bros that was drop on its head a lot as a kid whos favorit animal is a penguin. Dont get me wrong, its a fun game on a brain dead level.
8866	0	a	ok right away dont think i am a total hater. this game is not that great in my opinion though. yeah i only played 2 rounds but then agein those two rounds were frusterationg. the number of bombs they can through at you is also stupid. basicly in this game you are a penguin pushing other penguins off the iceburg, and maybe even killing them in the deadly waters. i think that this game is not worth even close to fiffteen dollers and to end this review there are great games out there but this, this let me down.
8867	0	a	This game is only enjoyable because I obtained it in a pack of six games for 1.50, had I payed more for this game I'd hate myself. If you can get it for next to nothing like I did then go for it. If not stay away.

8879	0	a	BEST GAME NA. The combat in this game is perfect, its really is the apex of what next gen has to offer. The graphics make bf4 look likes its being run on a toaster using the DayZ engine. The mechanics are 100% polished and make the ARMA II UI like clean. The particle effects of this game even Rival 'Call of Duty: Ghouls '6GB RAM Edition'' and it even trumps the fish AI too. Overall this game is so good, I would reccomend not buying and instead stabbing youself in the eyes a few times and breaking your hands, as you are not worthy of playing it. On a final note the only issue with this is game is it would not uninstall fast enough.
8880	0	a	A thoroughly unremarkable casual Non-Violent Family-Friendly Holiday-Themed FPS piece of ♥♥♥♥.   It's not hideously bad and if you like jacking off to penguins then there's penguins to jack off to here.   Sort of has a 'Dreamcast FPS' vibe to it. Could possibly be fun with Friends &amp; Bros but pretty much everything is fun with Friends &amp; Bros and ahahahahahahaha at actually playing this online with randoms.   PS hope you like playing with bots because literally nobody actually plays this game.   PPS you can also teamblock / teamkill and I'm sure there were plenty of extremely ♥♥♥-raged tweens back in the day.

8899	0	a	Cute little game, unfortunately not much here. Its an online game with only 2 total servers, so you'll be lucky to play with 1-2 other ppl. Mechanics are finnicky. Sometimes you'll hit someone and they'll barely move, either times they'll go flying. You'll hit right next to someone with an explosive item and they won't move at all. Sometimes you'll hit someone way off the ice and they'll be able to just fly back down to it. Other times you'll barely go off and you won't be able to go back. Every level is pretty similar and you use the same 2-3 guns with the same 2 powerups. Can get repetitive and take forever.   5/10.
8900	0	a	A real stinker of a title. Basically the whole thing is a 'Sumo' style of game, knock all the other Penguins off the ice to win the round. The issue is that gameplay is dull. The whole thing moves too slowly and is riddled with random bugs and issues that wreck the game.  The Computer players themselves are completely dim-witted too, either openly jumping off the ice float with little to no provocation, or looping in a basic pattern. Multiplayer is completely dead too making gameplay all but non-existant.  Basically theres a reason this isnt sold by itself, its just pure trash.
8901	0	a	Oh man... This game is so bad, I guess most of the positive reviews are fakes or trolls. First game, game crashed. Second game, I spawned 'dead' so I couldn't do anything but watch. Third game I finally got to play, and it sucked. There was 2 people in whole world playing this game same time as I, and it only has multiplayer, so it's worthless... Stay away!

8911	0	a	I've played very little at the time of this review.  Pros +Penguins are awesome. +Graphics look nice. +Controls are responsive. +Funish...  Cons -The game crashes with out fail after every match if in fullscreen. -The game resets video options after every restart of the game. -The OS can start to become unstable if you crash because of being in fullscreen. -When you die you are placed as a ghost penguin in wierd places, unable to move and in terrible view of what is actually happening. What makes this worse is that the maps are just large enough that it can take upwards of 10+ minutes for one of the last two penguins to die, leaving you trapped waiting.   In addition to being trapped and unable to move, you are given the ability to shoot what I can only assume are ghostly eggs but your aim is virtually non-existent.  Now if the glaring issues are ever resolved I would highly recommend this game. It could be the perfect fast paced mini game it wants to be if some changes were to be made. The maps are just too large and that forces matches to last longer than needed and with the other problems just makes it less fun.  I do think I'll continue to play a few matches here and there for a long while but I can't honestly see myself playing for long periods. If you watch some videos and think it looks fun I would get it. I just can't recommend a game with so many glaring problems. Although I do love mechanics of pushing penguins off of an island. It reminds me of some of these mini games that were on the first xbox back when I was a kid. I loved those and I'd still play those today if available for PC. 
8912	0	a	Monaco was an interesting concept and was alright for awhile. The problem is, the game provides a co-op function which it then, through its very design, discourages you from using. There is no way to make any permanent progress on any given level. Any deterrent you use to reduce the number of potential threats (even shooting the guards or exploding them) can be reversed by other guards, and murdering everyone on every map is impractical, if not impossible. This means that ultimately, the best way to beat any map is to remain undetected, but remaining undetected is infinitely easier when playing alone, as cooperative matches often just turn into a smash-and-grab chaotic cluster♥♥♥♥. At the same time, playing the game alone is almost pathetically easy, and feels hollow. In either case, the concept felt a bit unpolished and there was never a sense, at least not for me, that careful planning and slow, steady progress on a level would reward a player (or group of players) with a superior playing experience, so every level just devolved into 'Grab what you can, die in a bush, and hope someone survives to revive you.'  Suffers from the same problem Dungeon Defenders did, in that it provides cooperative play without an incentive to utilize it (indeed in both cases it was almost a hindrance to bring others into the game).  Had some fun with it though, probably worth checking out if you're not expecting much and you're just looking for a casual experience to share with a few people. I'd recommend waiting for a sale though.
8913	0	a	Not that good 4-5/10 :/
8914	0	a	10/10 A Must Play
8915	0	a	Beware people with colorblindness such as myself, when you are playing co-op with others, it almost impossible to tell which character you are playing as, causing many frustrations when you think you are controlling your character but instead trying to control someone else's and the colorblindness mode does slim to nill to actually fix that problem.
8916	0	a	People sit in lobby unready to play and there isn't an option to kick them. Stealth isn't really important as everyone just runs around collecting coins whether or not there's guards or traps. It's just a race to see how fast to get the level complete.
8917	0	a	Monaco is a deceptive game...looking at screenshots or trailers, you might get the impression that it is one of theses stealth games where you're supposed to go in, grab some loot, and get out like a shadow, without being seen or causing too much mayhem.  But Monaco is not one of theses games. Monaco is as much about stealthing some parts, as it is about running around spreading chaos in others. Monaco doesn't care if you cause mayhem, it doesn't care if you kill people or not, it doesn't care if you've been seen or not. The one thing Monaco cares about is how long it took you to do all that.  At the end of a level, Monaco only tells you how long it took you, then add a 10s penalty for every coin you missed, and finally, give you your leaderboards rank. Because Monaco is on a fundamental level all about speed. Cleaning levels as fast as you can is what Monaco is about. You can try to play stealthily, and never get seen, but it's not what the level design is made for, and it's probably not even achievable on the later levels, especially if you're trying to get all the loot.  So is Monaco a good game in its genre ? Probably, for the few people who enjoy replaying the same level over and over again until they've figured out the perfect path and ends up being lucky in the random placements of loot. The devs had a vision, and they stuck to it, and they've executed well on that front.   But most people aren't speedrunners. Most people play a game once (if at all) and are done with it. And for that great majority of players, i can't recommend it. The level design isn't really meant for doing anything else than going for perfect runs. Just getting the main objective and escaping will avoid most of the map and the difficulty, it will feel like skipping the level.  Granted there is an decent story arc to follow (though the ending was a letdown), and a great soundtrack, but it's too little if, like me, you don't embrace the main gameplay. So while still respecting the dev's decisions and applauding their great execution, i still give this game a negative recommendation.
8918	0	a	Not really very good.  Too fast paced/arcadey for good cooperation and the artstyle inteferes with gameplay. Certain classes are massively overpowered and others next to useless (a major problem in any coop game).  Almost everything you can do in the level (knocking out or even killing guards, hacking computers) resets either after a short timer or when someone finds the body and even the players may be revived infinitely. In addition the vast majority of classes are only really given a small bonus to an ability anyone can do. If anyone can pick a lock being able to pick it slightly faster isn't THAT useful.  All of this combined makes it much more likely/effective to simply have each player rush around alone than work together to come up with a proper plan. There is no real punishment for losing players since someone else can do the same thing (though a little more slowly) until you revive them again. Sure you COULD play the game as 'intended' but why? Yes, maybe it does magically get better towards the end but I can't see it being worth the ♥♥♥♥ before it. Fixing bad underlying design with 'good' level design is not acceptable.  The trailer (video on this store page) is completely unrepresentative of how the actual game plays in coop. As mentioned by others (and indeed at the start of this review) the art style makes it difficult to tell what is actually going on and isn't particularly pretty in its own right.  Maybe if you put significant hours into it you'll get used to the art style, only play the 'good' levels/play for score and speed etc but that is not an argument in favour of the game. It is advertised as a cooperative heist game (similar to, say, Swat 4 or Chaos Theory coop in design). Instead it is a fast paced arcade-style game with multiple flaws.
8919	0	a	This was a nice attempt to make a nice game but Failed. Reason one is the poor graphics.This Game is extremely Unoptimized for most Graphic cards. What it seems to me that the developers were intending to make a game Like Halo etc. This game has a Nice Story But poor Graphics and Gameplay. I don't think i will be recommending it to this Game to a Friend.
8920	0	a	This was described to me as being a mix of Payday 2 and Hotline Miami... I don't see a relation to either. This game is painful to look at. Half the time I'm staring at the screen trying to figure out what I am even looking at. Look at the pictures shown above and try to explain to me what I'm looking at. This game is a good concept, but it is extremely overrated. You can beat most levels just by navigating to the exit.
8921	0	a	The video for this game made it look a whole lot more fun then it is. For most of the game there is no point in sneaking as blasting through levels running from guards is less frustrating and way faster. It feels like there is really no point in trying to sneak and make the game work the way it's meant to be played when it's frustrating, dull and the game encourages you to complete levels as fast as possible. You won't be playing as all the characters mainly because it feels like a lot were added as filler and their perks are out classed by other characters. I JUST FELT LIKE I WAS TRYING TO HAVE FUN AND I WAS TRYING TOO HARD TO ENJOY THIS GAME AND ITS SUB PAR
8922	0	a	its only fun for the first 15 mins then it turns in to the same crap over and over aand onver again
8923	0	a	Not worth buying if you are trying to play single player.

8925	0	a	I would't reccomend that you buy this game
8926	0	a	If you like retro games maybe worth a try but honestly its not my cup of tea at all. I like the idea but controls pretty poor, graphics terrible (as shown in screenshots etc.) I only tried it cos it was free weekend and the concept looked fun. Only played it for a few minutes but thats all it took to decide I'm gonna uninstall
8927	0	a	The first thing I tried to do with this game was make it play in windowed mode, because that's how I prefer it. This required me to restart the game. So I did. Then the game opened up in windowed mode, and I tried to drag the game into a corner of my screen, because that's how I prefer it. I got about halfway there before the game stopped loading assets and tried to get into the menu. The game locked up. For a minute. Hitting the red X in the corner to shut it down did absolutely nothing, I had to give it the three finger salute to get it to ♥♥♥♥ off. Subsequent attempts to move the window were entirely futile; I can't even get the game to accept moving the top bar so much as a pixel because as soon as I tab out to get my captured mouse cursor back the game throws a shitfit and locks up HARD.  This game is such an attention ♥♥♥♥♥ that if I go outside of the game for so much as a second I have to give it a three finger ♥♥♥♥ you just to get my entire computer back.  I don't know what the game is like. I can't even get that ♥♥♥♥ing far in the ♥♥♥♥ing game, because I can't put the game window where I need it to be in order to play.  So ♥♥♥♥ this game. Maybe you'll like it, but I don't really go for BDSM where the game I'm trying to play wants to whip me until I beg for mercy.
8928	0	a	I can barely tell what I'm doing or where I'm going... it's easy to get lost. I tried the free weekend of it and was disappointed. I would not recommend unless you're a hardcore fan of this style of game and intuitively know how to play. Not for beginners.
8929	0	a	Looks like it could have been a great game. We were looking for a new couch-play title and Monaco is certainly praised for that. It also claims 'full controller support'... Except that it doesn't have full support. It only appears to support 360 controllers on windows :(
8930	0	a	The game teaches you that you should try to sneak all of the levels, and it lets you do that with any character you have at your disposal, and then it says '♥♥♥♥ you' and gives you two levels in a row that can only feasibly be completed by going in guns blazing and only with certain characters.
8931	0	a	Hey guys, I know many of you like this game, and don't get me wrong, it's good. It just that... well... it's boring. Don't kill me yet. It's just that it gets old way to quickly. After playing for a short total amount of time, I get bored. Sorry... I don't recommend this. D:

8936	0	a	Probably the worst overhyped game ever made. If you read the other reviews you'll see it's recommended by people with as low as 0.6hrs playtime.  So what is Monaco? Monaco is a coin collecting simulator. Imagine pacman, but you've got a gun, and also the ghosts pose 0 threat and don't come back to life. That's Monaco in a nutshell. Stealth? Oh sure, you can stealth through the game. But it's very easy to screw up and set the alarms off, at which point stealth is over and it switches to being one of the easiest shooters ever made.   It's just such a laid back game, there's very little consequences for doing anything wrong. The game practically plays itself. Your objective is mainly just to tilt the control stick in the direction of coins then sit back and relax.   Want proof Monaco is a poor game? Take a look at the global achievements. Less than 0.9% of people have finished the second act of the campaign; and I'll tell you it's definitely not because it's too hard.  It boggles the mind how this game managed to get such amazing reviews as it did; really says a lot about the quality of mainstream reviews nowadays.

8957	0	a	I've played the first levels of the first storyline with a couple of friends. I haven't enjoyed it as I thought I was going to.  The game, if you play it as a proper thief, is good for its sale price ($ 2.54), but it can get pretty annoying (sometimes funny, though) if you play it reckless. I would not pay its full price ever.  I think I was expecting something more from the hour and a half that I have played.   If you think of buying it just consider of telling your friends to get some copies so you can have a better time.  2.9/5 for 1.5 hours played.

8962	0	a	'Singleplayer or Co-op heist game', key word being singleplayer. No. It's not singeplayer orientated. Singleplayer and co-op have the same maps, same amount of enemies, except you're by yourself. I'm sure this game would be fun with friends to play it, but in my curcumstance this game is not fun, AT ALL. It's massively unbalanced. So much so that it's ridiculous, especially when guards can resurrect each other, despite taking a direct hit to the chest with the full slug from a shotgun. If you like a hard-as-Dark-Souls challenge then by all means buy it, if not don't get it, unless you have friends to play with. At least I got it for $2.54
8963	0	a	This game has potential but unless you somehow get a full group of people willing to play the game it's meant to be played, every game will be people running through causing too much attention to do the game porperly and have fun.  On another note, the game is way to complicated. You play on a top down POV but there is SO MUCH going on at any time that it's neraly impossible to see what's happening. You will lose yourself constantly, also basic parts of the game like laser alarms and hacking are just frustrating and random which makes most people just run through them.  Try it if it's on sale and ONLY if you have goof friends willing to play with you the way it's made to be played.  Alright/10
8964	0	a	Yet another game that will only detect Xbox controllers....... I REALLY wanted to play this game since it's release. Guess I won't now.
8965	0	a	This is a single player now. I read that there was a competition for this game but so few people entered it that it was canceled. I could be wrong but I know multiplayer doesn't last long on games like this. That's normally the best part in these types of games, and now it's dwindled down to nothing. I use the word dead to describe this. It's sad but it's true. Unless you want to play the solo missions they're fun but muliplayer was better and its gone now. I wouldn't buy this game anymore not to spite anyone but because you won't get anything out of it.
8966	0	a	It is a okay game but needs a few more good updates to be great
8967	0	a	It gets old fast. Not really good. Besides, its so confusing when you play with other people online. There are so many stuff going on screen that you don't know what to do anymore.  3/10

8969	0	a	I can appreciate the difficulty in bringing a quality indie concept to fruition, but that doesn't excuse a game from being compelling. At first blush it's a fun little romp which friends can join in on, but it quickly dissolves into an almost meaninglessly easy sprint. It's a stealth game in which stealth is not required, enemies are not particularly lethal, and your characters move blindingly fast. You can easily sprint through all the alarms and trail every guard behind you on the way in and out of each heist, ignore almost all of the loot, and be none the worse for wear. Loot is needed only for high score, and who really cares? All this without mentioning the abilities that make it even easier, especially the Miner character who literally can tunnel around all the obstacles in a level and walk out unscathed. No reason to go stealthy, no reason to really play, actually.
8970	0	a	 This is gonna be thumbsed down to hell because my opinion is different than yours and im not allowed to not like it even though I personally cant recommend it and you won't even give me a chance and read the review
8971	0	a	As of now, I can't really recommend Monaco. It's definitely a fast paced, incredibly fun game. It's definitely fun to sneak around, figure out how to take out guards, and recruit new characters.  however, there is a lot of emphasis on multiplayer, and, well, unless you have friends, online is pretty much dead. characters that you play are very single strength, so there are certain missions that are extremeley difficult to pull off unless you know which character is good and how to play them well.  overall, grab it while it's cheap, or if you really enjoy a challenge + stealth, I can't recommend this game enough.
8972	0	a	Seems like it would be a fun coop game but I just couldn't get over the art style. It is the worst use of the retro pixel style I have ever seen in a critically acclaimed game. The ugly doesn't bother me so much as it being not functional. It's a struggle to tell the tile sprites apart while racing through the level: is that a shelf, a wall, a door, or something else? I don't know, it all looks like placeholder programmer art.   Even after playing for hours I wasn't able to tell what certain things were without stopping and thinking about it.
8973	0	a	Way too fast-paced to be a stealth heist game. You wanna play online? Oh that ain't gonna work, it took me half an hour on my first play (not exagerating) to find a server that didn't shut down as soon as I joined, and your team lacks all communication and teamwork, within a second everyone has rushed in and triggered about 20 alarms. If you're gonna play, do it in a private friends co-op.
8974	0	a	I've heard so much praise about this game when I finally got around to trying it it turned out to be a pretty standard stealth type game that hurt my eyes and had way too much crap going on at once. Not sure what all the hype was about: I guess this game just fit all the critics' 'indie' bill too well to pass it by.
8975	0	a	A cool concept lacking good execution. Everything is so busy! Everything is so bright! Characters all look the same! Blocky for the sake of being blocky. Multiplayer is an absolute mess of flashy, neon, blooming colors and meaningless symbols. Too simplistic to have much depth, yet too complex to be intuitive or much fun with friends.
8976	0	a	I want to like it, but I was so confused and didnt know what was happening most of the time.
8977	0	a	Felt like it should have a sizure warning, found it hard to follow characters with the map not moving with you and everyone just being a square.
8978	0	a	This is flash game quality. Don't spend money on this.

8983	0	a	We bought a 4-pack of this game since it seemed like it would have some interesting mechanics. Unfortunately this game didn't capture our attention. After about 1.5 hours we found the game was a bit easy and some of classes felt significantly op compared to others. I did enjoy the game's graphical style though.  This game isn't bad but I wouldn't recommend it as I didn't really enjoy it.
8984	0	a	Monaco as a whole is a very interesting and fresh concept. However its executed poorly.  I never played the singleplayer as it was me and 2 friends (plus a random player) playing together, the multiplayer is insanely unstable, we would barely beat a level before one of us disconnecting, we all tried making the lobby to see if that helps but someone would always end up disconnecting. The game would occasionally just crash anyway.  What little time we could play in it, it was fun other than the fact its really hard to distinguish who's who besides a slight difference in colour.  The game could be good if it weren't for the instability.
8985	0	a	When I looked at the game in the store, I tought it'll be some kind of a robbery simulator like Payday but with pixel-graphics, also the 'field of view' (of the robber) looks gives us a modern-oldschool game, wich I'm a fan of. So I bought this game and started downloading it with a big smile on my face. When the downloading is completed, I opened the game and started a match. I was waiting and people were just joinning and leaving and I couldnt start to play. After I figured out that there's an option to play offline, I started the game. The character had a delay in movement and crosshair (I mean mouse) and the gameplay was all about moving from a place to place, collecting some golden things and avoiding guards (Wich is impossible in some levels). When guards are chasing after you, they will start saying things in French and that's very annoying. Now let me tell you the pro's and con's:  Pro's: 1. The game itself looks high-quality and makes a feeling of an old&amp;new game at the same time.  2. Field of view looks very cool and makes the game more 'realistic', wich means you cant just notice all the guards, you'll need to look at them somehow.  Con's:  1. Gameplay is same, you'll just need to listen to some convention in the start, and then do the mission. The mission are really boring because the lack of content, you'll find yourself interacting with doors / other things.  2. Sounds are really annoying, especially the one that the guards does. 3. A really big amout of levels as a story line, wich makes no sense at all.   This game may be cool if it was free, I'd better donate to charity the money I wasted on this game.
8986	0	a	Won't connect to any servers. Crashes frequently loading the lobby list.
8987	0	a	This is ♥♥♥♥
8988	0	a	I recieved this game as a gift a while ago, and from around 90m of co-op gameplay, I cannot stand this game, not one bit.  I liked the layout of the menus and their bright intense color on black, contrasting the giant pixels to the max. However, the gameplay in my opinion is extremely repetitive, and the game kind of 'forces' you to stealth the joint. In this I mean how you may have a shotgun, you can go in and blow someone to their pixely skeleton, however note that you can only use it once, before having to collect 10 stupid coins to load another use into your weapon/tool. And by the time I collected 10 coins, I had about 20 stupid Watchmen following me, tripping lasers as I ran, and doctors shooting me with tranquilizer crossbows, which led to me being beaten to death with the deadly forks the Watchmen hold. Sure, you can try to hide in a bush/vent/tree, but by the time I went in one, they followed me to the bush and happened to poke the bush with their forks, leading me to my instant death. The music, in my opinion, is awful, just sounding like an extremely sped up piano ballad, or better yet a 2-year-old banging their hands and arms on every key possible.  The graphics are squares. I think everything is a square. Your body is a big square, with a smaller square (the head, which stupidly bobbles left and right any time you move your mouse), and two little squares (the arms) on the side of the big square. Despite this I do like the lighting effects and post-processing. The animations are like pixel ragdolls.. It's strange. There are different characters to choose from, all with different abilities. I thought that it was cool, being able to have a specialty and all. You start off with 4 at the beginning, and get more as you progress through the campaign. Also, I just want to throw out there that if you want to go up a staircase, ladder, etc., you have to 'prepare' it first, and once it's 'prepared', you need to wait for ALL players to go there in order to go up. Hated waiting.  Overall? 4/10.. Others may like this game, but I sure as hell don't. I'll give them points for originality, but that's it. It's not my kind of game.

9014	0	a	Please release this on the ps2!!!!!
9015	0	a	Only fun if you play with friends, and even then it's mediocre.
9016	0	a	Maybe I haven't yet invested enough time in this game to appreciate what it offers, but some friends and I tried to just jump in and we were not enjoying it. A slightly better tutorial would probably be nice. The game really just keeps throwing new stuff at you expecting you to know what's going on, and for my friends who never even play stealth games, it became a huge hurdle. I can definitely see a fun game in here, but it's not very accessible as-is.  Edit: I also totally forgot to mention the terrible interface and options. Why can I not start a room for friends only? I had to kick Shrek out of my room about five times before my friend could finally join. I don't like saying no to Shrek.
9017	0	a	wham is it removed from my steamd account i installed it the weekend free and now it`s removed this is really suck i thought it is going to be perma when it was free lol this sucks really
9018	0	a	I dont even know why im stealing stuff like WTF !!
9019	0	a	confusing visuals, boring gameplay.
9020	0	a	This game is ♥♥♥♥ing awful
9021	0	a	If you dont have friends, and you buy this game, you're gonna have a bad time. Plus, this game is really boring. Pretty maybe, but boring.
9022	0	a	I really wanted to like this game. The setup is perfect, arcadey-style thief game with different classes and interesting level design. The one downfall is the visual language. I feel like everything is giving this gradient glowy style that blurs into each other. Instead of having things be clearly defined they are really hard to spot. I know this game wants you to panic and be stressed out with each situation, yet I can barely make out what's going on. I stopped playing once I came to this realization.
9023	0	a	A sneak-em-up, top down game which is fun with both friends and even alone. For a while.  The game involves employing teamwork and tactics to disable security cameras, steal items and subdue guards. At least, that's what it promises. Unfortunately, it's only too easy to just run through levels, shooting everything in your path, and to forget that the main aim of the game is to remain stealthy. The game is only fun alone for a short while, before levels become repetetive and monotonous. Playing the game with others was a great way to suppress this, until the playerbase became so small that you would have to wait in lobbies 1h+ before another player appeared. A good enough game when it was released, Monaco is now lying untouched in my library as it has done for some time.
9024	0	a	I gave this game a shot since a friend bought it for me. It's not without its charm and the colouring is lovely with different themes to choose from. The gameplay however is shallow. I wouldn't have mind this if I was back in high school playing four people on one keyboard during recess. For a game you pay for year 2016… just not good enough.   I believe you can have fun with this if you're in the right mood and with friends. I did for example have a laugh as me and a friend panicked when the guards saw us and I accidentally dug my friend in to a hole in the building.   There are better games for you out there. Also, the aiming was awkward as hell.  PS: It works on LINUX!
9025	0	a	I had to look this game up on Youtube to find out more information about it and got this.          YouTube™ Video:  DA- Indie-Luminati Secrets EXPOSED!!!&nbsp;
9026	0	a	Monaco is a great concept gone horribly wrong. I got it as part of Humble Bundle 11, even paying extra for it alongside Antichamber. Antichamber is an epic journey into the mind that can't get enough reccomendation from me. Monaco is a failed attempt at a retro looking stealth game about heists. As you start it, it draws a mysterious air around itself, with, I'll admit, a pleasing retro aesthetic. And then you watch the cinematics. They're certainly not what the advertivements show. They're just the characters at hand sitting someplace taking turns spewing out TEXT-BASED dialouge while doing their stupid, 8-bit, repeating animations. The gameplay is clunky, and the retro aesthetic collapses in on itself when you can't tell what's a wall, what's a door, what's a plaza for you to walk into and yell out at the top of your lungs, 'HEY GUISE LOOG AND ME IM ROBB N. YOUR BANK!' You can't tell what's going to break line of sight, what's going to get you noticed, what's going to - oh, wait, it doesn't matter, because you can just run past every guard, kill everyone, set off every alarm, ♥♥♥♥ up every lock-pick attempt (oops, that doesn't matter either cos it's just hold down a key and boom, lock picked) The outcome won't change, you won't get more reinforcements thrown at you, you won't lose money, or fail the mission unless every single one of you dies. It just gets more ♥♥♥♥-easy if you have a whole gang of friends at your side, because then, with each classes game-breaking ability, you hardly have to do jack-♥♥♥♥. It sadly fails, with all its' promise, at being a good action game, at being a good stealth game, at being a thriller, at being a good co-op game, all failed. The worst part is it's not actively bad, just plain boring, like a McDonalds hamburger: Far overpriced for the bland thing you get. 3/10
9027	0	a	 Not sure what all the hubbub is about.   I gave this game two shots to impress me but I just don't see the appeal. First I played it with the keyboard online with a stranger and then the next day I tried it solo with a controller, both sessions were about 45 minutes. I came away from both bored.  At its core Monaco is a pretty basic stealth game with a silly tone to it. There's a little bit of story before each level but it doesn't take itself seriously nor should you. I didn't see anything worth caring about. The majority of players probably skip it altogether. The guards you'll spend your time avoiding also have a bumbling way of acting that adds to the droll atmosphere.  I did like how each character you choose to play as has a unique special ability that enhances their gameplay in some way. I even enjoyed a few chases at times when I did get caught. However, with most chases I never felt like I was in much danger. I have read that many multiplayer rounds devolve into free-for-all sprints through the level with no regard to stealth and I can see why. There's really only two things to do in each level: collect coins and reach the exit. As far as I can tell coins only add to your score on an online leaderboard which I'm probably not alone in not caring about.  Without an interesting story, likable characters, deep gameplay or enjoyable goals to strive for I couldn't find enough to keep me playing Monaco.
9028	0	a	The only heist that this game was able to pull off was the four bucks out of my wallet.
9029	0	a	Whatever attraction the fairly common/routine gameplay may have had is defeated by the completely indecipherable visuals. Even after an hour and a half of playing, I couldn't tell what terrain was what, where I could walk and where I couldn't, etc. Retro and simplistic styles are one thing, but they need to be coherent to work.
9030	0	a	The game is okay at first. Run around collect gold end level. Most of the people you play with are raging idiots. They either don't try to be careful or they run through the level urging you to hurry up over and over again instead of letting you get a feel for the game. There's also no real progression other than unlocking a few new characters. So your basically just playing for score and i've never really been into arcade style games.
9031	0	a	I played Monaco: Whats Yoursr Is Mine before, and its a mangled mess.  Control is annoying, you have no coordination so practically you walk and the games walls push you into were you need to be, the graphics, are confusing, what is the thing you control? a person? it looks like a mess, the maps dont even make sense.  So I do not recommend this game. at all
9032	0	a	My friends and I were looking for a co-op stealth game, and we came across Monaco. Quite generously one of them bought a copy for all three of us. We started playing through the main missions, having a lot of fun sneaking through the maps, silently taking out guards and what not. But then we started to realize that you didn't really need to sneak at all. You could simply run the through the level with abosolutely no consequences. In games like Mark of the Ninja or Hitman: Absolution, you're penalized for being seen, and in the latter even penalized for killing non-targets. With no points system in Monaco, there's no incentive to play it stealthily. Outside of a score, the levels themselves don't feel particularly rewarding. Very repetetive and easy to complete. I would recommend this game to a group of friends who just want something to play together and laugh about. However with no need to communicate or strategize I would not recommend this to anyone looking for an in-depth cooperative stealth game.
9033	0	a	I did not enjoy this game a large amount at all, got fairly boring quick, gameplay wise very little going for it, and the art style is painful to say the least. I could have spent £1 on more enjoyable things that would have lasted a longer time, such as a biscuit collection from poundland. On a positive note it had a fun idea and concept, but that is really it.
9034	0	a	'What am I supposed to do'? - First reaction 'Oh , I need to collect the yellow squares' - second reaction 'And my teamates are killing me now ? wtf' - third reaction 'Wtf ? what the hell is happening , wat WAT' -last reaction  Opinion : Impossible to play.
9035	0	a	The game is interesting in it's design. You select one of a few unique characters with different abilities and attempt to achieve a goal, usually one pertaining to an overarching plot that you uncover as you progress. Some stories unlock new characters with new abilities that may (or may not) help you during your next mission. I loved the references and easter eggs in the game. The developers certain put a lot of thought and creativity into the game. That, unfortunately, is where the good ends. The mechanics aren't consistent. There are times when you can be standing almost right next to a guard who is staring at you and they will not react, even when in LOS. Other times you can be standing in another room behind a wall walking softly and they suddenly become alert to something nearby (you). Mixed with the fact that the characters don't have precise controlling (the gun aiming is atrocious), which makes things ridiculous when there are lasers that will trip alarms and the choice between hacking a computer or smashing through a wall is the same motion. There were plenty of times I was trying to hack a computer right next to a laser and had to frustratingly inch my way up to the console so as not to slide right into the laser (when you let go of your movement key, your character keeps moving a small distance). With some refinement, I'd say this game would be a most excellent and exciting co-op game. As it is, me and my friends simply ended up frustrated and just dashing through the level to make it to the escapes or safe zone with no regard to who we alerted. Needs more work.

9043	0	a	Game sucks, never play, 0/10
9044	0	a	I'd heard a lot of great things about Monaco so I decided to pick this game up.  From what I can tell, it's a 2D heist game with a lot of stealth elements thrown in for good measure. Sadly, it seems like I may have decided to jump on the bandwagon a bit too late - looks like everyone's already gotten off. The online community for this game seems to be zero with a serious lack of diehards. Playing this game by yourself can only be fun for so long.  I'd recommend getting this game only if you know for certain that you will have other people to play with.
9045	0	a	Game sucks, never play, 0/10
9046	0	a	nope and I didn't even buy it
9047	0	a	Not fun at all whether solo or coop
9048	0	a	ummmmmmmm epic im just playing hitman absolution o my xbox 360
9049	0	a	Not very interesting or fun. Played with friends, soon became bored with the game.
9050	0	a	It was fun at first (playing with friends), but most of the time, you can't see anything (some maps are way too dark) and sometimes you can't even find yourself on the screen. Distinguishing collectable coins form fire is quite a challenge on some levels, which makes the game frustrating.
9051	0	a	Nothing really stands out about this game. I found it boring and a little on the cluttered side when it comes to line of sight and other things you need to keep an eye on while sneaking around. The gameplay is smooth. The artstyle is nice, the look of the characters is a little unapealing at least for me tho. I'd just rather play other games I suppose.   5 out of 10 coins 
9052	0	a	This game is better than Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode I. You can play as the guy with the monkey and pretend that it's Tails and it'll be a better Sonic game than it because it has Tails in it. You can even play with your friends, and with Shrek, but it will be terrible because you won't be able to see jack because the graphics be uglier than Dr. Eggman's armpit. In other words, this is solid for a Sonic game these days but I would advise that you pay no more than one dollar for it.
9053	0	a	No incentive to actually steal stuff, which just leads to the following step-by-step program:  1. The mole digs a hole in the wall and takes the trophy. 2. You walk 2 meters to the escape zone. 3. Repeat.  No fun at all. The game is simply overrated.

9055	0	a	Fun at first, but gets ridiculously impossible.
9056	0	a	literally the most pointless game in history
9057	0	a	this game sucks a little bit so i dont recommend to buy your bux for this...
9058	0	a	wtf is this game about7jj8im
9059	0	a	Rather repetitive for my tastes. Each proceeding levels don't really offer anything new to alter your playstyle, so you are committed to cheap out on every levels using the same approach, which is incredibly boring.
9060	0	a	eh... this game is boring to say the least. Pretty much you pick up a gun run past all the people and shoot everyone in your path, running with a gun is more effective then sneaking so it's really pointless, and you just run from point A to B and it gets boring very quick. I will say it has a nice artstyle and sound design but thats about it.
9061	0	a	This game should be called 'Smash and Grab with Little to No Repercussions'  8========&gt;
9062	0	a	Very boring game specialy if you dont have others to play with also its quite hard to noticed the character your using on the screen
9063	0	a	It's okay. I really don't see what all the fuss is about.
9064	0	a	steam you ad this for 14.99 $ this no good game
9065	0	a	This is a good game, but the controlls arent my favorite. For exsample when you get a weapon you can use the mouse to look around. why cant I use the mouse to look all the time? Also I cant find any sensitivity settings for the mouse when I got my first gun.
9066	0	a	I tried to like this game. But the graphics are so bad I can't tell what is happening on screen. Seriously. Weird art direction is one thing, outright indistinguishable blobs are another.  Maybe there's a good game here. In fact, there probably is. But I can't play it if I can't follow what's going on the screen. So it gets a thumbs down for a truly hideous art &amp; graphical style.
9067	0	a	Monaco, more like shitaco. Monaco is the worst thing to exist besides aids and cancer, I would rather stick my head in a blender and turn it on while listening to wax. First of all, the music is abismal. The music's is a ♥♥♥♥ing old timey ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ playing it away like it's ♥♥♥♥ing the easiest ♥♥♥♥. ♥♥♥♥ him, probably a child molester. The gameplay mechanics are garbage, you try to maneuver a bunch of queers that move like fat asses. Drop some pounds and then contact me. And the story mode, if I were to strap a car battery to my nipples and electricute myself, I feel like the noise I would produce would make a better story. GET OUT OF THE CITY. THAT'S IT. 0/10
9068	0	a	I found this game very interesting and fun. You strive to collect all the money in a mission (optional objective) while looking for a Trophy case (primary objective) you need to find and escape. It's like a heist. The first few hours, I was having a positive experience playing this game. However, as time goes on, after completing missions here and there, I have realized that most of enjoyment I get out of this game are depending on how well-made the missions are. How fun and challenging they are. Some missions, I can run around attracting all the guards and still complete the missions, I realize that isn't fun at all. So I really suggest to restrict yourself to being a harmless ninja and try to loot everything and escape. Everything else really fall just short.
9069	0	a	i have nhever wrote a review on any game. so this is my 1st. i have to tell you all.. this was the worst game i ever played. thank god it was free for 3 days for testing
9070	0	a	its entertaining for about 1 hour then gets boring. its essentially pacman without being able to see the whole screen.
9071	0	a	Head hurts
9072	0	a	Worst game I've played this year. Don't bother paying for it. Annoying 'Minecrafty' cubic lazy artstyle, boring gameplay and repetetive levels.
9073	0	a	In my opinion This game is bad, theres No tutoiral or anything that tells you basic Controls, and the fact that most of the time you've gotta do it online makes it even worse.
9074	0	a	This game is awful and over priced. Completely over hyped rubbish.
9075	0	a	Gets boring really fast. I've never been disappointed with a $3 purchase before, but this might be it...
9076	0	a	It’s multiplayer-only and there are no explanations.  EDIT: Someone in some forum explained to me how to switch to single player mode, and I’ve been able to actually play this game. The developers somehow thought that hiding the option and making multiplayer the default was a good idea. You need to have a gamepad and press START to switch to single player.  Anyway, I haven’t enjoyed the game much. Sorry for the lack of details, it’s been a while since I played it. The game didn’t have big flaws that I can remember, except that it wasn’t fun for me.
9077	0	a	The keystone to making this game work is the three other people you're going to be playing with. The maps the game has to offer requires the utmost coordination and teamwork, but offers classes that don't particularly work well together, and also don't really work well on their own. I didn't enjoy my experience with this game, and I feel as if the game has unrealized potential, but that's how the potential is going to remain: unrealized.
9078	0	a	Monaco has no replay value whatso ever..... After the campaign is finish the only option is to play custom maps or campaign again..... Also there are not enough characters... Even though this game was never meant to be realistic.. the game is relatively easy 
9079	0	a	I'll keep it short and simple. The game itself is fantastic but the entire community is dead, and this ain't the kind of game you'll really enjoy playing alone by yourself.
9080	0	a	Boring... that's it.
9081	0	a	Fairly boring to me. I got it on a Humble Bundle.
9082	0	a	Worst game I have ever played.

9087	0	a	. 
9088	0	a	A chaotic and nauseating mess of systems that don't mesh well or evolve in any way. A madcap dash to collect and escape without any real ability or need to plan and strategize. I've tried so hard to give this game a fair shake and enjoy it but every time I come up short.
9089	0	a	. 
9090	0	a	not engaging as i thought it would be. I prefer Hotline Miami.
9091	0	a	Needs a patch. The client crashes after every mission. I'm running a 7870 @ 1135 &amp; mem @ 1270 and a 1090T @3.5. It looks like a fun game but it shouldn't have any problems with my modest hardware.
9092	0	a	It's boring as hell
9093	0	a	You're heisting banks and it's all ♥♥♥♥ing colorful. There's nothing colorful about heisting banks.
9094	0	a	Naw Naw not a very good game. Multiplayer sucks. Bad game!
9095	0	a	It's... interesting? It's kinda cool how the map is a floor plan until you can actually see it with your eyes, I guess, although that takes some getting used to. Basically expect everything to go swiftly to hell, which is sort of part of the fun. I really dislike the sound design, especially how it's kind of like some French guy is yapping right into your ear the entire time. Iunno. It's worth playing with friends, but I'm not about to pick it up and go for it alone.
9096	0	a	Almost every critic has acclaimed this game as 'amazing', 10/10 type of game. Whatever acid they were on, send some my way.  This game is pure ♥♥♥♥. I was looking for a fun game to play with friends and after seeing such ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ comments like 'One of the best co-op games of all time', I thought, hell try out this game.  What a steaming pile of garbage this game is. It's crap graphics which is to be expected of any indie game. That's easy to look past though if the game has fun, interesting gameplay. Hell, even a great story might make it worthy of playing if the latter both fail.  This game has zero of any of these elements. It's not visually impressive. It's not fun or even catchy gameplay. There is zero story. What the ♥♥♥♥ were these critics smoking??  Jesus lord this game is ♥♥♥♥. Rarely have I ever played game with friends where all of us, in sync, gave up on a game. We reached this moment at about the 10 minute mark of playing this attrocity.   You know the PC gaming sector is sad when critics are acclaiming awful games like this as 'amazing'. ♥♥♥♥ me I wish Steam had a return policy.
9097	0	a	Eh, Some decent gameplay alot of indie-games that most people like would definitely buy this, So far i don't like the game because all you have to do is walk and pick up coins your teammates will pick up first as in my experience, So essentially that shotgun item you first pick up is useless, Thus why this game has a hard learning curve for new players.  Overall i wouldn't buy the game, I'm lucky i got it from someone else.
9098	0	a	this game is really awful dont waste your money
9099	0	a	Intresting game, but for me it was kinda weird and not that fun, visuals are cool though.
9100	0	a	Played for a couple hours. Beginning game doesn't require thinking or skill. I have yet to see what's enjoyable about this game.
9101	0	a	It seems to be a popular game, I am one for stealth games yet this one just did not click with me... I think the difficult to read top down view and the art style is what put me off.  Not bad but I can't recommend it.
9102	0	a	I can't really say I like it, but I don't hate it.
9103	0	a	One of the first games i returned.  I expected a 2D Payday but instead got a 'run-to-the-exit' game.  Also the art style gets old real fast. Just too damn blocky.  Also why is this game over and over listed on the front page of Steam every week? Thats what annoyed me enough to write this review.
9104	0	a	Like Ocean's Eleven on 8 bits. It's a cool concept and the history is OK. But the playability is horrible. Only the viewed field of view is colored and confuses a lot in the beginning. There could be other options of this kind of view. The game is good, but this thing killed the game.
9105	0	a	I have been looking forward to playing this game since I grabbed a copy during the Steam sale at Christmas. To say that I feel like I've been ripped off, even though this game only cost me £1.55 is an understatement.  The art style is nice, but it's not easy to see what's going on, and very confusing. I hate the idea of co-op play on any game, but this game is built around it. Also, there is never little in the way of telling you what to do, and what is going on. When you start a game for the first time you except a mini tutorial just to get you started and introduced to some of the basic game mechanics. No such luck here.  This game will live in my game library, and I doubt I'll ever fire it up again.
9106	0	a	Guards can shoot through walls. Enough said

9110	0	a	Great game, but it suddenly won't open up any more. Reinstallation and validating game files doesn't work either.
9111	0	a	This game is, without out a shadow of a doubt, one of the most boring games I have ever played. It should have a base price of $3.00, not $15.00. The gameplay is not as fast-paced as one would think a heist game would be. The story is mediocre and very stale. Even with friends, the game is still boring and tedious to play. If I could refund the six dollars I put into it, I would.  2/10 would not recommend.
9112	0	a	I was really excited to play this game after watching a let's play of it, but when I tried it out for myself it was pretty disappointing :(   There weren't really any clear rules to the game? You had an objective but the gameplay itself was pretty messy and it was difficult to work with other players. Even joining a game was rather confusing? The lack of instructions kinda surprised me and it really dampened the whole game. In addition to that, everything seemed really repetitive and was pretty boring &gt;__&lt; 
9113	0	a	Had rather high expectations about this game and unfortunately, they never reached that level. I think the biggest problem is the messy graphics thats becomes a big bowl of psychedelic effects when you are up to four players. But in the other hand, we probably play the game the wrong way as the game wanted us to play it. Instead of taking it easy so stressed we around in sheer panic. I will give it one more chance, but for now I can not recommend this game.
9114	0	a	There is literally no point in being stealthy. No rewards, no punishment. Not what I expected, sadly.
9115	0	a	this game is sexist because only one of thje characters is female and shes a cirminal wow way to potray women in a proper form ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. i do not recomend playing this game if u have any comon decensy.

9119	0	a	  A top-down heist with multiplayer! Was interesting to play with friends, but ultimately didn't hold very much interest. Some of the visual cues (like guard sight range) were a little unclear and when combined with a sparse tutorial I overall felt like I was thrown into the deep end too soon. I could see it being fun if everyone in the group put the work into becoming proficient though.
9120	0	a	I'd love to give this a legitimate review, but I was unable to progress in the game because literally everyone you join/get matchmade with will just leave if you're level 0 and don't know how to do anything.   Can't learn if you can't play. As such, can't recommend.
9121	0	a	this game is ♥♥♥♥
9122	0	a	Monaco is a work of LITERALLY UNPLAYABLE. The superb way the game is only multiplayer, the fact that there are no other players online, everything comes together to make what is certainly the most unplayable game of 2014.

9124	0	a	(after playing for 10 minutes) The visuals are interesting &amp; pleasing, but not intuitive. The animations/movements are smooth, but slow (I am impatient).

9126	0	a	Pretty boring.
9127	0	a	I don't know why people like this game. I found it mundane and graphically terrible.
9128	0	a	I wanted to like this game. I really did. I even enjoyed the beginning. What it really comes down to, though, is a lazy stealth game. There isn't a lot of thought involved. It's either way too easy, or else difficult to the point of poor design. The controls are somewhat clunky and there isn't a lot you can do. Maybe I am just spoiled by other, higher quality stealth games, but this one was a bit of a disappointment.
9129	0	a	Max doesn't like this game, don't buy it.
9130	0	a	this piece of ♥♥♥♥ game wont even open
9131	0	a	not enough shooting wtf am i even on here for im just gonna own people on cod 4 XD
9132	0	a	feel like i'm the only person in the world who doesn't like this game.  it's not that it's bad, it's just not my style. the presentation is great, the levels are varied and offer multiple approaches depending on the class you choose, but despite the overall quality it's just .. i dunno, boring?  i feel like if this came out back when 320x200 was a standard resolution i would've loved it. back when 8 bit stereo sound was AMAZEBALLS.  but it's not. so i don't  &lt;/3
9133	0	a	This seemed like an absolutely perfect game and perfect idea. Unfortunately, for me, in single or multiplayer it was just a boring repetitive mess. It was super well-liked and well-reviewed, but it just didn't work for me. I like heist games and stealth games, but this one just didn't work. The graphics, setting, and music are all my style. Something just left a bad taste in my mouth, even though I got through a good potion.
9134	0	a	Meh. 3/10.  Before I get a bunch of flak for giving a bad review after only playing .4 hrs, allow me to explain.  In my opinion, this is just Hotline Miami but less fun.  Hear me out.  The gameplay, from my experience, was slow and repetitive. (I played the first 3~4 missions)  Keep in mind, this is coming from someone who quit AC2 at the tutorial.  TL;DR: Got bored.  
9135	0	a	This should be the type of game I liked. I really enjoyed (and completed) Mark of the Ninja, so I should like Monaco. But I don't, I couldn't force myself to play it for long.  The terrible graphics weren't a problem. The missions were a bore. Possibly in multi-player it is enjoyable but in single player I can't recommend it.
9136	0	a	I got this game because it looked like it was going to be fun, but about and hour through the game, I couldn't take playing it anymore.  This was sadly a game that bore me to death. I felt like I just couldn't get into the game and I felt really let down when I thought that it was going to be cool  +Cheap +Average game mechanics +different classes  -Story/game bore me to tears -Mediocre level/graphic design  4.5/10  
9137	0	a	Score: 6/10  Well here I am again. A game I want to love and can't. It just bores me. It can be fun to play with friends, but I really didn't even like that very much. It just lacks some mechanics and polish in my opinion.
9138	0	a	Kinda boring, honestly. I tried to play this game twice with my buddy after work, and we found ourselves waking up at 4am... kinda mad that we wasted our free time sleeping.
9139	0	a	I've tried to play this more than once and I just can't get into it. I don't understand the hype behind this game at all.
9140	0	a	Sucks big BIG time!
9141	0	a	I found this 2D game to be of Atari quality. Very unstimulating, and there was a lack of online players to coop with.
9142	0	a	Uh well this game is ... ok for a few hours but then you realize that the sneaking around is not well thought out and you might as well just run and gun it.
9143	0	a	You just run toward exit ignoring weapons and guards. After 3rd mission we stopped playing.
9144	0	a	Okay just to clear this up I have been trying to fix the game for about almost 2days and ive had like 4hours sleep this is ♥♥♥♥ing ridiculous excuse my french. When you buy a game you expect it to run you know launch but nooooooo This game doesn't do that it simply doesn't do anything its getting on my nerves and when you have a Beats of a mashine Like mine its even worse.............................
9145	0	a	Rating Scale: Offensive Unfun  Fair  Good Enthusiastic  While I would not recommend Monaco, it's not that it's because it's a horrible game. The game play is well thought out, the story is okay, the Modding Community, last time I played was strong. That said, I just found the game boring, and needing multiplayer to be more interesting. I don't think I am the target audience, but I appreciated the story being told.  
9146	0	a	Score: 6/10  Well here I am again. A game I want to love and can't. It just bores me. It can be fun to play with friends, but I really didn't even like that very much. It just lacks some mechanics and polish in my opinion.
9147	0	a	You could always watch paint dry instead.
9148	0	a	Sort of visually messy and tedious to play. Not much variety. Much more enjoyable multiplayer, though.
9149	0	a	It was confusing and boring dont buy unless it is cheap 
9150	0	a	Having to rely on randoms players just makes this game bad,would refund if I could.
9151	0	a	It's... okay. I don't know, I got sucked in by the hype. I honestly just didn't really have much fun with this. My wife and I played through this some in co-op, thinking that this would be our new go-to game. But after two sessions or so, we just completely lost interest.
9152	0	a	I really like the concept, but the single player lacks some playability. You should be able to send more than one characters into the field and it should allow switching between them. Many maps are most probably perfect for multiplayer, though.  Mouse and keyboard input are incredibly laggy, no matter what I changed in the settings. It is so bad, that running into narrow corridors when being followed is nearly impossible. The real mouse curser is quite often visible together with the in-game courser. As are not at the same position, this is unbelievably annoying.  I had high hopes for this game, but am quite stunned by the bad input lag. This renders the game unplayable for me.  Too bad. Some more focussing on gameplay and not so much graphics would have made this brilliant.
9153	0	a	Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine was a weird pick for me. At first, I was browsing through games on sale and stumbled across this one. This looked fun and so I chose it. This game is about being sneaky and getting past guards so you are not caught while smuggling things or breaking out of jail. I do not enjoy this and I think you won't either. Personally, I think this game is not worth $14.99 at it's original cost, but when I got it on sale for $1.94, I believed it was worth it. It is not a fun game and it becomes rather tedious after about 2 hours of gameplay. It may be fun for the 1st part, but it really is just the same thing over and over to the finish. Of course, don't take it from me. I've just been watching youtube videos on it and I have only played for 2 hours so what do I know? But, I do know that if you payed $14.99 for it, you just wasted about 13 dollars on it. it's really not that good of a game for the price you pay for it... unless you got it on sale.

9155	0	a	While the gameplay is simple enough, I just don’t get entertained by this. The difficulty gets too hard very quickly, and the advantages of each character in each level aren’t obvious.  Overall, I don’t feel like playing it anymore after a couple hours.
9156	0	a	Never seems to be anyone online to play with. Not sure if this is a bug or lack of popularity but if it is a bug it needs to be fixed.  5/10 until fix.
9157	0	a	i think it is really boring and not worth the money
9158	0	a	I would go for The Masterplan instead if I were you. Monaco is frantic and arcade-style, while Masterplan is a bit more tactical and planning-focused. It's a matter of taste!
9159	0	a	I don't like this, but I don't really enjoy stealth games. Pretty much just the bare basics of a stealth game, and the story's ♥♥♥♥. Only buy this is you absolutely LOVE stealth gameplay.
9160	0	a	It's a great game in concept. The problem lies in the fact that single player isn't fun enough to even play through the game; and NO ONE PLAYS THIS GAME ONLINE ANYMORE. Without the Co-op, it's a real disappointment.
9161	0	a	Not fun. I have been trying to get a refund, I bought it for like $1.49 two years ago, but steam is being unreasonable about it. Not a big deal, but I didn't like this game at all. No one to play with, people online dont cooperate at all, from my very brief experience, and I have no friends who were willing to get this. Oh well. They can't all be winners.
9162	0	a	Every positive review of this game is spot-on, but I just didn't like it as much as I hoped.  I love 2d retro games, but Monaco (single player mode) quickly came to feel repetitive. The characters are actually very diverse, and the life system (losing one character allows continuing with a different one from the same stage) forces you to adapt and make long-term strategies.  But eventually every level felt like 'hide as long as you can, then run as fast as you can, then hide until they forget you. Rinse wash and repeat.'  The developers did a great job, but Monaco has made me wary of future purchases based just on cool graphics and a neat concept.
9163	0	a	Monaco is great for people who hate strategy games among friends. I'm sure it would be find for people who are OK with complete chaos, but we were not that group.   We're quite stunned that this game was as highly reccomended as it is. A more in-depth look into the reviews echos how people who up voted were excited that stealth wasn't a main requirement and highlighted how this game devolves into more of a 'Frantic' mess filled with confrontations.   Our group wished that it was much more clear what each ability did, as the tutorial was of little to no help.   Another 'fun' aspect, was how full-screen mode disabled task manager, so this program literally was a pain to close.   Thanks indie game companies, but please do more testing before releasing, and make a better tutorial.
9164	0	a	Theoretically this game is a planning, sneaking and making a successful casual heist for money together with your friends while communicating actively with each character supporting each other.  In reality this game is 30 seconds of walking around and trying to plan, and suddenly it's all chaos, running around finding hiding places, you loose track of your friends, if anyone chats or speaks over mic it's just 'what is happening' 'where are you' 'where do we go'. Quickly you just find yourself playing your own game, reviving friends, doing something that will hopefully help team to reach the goal... There isnt really much timing with your friends.  The game runs too fast to make strategic decisions. And maybe it was intended to be just casual or for youngsters on speed but if you are someone looking for some coop that requires using brains, I can't recommend it. Its very casual and maybe our expectations were too high for strategic team play.  Maybe we are just too bad in this game. I never quite fully grasped the enjoyment factor for this game. But it might be a good game for you, it´s not for old farts for sure.  Sometimes the teamplay does work, where you proceed together with your friends, but it doesn´t really stand much pressure and turns into solo too easy, where getting the pack together takes a lot of effort.
9165	0	a	An interesting little game. Single player is OK, but multiplayer co-op is where this one shines.   pros:   great co-op play deep gameplay (well....) if you can tell WTF is going on. (see below) re-playability is somewhat OK linux/SteamOS support  cons: -stupidly hard for no good reason -let's face it the graphics are complete crap. What century is it again? They look like early 80s sprites from a C-64. Sweet mother of mercy they're bad. Can we move to 8 bit at least? This faux retro graphics detract from what could have been an amazing game, lowering it to so-so status.  An exansion for this game should switch to 16 bit graphics. I dig retro styled games, but this is just rather sad. Most of the time I can't tell WTF is going on because the graphics are just that bad.   3/5 for garbage graphics I can hardly even GET anyone to consider despite the great gameplay. If Valve ever gives us a MEH rating, I'd pick that.
9166	0	a	Its very fun to play with friends, but if you don't have any friends to play with, its not very fun. Single player/Random matchmaking kinda sucks.
9167	0	a	You could always watch paint dry instead.

9170	0	a	This game is beautyfull but it's kinda boring
9171	0	a	Honestly, I can't recommend this game. The concepts and mechanics of the game are not immediatly clear, and once they become clear you start to realize that the game was almost entirely created for multiplay. Where this wouldn't normally be an issue, it becomes one when you sit in lobbies waiting for randoms to join, or you try to convince your friends to play only to find out they don't have access to the level you want to play. I like the concept of the game though, very 'clue' like and it was fun to play with a few friends over local multiplayer. But towards the end it becomes repetitive, I got bored real quickly and will likely only revisit it if someone asks me to play with them.
9172	0	a	An atrocious usage of the retro pixel art with confusing game mechanics, Most of the time I had no idea what I'm doing except follwoing my co-op partners. The only good part about it was the colorful design...
9173	0	a	Not really very fun. Kinda confusing and boring and I don't know what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on because there's no tutorial or anything on how to play.
9174	0	a	Playing this game coop is not fun. The baffling art style makes sur eyou have no idea who is who, and anything but isngleplayer makes the game become one huge mess. I suppose I can see the appeal, but in my opinion, I don't see how this game is so critically acclaimed. I'm only glad I bought it on sale rather than full price.  Avoid this game.

9179	0	a	I can't tell what the heck is going on.
9180	0	a	This game is beautyfull but it's kinda boring
9181	0	a	This game performs the cardinal sin of making you replay large chunks of levels when you die, up to 45 minutes worth of your life that you'll never get back. The second time this happened to me (in a sneaking game, where you are super fragile, no less), I was ready to flip a table and/or never launch Monaco again.
9182	0	a	To be honest I didn't get this game at first. I selected a character (role) and waited for ages for it to determine when everyone was ready. Then after that I spent a minute looking at an image. I couldn't tell if the game was loading or just froze.  After playing a couple of games, I got the hang of the game and didn't really like it. I didn't feel like the I was playing with a team of people, just some other people randomly running around the map with me.  I don't know if I could select a different server, but at times the lag just made the game almost impossible to play.  I cannot recommend this game for anyone.
9183	0	a	Good game overall but will get a bit booring over time gameplay is smooth but has occasional lag due to the game not my gaming computer! Personally not enjoyed much but I think just a small amount of people will enjoy this. Overall I give this game a 4/10.. Hope this helped : )
9184	0	a	not worth $15.00 but if your bored try it
9185	0	a	if this game will be free, will be most popularity .
9186	0	a	No pls.. WTF is that s***t?
9187	0	a	I ♥♥♥♥ing hate this game
9188	0	a	This is a perfect example of style over substance. Don't play that game, it's boring and not even original for indie standard. It's basically an old school Metal Gear shoehorned with some awkward coop. not fun.
9189	0	a	I personaly do not like games that are meant for multiplayer. And as a Off-line Single player, it does not work that well. I´m assuming it´s a lot better with people. Noth my thing thou.
9190	0	a	Tried to play the game but it doesn't connect to the servers when I choose the first mission. It's just a crappy 2D steath game that doesn't need internet connection or servers to play some single player maps. So the game doesn't work for me, though it look fun
9191	0	a	This game has great content and a great editor. If you just want the game for only the campaign and the story line then this game is great for you. If you want to be able to download player-made maps and make your own map, then don't get this game. Whenever you make a map, the map gets corrupted if you don't make it correctly and you will have to restarted the entire game. Whenever you download a player-made map, the same thing will happen. Hopefully they fix this somehow. Bugs aside Monaco is a great campagin coop game and has a great storyline.
9192	0	a	I'll be a bit of a lonely voice in the middle of a lot of enthusiasts but I do admit I found the game a bit overrated. After reading so many claims saying 'oh my god, this is the best Co-Op game EVER' I gave this a spin and I was sorely disappointed. The game IS quite fun... for a little while. It actually quickly gets quite tedious, especially due to some of the base mechanics (like guards that wake up all the time, so you end up always bringing a Cleaner with you). It's a nice little game that will definitely have an appeal to some very specific people, but at large I'd avoid it unless at budget price.
9193	0	a	Would have been a fun game if the guys didn't speak French
9194	0	a	3/5  A top-down class-based stealth action game with a focus on co-op that oozes style.

9199	0	a	It could be me not playing the game as it is meant to, but that's to be expected without any sort of tutorial. In coop this game seems to be a complete anarchy without a real way of cooperating with other people. I bough it for some fun two player coop experience, but it's been such a repetitive and chaotic disappointment in the short time I played it that I do not really know if I am willing to give it another chance.
9200	0	a	Didn't like it, didn't get it. Concept is cool. Game rules are cool. But they don't translate well into the gameplay, imho, resulting in a confusing non-fun experience. For me. The Maw, Trine... now these are fun! (though obviously completely different type of games)
9201	0	a	Coop review: I'd love to recommend this game, but everytime I have tried to play it with friends (the only reason I got it), we've been unable to communicate, play or enjoy it due to severe lagging. We can't fix the problem from our end, so until this is adressed by the developers, I can't recommend it to anyone else looking for a little coop game.
9202	0	a	Playing this game coop is not fun. The baffling art style makes sur eyou have no idea who is who, and anything but isngleplayer makes the game become one huge mess.

9207	0	a	monaco was very dissapointing. in the singleplayer you can barely do anything because of the class system. in multiplayer its too easy because you can do everything. people you know out only stay knocked out for a very short time. guards can bring other dead guards back to life. making a run and gun approach (which is an option in most levels) almost impossible. and it gets very repetitive fast
9208	0	a	Immediately upon launching the game from Steam gives an error message stating to 'restart Monaco via Steam to play online, etc.'   It doesn't tell you that you must turn on Steam Cloud. This game will not work online, give achievements, or tie into Steam unless Steam Cloud is activated. Users are forced to use Steam Cloud just so one single game can work the way its supposed to, which is completely broken from a programming standpoint. If you're too lazy to code a working game / API that works as advertised then you get a thumbs down. I haven't even played the game yet. I've wasted 45 minutes trying to sort this out. I don't tolerate ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like this.
9209	0	a	For Mac users wanting to play this gem of a game with a Sony controller be aware that the advertised 'full controller support' is a lie on our platform, at least that's the case for my trusty DualShock 3 which usually works like a charm on OSX Yosemite...  Dear Pocketwatch Games *please* let us normal OSX HID gaming controller folks have a good time as well (most other indies manage to do it as well!)
9210	0	a	So.. I tried this game a bit. Wasn't as fun as watching people play it. I played with friends and they couldn't get into it either. I can't recommend it, but there's nothing wrong with the game, it's just boring. So if it's your kinda game, you might like it.

9219	0	a	Ok...  So this is sad...  This is like Flappy Bird in the sense that it's fun to play say 2 or 3 times but after that it turns into the ugliest game that you have ever played. You begin to think to yourself, why did I waste money on this game?   WHEN I'M GOING TO SPEND A COUPLE OF MINUTES PLAYING IT AND THEN ANOTHER COUPLE OF MINUTES TRYING TO GET MY MONEYS WORTH!!!!!!  I'll save you some money by saying, don't buy it.  Thank you, enjoy not playing Monaco.
9220	0	a	2D top down stealth game. Graphics are (intentionally) bad but don't capture any retro feelings as well. This game is one of those that is best played with friends, if played single it feels slow, boring and tedious. Mechanics are very basic and it plays like a flash game.
9221	0	a	was fun for the first few minutes i guess
9222	0	a	Pros: cool idea of a game online coop  Cons: boring too expensive 
9223	0	a	♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥
9224	0	a	This game urgently needs more documentation and help for first-time players. At the moment it drops you in at the deep end, online, with people who quit the moment they realise you don't know what's going on, which you don't because it has no tutorial, and the menu tab that purports to offer Help And Options only has the latter.
9225	0	a	requires another player (found via matchmaking) to play any portion of the game. not even tutorial is accessible solo. 0/10 do not buy  i had to leave the game open for 5 minutes to be able to write this review. it only took 2 minutes to change settings and find out that there's no single player function
9226	0	a	NOTE: This review is just to inform people who plan on buying this game now. TL;DR is: Dont buy it.   This game is out of date by now, and worse yet its just too big for flash to handle. The game has moved over to Afterbirth, Which is the far smoother running, more expansive and currently supported replacement. If you were looking to get this instead, I recommend you don't because it most likely will run like crap.  EDIT: Since it's evidentally not clear in my review, Afterbirth is not a sequal... it's an addon to the remake (rebirth) using something other than flash. Since flash couldn't handle the original. You will still get all the same story elements by playing afterbirth. Afterbirth of course includes Rebirth which is the base game.
9227	0	a	The Binding of Isaac is a great game. It is very replayable and addictive, and the random elements make every run a little bit different. Wrath of the Lamb only expands on this, and makes the game even better than it was before. I would give it a positive rating...  If not for Flash.  Flash ruins this game. The performance is about as stable and reliable as a one-legged mountain goat, and the game is rife with bugs. The only graphical settings are the nondescript 'Low, Medium, High', and the game is locked to a certain resolution. There is no controller support, and your progress gets wiped if you clear Flash memory. If you want to play Isaac, just wait for Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, a remake that not only gets rid of Flash but also expands on the game.
9228	0	a	I personally never understood all the hype for this game.  The controls and stuff are very simple and pretty fun. If you want to do well though, you kind of have to study the wiki to figure out what items even do. I've spent more time on the wiki than the game which kind of takes away from the game.  
9229	0	a	It was the Winter Sale and everyone was all aboard the hype train. Choo Choooo! I jumped on board. But after hours and hours of playing, I have to say, this is what Extra Credits was talking about when they spoke about the difference between a challenging game and a punishing game. In a challenging game, one is forced to rely on skill, sometimes within a steep learning curve, but there's a high risk reward factor because you know if you do a good job, put in the time and effort to get better, make the smarter calls, you will be rewarded with greater success. There is a system to master, not game or exploit, but master- and when you manage to, you feel like the Master. In a punishing game, like so, you can in one run through be given 2 power ups per room and 2 spiders to defeat per room or NO power ups for 6 straight levels, 8 monsters per room, and every chest gives you multiple bombs that chase you until they explode. Because the effects of the same actions can produce such varying results, the overall feeling over time is that your actions aren't what matters.  The end result for me is that instead of feeling challenged, I feel Punished for playing. I might as well have enjoyed rolling a die. To its credit, this has better graphics than just rolling a die and lots of kooky 3spooky5me atmosphere to immerse itself in, good music, and decent controls. But I don't really care if it's a high-spec 120 fps HD sensory feast factory. If the end result is still that it's all a crap shoot, that half the time I should just restart until I get a better first few levels, then there comes a painful awareness the more one plays that the outcome has less to do with me than with all those die rolls.
9230	0	a	note: I played this mostly offline, and have put considerably more than 4 hours into it.  I know it's not a popular opinion, but I really don't like the Binding of Isaac. There are a lot of things to like about it, most notably the wonderfully grotesque design, but I personally hate the core mechanics. I really really tried to love it (largely because it was a game that was easy to play on the bus), but eventually gave up.  Ok, so Binding of Isaac is a rogue-like, so we already know you're going to be dying and restarting a lot. That doesn't bother me. What does bother me is that you don't get better with each subsequent death. There's no lineage system or inventory hold over that helps you make a little more progress with each new game, you are just literally starting from scratch each time. And the controls are not complicated, so there isn't even an element of mastering the game's mechanics as progression.  And then there's other major design decision that I hate, the complete randomness. Procedurally generated games can be a ton of fun and help to keep things interesting, but your success in each run of this game is largely decided before you even leave the first room. The enemies being random is great, it keeps things from being rote. However, the power-ups being random is a huge problem because of the disparity between them. Power-ups can be utterly worthless, or god-tier, and you never know what you're going to go get. But because your previous attempts don't have any impact, you're relying entirely on the much necessary power-ups, which are sometimes just going to be useless.  One of my best runs was actually one of my first. In one of the first rooms I picked up a power-up that just devastated every enemy I came across. I've never been that lucky again. I enjoy challenging games, but there needs to be some sort of progression either through leveling or mastery of the mechanics, and Binding of Isaac has neither. There are of course going to be minor improvements to how you play, but for the most part, your 100th attempt has just as much chance of success as your 2nd attempt, and it's going to be based on what procedural roll you got. While this clearly doesn't deter most people, I find it to be an uninteresting set of mechanics that generally lead to wasting time on a run that was doomed to fail.
9231	0	a	How the 21st century PC game can lack controller support ? Great game but absolute pain to play with keyboard.  If you are ready to struggle with controls buy it, if not then avoid.
9232	0	a	Isaac is an accurate visual representation of me watching this game be praised so highly. A weeping, babbling, infant with social issues who lashes out at all of the literal pieces of feces around me using the power of emotion.
9233	0	a	hey this game is super good. But dont buy it because its second game rebirth is so much better so buy it instead.
9234	0	a	I suppose you could buy the game if you wanted 100% BoI completion, however, due to Rebirth and the Afterbirth DLC, there is literally no point in buying the game because all the content is in the remastered version. Other than that I still wouldn't recommend because it is a laggy flash game, with no built-in controller support and a lack of crucial settings. I can't even choose my screen resolution.  Just buy Rebirth, which is a fantastic Rogue Like game with tons of replayability.
9235	0	a	Listen. This game is great, there's no lie. But there is a much better remake, already with it's own DLC (and possibly another on the way) that runs incredibly smoother, has Steam Cloud support, working achievements, a ton more content, as well as this and this game's DLC's content, and a new soundtrack.  If you can't afford Rebirth/Afterbirth, then wait until a sale comes along, because this game stutters terribly on a GOOD PC.  Final rating: 9/10, but remake is 10/10
9236	0	a	This game WAS amazing until they stopped supporting it (perhaps only on Mac). On my laptop gameplay got extremely choppy and laggy, and I am running it on a very new computer, well above the required specs. This magically happened around the time Rebirth was put out. Great game, but don't bother with this version when Rebirth includes most of the same gameplay and more.
9237	0	a	Default keyboard control scheme is bad for left-handers. And you can't change it.  There's no support for gamepad, thus aiming to shot monsters with a Xbox Gamepad analog stick doesn't work well (through JoyToKey).
9238	0	a	You don't have to get this game, just get Rebirth, it's just better. Honestly it's a waste of money unless you don't have rebirth.
9239	0	a	it's decent for a short period of time, but mostly frustrating that you can't finish the game - even with perfect game play there's too much left to chance to guarantee successful run through.
9240	0	a	I have a couple of dozen games that were so bad I've created a garbage category (garbage is polite) and stopped playing them in minutes. Some I can't review since I haven't even put in the required 5 minutes they were so bad.  I must have missed something, I just don't get why people like this game.
9241	0	a	I love BOI rebirth but the originals flash based limitations are to Mitch to bear for me. I can't get a playable frame rate in most rooms as well. I however recommend it as a game as the mechanics are interesting and fun. This ones Not for me though
9242	0	a	Why would you not add Xbox 360 Controller Support by Default?
9243	0	a	I know this game is a hit, so my opinion goes against the grain. It was great in its time but now the genre has evolved.   The reason I don't recommend it is because its a little plain compared to other games in the similar style. For a fun twin-stick shooter, I prefer Enter the Gungeon. Rooms have more interesting shapes, and that alone makes for a more interesting experience.

9246	0	a	This is one of those games I wish Steam offered a thumbs sideways on. A thumbs down feels dishonest as there is a lot of fun in the game but the difficulty is just too high since every time you die you have to start over at the beginning and as the levels are completely random the difficulty curve is somewhat all over the place. The game is very much a trial and error to understand what anything does though certainly if you're wanting a game with a challenge it's not so high as to keep me ever wanting to play it again. Some of the powers and abilities are extremely useful which makes not having one or a particular one you're wanting up the difficulty.
9247	0	a	ENG:  Most a worst game &amp; game series, what im ever played!  The game is just too unusual and disgusting, and is therefore not to my taste.  I do not recommend.   FIN:  Yksi huonnoimmista peleistä ja peli sarjasta, jota olen ikinä pelanut.  Peli vain on liian epätavallinen sekä kuvottava ja ei ole näin ollen minun makuuni.  En voi suositella.
9248	0	a	I had a positive review, changing it because of the eternal update.  Eternal update is definitely hard, but not in a good way. Runs based not on skill, but on just plain luck pretty much took all the fun out of it for me. This was the only game in my whole library I had 100% of the achievements for, and now that's no longer the case because I don't have the sanity nor the patience to finish hard mode, and I refuse to use cheat engine.  6/10 too much artificial difficulty.
9249	0	a	I really enjoyed BoI, but I can't recommend it. It's just that this game, even though it's amazing, is so inferior compared to BoI:Rebirth.  BoI:Rebirth has more content and is in my honest opinion a better gaming experience than BoI.  Also at the current state (2015-11-05) there are issues with Flash, which causes the game to lag
9250	0	a	As someone who enjoys roguelikes, this is one of the worst roguelike games I've ever played. I really wanted to like it, but the story was dry, the difficulty level was gratuitous (not challenging, just irritating for the sake of being irritating), the mechanics were carelessly mashed together, and the theme was tasteless and unpleasant. I don't know what else to say other than I'm profoundly disappointed after all the rave reviews. This game gets a 4/10.
9251	0	a	Would be good if my fps didnt suddenly drop all the way down every single time I entered a new room
9252	0	a	I played “The Binding of Isaac years ago on Xbox 360, and apparently I got it again for cheap in a Humble Bundle. I can understand the joy of mastering a game, but the core gameplay of “The Binding of Isaac just doesn’t draw me in.  Sometimes I’ll die on the first or second boss, other times I’ll defeat them. That major difference is almost entirely decided by “Did the right random item spawn beforehand? Boss fights are made easier if you go into their room with full health, but the close-quarters nature of the game means that you’re constantly getting hurt. If I were a lot better at the game I would get used to these issues, but I don’t have very much fun playing it, so my skills will stay at an amateur level.  Plenty of difficult, good games have slaughtered me yet hooked me to play more and improve (Spelunky as another Roguelike, and Dark Souls), but The Binding of Isaac failed to do that.  The Binding of Isaac has a lot of strange items and secrets, but those aren’t worth the struggle and boredom IMO.
9253	0	a	I'm not really one for roguelike top-downs. This review is heavily biased. For the little time I played this game I still have to find joy.
9254	0	a	Laggy, Made in flash, and repetitive. Try Rebirth instead.
9255	0	a	Laggy, Made in flash, and repetitive. Try Rebirth instead.
9256	0	a	I wouldn't recommend this game as of now because of rebirth being out, but if you feel like going back to what started, more power to you.
9257	0	a	while fun, it has not aged well, compared to the far superior Rebirth
9258	0	a	I've played this game a bit here and a bit on console. It just never clicked for me. Levels are random, powerups are cryptic, combat is frustrating, and death is permanent. If you really like the gameplay, you can keep playing forever. I got tired after a few hours.
9259	0	a	wouldn't reccomened buying this is you have afterbirth because for one afterbirth is a expansion to this. It looks better (opinion) and also the difficulty in vanilla isaac is pretty high compared to rebirth
9260	0	a	Locked at 30 fps. I do not approve.
9261	0	a	This might be the most overrated game of all time. The shooting mechanics are terrible, the art is terrible, most of this game is terrible just don't terrible terrible no terrible.
9262	0	a	There's a 'remake' out for this game with more content that runs better. I don't see a reason to revisit this one outside of maybe the non-pixelated graphics.
9263	0	a	The permadeath system combined with the extreme difference in the randomized item giving, makes the game to hard and puts a strain on the fun that the game also gives. I don't mind that you can't save all the time, but this is too much. The extreme randomizing means that many playthroughs are basically lost from the start and time being wasted instead of having fun, not just because given items aren't very good, but you can end up not having any items for the first couple of levels, for example due to items room being locked and no keys being found. Many fun aspects of the game, but the difficulty is to frustrating.  PS: My negative vote is a 'light negative', some players will undoubtedly enjoy the game, just make sure you consider yourself one of those player-types before you buy it.
9264	0	a	The Binding of Isaac: Wrath of the  Lich King  Lamb, henceforth refered to as 'BOY' for convenience and amusement. Let me say from the get go that if you intend to buy this game, get the DLC as well: it adds a significant amount of variety to the gameplay.  But before getting ahead of myself, BOY is a pretty standard twin-stick bomberman-arena'ed randomized-stuff shooter of sorts. Notice how I purposefully avoided using the word 'rogue-like', since while it does share rogue-like elements it is not fair to call this a roguelike at all: being a rogue-like implies startegy, and BOY can only manage to give you choice... when it's having a good day.  BOY features a boy who is deprived of everything by a fundamentalist-religious mother and somewhat borrows minimalistically from the religious tale of Isaac's sacrifice for the purpose of premise. In reality, you are a boy wandering through the most amazingly large basement full of spiders, aborted babies and embodiments of sin.   Gameplay, as a twin-stick shooter, features the main character litterally crying tears against the nightmarish things that were locked in the basement. There's treasure that more often than not are stat sticks, increasing max health, damage, tear range or tear flux. There's treasure that passively grants abilities, such as a poor dead cat that when you get hit spawns friendly flies that will attack the enemies or irritable bowl beans that cause surrounding enemies to become poisoned if you get hurt. There's also treasure that is actively used, with an interesting twist on how to refill charges based on number of rooms visited; this is arguably the most 'strategic' BOY gets, and even then you still have to get lucky with what treasures you'll find in your run.   Some of the boss fights feel a little unfair, even if you know them like you would yourself, however. Between the last fight in the game (on either path) which requires an insane amount of luck with the items you got while reaching it to have a minimal chance of winning and every random pot shot of green blobs that some enemies and bosses much enjoy spewing, passing through the 'bullet hell' genre of unlikely dodges with nearly no reaction time allowed, some boss fights are pure and simply not really balanced, in my opinion. I for one especially hate Gurdy (or some such name, I can't remember it off the top of my head), the abortion that ♥♥♥♥♥ itself on the floor and charges at you; if you're not in a good spot when he starts charging, it can get messy really quick. And when you get two Gurdys in the same room? Yeah, absolutely not cool.  Now seems about a good time as any to mention that a lot of the developer's views and disturbed mind come across a subliminally conveyed message against religion and nihillistic views on life that gets more obvious the more you play the game and unlock endings. To illustrate, at one point you have to fight your mother and the next boss is your mother's heart, which can't mean anything other than symbolically killing your mother no matter how you see it.  So, what do I think of the game? If you don't think about it too deeply, as well you shouldn't for your own sake, BOY is just another twin stick shooter. The reason it got famous was because of the developer's previous title Super Meat Boy (see why I wanted to stick with BOY instead of BoI at the beggining?), and the amount of astronomical fame it brought as a game that was initially absolutely free to play over the Internet. But do I like twin-stick shooters? No, I really don't. I will concede that it was entertaining to some degree, and it was always fun to unlock some new item or deeper location, and pretty much the only reason I kept playing it was for the 100% clear. Which I have got, significantly sooner than I'd hope and sooner than I expected to get the achievements for 'no damage taken on depth X'. Incidentally, it bugs me that Steam decided to award me the '100% achievement achievement' and the 'clear the womb taking no damage' (you heard it right: you're inside your mother's sexual organs, because of this twistedly sick nihilistic prick that is the developer) in the wrong order; Golden God would look cool as the most recent achievement when browsing on my games list, a naked Isaac smiling like he couldn't be prouder doesn't look anywhere near as cool or even something you'd want to see.  Bottom line, should you buy it? Sure, if you like twin-stick shooters go ahead. Keep in mind the frustration of randomness not being kind to you. Do I recommend you buy it? Nope. It's on the cheap side, granted, but you'll waste more time playing the game than you'd like in hindsight, and leaving it unfinished will feel like a huge waste.
9265	0	a	Graphic engine totally outdated, no controller support. Cannot recommend this, when the next versions of this game are far superior.
9266	0	a	The game use to be fun but Has refused to run no matter what fix I try, had it since i first got steam and its not had any problems until the eternal damnation came out so sadly i have to rate this a thumbs down
9267	0	a	Paid 99 cents for this, immediately upgraded to Rebirth. It's A LOT better.
9268	0	a	this game is awful
9269	0	a	100% overrated  
9270	0	a	Got this in a bundle.  I don't get it. It's a flash game with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mouse controls.
9271	0	a	Judging by the reviews there is a lot to like about this game, which there is, but only if you're into the gameplay on offer. The Binding of Isaac is a series of random dungeons where the goal is to collect upgrades/loot and defeat bosses to proceed. There is no progression or saving. You have one chance to beat the game otherwise it's restarting from the beginning. The hardcore difficult is appealing to many, but for soft and casual players like me it's off putting  This isn't Rebirth, it's a budget game that you should buy on sale if you want a creative, interesting, and thoroughly challenging experience,  however  I would highly recommend getting Rebirth instead
9272	0	a	im sorry to say its not as good as rebirth and i would like it better if rebirth was DLC
9273	0	a	extremely laggy the newer versions of this game cost more but are worth it and never lag so i dont recommend getting this game
9274	0	a	why no have daily?/ 
9275	0	a	Just an overrated ripoff of a single part of first Legend of Zelda. Seems like filling it with blood and ♥♥♥♥ works. Anyway this one really sucks anyway: ripped off idea and implementation is really poor -- developers even can't make it work with gamepads and are proud of it -- menu suggests player to google some third-party software. Devs really need to google how to stick their hands out of ther asses and start making games.
9276	0	a	In the first few tries in this game youll feel great but soon after you'll forget aabout it unless you like dungoen crawl games.

9278	0	a	It's not as good as you'd think
9279	0	a	I have no idea why everybody gushes about this game, it's crap. Strip away the grimdark and the slighty better than usual indie-♥♥♥♥ graphics and you've got an extremly shallow dungeon-crawler / shooter that wouldn't be much out of place gameplay wise on the Atari 2600, which similarly uses it's difficulty as a cruch for it's lack of solid gameplay. Also the 'go google joy2key' gamepad support is beyond lazyness from the devs (joy2key is not a free product)
9280	0	a	I'd recommend you get the remastered version, Rebirth. It's well worth the extra money? Why? This was coded in Flash. There's much less items, and the game's overall very choppy.
9281	0	a	I don't understand the appeal of this game. The gameplay is so simple and repetitive I started to get bored 10 minutes into it. To make it even worse how well you do is entirely dependent on what power-ups you get. The atmosphere is very dull, nothing but mildly unsettling enemies and poop everywhere.
9282	0	a	&gt;Controller only game &gt;Controller support options: Go use xpadder (google it) &gt;Wtf is this
9283	0	a	After about an hour of trying I still cant get the game to work with my controller and steamlink. As a result I can't recommend this game.
9284	0	a	Flash based game, it ran slowly on max settings due to coding problems. My Pc is 4x requirements for all of it's specs. Do not recommend.
9285	0	a	I just don't see the attraction. pointlessly sick and depressing. If that's your cup of tea, enjoy! I regret buying this.
9286	0	a	Great game, but the remake is better:   http://store.steampowered.com/app/250900/ 
9287	0	a	Disgusting, frustrating and not nearly as edgy or clever as it thinks it is. Ooh, take that, fundamentalist Christians. Never heard that one before. It's a roguelike, so it's a bunch of randomly generated levels that may or may not be reasonable or fun to complete. This is the laziest form of game design, and I'm disappointed to see it becoming so popular. The humor, such that it is, is incredibly juvenile, and most of it makes no broader satirical point, so there's no weight to it. I picked this up because it was so highly recommended, and I wish I hadn't. I'm a little upset that Steam won't refund my money for it, to be honest. I'd steer clear of this one. It's like a bad flash game writ large.

9290	0	a	really needs custom announcer packs but ok for now i guess
9291	0	a	i don't remember buying this game
9292	0	a	another overrated indie game.. i will never understand the high ranking reviews and very good reception overall among critics and gamers. for me such games have absolutely nothing to keep you playing, trying, whole concept is extremely primitive and uninteresting. if this was tha last game on earth, what the hell why not, but since there are thousands wonderful games around, both new and old, long and short, i find not a single reason why to bother with this. not recommended
9293	0	a	Nope. Just no. Buy Rebirth instead.
9294	0	a	While I see the apeal of this game if your not into dunguon crawlers hugely then this might not be the best for you.
9295	0	a	IT WONT LEMME PLAY &gt;:( (anymore)
9296	0	a	I have not played the game very much, because it is too difficult to set up a controller in it. The game just write 'google it' in option. I have helped to make two very small games and we could figure out how to get the controllers to work in our game, without people had to google it! I could not play the game with keyboard (got quick sore hands) because I grew up with gaming consoles.  I like the graphics and the freaky story, but the trouble with the controller turn it in into a negative experience for me. (If you prefer the keyboard over a controller, then you can turn my review into a positive one.)
9297	0	a	The game is good but when they released the rebirth and afterbirth this game is ♥♥♥♥ :D
9298	0	a	Okay, I get that the rooms are randomly generated, but what's the hype aorund this game? It's really nothing special.
9299	0	a	The most ferocious monster in the game is the poor optimization.  Every monster causes framerate drops.  Without a high end gaming computer, this game is unplayable.
9300	0	a	How does one return a game. 
9301	0	a	terrible. barely functional and abandoned.
9302	0	a	Arcadey randomized power-ups, limited health, perma-death, and funny/dark theming. It's really good at what it intends to be, so get it if you like this sort of thing, but if you are, like me, someone who was on the fence. . . well, I don't like it.
9303	0	a	really bad with the steam controller!
9304	0	a	Gets boring don't pay full price if it's like 2 bucks sure go on and add it to your cart but if not... eh it's not worth it
9305	0	a	This is a great roguelike game totally ruined by the fact it uses Flash. No matter how fast your processor is, fps will drop. the controls will become less responsive, and you will not be able to dodge another projectile hurled at you or another monster trying to hit you. And, of course, fps will drop when there are many objects on the screen.  Buy The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth and Afterbirth instead. That game has a different engine with stable 60 fps and a ton more content.
9306	0	a	If youre a self-mutalating masochist, who somehow enjoys torturing yourself, with the idea, intent or prospect of playing a game, but instead, secretly or subconsciously, enjoys a game playing you into submission, then this game is for you.  Think Im joking? Really Im not. Its either that or too many kids/people these days dont know what the hell really makes a good game any more. This game has sooo many Pos reviews, it has to be one of the above reasons why this game has so many Pos reviews.   I usualy trust that a game with so many good reviews HAS to, just HAS to have some pretty good stuff to it to merrit such acclaim...but this game...is just a joke.  Random generated in a game can be a good thing. This game is just too random...so much so that skill has 99% nothing to do with it &amp; really just comes down to pure, blind, dumb luck on what items &amp; enemies youll find each &amp; every play through.  I wanted to like this game. It can be fun for a little while...IF &amp; BIG IF, youre lucky enough to get decent pre-gened levels &amp; items. Even then your luck can run out half-way through &amp; youre screwed &amp; die for no good reason with all progress lost &amp; nothing gained.  Im writing this review in pure disgust &amp; anger atm, hence the tone if it. Theres a difference between a game being hard-core &amp; difficult &amp; requiring skill to get better at it...&amp; then there is this game which has NONE of those qualities. Its for those reasons &amp; the fact that so many people seem to enjoy being punished with no real rewards that Im venting as I am. That &amp; a game should not leave you feeling plssed off &amp; cheated after playing it. This game does just that.  Take some time to read some of the other negative reviews for more, less colorful &amp; in-depth info on what Im talking bout. For now, Im done with this game. F*ck this game, Hulk Smash &amp; rage quit.
9307	0	a	I hate rogue-likes and this is just... oooohhh this is a frustrating one.  I know people enjoy this game, but I can't put my finger on why, honestly. It's crude, gross, heavy-handed and just... eh. All I get is angry and frustrated at the game when I get a bad run of luck and that's about all this game is: trying to make do with bad luck that comes your way and mashing restart when you die.  When I finally did beat Mom the first time I didn't get a massive triumph so much as I did a feeling of 'finally, now I can move on to something better.'  To fans: you keep enjoying it, I'm glad you do. I just can't find any reason to recommend it myself.  -------------------------- (Edit for further explanation)  As I said, I don't really care for roguelikes. The one I've enjoyed the most was probably Realm of the Mad God, mostly because I could play with friends, which made the more range-inducing bits of dying to a danmaku pattern and having to restart 20 mintues of progress less frustrating.  BoI hinges on three things: do you like the dark, gross anti-humor of the game, do you like danmaku, do you not mind getting screwed over by RNG. If so: great! This game's great and hope you enjoy yourself. I am not that kind of person. The humor feels like it's trying to hard to be 'edgy', the RNG is infuriating (yes, even for a Roguelike), and it makes me feel like the 'challenge' is mostly down to 'Did you get decent items?'  Sure: the game is challenging even if you DO get good items; most of the extenuating challenge comes from danmaku patterns and clever use of limited resources to (try to) mitigate bad luck. Hell, I'm a casual fan of the Touhou series, so I've got no qualms with 'this boss/enemy is tough' or 'this pattern requires very precise movement to dodge'. That's a good point of the game: you screw up and it's on YOU. However, it's equally likely you'll get screwed over by items and, despite how well you play, you'll waste your time.  As a final note, if you're looking at this version, and it DOES interest you: go grab the re-release 'Rebirth' which has updated graphics, items, music, and (from what I've heard from friends) is generally an all-around same-but-better-polish experience.

The one I've enjoyed the most was probably Realm of the Mad God, mostly because I could play with friends, which made the more range-inducing bits of dying to a danmaku pattern and having to restart 20 mintues of progress less frustrating.  BoI hinges on three things: do you like the dark, gross anti-humor of the game, do you like danmaku, do you not mind getting screwed over by RNG. If so: great! This game's great and hope you enjoy yourself. I am not that kind of person. The humor feels like it's trying to hard to be 'edgy', the RNG is infuriating (yes, even for a Roguelike), and it makes me feel like the 'challenge' is mostly down to 'Did you get decent items?'  Sure: the game is challenging even if you DO get good items; most of the extenuating challenge comes from danmaku patterns and clever use of limited resources to (try to) mitigate bad luck. Hell, I'm a casual fan of the Touhou series, so I've got no qualms with 'this boss/enemy is tough' or 'this pattern requires very precise movement to dodge'. That's a good point of the game: you screw up and it's on YOU. However, it's equally likely you'll get screwed over by items and, despite how well you play, you'll waste your time.  As a final note, if you're looking at this version, and it DOES interest you: go grab the re-release 'Rebirth' which has updated graphics, items, music, and (from what I've heard from friends) is generally an all-around same-but-better-polish experience.
9309	0	a	the game seems nice at first but its a waste of cash if you want the good one buy the rebirth then buy the dlc afterbirth and buy the other dlc
9310	0	a	 Good luck finding an actual serious review here, lol. I recently just came back to read a useless pile of text I gave on this game AGES ago and feel I should at least write something way more helpful and meaningful to make up for that, just in case people are actually still buying this game and want more info to go on. As much as I want to make this review unobjective as possible I just can't cas it creeped me out WAY to much, so yea take it lightly and take into account many other reviews before making a decision please, that's how you do it, one review/experience is never enough to fully understand what a game is.  And as always my reviews are NOT reviews in the typical sense, the word 'review' has almost lost all meaning on steam, just look at how many useless reviews there are on most games and how many are actually just jokes and you will see what I mean. Anyway take my 'reviews' how you want to cas I don't even know what to call them, written first impressions? experience reviews? Feedback reviews? Concluding notes? None of them are coined terms so I dunno.    Why I did not enjoy this game at all:  &gt; Incredibly disturbing &gt; Way to basic gameplay &gt; Uninteresting art style &gt; Absurdly repetitive &gt; Makes you feel really... depressed =( &gt; Will probably keep you up at night &gt; Unfair death and progress system &gt; Relies way to much on random luck just to win &gt; Some enemies are to predictable while some are just so unfair &gt; Odd game pacing &gt; Rooms are way to small and restrictive &gt; No difficulty setting for those that just want to have fun   Basic conclusion:
9311	0	a	This game has a lot of replayability, but I didn't find myself wanting to replay it. I kind of wish I could post a neutral review. After a couple of playthroughs, the game becomes a bit tiring.
9312	0	a	Don't. Just get Rebirth and then the Afterbirth DLC. It's not worth it.
9313	0	a	stupid baby game worst game EVER
9314	0	a	0/10 put in more blood

9316	0	a	satanic worshipping game dont buy im a christian the power of christ compells you
9317	0	a	everyone that likes or buys this crap are nerdz
9318	0	a	The binding of never will be taken seriously competitively
9319	0	a	A lot of other people like it, I don't. If I played this in an arcade in the 80's, maybe it wouldn't be so bad.
9320	0	a	I just don't get the hype.  Poorly optimized, repetitive, pseudo intelectual silly little game.
9321	0	a	If you like flash games you will love this because that is actually what it is. Just a generic boring flash game weird version of zelda. It is really nothing more than a crappy flash game ported into a full game and it has overwhelmingly positive review status because who knows. I paid a dollar for it and thats about what it is worth. The challenge comes from being extremely lucky to find a very random weapon upgrade, and sucky controls. It would be easier if I could use my controller to play, but while 99% of games recognize a xbox 360 controller right away because that's what Windows and all good games ♥♥♥♥ing do, recognizes it right away because its a Microsoft product, this game tries to tell you to use some special controller enabling program. I eventually gave in and got it and tried playing with my xbox 360 controller and the controls still blow equally as much as the keyboard controls do. Well it really isn't so much the controls blowing as the fact that it is just a stiff flash game that has the bare minimum of effort put into the movement and attack. Basically up down left right, just like a old dog crap NES game or a free flash game. This game ♥♥♥♥ing sucks.  4/10 Snore zzZZZZZZzzzzzZZZzZZZZzzz........
9322	0	a	IT IS A BAD GAME!!! 
9323	0	a	Nope
9324	0	a	flash game, no controller support... maybe the newer versions are better? not a fan of the games overall theme, so, idk.
9325	0	a	  It's okay, but its super laggy and it was a gift but you guys wont let the sender refund it. pls let us refund
9326	0	a	Just my personal opinion... Controls are just awful and sluggish and the difficulty is like some ridiculous super ultra nightmare level. I installed/uninstalled about 5 times to try again over time but I still think it's ♥♥♥♥♥.
9327	0	a	Binding of ♥♥♥
9328	0	a	This game is overhyped and I'll tell you why.  The concept is simple enough, you explore a series of rooms, kill a boss, move on to the next floor, and try not to die because that loses all your progress. But you'll die frequently, and not just early on. The enemy movements are erratic; some move randomly, some pursue you, some move randomly until they change their mind and try to pursue you...and your health is low. Not low for say, the start of a Zelda game. But it's low relative to how often you'll be unable to avoid the enemies due to randomness.  In fact, almost everything in the game is random, and the makers still decided they wanted to inflate the difficulty. So if shooting 4 ways in 13x7 room where the enemies prefer to move diagonally and the bosses fill 3x3 squares while spawning more enemies is too easy for you, you'll love all the obstacles that limit you more than them. You'll also love that most powerups are unexplained and a few will lower your stats. There ARE comprehensive guides, e.g.  steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=144481984  but they can't predict when pills will help or hurt you, and there's no reason for the other information to not be given in-game, since it's only available in English. A small number of items actually do have a text pop-up briefly explaining what they do, so it's not like the idea of explaining things never occured to the devs. But they decided to make the pills a liability and the items with a set effect annoying, since there are dozens of each kind to look up. Seriously, look at a guide and ask yourself how much you'd be able to memorize without it turning into a chore.  If you roll the dice enough times, you'll get lucky and get items that are significantly helpful. But you'll still have a good chance at getting screwed over by the room layout and the behavior of enemies. I've seen people defend it on the grounds that you manage your resources within the confines of what you find on each floor, but that's secondary. Even pros can only get so far before lady luck kills them. For a game where death resets everything but unlocked characters, spending hundreds of hours running into that wall is frankly unreasonable.
9329	0	a	THE GAME IS ♥♥♥♥ DONT GET
9330	0	a	from my understanding the new issac game is much better, but still, this version of the game is terrible.
9331	0	a	star all over again when you die
9332	0	a	I really don't understand why everyone loves this piece of absolute garbage. Another ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game doing an awful job trying to mimick Legend of Zelda. THIS GAME IS NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY!!! If you like repetitive gameplay with bad art and a nonexistant plot, you'll love this game!
9333	0	a	I won't say much, I personally don't like arcade games. So, I will not say this is a bad game, lots of people seem to love it, but just like Super Meat Boy, it bored me INSTANTLY. Tavel myriads of identical rooms, chuck saliva balls (?) at hordes of deformed baddies, die a lot, get highers scores, so on and so forth.
9334	0	a	boring, bad zelda clone
9335	0	a	I really don't get the fuss on this one. I doesn't tickle my interests. I've watched a few of Northernlion's LPs and i see how one can get lost in the game, but it's really not for me. Interesting how high replayability you can get from a seemingly very simple game though.  Style and music and all is superb, in it's own right, it screams McMillen. I do admire someone making games so personal. The originality that shines through is awesome.  And extra credit for the game-intro, it's simply amazing!  It's cheap, original, addictive i guess, but not for me, however it's popularity points to me being wrong! Choose but choose wisely.
9336	0	a	Binding of Isaac has a poor gameplay, is VERY repetitive and is not very skills-based.  You rely way too much on the seed. The first time I finished it, I didn't even thought I did better than in my other runs; I was just lucky. It felt like lotery, which is bad in my opinion, but is strangely one of the reasons I heard often for why some people got addicted to this game: you want to play it over and over to see if the next seed will be 'the good one'. No thanks, I don't need this kind of addiction in my life, it's a waste of time, and it's not even entertaining.  The other reason often heard is because people want to collect every items in the game. Yeah, doesn't seem very interesting either. Speaking of items, there are too many. Yeah, I know, complaining about too much content, but hear me: there is no description for them, and since there are so many, you can't remember their effects, which is critical at times. So you quickly find yourself having a wiki page opened while playing, and refer yourself to it often.  I'm an enthusiastic rogue-like player, but I just could never understand the praise this game got. Even today, it's considered one of the best. I can only be grateful it helped bring back the genre to life.
9337	0	a	This game would be fantastic if it didn't rely so much on luck. Skill is irrelevant because you'll either get carried by RNJesus or ♥♥♥♥ed in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ by Troll Engine. Simple as that. You get some kind of hollow sense of achievement when you win, but after about 4 wins it's more like '♥♥♥♥ing FINALLY, that grind is over'. After that the only reason why you play is just to waste time. 
9338	0	a	10/10 would uninstall again
9339	0	a	The Fox version of dark humor.  Is it offensive? Yep.  Is it grotesque? Eh, sure.  Is it bound to make you think? Subtly prod you to unravel wavering layers of sadness and futility? Does it beg questions with answers that so deeply unsettle you that all you can do is laugh? Once, maybe.  Also, does it bother anyone else that they couldn't be buggered to add controller support? Instead glibly directing you to joytokey, flatly telling you to 'google it'.
9340	0	a	Game no longer supports controllers, I have 2 and neither work at all with this game and conviniently this is the only game it doesn't work on after previously working,control options unchangable, GG WP. Uninstalled.
9341	0	a	this game is ♥♥♥♥ i want a refund 
9342	0	a	Very poor mouse and keyboard controls and when you look in settings for controller support it tells you to go buy a controller software. If you can get around the horrible controls you get to play 'ring around the rosie' with monsters as you shoot tears at them. On top of that the highest resolution you can set it to is 1280x800 so don't expect it to look pretty on monitors newer than 2011.  I love the setting and theme but can't get past how poor everything else is.
9343	0	a	This game is good, sure, but it can be pretty boring. There is a lot of stuff added to the game and it has a lot of detail and quality, but the execution just feels lacking to me. The game gets boring quickly and there isn't much to make up for it, and that's a shame. Really, I'd follow this review more loosely than others because this is much more of an opinion than a crique based on one big rubric.
9344	0	a	Unfortunately the developers made a remake of this game with tons of additional content, which is not included in this origianl version. Rather than making such remake an expansion -- it is set as a different title on Steam. So if you bought the original -- sucks to be you.  You are better off with the Rebirth version -- altough I would reconsider buying a game from this developer based on the above.
9345	0	a	This game is not too good, but still not so bad. I just don't have time and nerves to go trough so many things that i have to unlock. At start i do not have many items unlocked to be in-game, so i am ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and i die in 3rd room. I'm sorry but no.
9346	0	a	this game is about the westboro baptist church leader, mama bean, beating her little kid isack so that she can satisfy her sexual needs.  4/10 would of prefered it in HD. wait, there's a remaster, sh*t.
9347	0	a	Very old and ♥♥♥♥♥♥, you should get the new version! It has ♥♥♥♥ graphics and feels like u are lagging even with a good pc. Though it still can bee good if you are having some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ school laptop andyouare traveling somewhere. And i don´t recomend buyin it if it is not on sale and u are not traveling!
9348	0	a	this game is honestly way too hard, or it's just terrible.
9349	0	a	I bit on the 'overwhelmingly positive' hype. I tried to dig in to this game, but hated it too much to try. Not that it's that bad of a game. But rudimentary graphics ought to allow for rudimentary controls; fun and hassle-free. Only utilizing my logitech roller mouse and keyboard, (i also tried my Nostromo keypad) i found the linear movements too laborious for a throwback level grinder. Way too much so. This is, I'm sure, a very different game on any standard gaming controller, xbox or otherwise; but on PC it felt unsatisfyingly bulky.
9350	0	a	Why did I waste my money on this game? I don't know if the game is hard or I just suck really badly, but I can't make it past the first few rooms. I just give up, it's not worth my time.
9351	0	a	not that fun
9352	0	a	There really is nothing to this game, its so repetative, even with the procedurally generated levels, 6/10
9353	0	a	The game is pretty slow compared to the newer Binding of isaac.
9354	0	a	its not worth it
9355	0	a	Same thing over and, over again don't get the point.
9356	0	a	pretty trash now but good back then 
9357	0	a	  thought it was a bit lackluster  not as gud as the first 1
9358	0	a	  The game runs at an unplayable framerate because of its crappy engine, and there's not a solid fix.    Luckly I bought it at 50 cents and the soundtrack is good. But buy Rebirth instead.
9359	0	a	Trash game that's not worth any money. This game is of the quality of something that would normally be free on NewGrounds, it just got super popular for it's scatological and religious child abuse-oriented 'humor'. This ♥♥♥♥ is just bait for LP'ers, as your success chances are based almost solely off of what the RNG decides to drop for you, and has little or nothing to do with player skill. The bomb is possibly the most mechanically inclined component of the game as the ability to place and push the bombs as well as getting enemies to swallow them probably takes the most skill out of anything in this game.  This game seems like it was made possibly for a young teenage audience. Lots of anti-religion humor and grossly inaccurate depictions of child abuse. While I understand that the story is supposed to be loosely based on the creator's history, a lot of the flashbacks diverge from anything involving his family, and often times, if not the majority of times, focus on abuse he suffered at the hands of his peers in school. There's also a bizarrely incestual element to the game as collecting the used underwear of your mother is a common power-up. It's hard to view this game as an abuse story because it just does not stick to a coherent depiction of abuse. The main intended component was supposed to be abuse at the hands of a religious family, but aside from the intro, there is very little mention of christianity other than jokes about satanism and having the 7 deadly sins as minibosses.  The game also decides to simply punish you for things that you could not possibly have known. Pills and Tarot Cards are the biggest instance of this. These are items treated as upgrades that often have adverse effects on the player, which, for some reason, are actually permanent in some cases. What's more is some of the 'upgrades' can make your life harder in the game, such as the boomerang tears and the laser tears. Because every single enemy in this game is fought by simply kiting, the implementation of upgrades that are more shooter/defensive on your only offensive source seem very odd.  All in all, this game is a mess. If you want a game similar to this, but actually made well and with sensible game mechanics, pick up Castle Crashers. Don't waste your money on this piece of trash. It's so poorly written. It goes from parental abuse to fighting poo and pee monsters in the scope of about 1 minute. If I could refund, I would. Do not make the mistake I did and buy this because it's popular, it's just LP'er bait.
9360	0	a	OK i had to try really hard to refrain from curssing every other word. first off the fact that the devs decided to instead of writting code to support a twin stick game pad they tell you to use a program called joytokey...... ok cool so now you just bought a game and have to program 6 axis thumbsticks and up to 16 buttons on a scheme that isnt very user freindly (if you have ever used joytokey you know what i mean not for just any one who wants to play simple contrroller games from their pc.) great so now if you just installed the game downloaded and installed the 3rd party program and set it up you are now ready to play...... only this game isnt worth the time the money or even the effort of half of what intails to play it.    tldr: game is crust pile of junk / have to download other programs to even think of enjoying this rubbish  *trust me even if u do all that jazz you wont enjoy this game
9361	0	a	Rng ♥♥♥♥s you over. Rebirth is better but is the same way if not worse. Get it when its extremely on sale. Otherwise, pass
9362	0	a	This game needs controller support. Until it has that I cannot recommend it.
9363	0	a	It's not really a 'bad' game. It's pretty average, but the AI is bad and the firing is executed very poorly. You can either use the arrow keys to fire, which hurts your hand after a while, or the mouse (which barely works, it only actually shoots when it feels like it).   Other then that, it's mindless walking from one room to the next, slowly killing stuff and looking for powerups. Not terrible, but I don't really recommend it. If you want a good game in this style, try Castle Crashers.

9369	0	a	This game is ♥♥♥♥, edmund should have just done what his fans really wanted and made a spiritual succesor to Bad Ratz. The graphics are trash an the game doesn't even highlight the first-person shooter aspect. The people at team meat made a game that rode on the success of Barbie™ Dreamhouse Party™ and ended up making a comercial failure like Elder Scrolls V: Skyrimjob. A true dissapointment 
9370	0	a	This Game , is preety boring , not fun at all , buy Binding of Isaac : Rebirth its much better..  I got a refund on this game , just wasted my 5$ when i could have gotten myself a csgo skin.

9374	0	a	This game is seriously dark and doesnt make a whole lot of sense either...not a $5 game...
9375	0	a	brings back too many repressed childhood memories
9376	0	a	1. The art style is awful. Flash cartooning is just ugly and amateur-looking (and judging by screens of Rebirth, it didn't really get any better). I mean, you play as a naked kid that could be drawn in 5 seconds in Flash. It's not even funny, it's just boring.  2. The themes (anti-Christianity, anti-mother, anti-beauty) give it an annoyingly tawdry and borderline pretentious vibe. Unless I missed something, there was nothing that indicated it was a satire of itself either... but even if it was I'm not a big fan of cynical satire anyway.  3. Repetitive dungeon rooms and RANDOMIZED repetitive dungeon rooms make it hard to grasp any feeling of level progression, which is usually why I don't play these types of games. They are only tolerable when other aspects of the game are good, like the combat or the character/enemy designs, which isn't the case here.  So yeah, I don't like this game.
9377	0	a	Great game, but get Binding of Isaac: Rebirth instead. (New version with more content)

9387	0	a	this game sucks...waste of money...bad controls...do not buy...go away
9388	0	a	This is the best and worse game I've ever played. It is SO good when you're actually able to play; it truly brings back the old-school gamer in me to experience a modern NES style 'once you're dead, you're dead' playthrough, and each time it's different in some way. However, when I'm no longer able to f'ing play the game, that's where I draw the line. Games that pull you in and make you want to continue playing are far too few these days. This game does it with remarkable ease. Unfortunately, it is fraught with such a bug, that I will most likely never play this game, or any of its line again. There is a bug in this game that restricts your input device from allowing input.... think about that. The game responds to input, but you're not able to give it what you're meaning to. I'm not talking about an enemy reversing your controlls, I mean, you try to walk or shoot in a direction, and the game simply ignores that request. Again, hatred built from accusing my past controllers or input devices of not 'working right', but in this case, it is documented and agreed upon across the board as a bug with the game itself. I can't think of anything worse than to dangle such a wonderful game in front of you, then simply pull it away. I would've rather paid more money for a working title, than to have this fail in such a significant way.
9389	0	a	As someone who loved this game and played it non-stop, Rebirth is simply a completely better game. I've read countless reviews on how bad the new update is, but I gave up in the first few minutes because of how laggy the game is (it was made in Flash). This was great for it's time and a true classic, but once I went Rebirth, I couldn't go back.  The main problem with this game is that it was made in Flash, but Rebirth fixes that. Rebirth is only 10 dollars more expensive and better in most ways. The nice music and flash graphics (I prefer Rebirth's pixel graphics at all times besides pixelated cutscenes, but some prefer these cartoony graphics which is fine) honestly can't save this title.  Binding of Isaac, you have given me over 100 hours of fun, adrenaline and excitement, but the day your sequel came out, you died. Though we will not play you, we will still remember you and all the classic memories that will never leave us.   Summary: Just buy Rebirth.
9390	0	a	In a game where most everything you encounter is randomized you're left with just that and not much else. While I can see why someone may enjoy trying to pull of a flawless run or even just go through and try to become a buffed out child tyrant, it's entirely in the hands of the game deciding wether or not that would be possible. The feature of this randomness is both Binding of Isaacs strengths and flaws. The first few times you go through the game its pretty entertaining and interesting. Things are new and you don't know what to expect. Though, latter on as you repeat from the beggining over and over because some measely fly killed you, the experince just becomes repetitive and bland. You begin to look for specific items and know exactly how to take on an enemy or boss in the most efficent ways possible. The rooms also become tedious to run back and forth through. With pleanty of back tracking to specific rooms just so that you can spend that extra penny you happened across into a betting machine or in a game of guess where the item is just to see if you get anything good, or anything at all. It just becomes a waste of time, which is hard for me to say about any game really. The art direction in this game may be the only thing this game has going for it, in my opinion. They did a great job at really making me feel like I was in a dreadful scenario and was faced with nasty creatures. Thats cool. I feel like their may just be something missing in me that doesn't allow me to fully enjoy this experince but the game isn't perfect either.
9391	0	a	Bad, intentionally annoying, too luck-based, not rewarding, overhyped, overrated.  They've managed to create a highly addictive game that's just not good. And I've wasted over 90 hours of my life stressing with the lack of luck the game keeps throwing at me. Just like real life, huh, so why do I need this? They hide information just so they can feel more hardcore, and just to be annoying, and even talk about how they hate wikis, that a true gamer shouldn't check guides, yada, yada.  My successful runs were all due to good luck. Of course, training makes it better, but I think games are supposed to be fun, above all else. And BoI is just addicting. Like a drug. And I'm not joking. Devs shouldn't be proud about creating a drug. This game made me feel miserable over and over. Well, if you like that, go on ahead. ♥♥♥♥ the hype, I'd rather have real fun. Perhaps I take it too serious, but this game is just insufferable.  Now you can rate it down because you love the game, even though you didn't read.
9392	0	a	I don't see the huge fanfare over this, to be quite honest. It's good. Just good. Nothing more than that.
9393	0	a	I can see the appeal (if you didn't play the original Zelda series) but I just couldn't get into it. I didn't like the movement, the sound effects, or mechanics. I felt like I was playing a flash game that could be offered online for free in 2002...Good thing I almost got it for the same price as that.
9394	0	a	It's a very boring game about some kid who shoots tears out his eyes for some odd reason. No real story, and it's just an extremely confusing mess.
9395	0	a	I get what they're going for and they do a decent enough job of it. But for me the content is unappealing. I like horror movies, and have a fairly high tolerance for creepy. Black humor about hacking up idiot teenagers or setting fire to pompous adults is fine by me. But sick things with little kids -- even badly drawn, imaginary ones -- is a line I don't like to see crossed.   Even without that, I don't see much to get excited about. Sure it's got an old-school vibe to the gameplay. I could see killing some time with a game with similar mechanics. I don't see raving about it the way folks seem to for this one. Taste differs, I suppose. The setting and art style is just such a turnoff for me, I had enough after five minutes. I'd call it the gaming equivalent of a fetish: if you're into it, you love it. If not, it's a bit disgusting.
9396	0	a	This just really isn't my thing. Picked it up for a dollar in a sale like lots of people did, but I really hate the game. Might be your thing though.
9397	0	a	its good but U NEED TO GET REBIRTH 
9398	0	a	I came here,saw the reviews were overwhelming positive so I decided to buy it for 1 euro (lol).I tried to have fun with the game but I actually got bored of it pretty fast (not because of dying too many times) but because I don't think there's any purpose you should pursue in this game.I am not hating at all so mind your saying about my critic and plz don't be rude!
9399	0	a	- Freind gift's me game - Does not bother to install game - 1 year later, see's game and install's it - Start's game up - Look's at very sad intro - Play's Game - Kill's people with shooting tear's  - Stuble's apon Boss Battle  - Get's killed - Rage's and Cry's  - Smashes P.C.   20/10 would crie again
9400	0	a	This game is just so odd and creepy, I kinda wish I could delete it out of my steam account. That being said, I didn't find the game play, graphics, or art exceptional in any way.
9401	0	a	It looks cool but i hate that there is no savepoint at all. This game would be soo much better if it had a reason for me to come back. This is why i hated games like Minecraft and State of Decay.
9402	0	a	hey, there's an update for this old nostalgic game, oh! and there's new achievement in it. hmmm, that looks like fun. *open up game*, wow! cool, it's the eternal version. let's see what's this new version has to offer. *after playing for 10 minutes* NOPE! NOPE! NOPE! ♥♥♥♥ THIS ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥ OF GARBAGE, I HOPE THE ♥♥♥♥ING UPDATE DEVELOPER DIE IN THE FURY OF SATAN. ♥♥♥♥ ACHIEVEMENTS, I'VE DONE 100% ACHIEVEMENTS OF REBIRTH SERIES, I AM NOT...♥♥♥♥ING NOT DOING THIS PIECE OF ♥♥♥♥ AGAIN. oh, and Florian, do me a favor, kill urself. congratz of screwing up people who want to get 100% achievement(including me). I would say normally there would be like only 30% of people in the world who get complete achievements, congratz, now there' only 0.0000000000001 percent of the people who got complete achievements. Florian, u have done enough, don't u dare even touch rebirth. I would not recommend playing on hard mode. imagine playing Touhou bullet hell game..... yeah, that's the ♥♥♥♥ing hard mode. thanks Florian, u ruined this nostalgic game 4 us. also last thing. ♥♥♥♥ you Florian
9403	0	a	This game has an indredible amount/rate of positive reviews here on Steam. But is not that good. Most of the reviews are a result of the combination of cheap price + dark humor. But as a game, unless you really can bare that luck is an important factor (and maybe the main one), you may not find it worth of your time. I haven't
9404	0	a	A quirky, disgusting take on the original Zelda for NES or something...I dunno, almost. Some unique powerups, features, an...interesting art style and humour, but ultimately I don't feel it's my kind of game. But if you're into more twitch-based, challenging shoot-em-ups or the like, you might enjoy it.
9405	0	a	The only reason im giving this a thumbs down is that you should buy Binding of Isaac: Rebirth instead
9406	0	a	How does a game that I'm basically playing at 640x480 on a super fast PC with a brand new install of windows and all drivers up to date, how does a game like this lag? When it matters most and I'm deep into it, the game lags out and all the hard work is lost. What a disappointment.
9407	0	a	This is more a tribute than a review. Having that in mind, i now shall tear a new one in once my favourite game.   Why the change of heart after so long? Because Binding of Isaac: Rebirth came out and its supperior in every way. Don't get me wrong, vanilla BoI ressurected roguelike franchise, and most AAA fan♥♥♥♥ dont get it, the bad reviews goes 'its hard, hurrdurr, cant beat first stage, hence the game is bad'. Smooth.  The flash is not meant to be a good 'big' game drive. And it shows pretty much. I wont say my PC is great, but lag spikes are insane in BoI:WotL. And even with basically nothing on the screen the game isn't really 60+ fpsish. Randomisation eats, you need luck to win, and even with that one mistake can end your once good run. Don't get me wrong, i like hard games, but in WotL there's no learning curve, just luck. Again, R is better, since even with really bad luck streak we can win.  Graphics and music are relative to taste, i liked the style, but again R decimates this title in every way possible  Bad design of most chargeable attack effects (which are done better in R btw) olny adds salt to the insult.  Well, as I said, its a tribute more than review, so thats it. This game is good, but still weak compared to remaster. If you want to sink balls deep into the madness of Binding of Isaac, buy Rebirth instead of this game. Its better and more fun. This one is just for hardcore fans of the series. I would recommend it before R release. Now thou, don't bother.   Zawisza out.  Afterthought of Eternal edition: Mister Himls. What the ♥♥♥♥ did you program? The game which was previously more or less balanced turned into a mess. Everything move faster, except for player, eternal enemies have patterns which are borderline impossible to counter and the entire game turned into a cluster♥♥♥♥ of ridiculous mess. Hard games are good. Impossible games are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. You ♥♥♥♥ed it up, mister Himls!
9408	0	a	No gamepad support? really? pretty much unplayable on the keyboard.   I wouldn't be so upset about such an omission if it wasn't for the lame 'controller' options in the in-game menu. 'Google 'JoyToKey''? Really? That's your idea of controller support? Thanks for the info to a 3rd party program that you have to buy to play a game i already own. I can't understand why the devs can't put in gamepad support for a type of game that really needs it.  I loved super meat boy, laggy bugs not withstanding. But unique art style can only make up for so much.   oh and powerups. no clear indication of what powerups do. some things you just wear on your head... and nothing happens. Yes, you can google it i suppose, but that's also just a lame excuse for the dev to be lazy.  this game is an example of a very wide, but shallow gameplay. Yes, there are a lot of things you can collect and do, but they don't interact in any meaning, interesting way. And even the width of the game isn't clearly explained. Contrast this to something like Dota 2, which is another extremely wide game.... but at least everything is well-explained and documented so that players can actually learn from their mistakes.   On the whole, an unfortunate, unsatisfying experience.
9409	0	a	Florian Himsl, you are a sick ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, i think you know that. Eternal Edition is a piece of ♥♥♥♥. 0/10 Carl, 0/10!!!
9410	0	a	Addictive - yes. Fair - no. Too much randomness, overall can't recommend.
9411	0	a	Well this game used to be good until the new Eternal update came out. Its a freaking mess. The game used to be hard enough because it was a ''flash game'' hence the lag, and now this update came out it has become a nightmare. Enemies and bosses are WAY too hard now. Too many projectiles and homing projectiles that it became a bullet hell, even worse is that theres sometimes a delay with the game trying to follow your controls, meaning you can get hurt and its not fun playing this anymore. Sorry, i used to like this game but now this gets a BIG dislike. If you like a better game, try Rebirth. Its pretty much the same game but you have new items, bosses and it still has a hard mode which is similiar to this version. Get it please, or uninstall the Eternal update.
9412	0	a	i deffinitly do NOT reccomend this game if you take my advice you can save your money and buy another garbage game
9413	0	a	Impossible to really play on my windows 8 computer. The game lags and the controls just don't respond right. I can run fallout 3, 7 days to die, minecraft, and game just like this called our darker purpose. But this one gives me the most trouble. The lag is usually just when first entering a new room, but not long after being in a room controls stop responding at important moments.  If you can't play this due to the bad controls try Our darker purpose. Its like this but much better controls and much less gore and poop. In my opinion its harder too.
9414	0	a	the game most of the time brachs you wasd keys alot and it is anoying i have died more then ones by this and i dont like it  
9415	0	a	I've heard lots of good things about this game. I expected almost a miracle and what did I get? Boring, ugly, uninteresting game worse than many free flash games. Totally wasted money. I recommend playing it only as a form od severe punishment.

9420	0	a	Only worth a few bucks. 6/10
9421	0	a	The input lag is horrendous and I can't get the sound to work.
9422	0	a	Buy this game for under a dollar as a trial for Rebirth. You'll play one hour and then buy Rebirth.  In terms of this game, it's an awfully optimised game with a lot of issues. No controller support, no Linux support. The game has a horrible wallpaper in full screen and only looks good on a 4:3 display.   For a 2D flash game it has a lot of issues with performance, with framerate drops and slow motion on older systems.  I mean yes, it was a brilliant game which lead to the incredible second game: Rebirth, but now it's outdated and really shouldn't cost anything.

9428	0	a	Now...I am not sure where to start with this, but I will do my best. So, the storyline of this game is different then other games. This is how it goes. So Isaac is a boy who lives with his mother and they live a happy life together. One day while Isaac is drawing, which is one of his favorite hobbies, his mother hears God's voice speaking to her and God says something like this 'I see something bad in Isaac. If you truely love me beyond all things sacrifice isaac.' So Isaac's mother took a butchers knife from the kitchen and seeked out to kill Isaac, but Isaac heard what his mother was doing and found a trap door going to the basement under his rug. And went to the basement. Now we get into the game. When Isaac is in the basement there are all these weird, ugly, disgusting, smelly creatures down there. And poop. There are powerups in the game, that make you do damage, run faster, blah blah blah and other stuff. You try to defeat these enemies and there is a boss which is Isaac's mother. But there are other bosses and mini bosses and other crap. Now it might seem as the game is hard at first as it seemed for me, but once you get uset to it, it seems easy. Some other bosses are poop, satan, mom's heart and other stuff. But really, I have my dislikes and likes about this game. And i am not saying you should not buy it but most likely be careful with your choice. Also, even though I do not reccomend this game, it is still a realy good game. I hope this helps you decide on your decision. Thank you.
9429	0	a	I like it but it's soooo rage inducing !
9430	0	a	it sucks and is too unforgiving.
9431	0	a	whats the point of the game if you have to restart the WHOLE yea i mean WHOLE game when you die??? couldent there be like a checkpoin or somthing. good job i brought it for 7p :P
9432	0	a	The worst game in the world
9433	0	a	Once and done life sytem is frustrating. If you get enjoyment out of doing the same thing over and over and over....and over....then this game is for you.
9434	0	a	Pros:  -Roguelike -Vareity of Items -Variety of bosses -Price Cons: -Weak story -Too evil -Little Replay Value  I was attracted to this game, because of the good reviews and the low price, but was severley dissapointed. I only enjoyed it for a couple lives, but found little incentive to keep trying. There was no promise of an endgame in sight. I played long enough to experience a few different bosses and weapons, but they prompted nothing more than an 'oh, neat' response. This negative may be subjective, but I thought the game was too evil. I like creepy themes, but this seems to be a celebration of evil. I won't be returning to this game.
9435	0	a	For no apparent reason this game instead of having actual controller support tells you to use another program. So I tooled around on the net for 15 minutes losing interest in this game every second. Eventually got it running played for a few minutes. I don't care.   1 star.
9436	0	a	I can safely say the 140 hours I poured into this game were all completely wasted. I feel no joy or sense of acheivement after everything i've done in the game. Stay away from this game, and stay away from Edmund
9437	0	a	This is the poopiest game I have ever played. First off, the game is not in first person. Like really? Some of the greatest games ever made like Rogue Warrior and Secret Service are in first person and this game isnt? What the ♥♥♥♥ Mr. Mcmillen why couldnt you take inspiration from those games instead of poop like Legend of Zelda? That game dosent even have guns. SHAME ON YOU 1/10 one of the worst ever. DO NOT BUY
9438	0	a	Knowing that i REALLY like this game and been playing it for a while, it shows how bad it runs performance wise. What's the good of playing high quality games when all you're gonna get is 10 fps? None. This is the exact feeling i have about this game. Please fix this
9439	0	a	It's really boring cause of RNG. Either It's too easy or you just die.
9440	0	a	Interesting art style, but just not fun to play.
9441	0	a	Considering this game has no save or checkpoint system of anykind everything you do is absolutely meaningless, and it doesnt help the game can be unfair and unforgivingly difficult
9442	0	a	It's a very frustrating and irritating but nontheless addictive game you doomed to play over and over again. Game mechanics rely heavily on luck. No matter the skill sometimes games just need to get you down with bad items, though patterns and random events. Some achievements are insanely hard. It you don't want to spend you life mindlessly near the computer don't buy it.
9443	0	a	A Flash game.  Not worth the small price IMO. Simple storyline coupled with simple gameplay that relys mostly upon luck if you wish to beat the game. Skill plays a very small part of this game as much of the advancment through it depends on luck of the draw.  I dont think Flash games deserve any spot next to real games on steam.   id give it a 3 out of 10  Casual / Flash
9444	0	a	The game is too hard to get into now. Hard Mode is nigh-impossible. Item drops are mostly bad or not good enough.
9445	0	a	♥♥♥♥ this ♥♥♥♥! buy *.* : Rebirth (patched version) instead!
9446	0	a	It's tricky to recommend this game. I only recommend playing this game if 1. you have a hell of a lot of patients, I'm a patient guy yet this game irritated me to my limit. Numerous hours of gameplay and i have yet to finish it once 2. You want to play a 'deep' game (this game is about ad deep as the sand pit i dug once when i was 5) 3. you want to see a whole heap of random cynical bizarre ♥♥♥♥ and a whole heap of ripping on Christians 4. You're a Indie Fanboy/hipster or a die hard game completionist

9448	0	a	I feel kinda bad giving this a bad review because it was a gift, but..noope. It's style is filth.. A bunch of nasty stuff with kids and anti-religious hate masked as 'dark humor' this game should be the picture in the dictionary next to the word grotesque. It bothers me to see it in my library lol.. I have no problem with atheists, or people with different religious ideas than mine, I think there are many paths to truth, I just don't like it when people over simplify and mock things like this to try to seem smart on the internet.  besides that its just a free flash game that they make you pay for..  definitely not worth getting, doesn't live up to the hype at all. If you want a game that is challenging, and made with pride, get dark souls 2.   Ps. Angry militant internet athiest, please don't comment, I know you are out there and it isn't worth your time, i'll delete it or ignore it anyways. lol. I'm not trying to start a flame war, just stating my thoughs on a game.
9449	0	a	Not my kind of game. I have heard very good things from others, but to me it was like the flash games I played in elementary school in 2006. Ask Theo if you want an opinion from somebody who loves the game and its sequel.
9450	0	a	This is a solid game. Controls and everything is fine and can provide endless amounts of entertainment.  This game is not for everyone. The story has strong anti-christain tones, gore and fecal matter everywhere. Eventually I just couldn't keep playing this.  Not bashing on the game because I did want to enjoy it. However the tone set just keeps me away.
9451	0	a	Not my style of art.
9452	0	a	A nice roguelike homage to The Legend of Zelda. So nice, in fact, that I'm going to play that instead of this frustrating, unfun, procedurally generated (but looks exactly the same) dungeon, no health drop, WTF does that item do, why is there no controller support, game. Also, the art style makes me want to scoop my eyes out with a melonballer.  On the plus side, F*@K religion and I only paid like a dollar for it, so I guess it was worth it. Better that 99% of the dreck on Steam.

9454	0	a	the game is almoooooooost fun but its not fun -.-
9455	0	a	When you buy a game and do research on said game afterwards and find out that there is a more comprehensive and updated version of the game (The binding of Isaach: Rebirth + Afterbirth) and read several recommendations on forums online to play the latter versions for a much better experience and you file for a refund but you've already player 2+ hours and they won't give you a refund and you choose to permanently delete the game in your inventory but the memory that you spent 6.6 euros on this game and the first dlc (wrath of the lamb) still haunts you every time you see this in your inventory and you wonder why the F*ck they don't just delete the older versions of the game so people don't accidentally do this kind of shi* and then about a week later you write this review..... feelsbadman  Don't buy this version if you want to play this game. The game itself shows promise but this is the older and less comprehensive version. Buy Rebirth + Afterbirth for aprox. 25-26 euros for the full experience.
9456	0	a	Not having controller support and instead of programming this feature in like any normal developer would, they was lazy take your money and tells you to google joytokey, this isn't good enough for me, I have hundreds upon hundreds of games to play and they all barter for my time, yet this game expects me to do the work I've paid them for? It's a down vote for this, is the game good? It's okay, it's over hyped and maybe because of the qurky art style? I do like the art style but I don't think there is much to the gameplay.
9457	0	a	Not nearly as good as everyone makes it out to be.   It's a good game, but I wouldn't recommend this game due to how 'meh' it all feels. You see videos of this game and you think it looks fun until you realize that the controls are not as tight as they should be. A game like this requires those tight controls to be fun and effective. Everything as an almost 'on ice' feel, or in this game's case 'On blood'. But if the controls were as tight and responsive as one would like, then sadly the game wouldn't be as 'hard' as it is. You cannot really dodge all that well due to the sliding, so when you fight enemies/bosses with plently of projectiles being thrown at you, you can imagine the frustration.  The asthetic does not appeal to be, honestly. It feels like over the top just for the sake alone, like Happy Tree Friends. You may like that, I do not.  There is a fun game here, even maybe a good game. The items are interesting and at times I can get a chuckle out of how impossibly deformed your character can become. If you can just get past the control problem and the asthetic you'll get a lot of enjoyment out of this game. If not then this game is not for you.  
9458	0	a	this is the dumbest game ever it sucks and i hate it
9459	0	a	Fast paced, Dark, 2D dungeon crawler. Pretty good if you need to waste some time.  Soundtrack and Visuals are superb, but I really don't get the fuss on this one. got bored quickly, and had a hard time playing for more than 5 minutes at a time.
9460	0	a	The pictures on the store page are funner to play with than the game.
9461	0	a	Default controls are confusing and lame (if you want to use a controller they straight you tell you to F yourself and use a program) and I bought the DLC and game seperate without seeing the bundle and lost 11 cents. 5/10
9462	0	a	like the original zelda games. but with no saveable progress. and weird dark humor. and it feels like a flash game on newgrounds. probably was then they decided to sell it.   whatever. as far as depth and 'game', this is basically an arcade game.  value: $0.25 per play..... NAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!! I dont know, it really depends on who you are, because I can see why you'd like it. I just didn't.  seriously though, value: &lt;9$

9464	0	a	About this game? Well... It's probably one of the most satanic, demonic, celebrations of evil type of game I've ever seen/played. I don't like that stuff. On top of that, I just don't like the controls. You can only shoot in the 4 cardinal directions. No omnidirectional shooting. And you can't start shooting immediately after entering a room. These are minor complaints, but that with all the satanic stuff, I can't reccomend it.

9468	0	a	How did this 'game' become popular? Is it a joke? Like Bad Rats? The so bad its 'good' kind of game?  First impressions. Music is great. Controls? A twin stick shooter, that you can't use a joypad with? Umm, kay? Oh a controller option let's take a look 'Use joy2key (google it)'. That is taken verbatim from the game by the way including the game telling me to 'google it'.  Enter a door and lose health from the doorway itself, then lose more health going back out the way I came in from the same doorway because the room was a dead end. See some fire, cool background image right? No, it shoots at you. But you wouldn't know that because it isn't classed as a 'bad guy' since killing all the bad guys opens the room doors however fire is excluded from this and is super hard to hit anyway so you wouldn't even know you were hitting it or that it is even possible. Spiderwebs on the floor that just look like background scenary just like the fires. Oh they slow you down despite not looking interactive at all! Pick up an item, what does it do? No idea because this is one of those 'ha ha this game is hard!' games that isn't 'hard', at all.  Artificial difficulty doesn't make your game hard, it makes it tedious, their is a difference. So once again where am I? Not playing the game thats for sure! Because now I have to go to the wikia and read about what everything is, why are doorways killing me, what do bombs do, what are keys for, so on and so forth because in order to be 'difficult' the game just choose to be obtuse instead.  Then their are the other issues for example i'd enter a boss domain 'game lost focus but still runs anyway!'. I hear Rebirth fixes some of the issues for example you can ACTUALLY use a gamepad this time rather than simply being told to 'google it'.  Its a shame because a friend gifted me this game and recommended it so I actually went in with high hopes and tried to ignore it's flaws but I derived no fun from this game, like at all.  I hear rebirth is better and since this is a twin stick shooter and that version actually lets you use a joypad, I imagine that alone qualifies it as the better game. Avoid this one and just get Rebirth instead. Also this game runs in flash so you may experience memory leaks although that is a flaw of flash, it is still lovely icing on a wonderful, terrible, cake.

9472	0	a	It's terrible, it should be a flash game on some website, not a Steam game. I really expected better from one of the guys who made Super Meat Boy. Ed's art is good, but this game just sucks. I have no idea why people like it. It doesn't even support controller right out of the box, you have to install a third party's software to convert controller input to keyboard input because it's poorly coded. If there was no 'Indie Game The Movie', I don't think this game would sell, it wouldn't even be here. Maybe even people on greenlight would vote 'no'.
9473	0	a	I've tried a few times to play this. I heard it gets better, but I personaly can't get into it. The gameplay isn't something great. It's like oldschool Zelda, but entirely dungeon-crawler. The game doesn't feel right on a keyboard and it feels strange on a controller. There are no options to bind keys, so if you're arrow keys are broken or you don't like to use them, then you're s**t out of luck. There is no controller support, so you'll have to download a third-party, controller-to-keyboard application. They could've spent just 10 minutes to add bindable keys or added controller support, but nope. Disappointing; exactly like this game. The 'art style' looks like my toilet after I eat chili. Don't get me wrong, I have a sense of humor, but there's not much humor in this. Just poop. (But once again, I personally don't like it. Others will view that differently.)

But this... this crosses the line into blasphemy. Don't get me wrong, the core game play is extremely solid, as others have said. I honestly do wish they'd chosen a different theme for the game, but I also wish that I hadn't supported the game by buying it. Live and learn, I guess.   As an aside, the devs would NEVER make a game like this about Islam. Just shows how trendy it is to bash Christianity, and how cowardly they are. And yes, I know that the biblical story of the binding of Isaac is also present in Islam and Judaism. The point still stands.
9479	0	a	This game was on sale few days ago, I saw how popular this game is so I give it a try...  But well it just not tickle my interest. The beginning was some kind of fun but after playing for a while I got bored. You basically land on random maps with a few rooms filled with monsters that could kill you easily but hard to be defeat, I die several times and that's it.
9480	0	a	GIVE ME A REFUND STEAM PLZ  0/10 NO REFUNDS NO FUN :(
9481	0	a	Cant say i really recommend this game. Its interesting but i imagine it was probably cooler when it came out....  The story and vibe are just too hipster for me and doesnt really add much to the game.   The mechanics are simple and easy to grasp true, yet it feels lacking... there are other characters to be unlocked, but the first character is so dull that i dont feel like exploring more and unlocking the rest.  Today there are definetly better games of the same genre. This game offers less intensity than dungeon siege, less story and character coherence than bad mojo and less fun vibe than bastion.   I believe its one of those games that pioneered a genre but only made way to its own demise.

9485	0	a	Not recommended specially if Christian...   FPS drops as well during gameplay. I still wouldnt recommend this but if you have no problems with the 'plot' I think it is better if you get Rebirth to have a new engine and smoother gameplay  
9486	0	a	I... legitimately don't understand the popularity of this one. Actually, I totally understand it. Because of how bloody backwards the average gamer's interests are, and how little this game has to offer for me personally, clearly it's gotta be the most popular thing on the entirety of youtube.  Doesn't deserve it, mind you.   I mean, the point of the game is to disgust. The 'humor' never gets past juvenille gross-out schlock that isn't shocking, just irritating. Other than that, the game HAS NO PERSONALITY. That is it. Entirely limited to that one category, and I guess some mememememes too but yeah that's practically worse. But I can forgive awful presentation of the gameplay is any good.  But... no, it isn't... the game is too RNG-reliant, to the point where you can easily be screwed simply because the game decided it didn't want to give you anything useful. I've also had randomly generated rooms where it was utterly impossible to avoid a hit or two, which is awful. But the entire game philosophy is just stupidly backwards too. When I walk into a room where opening a chest means fighting off a few waves of enemies or walk through a door that hurts me to get a reward, I WANT A BLOODY REASON TO DO SO. Not the chest opening and giving me a bomb more often than not. You know what that does? It takes a risk/reward philosophy and extracts the reward, leaving only the risk. This is not a game you win through skill alone, it's a game you win when the game lets you. Yeah, sure, there's some element of skill involved, but when I die in this game I don't feel like 'whoops I screwed up' as much as 'well I could've had a chance if the game would have let me'.  And apparently it gets better the more items you unlock but you have to play through the miserable early stages of the game to get those items, and suffering through that probably isn't worth the likely at best mediocre full potential of this game. Fortunately this game is cheap and often on sale, 'cause that's the only reason I can think of to buy it. Also there's a remake that's 'better' (though probably still has all the same issues, I don't understand the general gaming public and their insanity but whatever.)
9487	0	a	You can't shoot diagonally, and to get a controller to work they literally tell you to google some program to map a controller to kb/mouse buttons.  Thats just to unforgivable.

9499	0	a	more like the binding of sucks butt because this game sucks butt
9500	0	a	The game is great and well done if you like the genre, I just can't play it because of terrible performance (fps drops) because--Flash. There might be a fix but at some point I stopped trying. I'll update this if I do fix it. Grabbed it at Halloween sale for dirt cheap so I wasn't too bummed (I'd have kept trying to fix it otherwise). Go get the sequel instead, I think that one runs better.
9501	0	a	This game has great gameplay vaguely reminiscent of the 2D Zelda games of old. The artistic style is much darker than is reasonable. If you have a weak stomach, this game is rather gross. In short, the gameplay is good, but the overall tone and story are far to dark.
9502	0	a	The Binding of Isaac is actually not ever Bound at all sadly. Would be really nice to play a game that came out on consoles and PC with my game pad. Such simple controls but without getting a third party program I would only need for this 1 game there is no way to just set up even basic key binding to your game controller.  I'm just not a fan of any game that makes me keep a keyboard in my lap to play. I don't sit at a desk like some kid. So for me this one was a waste of money and a real bust.    
9503	0	a	Can't customize controls, thumb down, bored of lazy dev.
9504	0	a	how did anyone ever handle playing this piece of trash
9505	0	a	(don't let the 0,5 hours deceive you. After getting this game I suddenly got the rebirth version free on ps4 so I haven't played this one much but they're basically the same thing)  This game is mediocre. It's pretty simple and not in a good way. It's boring because the mechanics. They're... boring. Simple as that. That's the main flaw of this game. It functions perfectly, but that doesn't require much since it's so simple. And before you say it's supposed to be that way, let me say this: 'I know.' But the gameplay is missing originality. It's a cheap game, but you can find games like this for free if you search. It doesn't have 'it's own thing' like Rogue Legacy and other great indie games, so really there's nothing to see here.  It's functional, but where's the fun in that if the game isn't interesting in any way? Well... The art is nice and the bosses are ok. Too bad both of these are missing tons of originality and the same designs are used over and over with slightly different forms.  There's not much story either and what's there was clearly written in 20 minutes or less. There's no atmosphere since it's not that kind of game.  ...But to make everything here easy to understand: This game is just really ♥♥♥♥ing boring.
9506	0	a	this game was atrocious. I spent my living college memories playing this and now I can't remember own name. Sometimes I respond to Isaac sometimes I respond to ???. My life has been a ride of tears ever since this game and I don;t think I can quit ever
9507	0	a	This game is too hard. I'll update this if I ever get my spirits up enough to fight it again. It's really imaginative and the different abilities are really fun to discover... But it's just demoralizing how the randomness and speed overwhelm you. Just stops being fun. Every time I stop it's because I'm thoroughly bummed. I've played 27 hrs. I hope I can stay away. Just a major bummer. Better gamers than me will surely waltz through it. But not me.
9508	0	a	My boyfriend plays this game more, than he plays with me! Silly game!
9509	0	a	Its a flash game. Its shallow and basic. The collision is horrible, it relies on random factors way to heavily and it wont tell you what an item does until you use it.  If you want a better rogue like game to play there are tons on steam right now that can do that. Play something like Rogue Legacy or Risk of Rain.

9516	0	a	cant see why people are so addicted to this game i was having a hard time having fun in this game
9517	0	a	A bad but hyped roguelike. Cool graphics, random maps, and a lot of foes and items. But mechanics is not explained since beginning: requires to consult a guide several times to learn what can do its many items, and how to play, because game shows scarce info and not has tutorial. Gameplay seems easy and wonderfull, but really is hard and frustrating. Its difficultly is based on that player can not shoot diagonally without moving, the progressive reduction of free space by addiction of obstacles, and the fact that can not save any progress. Winning is a question of luck and waste time more than the own skills. The references to eschatology, insane oddities, esoterism and terror mainstream by themselves are insufficient to make original a game; and their accumulation should not be a reason to hype a game. This is a encyclopedic example of an overrated product by his fans, that no tolerate critics and any disagreement in ratings. There are much better and sane options of the genre, like Iron Fisticle.
9518	0	a	one of the worst binding of isaacs
9519	0	a	Not that quick of a game
9520	0	a	4\10
9521	0	a	Get the remake, Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, instead.  The Binding of Isaac is an incredible game which gave me many hours of enjoyment. However, this version is a mere prototype of Rebirth, which is superior in every single way except possibly the soundtrack, which isn't worse, just different.  The only reason to purchase the original is for curiosity's sake, or because you don't have ten more dollars.
9522	0	a	♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t game,may luck be on your side. it came out during that time when every game wanted to be a classic NES game with the hard diffuculty factor,so if yo like getting whipped like in the old days (but in purpose) then this is for u
9523	0	a	i lick it tho it not as gud as cod but it still coo
9524	0	a	20/100 (Yes, I am considering it is a very cheap game) I couldn't stand this for no longer than 2 hours
9525	0	a	Although it was made by the makers of super meat boy and was a npleasant take on the original legend of zelda, it isn't too great, as it feels much like a flash game that should be free because of it's lack of features, levels, game mechanics, and save mechanic. This game is basically a watered down and satanic version of the legend of zelda.  The art style is lovingly kept from super meat boy and that was a good idea because the music and the art style were my favourite part of the game and i'm glad websites like grooveshark and youtube exist to make the best part of this game free  The game may lack bugs (ironic since bugs are a type of enemy) it doesn't make the game perfect, it just puts a rose between a thousand thorns because it is tedious, poorly made and a HUGE step down from super meat boy and i definitely would not reccomend it to anybody who doesn't like paying for flash games
9526	0	a	Just a disgusting, ugly game.
9527	0	a	I have played this game ALOT and I still can't make it past Cave 1, if you buy this be aware that it's very difficult and there's no difficulty level it's all the same difficulty. BUT if you can get past the fact that you'll die alot then be my guest but I hate that I can't get very far in this game. PS the higher you go through in levels the more it takes a toll on your computer cause when I get to the Cave my person lags randomly and I'll die....and it's not my computer cause this thing runs like a champ at everything else so I believe it's the game
9528	0	a	Right now it's on sale for 59 cents. That's the absolute most I'd pay for it.
9529	0	a	It's repetitive, and you die a lot, but I picked it up for a buck during a sale, so I don't regret the purchase.
9530	0	a	glad I only paid about 80 cents for this... not enjoyable at all  to be more specific, the setting is stupid, the gameplay is crappy, it feels strongly like the flash game that it is, you literally cry tears at the 'enemies', I don't see how this is enjoyable. waste of time.
9531	0	a	this game isn't good  you people are crazy
9532	0	a	So.... 2 Years ago, I got the 100％ platinum achievement, and that game was one of my favorite.... Now, ''Rebirth'' have been publish, personally, i don't like it, but nothing to do with the original one.... Until they uploaded it, now the old nice game is dead, and i am really disappointed about that, why create a new game, to change the old one after ? That really sad for a game like this one.........
9533	0	a	It is baffling how much attention and praise this neanderthalic flash game has received, because after 6 hours of playing, it is now clear to me that this game is not even worth the $0.66 I paid for it.  The controls are clunky and slow to respond, the game is rife with infuriating artificial difficulty, and no matter how many times you play, you will always have to rely on luck to win. Plain and simple. Power-ups are the life blood of surviving, and those just so happen to be randomly generated and you may not get anything useful at all. As the game progresses, more and more enemies are thrown at you, so it becomes a 'shmup shooter'; a poorly crafted one.  The bottom line is that this game for masochists should end up just like the game's protagonist - in Hell.
9534	0	a	So I first have to say that this game it's not worth 5 dollers but lucky for me I got it for 49 cents but it looks more like a browser game than a steam game. It is fun for 15 minutes and it can be some what funny but it just didnt do it for me.

9540	0	a	I love the idea and it WOULD works fine, the only problem is: the game get you everytime, everywhere, maybe you have sometimes a good run, but then you get some bad random generated stuff (like always) and you die and die over again.  The game seems more about luck instead of skill, hope for good items and this stuff.  THE GAME IS JUST UNFAIR i dont get it what everyone loves on it.

9545	0	a	Game is absurdly difficult. This would be fine in and of itself if it had any sort of difficulty adjustment for those of us who just aren't good enough to beat it, but it doesn't. So I wasted money on a ragequit engine.  Don't bother unless you're a masochist who enjoys permadeath, frustrating amounts of trial and error, and a luck-based powerup system deciding your fate.
9546	0	a	Not now that Rebirth is out.
9547	0	a	I really wanted to like this game but the anti religious overtones and overall bad design choices made it just frusturating and a waste of time in my eyes, maybe a good android game but not enough for a pc or system release.
9548	0	a	make ♥♥♥♥♥♥ zelda clone with next to no depth, sell for 5 dollars, make 15 dollar version years later and profit more than you deserve after comparing game development to being in a concentration camp  in all seriousness, the randomization is boring at best and unfair at worst, often giving you either gamebreakingly awesome item combos or ♥♥♥♥ for the birds, the art style is 'lolsofunny' ♥♥♥♥ and urine jokes because indie developers know nothing except phoned-in ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, edmund himself is an idiot, controls are floaty, flash is ♥♥♥♥, the remake is basically a cash-in, and in general it and rogue legacy are the perfect examples of why roguelike elements are actually usually really bad when applied to non-roguelikes

I feel sorry for anyone who might have to admit they had something to do with this game, or even worse that they think its funny or ok when its not at all. Maybe I could get behind the same exact game in like a zelda setting but this is wrong. you guys need like serious psychiatric help. For real.  Also, for the record I am by no means a fundamentalist right wing christian. I've Actually a male with 3 piercings below the neck and none are my belly button, and I have been branded like a cow 18 times. Ive filmed play piercings. all in all I am down with some sick stuff.

9559	0	a	The pros of this game:  Creative, inventive, fairly unique in its structure and gameplay demands.  The cons to this game:  Hospitals, care for the sick and dying, water for people to drink, love for the unwanted, strength for those who need it, compassion, and forgiveness. That is what I see Christians do, day in and day out. I'm around them all the time and try to live that life myself. I'm not perfect. Fortunately, I don't have to be. Should you choose to come and flame me after reading this review, I consider it unlikely that I will read what you have to say.  I understand that if you think Christians to be backwards, cave-dwelling simpletons who would kill their own children out of devotion to the voices in their heads, by all means, play the game. What that means to me is that you know Christianity from people who make their living by fleecing others on television, people who make the claim to faith and then sit around waiting for the check to arrive in the mail, or from some atheist professor who lives a bitter life of drinking champagne while offering you the opportunity to hear him or her drone on for hours in some lecture hall at greatly inflated prices.  Ultimately this game is profoundly offensive to anyone who live by a rule to respect others and their deeply held beliefs.

9566	0	a	How to get the Legend of Zelda on PC: 1. Buy this game
9567	0	a	Don't believe the hype. This game sucks.
9568	0	a	This one has me scratching my head. I know so many people that love this game, and there is always two or three thousand people playing it. The best thing this game has going for it is the sound track. The game-play is beyond repetitive, the player has to start from scratch every time with no load-out options, the enemies have so many advantages over the player, and there is no description for any of the items the player can find.  The attack that the player is given is bland and boring. Some of the fights become long and drawn out because of it. If running around in circles while using the same one attack over and over again is your thing, this game has awesome game-play.  There are a tone of usable items the player can find in the game, as well as equipment that give passive stats. To bad the first of each item that is found will have to be wasted, seeing that there is no explanation to what any of them do. A lot of these items will get the player killed the first time around, not knowing that it gives a de-buff.  I'm perfectly fine with the grotesque humor and art style. It makes the game stand apart -- not the game-play. A big emphasis was put on the random dungeon generation, which is all well and good; unfortunately, the game turns into a game of chance rather than skill. On multiple occasions I walked through a door only to find myself surrounded by enemies before having the chance to get two steps.  I wont call The Binding of Isaac a bad game, but I will say that it is not worth all the hype. Get it when it's less than a dollar.

I can't remember playing a game with wasd and the arrows since the 90s, incredibly awkward scheme. On top of that you can only shoot north, south, east and west. Nothing in between. On a game that is soley based on luck, I feel like thats F'ing BS. Go buy Nuclear Throne, Hero Siege or Enter the Gungeon because this game is trash.

9579	0	a	Waste of a dollar, this game is utter trash. People must be dumb if they think that shooting randomized objects on a flat surface makes this one of the greatest indie titles ever. Is everyone trying to be edgy? This is a trashy flash game yet the second top reviewer says it has 'polished graphics'. Wtf is wrong with people?
9580	0	a	I got this game for free and I don't even feel good about that. It's just like some really emo person re-textured the first Legend of Zelda game. The plot in the beginning seems to aim for making religious people look crazy. The game is pretty tough (coming from someone who's beaten both Dark Souls games) and you start over at the beginning every time you die. Figuring out the game is hard, for example I found some items in a room and when I touched what I guess was a dead cat I lost two of my hearts (for the rest of that playthrough) Definitely not worth playing and I don't see where all the hype about it is from. Plus the scenes with the main character crying while thoughts of what looks to be women lactating on him are weird and don't make any sense whatsoever.

9585	0	a	I play LOL, TF2, fable, State Of Decay. Yet this game on lowest setting and smallest, still has lag. the lag with highest setting is about 1/8th the and on the lowest 1/3 the trailers game speed. from what I read people who have old computers run the game fine. This game is a flash game that was horribly optimized. game can best be described as taking a bloody ♥♥♥♥ in the place that all the high school girls had abortions 0.000000001/100 the spider mod runs at a higher frame rate then the game itself  http://spidermod.spiderland.net/ 
9586	0	a	1,5 hours into the game so far. I think I had enough of this.  + Great hardcore oldschool gameplay. Nice music. - Amazingly disgusting art style. Simply revolting.  Seriously, the 'art style' is absolutely horrible: piles of crap, buckets of lard, ♥♥♥♥ puddles, torn out eyes etc. etc. and all of this in the concept of a naked baby running around basement and beyond to kill his mother in the end, NO THANK YOU!  I just can't recommend this. It's hideous.
9587	0	a	This is a great game, with many hours of gameplay, totally worth $5, but i wouldn't recommend getting it now because there is a remake with the dlc included and new stuff coming in november, so i would wait until then to try issac in the remake
9588	0	a	To me.. it's not funny game.
9589	0	a	This game will not even run when there is more than 4 enemies in the room. At one point fighting a boss I kept the button pressed but he would not go anywhere he was just stuck there. This game is built with ActionScript which is for Adobe Flash games. Looks like a great game but very poorly developed. Perhaps I will try again in a future update when they finally reprogram this game in an actual programming language. If you have under 5ghz processor stay away from this game it will stop working on you.
9590	0	a	Disgusting game, whoever made this is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥. I Don't want to sound hater-like or a threat, I'm just saying that this game is horrible and the story line is very disgusting and I would never make a game like this if I were you, this is terrible. GUYS YOU ARE GIVING POSITIVE REVIEWS TO A GAME THAT IS ABOUT A MOM KILLING HER OWN CHILD, OMG???!?!??!?!!! BE REALISTIC  Graphics 8/10 Story Line 1/10 Disgusting Gameplay 4/10 Whoever made this, I don't know what to say...  So who gives a ♥♥♥♥ who and from where did this idea come from, this is terrible, and really really brutal. A Big BOO for you!

9595	0	a	I can see why this game has such a huge following, but personally I:  1. Dislike bullet hells 2. Dislike roguelikes 3. Find this game god d-mned disgusting  If you like playing as a naked baby fighting tumor monsters, then BOY do I have the game for you! Couldn't refund, ultimately removed from my account because I despise this game, and was sick of looking at it in my library.
9596	0	a	UPDATE  I dont care if you liked it or not. I complained about some things. Dont get your knickers in a twist because of a opinion on a game you like.    UGH, Why?! Why do I have to?! 'YOu have to do it, its a part of our schedule!' Fine! I better get payed for this.....  (WARNING. THIS IS MADE FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES. DONT GET YOUR FLIES IN A TWIST. PLEASE, READ THE ENTIRE THING BEFORE COMMENTING ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ STUFF.)  Ugh, where do I start? I clearly see gorey enemies, im fine with that....Im glad that I played it.....     - DIFFICULTY LEVEL -  Oh my GOD, either this game goes from easy to horrific, and its easy to get this game under your skin, like, very easy. 5% of the time, its easy. But 95% of the time, it will tear you in half and eat your insides! The weapons seem innacurate at times, the achivements are rare to get, the bosses are 4x harder than a regular enemy. Like the pin. I have to get into a position as it jumps out of the ground and burrow right infront of me, as I am moving to not get hit. Then, it will come out and shoot an acid ball at me, and burrow AGAIN. Repeat cycle. Thats the Pin boss. WHO THOUGHT OF THAT? Its like coding a game about a sqiruell and making it about a zebra. ON. PURPOSE.    - BUG LEVEL -  This game....Doesn't have many bugs. Or any, really. The biggest one was not dying from an enemy. Get it? Hahaha! Heh.......heh....That joke sucked.......This game seems bug-free, wish I thought was impossible.    -OVERALL LEVEL-  Its a bad to meh game.  The animation is horrible The graphics is......Ehhh... The weapons are weird Its overly weird The controls are.....Ehhh... I wasted more than 15$ for the Binding of Issac game, and the DLC.  Not worth the time, effort, or money to play this game. Its a Good game at best.  Please, dont play this. If you do and win, you have more patience than me.  Still though, this game can be fun, gorey, and weird.
9597	0	a	Waste of money.  90's graphics and 80's gameplay. Not the worst game I've bought on steam but definately that half of the scale. Save your money!  UPDATE : After the overwhelming posite reviews I thought I'd put a bit of effort in, thinking maybe I missed something. No, didn't miss much. I can positively absolutely confirm that this game IS A LOW QUALITY CRAP GAME!   Update 2: After trying to play this crap again for over an hour.  Here is a grown up point of view. The graphics are horrible. A 12 year old could draw better grahics. A circle, box and 4 lines is the main character.   O [ ]--   | \ Most of the enemies are stick figures or bouncing circles of different colors.  Gameplay is near pointless and resembles that of the 80's arcade. Same thing endlessly! Randomly generated rooms with random doorways. You can't aim properly, and minor obstacles stop you in your tracks and often prevent you from obtaining the keys etc. This leads to many times being unable to continue as until you kill all the circles, squares of squiggly lines and get the key you can't move on in some rooms. The music is just annoying and after a very short time will be turned off. The sound effects are definately low tech and appear to be an after thought Many time you end up with nowhere to go so you have to start again like I've stated and the boss levels are ridiculously hard and make no sense. Shoot them 50 times they shooot you twice. Your dead! The younger players seem to like it as the endless reviews like 'Awsome game', 'Really Fun', 'Best game ever' 'Funnest game' etc showing that it does have a place for children or those children at heart. Hmmmm! If you are over 12, and want a little bit of intellectual game play then AVOID THIS! IF YOU ARE 12 or less age wise or have the mentality of herpies and are looking for a button masher, random generated 80's style, poorly executed, dungeon game that requires just simply randomly walking around shooting circles or triangle or stick figures then BUY THIS GAME or get your mummy and daddy to buy it for you! Its cheap for a reason! If you do like the 80 style monotonous type games then there is far better games than this, and far better value.
9598	0	a	Too hard, too weird. Like Sperlunky, permadeath made me give up on even trying more than a few times.
9599	0	a	While I enjoyed the simplistic yet effective game mechanics, I can honestly say that the game made me feel uncomfortable to the point I didn't want to play it any more unfortunately! S: The Binding of Isaac seems to focus on being as grotesque as possible themed on lovely stuff such as feces, abuse, and fetuses. I guess that's kind of the part where it slid straight past my sense of enjoyment! D:
9600	0	a	I really want to like this game. I love the idea and mechanics behind it. But every time I think of loading it up, I get put off by the art style. Just a few too many dead baby/poop jokes. It's not offensive, it's just off-putting. If you can get beyond that, it's a unique and (I hear) challenging and fun experience. Just not gonna be for everybody.
9601	0	a	Fun and satisfying at first but demands way too much commitment (and luck) to finish it properly. Yes it kinda renews itself over time with the content you unlock, but you'll end up spending countless hours playing the same thing over and over again, with a gameplay that hardly rewards the skill you acquire.    
9602	0	a	The binding of Isaac and the war against the random Item generator!  This game screws you over just based on what does or doesn't pop up when you find a treasure room or beat a boss. You either get nothing but health or nothing but damage. So you run around with six or more hearts but still shooting basic tears or you're a glass cannon. One or the other.
9603	0	a	Good time burner, but nothing else.
9604	0	a	A compilation of nearly every bad game mechanic you could possibly think of complete with sloppy controls and a sense of humor more juvenile than a middle school locker room.  An excellent example of how NOT to make a dungeon crawler.
9605	0	a	There are free flash games on  Newgrounds.com  with more depth than this. Please save your money.
9606	0	a	I did not have fun playing this game.
9607	0	a	A flash game that should have stayed that way.
9608	0	a	It's pretty cool that games that are made in Flash and flat-out tell players to use third-party software for a pretty basic feature are allowed to be sold on Steam. I like the fact that Edmund McMillen is so incompetent at making games that he had to have someone remake it in an actual engine for a 'definitive remake' (that I have to pay money for again! Nice!). Leave your flash games on Newgrounds where they belong please, Edmund.
9609	0	a	This accessibility first look we checked out The Binding of Isaac. The Binding of Isaac is an action game where your trying to fight your way through a basement to escape certain death. from your mother. It’s definitely a dark story! This is from a mouse only gamer perspective:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n20XFRBytNw   I knew upfront that movement was keyboard based, but I was very curious about if it was still playable with a mouse. The game starts in windowed mode &amp; is borderless so onscreen keyboard is usable! There’s no options for Colorblind mode or Subtitles. As a matter of fact there’s no subtitles on the opening cinematic which explains the whole story.  As far as gameplay goes, as expected it is keyboard heavy! The movement of your character needs a keyboard or joypad. It IS playable with onscreen keyboard but was quite frustrating since I had to choose between moving or shooting. I was able to take down a boss by staying back and shooting but during advancing through rooms success depended a lot on the type of bad guys in each room. If the baddies were ranged or patted, I could carefully maneuver well enough to win but for mobs that were melee, escaping was many times impossible for me. You can shoot with your mouse which does help if nothing is chasing you. Completing a level of the basement was a huge victory but short lived since you begin back at level 1 upon death.  It IS playable with onscreen keyboard, keyboard only, or joypad. However, to me the frustration of not being able to move and shoot simultaneously via onscreen keyboard wasn’t worth devoting hours to. The lack of subtitles also was disappointing since the developer makes the opening cinematic the story of why you’re even running through your basement.
9610	0	a	Just a dull really. No idea why I've heard so many great things about it.
9611	0	a	THe binding of isaac is a proceeduraly generated dungeon crawler with random loot, rooms and enemies. It is also the most offensive and generally disgusting game I have ever played. It is the personification of isanity and malice. It was quite simply constructed to be offensive to as many audiences as possible. The beggining of the game shows a child under fear of murder by his own mother. This is followed by the first dungeon, in which isaac needs to use his own tears to fight the monsters within. That sounds bad enough, however throughout the game, more disgusting content is clear. As isaac finds powerups, he attatches them to his body in the most gruesome way possible.   This game has reduced any sense of respect i had for team meat and I would never want to meat this author. The binding of isaac is ♥♥♥♥ed up in the worst way and i wish i could remove it from my games list, as i am ashamed to own it. 0/10. 
9612	0	a	Friend bought me this game with the dc and everything. My first run saw me with brimstone and decent stats all the way to the depths where i was mercilessly ♥♥♥♥♥. 212 deaths later I still have not beaten mom once and resort to restarting each time until i get decent loot on the first floor.  This is not fun . This is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on legitimate difficuty for the sake of replay value. This is one of the worst examples of pinning a 5 dollar bill on the player and wishing him the best of luck that i've ever seen.  There should never be a time in any game ever where a player gets every room he can, stacks everything in his favor, and still does not have enough power-ups or weapons to beat a level. This is a textbook example of artificial difficulty.   That said, I still return to this game again and again. This is one of those games that is pure torture porn and only appeals to people who want to loathe their games and feel the sweetness of totally crushing them (even if it's only because the game finally threw the player a bone)  If this is not you. Do not buy this game.
9613	0	a	Up front, if you are at all interested in the game, look at the Rebirth remake. It's not based in Flash, it should have far less bugs, and the difficulty shouldn't change with the updates. It SHOULD be the definitive version, look for negative reviews there to see if new bugs have appeared.  I'm glad to be finished with this game, as the gameplay is just mediocre and tends to drag on with massive repetition. You are tasked with navigating (often with no map) floors full of enemies to find few items and the boss to get to the next floor. Bosses are constructed on around 12 concepts, using reskinned designs to pad out to the 40+ advertised. Several items have similar or identical effects. Rooms are always the same size, with no real visual variety. I understand that these limitations are largely due to being based on Flash, but WHO decided Flash was the way to go? Being programmed for Flash caused performance issues, achievement bugs, limited updates, and didn't provide many benefits. A mod is necessary just to allow  resizeable windows  and the option to backup save data, so thank the community for actually making this game functional. Speaking of save data, it's slightly important to back it up since clearing Flash cookies will wipe your progress. Cloud sync seems inconsistent, and problems are known to occur by using CCleaner. Flash should be reserved for free online games, not this.  Even in the Rebirth remake, the game is somewhat limited and dated. The visuals will appeal to some, along with the old memes and references. Gameplay is a light bullet-hell roguelike, with no twin-stick freedom to shoot. Animations and physics are awkward. Most of the gameplay is just brute-force trials, hoping the random items are decent. You are expected to beat the game at least 20 times to unlock most of the content, but not much variety is added. It gets tiring, and the only real challenge comes from the final 2 copy-pasted bosses. Those bosses require at least 16 completions to unlock, and they are only difficult because they break so many of the rules you are taught about the game. Enemies shoot projectiles in arcs, and you need to watch the shadows to know if you will be hit. These bosses fill the rooms with projectiles, and have blue shadows instead of black. The floor being blue, along with the projectiles, makes it artificially challenging. Just make the damage invisible at that point.  Luckily, I had limited deaths in normal play, and didn't really struggle with the game. The Candle item just breaks the game, and most runs have a few decent items. Most damage is avoidable, and Spirit Hearts make the game a breeze. However, getting most of these items and progress means playing slots, grinding through many rooms, and spending a lot of time seeing the same gameplay and bosses. I mean, the not-quite-final bosses that just constantly spawn small enemies, those are SO interesting to grind down slowly as half the time they are invulnerable. After playing this and Gish (a sleeper mediocre game that didn't get a raving fanbase) I really don't feel either has good game design or ideas.  I like shooters and roguelikes.  Tower of Guns  has amazing gameplay, far more variety, and progression not requiring beating the game 20 times.  Not The Robots  has strong gameplay, great variety, and progression that never requires beating the game. If you want a RoboTron game,  Ultratron  is one of many that actually supports twin-sticks natively. I really can't recommend the game concept, and I feel Rebirth will still have the same bad game design and issues. There's hundreds of hours potentially, but it's all the same rooms and bosses. But if you must get it, go for Rebirth. This edition has definitely passed its prime.
9614	0	a	This game is twisted and f*cked up in every way. It's one part tears, one part ♥♥♥♥ and eight parts heresy that adds up to 10/10 of pure awesomeness!  Why the down vote? I won't recommend buying it now because a remake is on the way called 'TBoI: Rebirth'. This remake will fix the most annoying thing about this game: it's flash based. That means lags, limited gameplay and no support for Overlay or high-resolutions.  With that caveat in mind, this game is awesome and I can't recommend it highly enough. It's classic Zelda in a very twisted world that is procedurally generated and with a huge amount of items. Every game you play is unique. It has loads of unlockables, achievements, and challanges. Go play this now!
9615	0	a	Dustforce truly is a work of art. I don't mean that lightly. The way it's animated plus its music gives it that title in my book. I can find myself playing one level for an hour, maybe even hours at a time. The frustration of losing levels is filled with relaxation and calmness because of the ambient music. The way the levels are crafted is truly mindblowing. They had a system in which you had to perfect a level to earn a key, and you would use that key to earn more levels. In layman's terms, to earn more levels, you had to perfect current levels. They ditched that and added an XP system in which you gain more XP to earn a key the more levels you play and perfect. I'm very glad they added this system and was skeptical about buying it. But now that I did buy it, I do not regret it even for a second. One thing I really love about this game is how you don't have to unlock base levels. In a sense, this game is open world. That sense is that many levels are available to you, and you can choose whether you want to advance into more challenging levels, or stay where you're at. To get an S in completion, you have to sweep up EVERY leaf, and to get an S in Finesse, you have to maintain your combo throughout an entire level.   Another thing I absolutely enjoy about Dustforce is its expasive community. There are lots of Community Workshop maps for you to sharpen your skills on, and lots of people who can set a good example. I'm sure most of the people who get best times on all the levels have a Youtube channel, so you can probably catch them there. The community may or not be active, but it sure is good and friendly.  Overall, in terms of gameplay, music, artstyle, animation, and difficulty (it's not an easy game, but it's not that hard of a game either. It just depends on how much you want to play it), I rate this game:  10/10 BUY THIS GAME.
9616	0	a	If you like internet jokes, you'll like this game because you're an idiot.
9617	0	a	it sucks
9618	0	a	I havent playing this game much but thats because it just isnt that interesting to me. its basically the same thing over and over.. i had high hopes for this game based on the other reviews but unfortunately i was let down. I tried to enjoy this game but i felt like i was forcing myself to play.
9619	0	a	quite possibly the most ofensive tgame i have ever played. the antagonist is a maternal figure. we all know that mothers have the hardest life of any person on the planet. there is reference 2 the protagonist ♥♥♥♥♥♥ his mother. i do not recomend thsi game.
9620	0	a	Excellent idea. It's similar to the old Zelda dungeons. However, only 4 directional shooting...nope. That's a game killer for me. This isn't the 1980s. I expect much much more.
9621	0	a	an aesthetic that's stuck in the year 2000 where dead baby jokes and flash games where you give the backstreet boys black eyes are the leaders in internet creativity. embarrassing
9622	0	a	This game is a trap. It gives you the impression that you have control over whether you win or lose, but in reality you only have the ability to lose. The game decides whether you can win, as after a certain point it becomes actually impossible to win without a certain amount of certain upgrades. This means that some percent (40-50% in my experience) of attempts are complete wastes of your time. If you don't care about winning, this doesn't effect you, but everyone else who tries hard to beat this game is getting fooled.
9623	0	a	This game made me derpressed and now I can't go to school because they think I'm mentally unstable.
9624	0	a	Truth be told I was not sure what to expect with The Binding of Isaac.  Thematically you can push the notion that it's an imaginative biblical study, or one that focuses on mental health crisis's in families, or that it's a reflection on childhood trauma...  And that's fine, story &amp; inferences in games are great but when the gameplay is reminiscent of the frustrating 4 way directional combat of the first Zelda game, and the random spawning of items &amp; creatures isn't so well measured as it is in games such as Diablo, Isaac simply isn't a very fun game.  With that being said, if you are a fan of the first Zelda's combat (which only really improved with A Link to the Past) and are admittedly skilled enough to get through the game without much trouble, then I am certain you'll have a better time with this than I did.
9625	0	a	Flash game worthy of Kongregate. Also not a roguelike.
9626	0	a	Really just too difficult. I've spent around 20 hrs on this game and I have yet to get anywhere with it. But if you've got a lot of free time - knock yourself out! Not nearly as fun or good as Super Meat Boy in my opinion. 5/10  Edit: Achievements don't work on Mac either. Even if you log on to your PC.
9627	0	a	Game bores me 
9628	0	a	This game has a nice idea to it and i feel obligated to play it but i just cant without co-op. Without the co-op feature i just never feel like playing it. i always say its gotta have co-op because friends makes everything better. This game with friends would be a great time full of laughs and wtf's but alone it has this dullness to it and it is more of just a pass time when none of your friends are online and your really bored and you have nothing else to do. I really wish it was co-op because i would of loved to play it with my friend, because of the cheap 5 buck price it would have been great if you dont know what to play with a friend you could buy it quick and play do a good play through or 2 then move on to different game. but sadly that is not so. in conclusion i would have recommended this if it had co-op

9633	0	a	This game is simply stupid and bland. It is a blatent rip-off of the original legend of zelda! It is supposed to be a more casual game but every single time you want to play it you have to sit through a disgusting 5 min clip that you do not care about. It is a waste of time and if I could get my money back on it I would.
9634	0	a	Waste of $0.99. -_-
9635	0	a	Just... no. I got this one as part of a cheap bundle, and it is far too gruesome for me to ever recommend.

9640	0	a	Well, the first part. It's not the badest game, but with this flash crap and that You can't play it with an gamepad, it's an 3/10. The new Rebirth and After birth are Great (It's also kinda like an remake. 10/10 for both).
9641	0	a	I really wanted to like this game. Unfortunately, the game keeps sabotaging itself. The concept of roguelike meets Legend of Zelda dungeons sounds fantastic. There are also tons of items and unlockable characters. The soundtrack is good as well.   It's just a shame that the controls are garbage. This game is controlled like a twin stick shooter, except you can only move in 8 directions and shoot in 4 directions. That by itself is annoying, but the real kicker is that your enemies do not face the same restrictions. They can move and shoot with complete freedom, while you are stuck trying to awkwardly angle your shots at them. The developers even said that they tried giving the player more freedom of control, but it made the game too easy. Crippling the player's controls in order to make the fairly basic enemies more difficult is bad game design.   Another disappointment was the game's framerate issues on my computer, which I know can play much more demanding games than this. One last thing to mention is this game's sad attempts at humor. The tone feels like it was set by a 12 year old boy that desperately wants to be 'edgy' or something. Unless you still find poop to be hilarious, the game doesn't have much else to offer in that department.
9642	0	a	Absolutely no bondadge scenes. Complete disappointment
9643	0	a	TRIGGER WARNINGS: Ra.pe, Self-Harm, CIS/Male Privlage   What can I say about Binding of Isaac? The amount of fuc.king insensitive and misogony in this game is absurd. After experiences with previous games, I thought that I could do with a nice, rouge-like game. But, after playing it for literally 2 MINUTES the first item I found was 'The W.hore of Babylon'. It didn't stop there, I also unlocked the 'Emo' character, Eve, who's gimmick is SELF HARM! Upon beating the game with her as well, you unlock the Razor Blade, an item that increases your damage as you CUT YOURSLEF! Un-f.ucking-believible! Any it's no surprise a fat, CIS, white male created this one. Also the subtext under this game mirrors very closely to R.APE! Despite this I played this game for about a few hours - not very challenging btw - and gave it a chance to impress me but it was one offensive/childish thing after another. All in all, while it can be fun at the beginning, it quickly reduces in enjoyment from a mixture including blatant disregard of the players feelings, toilet humour and misogyny. If you want to replicate your experience go to 4.Chan and try to be a decent human being. Probably give it 9/10 at least.  #malescum #teammeat #kingkongkek #thewhitefuture
9644	0	a	The introductory movie was interesting and entertaining, but that is about all I can put in the pros column. The game play is something you'd see 15 years ago. I know, nostalgia is becoming all the rage, but it feels like a cop out that indie developers are using to put out poor production value. I'm not slamming all indie work, there is quite a bit of good stuff out there. Next, this is a rougelike. Again, I know rougelikes are becoming popular. But I just don't find it fun to loose all progress and start over from the beginning with a randomized map. It makes me feel like I wasted my time. I got a bit intrigued about the various items and collectibles, but you apparently have to use them to find out what they do, and even then I wasn't sure what happened. You can't jump on the Apple bandwagon of providing no user assistance, when your user interface is not intuitive. There may have been an interesting story here, but I'm not going to punish myself to unfold it.
9645	0	a	I can not recommend this game in the slightest. I hated every second I played of it and had absolutely no fun. However, I realize there is a large nearly cult-like following to the game that I don't quite understand. This sickness has taken a few of my friends, and while I will never let it take me under it's awfully dank and disturbing spell, I can see that there are many others out there that have embraced the dark stench that is The Binding of Isaac and either enjoy it wholeheartedly or have haphazardly drowned in the cesspit of dull gameplay, mind-numbing music and aesthetic, and an unfunny, grotesque, and frankly immature sense of humor.
9646	0	a	I cried on a bully hoping he would explode into bloody oblivion. Ended up having to beat him to death with a nearby rock. 4/10 for child sacrifice.
9647	0	a	Wish i could enjoy this :( I did enjoy it at the start, but as i got more items and enemys got more plentiful, i started getting massive delays between me pushing buttons and the game reacting (im talking 10 seconds here), which made it impossible to do play. It doesnt seem to have been brought up by many others, so i considered it being the fault of my computer, but i have a decent Pc that can handle games with much higher hardware requirements without problems, so i dont know whats up. until i figure out what is wrong or this is fixed, i cant recommend this game. it's gameplay, however, seemed great, and i can see why people without my problem would love it.
9648	0	a	This is a nice rogue-like with amazing art. Try the flash version on New grounds site before you buy because the play is unforgivingly hard.
9649	0	a	Trash with disgusting and disturbing images. DO NOT GET UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.  This game gets a 1/10
9650	0	a	very much NOT recommended. If your a christian like me anyway. This game makes fun of christianity so much its not funny. The entire storyline is so wrong and the monsters are just creepy  However I did find it fun for the little amount of time I played it. But I would recommend you buy Risk of Rain instead of this. Its the same rougelike concept of gathering random items that do different things and when you die you restart but its so much better.
9651	0	a	I bought this game during a flash sale. expecting it to be pretty good considering how talked up it is.  So far I haven't been impressed. Limited resolutions are one thing. When the game doesn't have native controller support but goes on to tell you to use JoyToKey to get it to work, I think that's a bit of an insult. I know that an option exists to enable gamepad support on games that don't have it, not putting in the support because a third party provides it and then making a point of saying that it's possible is just lazy on the developers part.  When it comes to the gameplay, I'm not impressed. You can make the excuse that it's just a flash game but rather than make the game seem better, that excuse makes it seem like the game should have been just put on a site like Kongregate and allowed to be played for free.   Compared to games like Rogue Legacy and Stealth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Deluxe, this game is very lacking. You would be better off getting one of the others. Gunpoint and FTL are two other games within in the same price range that are way more enjoyable than this.  This game really reminds me of 'Dot Dot Dot, a game review by AXMAN13' (check it out on youtube if you don't know about it) as those are the kind of emotions that are brought up when I play this game.  tl;dr Get something else. Even the $2.49 that I spent to get this game seems like it was way too much to pay.
9652	0	a	The game isn't exactly bad, but I personally didn't enjoy it. The challenge is basically dodging crap whilst shooting at weird stuff, and running around a zelda and rogue inspired maze, with some obstacles and lots of flies and poop.   I feel like the difficulty is too manufactured with it basically being you die and have to start from the beginning. I mean I guess its an original sort of idea with its nightmarish theme, but at the same time, the game doesn't pull me into to actually want to keep replaying it.   But I think the game suffers from too much repetitive gameplay for little player reward. And for me there isn't anything interesting in the game or anything 'gameplay-wise' original to enjoy.
9653	0	a	$h!t from a mans @$$. Dont give Edwin Mcmullen any of your money.
9654	0	a	I like the game, but you'll have a hell of a time getting me to play it. It's fun but tedious and kinda dickish, really. The absolute reliance on complete chance results in 'INFINITE REPLAYABILITY' on paper, but in practice it turns into '♥♥♥♥ING REALLY?'. It shouldn't be as bad as it sounds, but with more absolute ♥♥♥♥ items than worthwhile items, there's about a 75% chance of you getting kicked in the balls by something useless or of minimal value, which is then followed up by yet another item of absolutely no purpose. The other 25% of the time you'll be thanking *INSERT FAVORITE DIETY/MYTHICAL CREATURE/ELDER GOD HERE* that you finally got something good, which leaves you completely open for a double kick in the balls. I'd probably hate this less if there wasn't so much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ content to go through, as well. There's an absurd amount of stuff to fight, obtain, etc, but the chances you'll ever get to it without an absolute devotion to the game are slim to nil, really. This game hates you and wants you to die and to never play it again, and the only way to extract any amount of joy from it is to either be a really lucky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or have an absurd amount of time to burn.
9655	0	a	A neat little indie dungeon crawler the binding of isaac can keep one busy for hours, unfortunantly unless you are a die hard fan of killing things with tears, a few hours is more or less the maximum amount of time until this game losses it's playability and becomes repetitive.
9656	0	a	'A call back to games like NES Zelda where the game is self explained through gameplay'. Too bad your weapons are decided for you. If you pick up an item you didnt know you didnt want, you're out of luck for that game. The special items and cards are purely trial and error, you have limited uses of them and you only learn through using it before knowing what it's meant for, good luck memorizing every single one. There's little to no strategy: go to the item room, get the item (assuming it works with what you already have), find the boss room, if you find a card waste it to learn what it does incase you find it again, beat the boss, find health, repeat, good luck ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Thankfully, if you're getting too many hearts you can give some of your hearts to the Devil for attack power and give coins to Greed but there's no garantee they'll have something good and it might just waste time and resources. The game is pretty difficult, which isnt bad in itself, but that's nothing when you consider you have no control of what playstyle you're building around. You can plan to get all the health boosts and be a tank but you have to hope youre given the right items in the first place.
9657	0	a	phil fish is a retardt dont buy this game
9658	0	a	play a big boy roguelike instead. this game s unfun as ♥♥♥♥! and the aesthetics awful, def something a 15 year old who makes games on new grounds would come up with, total epic fail
9659	0	a	This game is ♥♥♥♥ing stupid i bought this game seeing the little boy naked and i thought it would be a mmorpg of a big oral ♥♥♥♥ scene with a little boy who got disbanded by his mother. But its about a kid who hides from his psycopathic mother whos fat at rahul chekuri on a friday and then he has 5 floors in his house like how da ♥♥♥♥ does his mom afford that she must give 50 ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s to hobos, lets get back to the story. so while running away from your mother you see all of your half aborted brothers and sisters. You brutly kill them and then u watch the 2000 hit Good burger then you fight this fat ♥♥♥ leg then in the end you become a little emo ♥♥♥♥ and kill yourself -10/10 would ♥♥♥♥ a wheel chair bad game do not buy
9660	0	a	To be honest, this game is alot of fun...WHEN YOU CAN ACTUALLY MOVE.....i have checked and it is not my computer..i have no idea why but this game chooses to lag like all hell when you enter a room with 3 or more enemies. Afterwards, the entire time you play till you close it....ITS LAGGY..like beyond bad..the lag is so bad that your movement is delayed and by that point its really pointless to continue..i made it to cave 1 and i was still lagging..  All in all, yes i do recommend this game, however i believe they need to..idk update it or something so its not so laggy i paid money for it and can't even play it!
9661	0	a	The Binding of Isaac is definitely worth $5, and is all around an okay-to-good video game. However, I do not recommend it, as there are much better games with similar gameplay, plot, and visual elements. To name a few, aLttP and aLBW (for the gameplay), Super Meat Boy (for the graphics), Paranautical Activity (for the RNG-based layouts, buys, and bosses), and Mad Father (for the themes of madness and   fighting a parent  ).  First, the graphics are visually intriguing, but ultimately disgusting (much of the game is based on urine, feces, blood, and tears). Nevertheless, they are well done. Second, the gameplay is very similar to that of the original Legend of Zelda; many of the enemies in Isaac are direct ports of Zelda enemies. However, the combat control is more difficult than that of Zelda: not more challenging, just more vexingly difficult. Third, the plot is okay. The opening is inspired by the biblical story of the same name, but the rest of the game's plot is shallow ( if  even existent) until the end, which [spoilers]still parallels the biblical narrative to a certain point in the plot. Not very creative.[/spoilers] It does pick up deeper meaning and amiguity later, but still doesn't compare to the plot of games such as Chrono Trigger, OoT, or even the Stanley Parable. Finally, the music is perhaps the best individual aspect of the game, but still nothing to go out of your way for.  While this game is worth the $5, its only noteworthy feat is how all-around  okay  it is. I would not say this is a good game, but rather an average game. Overall, I would give it a 7/10, without a recommendation.

9665	0	a	As Sun Tzu, you should read this review with the same intensity as you would 'The Art of War.' This game is only fun for the first 3 runs, and then you beat it completely. There is nothing new gameplay after you beat it, it just relies on, 'We will give you new items that are alright in the rarest of occasions.' as a way to compensate for this. The items are either game-breakingly amazing, or so terrible they make the game worse. This just makes most playthroughs of this game solely luck based as you can only hope you get a good items to beat the game or you just fail. Some will argue that, 'Oh, this makes the game harder or easier since you never know what you will get.' Which doesn't make a game good, it just makes it feel like I should be playing Russian Roulette for the same luck based fun. No matter how fast you try to beat it, a playthrough will somehow always take an hour or longer. With how much this game is talked about, I would've figured it was so much better than it actually was.

9670	0	a	I really do not recommend the game for people who cannot keep up with rogue like games and I certainly came to know the hard way after purchasing this and terraria to check what the fuss was about. I bought it on the basis that it was from the developer of time ♥♥♥♥ and the incredibly awesome super meat boy was really disappointed on the rogue like characteristics of the game thought it would be something different not into games like these and terraria and stuff like that. For people ho love those lind of games this is really worth checking out from that perspective it is really a nice game..
9671	0	a	I guess... if you like the old Atari Games and still own one or look forward to getting a smart phone so that you can download an Atari Emulator... this is the game for you.  Think of the first Zelda game. The camera is situated the same way and you control and fight pretty similar to that. Each time you play, the maps are randomely generated -- which may seem compelling, but to me, the game just doesn't have enough to really compell me. That's not a sales pitch. It might be if it were a game that I found entertaining, but there's something about this game that's just bland unecessarily morbid and stupid, lacking the plot necessary to continue playing it over and over again so that it can randomly pick which Boss you have to fight at the end of every level.  Nothing you obtain in this game will be permanent seeing as you have to start all the way back at square one the second you die.  I guess if you're looking for a sales pitch, the game is extremely difficult. It's easy to understand and play. But the difficulty is pretty high up there. If that's your thing, have at it. BUT, would I recomend this game... Meh. Not really. Too bland.
9672	0	a	After playing this game for countless minutes I figured, that i really don't know what it's all about. While the story of the intro is pretty funny, i find that the game it is not, it's rather boring. Really, it's terrible.
9673	0	a	I have to say 'NO' to this game. This game is not the kind of games that a gamer who plays FPS or RPG and never played indie will like or enjoy that much.. This game is not that hard , but the mechanics are a bit difficult and it takes time to get used to them.  I didnt enjoy playing the game, but im not a indea fan (so maybe this is the reason). BUT if you are an indie fan , buy it.  Edit reason : When I wrote the review I wasnt focused and used bad english . Now it is fixed.
9674	0	a	I did not care for this game at all. It a low-res asteroids with a tacked-on bias against any sort of religion that is just ham-handed at best. This is not the place to come for subtelty or parody. No. This is a crazy religious lady who decided to murder her son. Finally! *eyeroll*

9677	0	a	Frustrating, not worth the time I spent on it, but nice gameplay.
9678	0	a	When does this game get fun? Controls are loose and sloppy, framerate is all over the place, and the game runs in a tiny window. The pacing of the combat is very slow and there isn't much depth here. Despite the slow combat, you will still die all the time because your weapon shoots slowly, does very little damage, and most of the enemies fly/shoot over the obstacles which fill the rooms. Hit detection is unforgiving, so it's easy to get stuck on the edges of objects while you try to maneuver away from swarms of enemies. It's a shame because the concept is solid and there are tons of cool items, secrets, and power-ups to discover. Unfortunately the fundamental mechanics are broken. Hopefully the upcoming 'Rebirth' (non-flash) version of the game will fix these problems, but the current version is trash.  Also - unskippable 2-3 minute story cutscene every time you start up the game. Binding of Isaac does not respect your time.  Good alternatives to this game: Smash TV, Robotron, Pocky and Rocky.  To clarify - this is the OSX version of the game. Maybe other versions are better, but I'm reviewing the version I actually played. If the developer doesn't want to get bad reveiws then they should do a good job with all versions they release.
9679	0	a	Hey guys, I hate Christianity! Am I cool yet, internet?
9680	0	a	I picked this game up for about 2 bucks a year ago, and didn't around to playing it until recently. I don't really have anything good to say about the game. I don't think I actually like anything about it. The music didn't move me, the controls are ok I guess, I didn't enjoy the art style and thought the overal design of the game wasn't very good. I enjoy difficult games, this one just has no redeeming factors for me. Plenty of better flash games out there that do what this does but better, and they don't cost a thing.

Not a fun game for me, and this is one of those rare occasions where I don't understand why other people love it so much. The game  feels  bad to play. Can't remember the last time I've said that about a video game.
9685	0	a	couldnt find the magic mirror to leave the dark world. kept dying. 2/10
9686	0	a	I know I'm in the minority on this one, but I hated this game. I literally liked nothing about it. Got it in a bundle and tried to enjoy it, but it's just not my kind of game overall.
9687	0	a	To be honest, this game is not as great as everyone says. I enjoyed Newgrounds growing up but this random generation that decides your play though makes the game more luck than skill which for me, tends to become aggravating. I enjoy having some sort of guide or at least hint on what an item does once acquired.. Nothing more aggravating than trying a newly acquired item that end up killing me. This game is just not for me.
9688	0	a	(I don't own this game but I played it from Family Sharing Beta.)  This games have a lot of qualities you have probably heard of. The graphic style is kinda.. unique. There is a lot of objects to discover, some can be very powerfull. There is a good variety of ennemies and an excellent variety of bosses.  But there is one thing I can't accept : The game is strongly unbalanced. You will need as much luck as you'll need skills to progress through the game. If you do a better run than usual, it is because you picked something over-powerfull while you can spend a full run beeing thrown troll-bombs and curses in the face. Somes bosses are too easy (I always beat Dukes of Flies without beeing hurt) while other will ask you very good reflexes to survive (like the Spider, I don't remember the name). I asked my brother (who Shared the game to me) about the sacrifice room. He told me that each time you hurt yourself in that room, there is a chance to get a chest of a random rarity. Find a better way to ruin a run.
9689	0	a	If the developer could fix the bug that the achievement cannot be unlocked under Mac version, probably I will enjoy this game much more.
9690	0	a	Difficult,  I have over twenty hours into this game and I haven't even gotten to the final boss. A lot of winning is just luck in what skill ups you get in each level, it's fun to mess around with but it's more frustrating than fun in my opinion.
9691	0	a	Games that are hard for the sake of being hard rarely appeal to me.  This one is no exception.
9692	0	a	It would probably be decent if it had controller support. Trying to play a game like this on the keyboard is just painful.
9693	0	a	I really wanted to like this game, but sadly, it is incredibly overrated. It's fine for a few playthroughs, then becomes a game of luck. I'm a big fan of roguelikes, but having item chests after bosses that could contain any item in the game? It took away the fun, for me. Get the best/most fun items? Good for you! The game is a blast. Get only money or health for 10 playthroughs in a row? Boring throw-away, a total waste of time where you didn't even learn about the game, or strategies, or take away anything other than frustration. The enemies are interesting and different, as are the bosses (also randomly selected from a short list), that's the only real good thing I could possibly say about this game. Overused poop and fetus jokes just compound on the nails-on-a-chalkboard irritation I found myself having.
9694	0	a	It is challenging game ... true, but somehow annoying and boring. Wasted money. After uninstall I felt relief.
9695	0	a	Unnecessarily blasphemes and very gory and violent.
9696	0	a	so apparently im not giving enough descrption to my review. Don't get me wrong isaac is a preatty good game but many things put me off from enjoying this game as much as id like to. First of all the bosses. There are 4 types of bosses Easy as heck, Boring long and tedious, okay, and hard as balls. Theres no common standard to the bosses making some look like chumps but osme hard as heck to beat. One of the joke bosses is larry due to the fact hes so easy anyone can beat him but there are bosses like Gerdy that are near impossible to beat. Also there is annoything long bosses like fistula and duke of flies. There so long to beat without the proper equips that the battle will go forever. The ok bosses are most likely the horsemen, loki, monstro, isaac,blue baby, and satan(the last 3 are end game bosses). Another thing is the randomness. This is what really kills the game because for a whole playthrough you can only get space items or only health items(had both happen before) making later levels impossible. Also, enemies go witht eh bosses some are to easy while others are to difficult while some are annoying. There are to many to name so the annoying ones are the backside vulnerable only zombies and the super jumpers. Overall the randomness and difficulty scaling really kills the experience of an overall solid game.(also, i see alot of the negetive review being basehd for honest opinions which I really can't understand seeing as feed back is nececary for improvement.(There are still trolls though negetive them as much as possible)

9703	0	a	How does a game like The Binding of Isaac get made? Here is a game that appeals to no audience I can think of, and yet it is playing on thousands of screens. The only logical explanation I can come to for this game's existence is that Mr. McMillen has some very incriminating photos of someone at Headup Games.  Our title hero, Isaac is a dweeb. Not a funny one, or a likable one, but a pathetic dweeb who seems to live in his own world. Isaac hails from a small Midwest farm town, where he works as a boy at a house, until he's fired about two minutes after the opening game credits. He goes to a basement, where they decide to cheer him up by killing him. Seconds into dieing, Isaac recognizes the star as being his mom. Rather than be horrified, he is entranced by the idea that his mom were once in a bad. It's at that moment he decides that it's his destiny to kill his mum as well, and decides to head to California and make it in 'nude movies'.  Isaac arrives in Hollywood with big dreams, but seemingly little common sense, as when he auditions for a mac and cheese commercial, and immediately drops his pants and starts jerking off in front of the horrified director and casting crew. Fortunately, the monster on the commercial shoot used to work in the killing babies business, and directs Isaac to someone who can help him. The first person Isaac meets is the monster Peep, who is currently the biggest thing in the movies (in more ways than one), and immediately shuns him. He's later introduced to another ♥♥♥♥♥♥ boss, a down on his luck porn director who is so desperate to make a movie, he's even willing to give Isaac a shot. The audition does not go well, as when Isaac drops his pants, his 'manhood' is revealed to be literally microscopic. He also has a tendency to start screeching like a monkey whenever he sees a woman take her shirt off, and starts shooting off blasts of his 'man juice' like a shotgun all over the room and ceiling.  Let me stop this plot synopsis, and ask a simple question - Does this sound like a Game you would want to play? Does it even sound like a game to begin with? I find myself returning to my original question, how does a game like The Binding of Isaac get made? It holds absolutely no laughs, its lead character is an unlikable schmuck with an overbite and not a shred of knowledge of how to behave in social situations, and there's literally no plot to speak of. Just one situation after another for Isaac to humiliate himself. As the game dragged on for nearly 100 interminable hours, I came to realize that the entire gameplay revolves around three basic themes. 1:) Isaac. 2:) Isaac has a small ♥♥♥♥. 3:) Isaac ♥♥♥♥♥♥s instantly every time he sees a woman take her shirt off. The games repeats these same themes many times, as if it thinks if it repeats them enough, it will wear down our defenses, and we'll eventually start laughing.  Back to the plot - Isaac's disastrous audition winds up on the Internet, and becomes a sensation. This inspires Mom to give the guy another chance, and come up with a new form of porn that is non-threatening to guys (because they know they're better than Isaac), and is reassuring to women, since they know they are sleeping with a better guy than Isaac. Somehow, this idea takes off, and Isaac becomes a major star in the porn industry. He even sweeps the porn film awards, which is hosted by Pauly Shore, who plays himself in a cameo. It also means that this is probably the worst movie Pauly Shore has ever appeared in. (And no, I'm not forgetting BioDome.) While all this is happening, Isaac also strikes up a relationship with a sweet young waitress named Kathy (Christina Ricci). Kathy seems like a bright young woman, and Ricci plays her with charm. So, why is she hanging around Isaac to begin with?  Looking back over my review, I see that I have left very little out. This literally is all there is to the game. There's no real conflict, other than a very halfhearted falling out between Isaac and Mom that exists solely because the game was nearly 90 hours old, and nothing had really happened so far. This is nothing more than a story of an insufferable schmuck who goes to Hollywood, gets a job in porn, and falls in love with a nice girl. That's all. There's a hint of a subplot concerning the jealous monster, Blue Baby trying to ruin Isaac's career. But this is so unmemorable, it could be cut from the film without anyone noticing. Why did it take three people to write a movie where virtually nothing happens? A movie that's quite clearly dead.  Yes, The Binding of Isaac is a dead game. It shows no signs of life or inspiration. It doesn't even have the decency to be a lively or memorable bad game. It just sort of lies there, not doing anything, and then asks us to leave 100 minutes later. Those who know me know that I never wish ill will upon anyone, but I seriously think that a movie like this could end careers. I hope that doesn't happen. I'm sure McMillon is a nice and funny guy in real life. I'm also sure he'll be apologizing for this one for a long time to come.
9704	0	a	Cool game, but virtually unplayable because of Flash.  Wait for the remake.
9705	0	a	random generating levels where all the rage when this came out. i mean minecraft did it, so why not this game too? because a zelda like dungeon kinda needs to have a well planned out layout to make the game intelligent and fun to play. this game is random, one play through you can start out with getting wicked good items and just wreck havoc, but other times youre garanteed dead.  also its ugly and not funny like meatboy was.

9711	0	a	why is this on steam it's a ♥♥♥♥ing flash game
9712	0	a	This game has made me go through the entire opening sequence every time I start the game. Not to mention Isaac has ridiculously low health, the combat system is terrible and there doesn't appear to be a saving mechanic that I have found.  Terrible, terrible game. Good thing it was only $5
9713	0	a	not as good as mario
9714	0	a	I'll be the uncool guy and point out that this is a super emo flash game with no gamepad support about hating your mom and crying at flies.
9715	0	a	Yes, this game is hard. But did I find it fun and needing to be conquered? Unforuntately, no. I really wanted to get into paying this, but for some reason I don't find much pleasing about it except that the story is creative.
9716	0	a	So i decided to give this flash game a try, it was sitting in my library for a while now so.  It turned out to be a fun game, wow, i was really having a blast, i got some cool powers and i beat it first try with no problems.  I started a new game and this time was even better, i was the devil and i was shoting 3 bubles at the same time. All good until i got killed because of lag, ¿lol? what kind of netcode this game uses?, its a single player game and it lags? ok fine, ill use a checkpoint....WRONG. you have to start over.  Are.you.$%&amp;&amp;//.kidding me? what kind of garbage is this. whose idea was this?? honestly this is unaceptable, no way im going to start over again.......we had checkpoints systems in the last century, or even passwords, this is lazy development. Im quitting this game, and no, you cant have my stuff since i lost it all.
9717	0	a	Terrible game. From what I hear it's hate it or love it so oh well.
9718	0	a	Loved the game, for controller support you had to buy a outside prog... then they remade it and now they charge if you allready own it.. sry devs you allready made the $$$ to give us the content and support we even bought your expansions..

9723	0	a	Oh boy, a fat neckbeard with a mature game that has a message about something pertaining to abortion and relationships and internet memes and poop jokes. There's a lot of poop in this game. I think it's indicative of the game's quality, actually.
9724	0	a	Not worth the money, really this game is only a 'fun to watch' game. Nothing more. That or it's just not my game.  It might be that, but Northerlion has over 600 parts for this game, so... I guess it's just me.
9725	0	a	And ugly, pointless mess, that feels like I'm playing some game thing scripted up in a couple of hours instead of a polished action game. There's no weight or impact to anything - the original Legend of Zelda had a deliberateness to sword-swinging and walking around, much like Dark Souls nowadays, and all of these indie top-down action games feel like I'm gliding around on ice skates shooting a water gun at whatever blobs count as enemies.
9726	0	a	Beat it on my first playthrough the day I got it, it's pretty bad seeing as how the collision is worse than half the bullet hell games I play and the fact this game is very very slow paced, I wouldn't bother with it!
9727	0	a	REVIEW HAIKU  Don't know what to say  Confused by the basic theme  Perhaps you decide
9728	0	a	Seriously thought this was an epic game. Most of my friends told me it's really good and since I saw it at $0.99 i decided to buy it. Turns out this game just sucks. Not even worth my $0.99

9730	0	a	stupid game, there is no fun, i dont know why peaple play this
9731	0	a	Whereas Super Meat Boy is a perfectly tuned mechanical masterpiece that confidently invites you to master it, The Binding of Isaac is a sprawling junk heap of nonsense that doesn't even care if you understand it. ♥♥♥♥ this game.
9732	0	a	tl;dr? This is an actual negative review of Isaac. The story is unnecessarily dark which leads to only polarizing its audience more so than just the game would. The actual game has no controller support, which is dumb. It personally seems repetitive to me regardless of the rouge-like elements and got boring fast.   The Binding of Isaac's story is highly juvenile but just the fact that I’m seeing people call the story good is making me scratch my head it isn’t good. The dark themes in this game are highly unnecessary for what the game really is; a rouge-like dungeon crawler. The game sure has the Newgrounds feel to it, but what it’s missing is the humor, instead of having a dark comedy vive like how I thought it was going to be, it seems to be a lot more focused on the DARK part of that. The story is almost like it’s both trying to be taken seriously and not at the same time in the same parts which makes it both not funny and laughable at the same time.   Of course, you’re probably wondering why I’m harping on the story so much when it’s obviously not the purpose of the game. Reason is, because of the way the story it seems to only polarize its audience with one side either not caring about the story, or liking it because they’re hard-core atheists who like anything anti-religion; and the other side being people who aren’t comfortable with the story, or feel it’s distracting to the game. Again, this polarization seems very unnecessary since the story is a very minor part of the game. I feel like the game could have still had its own unique identity with a different story.  The Binding of Isaac really has nothing too wrong with it mechanically, though. Other than the fact that it has no controller support (some people don’t want to download a separate program just to play the game with a controller) and the game really is a controller game, the keyboard controls feel awkward as all hell. Besides, it might just be me, but even with the rouge-like elements the game feels very repetitive and it bored me pretty quickly.    
9733	0	a	this game is utter complete ♥♥♥♥ here's why  1.its random generated so you're gunna get either good ♥♥♥♥ or pure nothing which will make you die and force you to replay thru all the boring ♥♥♥♥ again  2. unbalanced as ♥♥♥♥ meanign you will be struggling to go thru levels cause the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game went'oh ok lets give u all key needed doors with no keys in the level' or' hey i know lets go face a boss with no hp' or' hey lets make a shop at lv 1 have a 15 cent item you will never get cause theres never that much cash on level 1'  3. items are ??? cause the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ developer went 'ok lets add items with no description anywhere of what it does cause i just can' like wtf does bad gas do??? seriosuly half the items don't tell you what they do and may be worthless  4. ♥♥♥♥♥♥ly optimized seriosuly you think its hard? try it with lag cause someone didn't kno how to develop a well oiled game instad they failed miseriably and made a game where even on low graphics still lags its 2014 get it the ♥♥♥♥ together!  5. no saving or any kind of fair gameplay in regards to the randomization seriosuly some of this ♥♥♥♥ is so stupid that its like game is forcing you to die cause of the mobs and layout spawned are near impossible to dodge and you end up dead  So yeah this game isn't difficult as some claim its ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t its unbalanced as hell and ♥♥♥♥♥ly optimized and apprently the creator couldn't even be ♥♥♥♥♥ to fix this in a update good job *sarcasm*

9735	0	a	This game is aids. Something to do when there's nothing else available. Enjoy it.
9736	0	a	Simplistic. There really needs to be a way to save game and a way to skip the opening. It just really sucks to have to start over and go through the long opening everytime you actually want to play this.  The cards are cheep though if you wanted a game easy to badge up.

9753	0	a	Desperately unbalanced and bad, annoying piece of garbage. At the beginning you'll think it's a cool, hard game. But then you'll realize it's rubbish. Entirely luck-based, with a side of shady charts that don't seem to matter. Basically, the game will deny you the items necessary to complete it.  What a garbage the game is, is in plain sight, In the very first level of basically 19 games out of 20: you'll lack the keys, the coins, or the bombs to explore it fully. So it begins and so it ends, you'll never have enough of anything to make levels play fun. It basically becomes a harder chore of killing things to receive a health drop so that you'll be able to tank the next room.  Additionally, drops are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. The only key to success is to have more damage, more atack speed and more range, and the items and the chances to have these delivered is basically non existant, and DECREASES the further you play (because there's more items).  The only way to play is basically to avoid damage for the entire level (starting from the second level), or to avoid damage in a boss fight, so that you'll be able to enter a 'devil room' where you have access to the only meaningful, true upgrades for your character. Needless to say, chances to avoid damage are basically ZERO even if you well know how to play, since you won't have damage, attack speed, or movement speed to achieve quick enemy kills.  I played it and completed it out of spite, using a trainer for infinite health and bombs, and even so, the game angered me, because i literally completed it 3 times with the basic attack speed and damage.  Do yourself a favor, steer away from this rubbish.

9756	0	a	Worst controls ever! The story seems to be interesting. The game is a little repetitive but it's possible to overlook it, since it's short. I found the game a little bit difficult, but that might be because of the controls. They are just very confusing. It's irritating. I'll probably never play this game again! The controls are to blame. Luckly I paid 1 dollar for it. That's the only reason I'm not ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off. Even if I liked the game, I still believe it's not worth full price. But with 85% off (less than 1 dollar) I recommend you buy it. There's a 50% chance you might like the game and it gives you 5 cards, so you can get your dollar back.

9761	0	a	 A basic game with creative visuals. Way too hard though, no extra lives so once you die you loose everything and start from the beginning, even if you hit Replay. The furthest I got was the third dungeon, health/weapons is too scarce, and it's impossible to get any good upgrades. Got fed up with it, not really worth anyones time.  2/10

9768	0	a	This is a RNG. The developer is an idiot. His unjolliness can be observed on twitter. If you have no issues with flash games, go ahead, but be aware you need third party modifications to make achievements work. Refer to sentence two.
9769	0	a	1,377th!
9770	0	a	Overrated.
9771	0	a	First off, the game itself is fun. Don't mistake this as saying the game is ♥♥♥♥, and with some work, it would be great.   The problem is that the developer is ♥♥♥♥. When you go into the options menu, you have a choice of 5 resolution options ranging from 800 to 1260. Your volume options are sound effects on/off, and music on/off, no volume bar. And lastly, there is zero controller support. I am aware that it doesn't say it has controller support on the store page, that isn't the complaint. It's that it wasn't made in the first place. To add insult to injury, it has a controller option under controls that says to go download a program called JoyToGo, then tells you to just 'google it!'. Lazy.  I understand that this game is cheap. It's not some AAA $60 game, but that is no excuse for being lazy and having almost no options. I could forgive the lack of controller support, this is a PC game, not a console game, but the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ resolution and volume options are too abysmal for me to recommend it at all.  Good idea, good gameplay, horribly executed, imo. I honestly can not play it in this state that it is in.
9772	0	a	I can't even play the game :(. Keyboard doesn't seem to want to work with the game. I used to be able to, but I just got a new computer and it won't work properly anymore.
9773	0	a	Ehh its ok but not worth 5$ would only buy it on sale for 90% which i did. I have not gotten far but really dissapointed so far.
9774	0	a	These flash games are too laggy, there's no reason to play this now that Rebirth is out
9775	0	a	This game seems very poorly optimised to run on my Late 2014 Retina iMac. Frames per seconds often dip to single digits.  I figured I'd give this a go after playing a lot of Rebirth, but the overall experience was pretty painful. Rebirth is definitely better optimised and overall a more fun game.
9776	0	a	joytokey... middle finger to you good sir... how about buy a car and tell the person 'Here's how to put the engine in if you don't want to walk.' This should be a facebook game for these reasons
9777	0	a	♥♥♥♥ game ♥♥♥♥ life :) 
9778	0	a	Let me explain myself before I review this game, as I expect possible negative feedback.   This is not a bad game. If it were I wouldn't have put almost 200 hours into it. However, the biggest problem I find with this game is that Rebirth exists. Binding of Isaac's sequel fixes the lag that was a major downside this game had, as well as improve art style, item combos and glitches that rendered some items useless (I'm looking at you Rusted Key). Rebirth is pretty much a direct upgrade from this game. That doesn't make Rebirth perfect though. The soundtrack in the original Isaac (this game) is by far way better than Rebirth's soundtrack.  As a stand alone game, Binding of Isaac holds fair when it comes to other games. However when compared to its sequel, it doesn't do too well. If you are thinking of buying this game, consider buying Rebirth instead. It's not that this game is bad. It's just that its sequel is better
9779	0	a	The controls for this game are straight from the dark ages.
9780	0	a	Love the engine, hate the content.   While it has the great randomly generated Retro Zelda-esque dungeons, the wrap around story, graphics, and concept are lacking taste, I simply could not get past the vulgarity, which is saying a lot. I am all for demonic things, blood, gore, and that dark genre that really draws the player into another world, but when the protagonist is an innocent nude, abused child being murdered by various nightmare creatures in his basement, in effort to escape being murdered by his mother, it plays like a really horrible independant horror film.   I would say this one is not for children, but honestly, I feel it is not for anyone.
9781	0	a	Extra-Hard dungeon crawler featuring massive amounts of perma-death and RNG.  The controls are easy to lose track of with mouse + keyboard, and as a result late-game just becomes spamming bullets while dodging bullets. The frequent comparison to Legend of Zelda dungeons is inappropriate, as this game misses many of the unique puzzles and rich backstory that made the latter great. If you're into perma-death bullet-hell games which rely very heavily on RNG to supplant difficulty, go ahead. Not my cup of tea, though.
9782	0	a	Good game overall, but now that rebirth is out i would get that instead, because it's more optimized, and has more features.
9783	0	a	No longer recommended. Play the remake 'Rebirth' over this. It improves the game in almost every way--graphics, variety, framerate, and game-feel.
9784	0	a	I don’t like the very limited shooting-control. Other than that, seems like a good top-down rogue shooter/adventure.
9785	0	a	It's not that its a bad game, but its kinda limited. Maybe it was because I was expecting more of an RPG in my 'action rpg' but it just seemed like a brainless shooter to me.
9786	0	a	I just bought this game and the bloody sound doesn't even work, i've tried everything!
9787	0	a	to old get the new game 'the binding of isaac rebirth'
9788	0	a	Go buy Risk of Rain.
9789	0	a	DONT BUT IT! Buy the new one Binding of isaac: Rebirth
9790	0	a	The lack of full controller support even with JoyToKey is the only reason I recommend waiting for Isaac Rebirth instead of this game.  But I only count for the 1% that situation applies to. The other 99% of you should get this game. Fantastic addicting rogue-like design, the usual perfect controls, huge amount of collectibles, no dominant strategies as loot is randomized and encourages you to adapt to what you receive.
9791	0	a	Only A Lifeless Basement Dweller Would Play This Game More Than 100 Hours. Do Not Buy.   
9792	0	a	ugh this is basically the least fun twin-stick shooter I have ever played. Who the hell thinks a twin-stick shooter where you can't shoot diagonally is a good idea. Everything else about the idea of a Robotron roguelike sounds great on paper but that really ruined it for me.  Also it's written in Flash and thus often runs with a framerate of '♥♥♥'. Which I guess is appropriate for a game with so much fecal imagery.
9793	0	a	Hidden luck stat is dumb  3/10 would not have bad luck again
9794	0	a	this game is horrible, I payed 5 dollars just for my keyboard to be not working with the binding of issac, and i would like my money back.
9795	0	a	Crude hummor but fun game, well worth the price for who doesn't already own it from the handfull of humblebundles and 90% off Steam sales it has been in. But with that said with all the fixes and new content and what not I can not suggest getting this one over Binding of Isacc Rebirth, which includes all the content from this and its DLC Wrath of the lamb plus about twice as much content on top of that, not to mention better controls, and better item synergy with items that use to not synergize with anything.  While this game you can play for hundreds of hours and not see the same run twice with each run feeling unquie to the last (apart from the few items that don't synergize with other items making the run feel the same as another with it) you will definitly get your moneys worth out of it.  Because of that I can not recommend this game because Binding of Isacc Rebirth contains all this games content plus a lot more, runs smoother, and what not. So I suggest if your interested in this game pick up Rebirth instead even though it costs (currently) $15 as a pose to this versions $5+$3= $8. Spend that $7 more and get the better version, you won't regret the little bit higher cost for what you get.
9796	0	a	Great game with so much replayability but at this point I would just wait for rebirth to come out 10/10
9797	0	a	Because I ♥♥♥♥ing love memes!
9798	0	a	THE game is pain in the ♥♥♥! if u enjoy sach pain then this game is for you with no checkpoints and no save game if u have some problem you will start over again i want my money back!!!!!!!!
9799	0	a	If you are a completionist, this game will drive you completely insane.  Top-down Zelda dungeon style combat is the name of the game. With dozens of pick-ups and strategies to learn, The Binding of Isaac is also rife with religious symbolism, not all of which immediately makes sense, and elements of cartoon horror.  The story is open-ended and full of symbolism. Depending on who you are, it either doesn't matter and is just an excuse to get you fighting severed heads and corpses full of flies, or it's a deep metaphorical examination of escapism through gaming. Both viewpoints are valid.  Gameplay can be difficult to pick up for some due to the divide between firing and movement controls. Some pick-ups will completely change the battle mechanics and require a whole new learning curve to master, which might turn you off the game, or might intrigue you.  The concept and mechanics work well, but the fact that the game is run in Flash makes the action unreliable and can mess up the difficulty curve or screw with you by slowing down the game. Now that Rebirth is out, there's really no reason to play the original. The new edition looks better, plays better, and has a bunch of new content.
9800	0	a	Everyone loves this game.
9801	0	a	Buy the sequal. It is literally better in every way possible.
9802	0	a	So...Yeah... Someone decided to make a Legend of Zelda clone with randomly generated dungeons and challenging gameplay. Seems like a good idea. But hey wait! You know what I always felt Zelda needed? Some blood. Well okay, yeah we have the technology now... How about monsters that vomit blood? Ooo, and some biblical references. And tarot cards! And the Devil! And lots and lots of feces. Aw, yeah man! I love feces!.... Published.  Just play The Legend of Zelda.
9803	0	a	Seeing how BoI: Rebirth is out, buy that instead.
9804	0	a	I lack to see the hype that is/was, I got very VERY bored within the first 10 minutes of playing.. not to mention lack of variety within the game itself.  I'm aware the game is darkly themed, but the lack of variating colour is rediculously underwhelming.
9805	0	a	This was great when it came out, but Rebirth is this plus a whole lot more. That, and unlike this, Rebirth isn't in Flash and thus doesn't suffer from serious slowdown issues. What I'm saying is go buy Rebirth instead. If you want something akin to the graphical style of this, Re has a built-in filter you can turn on.
9806	0	a	Unless you want to pay money for what is literally a flash game, don't waste your time.
9807	0	a	10/10 would not play again
9808	0	a	In this dark and edgy adventure, you cry on ♥♥♥♥. Then other ♥♥♥♥ happens, like unfunny memes and dead babies. The only deepness in this game is the crater in your head of you like this game.  If you like dead babies, get an abortion. It's a better experience overall, Micy D's needs its burger meat.
9809	0	a	The Steam Achievements don't work on mac ;(  But if you don't care about Achievements then buy this game now ;)
9810	0	a	I can not even start the game and it crash's Help Plz?
9811	0	a	Don't buy this. Buy The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth. It's a ♥♥♥♥ing fantastical remake of this. Rebirth runs faster, has so much more content, and has a balanced hard mode unlike this one's hardmode that just makes enemies tedious as ♥♥♥♥ to kill.   Please buy Rebirth.
9812	0	a	When I first played the game, I was very hard on it. I thought the mechanics were horrible and I do not like rogue-likes. However, after a few playthroughs I came to understand that it wasn't about winning on the first try, but it's one of those games where both success and failure makes you stronger.   Then I came back to it after some time away and realized how much of a hack it is. The update bends the game even more towards luck and as the engine strains shows exactly how poorly implmented it was in the first place.   It's not completely bad obviously as I've put a lot of hours into it, but those same hours have illustrated to me exactly what the game does right and what it does wrong, and with the latest update the 'bad' category has reached a tipping point.  Now some people may like how much of your survival is left up to pure random chance now, but I'm not one of them. I would rather promote intelligent design over mechanics that are inspired by truly awful design from the old 8-bit era (I've beaten Battletoads; the 8bit era is full of terrible mechanics).   The series seems to pride itself on delegating a lot of the experience to pure random chance. When it works, the experience is very rewarding but when it doesn't it's just frustrating -- and my problem with this is that other developers look at the success and think it's purely from the random chance factor but that's only a single factor in several variables. On the new hard mode, several variables involving the pacing are just tossed to random chance and the developers seem to be OK with this but I'm not and hence I've removed a positive review.  If you'd like examples of better balance, I would recommend 'Our Darker Purpose' (which is extremely difficult but so far failure in that game feels more like a lack of skill than just pure bad luck and whose developers are considerably more mature), 'Risk of Rain' (more customizations to the game play which makes it feel like the developers cared more about player experience), or 'Dead Pixels' which combines the randomization with a save function (and is a better experience than any of the 'Left 4 Dead' games, surprisingly enough).  It's not a bad game but it's not something I would recommend to anyone anymore -- there are far superior alternatives by more mature developers.
9813	0	a	I hate when you are thrown in big action rooms right in the beginning without evolution. I prefer when they let me accustom to the game before it gets hot.
9814	0	a	I only don't recommend this game because of Rebirth, it is literally so much of an improvment upon this, that this becomes garbage, even as a cheaper version. Great game I suppose, held back by flash.
9815	0	a	This is truly an amazing game. But there's almost 0 reason to even buy this game anymore because The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is out and that game takes everything amazing about this game and makes it even better. If you are thinking of buying this game, go and buy Rebirth instead.
9816	0	a	the game has stopped working :(
9817	0	a	Buy rebirth instead, new Eternal Edition isn't good.
9818	0	a	This game, while fun on the website, is extremely laggy! I changed the graphics to the worst ones possible, and nothing. Sometimes, when I try to move, the game takes a few seconds to make me move. I purchased this on sale for $1.69, and I would say that's not worth it.
9819	0	a	just buy rebirth
9820	0	a	The game can seem enjoyable at first but it is just too hard for the adverage play the binding of isaac rebirth is much easyer than the first i highly recommend waiting untill you have enoughf money to buy rebirth which is much more fun and easy than the first
9821	0	a	If you want to play Binding of Isaac you should get Rebirth insted of this. It may be more expensive but it is well worth it since the engine and the graphics are updated. The game also runs much smothwer
9822	0	a	Maybe I just don't get it? It's like an old-school NES Zelda game, but really ♥♥♥♥ed up. I got it because the reviews are so good, but I hated the grotesque nature of the game.
9823	0	a	game is suck didnt even know i own it
9824	0	a	After 100h its getting really boring.
9825	0	a	You're like a baby who hurls ♥♥♥♥ or ♥♥♥♥ or something at demons. Reminds me of my childhood. 3/10 would not recommend.
9826	0	a	if you like shoving ♥♥♥♥♥ up your ♥♥♥ and playing stupid games made in flash from newgrounds, this is the game for you  aka: the binding of you just paid for a flash game you can get on newgrounds
9827	0	a	I want to like this game but do I have to endure the opening every time I play. Mashing the keyboard didn't get me past the into. Killing the game was my only choice.
9828	0	a	This game doesn't work with my computer im am displeased i click on the game and it says prepareing to lauch game... as normal... but then it closes and the game doesn't even launch i've done every thing reinstalling and installing steam and the binding of isaac. and every time i look for a fix ITS ♥♥♥♥ING ABOUT REBIRTH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
9829	0	a	Isn't very playable, just go get Rebirth instead, you will be fooled otherwise.
9830	0	a	If you wanna pay money for what equates to a free flash game, go ahead. I like the game, but I can't recommend it because I don't feel it deserves a price.
9831	0	a	Meh. Somewhat original dungeon crawler, but once you get past the ♥♥♥♥, ♥♥♥♥, and blood everywhere, it gets old quickly.  It's worth a couple dollars to experience, but don't expect too much from it. It's really just a glorified free flash game.
9832	0	a	Believe it or not, this 'twin stick' shooter, doesn't support twin sticks. Yeah. Your only option is to use wasd, and the arrow keys. Can't rebind. That probably doesn't sound like that big of a deal, but my keyboard has the mini arrow keys. Left and right are full size, but up and down are half sized, which makes that control scheme unplayable for me. I have to use a controller, and the only way to use a controller is to download software which makes your controller buttons mimic the keyboard buttons. Huge pain in the a**. Not to mention, this game isn't astounding to look at, and it chugs down to a crawl on medium settings. Granted all I have is a run of the mill laptop, but still, it can handle these kinds of games. I should be getting about a hundred frames per second on high, and I actually get about 10 on medium at times. It's insane. Not to mention the controls are pretty still compared to most twin stick shooters. I mean, the game is fun, I guess, but it was an enormous pain for me to set up my controller, and the actual controls are so stiff that they frequently get me killed. Try rebirth instead, I heard they fixed all these problems, but I have too bad of a taste in my mouth to try that one.
9833	0	a	Wasted potential.  Shouldn't have taken edmund a sequel to fix his mistakes. Terribly optimized for most machines due to the outlandish decision to make this in flash, which is to say nothing of the playerbase (which mostly consists of powergaming ****heads).   There is literally no point in buying the first one now that the sequel is out. Spend your money elsewhere.
9834	0	a	♥♥♥♥ game made to be a piece of annoying ♥♥♥♥
9835	0	a	This game is really weird. I don’t like the theme at all and the gameplay is simple but nothing special. I paid less than a dollar for this game so I won’t count it as a loss but I doubt I’m ever going to give it a second chance.
9836	0	a	The item variety is cool but the game itself isn't as deep as some make it out to be, the depth is always essentially variations on the same core progression. Once the final (final) boss is beaten there isn't much else to do. and this means that at the end once everything is unlocked the core game can be beaten in about 40 minutes
9837	0	a	Accidentally brought the original. Get the ReBirth edition instead. This is more like a flash game. Fine as a taster, but you really want the other one.
9838	0	a	The gameplay at the most basic level is unappealing to me.  4-way shooter is sad. 1982's robotron was even 8-way and much smoother. I don't care for the non-repeating fire, but the long and short of it is that it needs a dual-stick configuration. 1980's Space Zap was a fine 4-way shooter, and that only worked because the enemies only approach from the cardinal 4 directions.  I simply did not find it engaging. When I was fighting my first boss monster, after I shot him 50 times and only dented his life bar, I spent the rest of the fight saying 'ho hum, this sucks.'  I'm dissapointed, as I'm a fan of roguelikes. (See author's nickname).  A note to all: from all reports, the rebirth version completely supercedes this original version, so there's practically no reason to buy this version.
9839	0	a	I'm a fan of random permadeath games. Binding of Isaac just didn't feel random enough. The rooms felt predefined and I'm pretty sure they are. The only thing that feels different is the layout of the map that you generate by going through each door.  For example, in Spelunky each room is generated from several smaller rooms in a way that makes it possible to get to the exit without bombs. Since there are many smaller rooms used to generate the full room, it feels different everytime. Every level you play will be totally different. The monster placement, the loot you will find, the long drops you will have to take, it is totally random.  Binding of Isaac just feels too repetitive.   One thing I like is that it does have a 'one more try' feel to it though. Even though I didn't like it much, I did find my self playing a few games even though I didn't enjoy them. Just because I wanted 'one more'.
9840	0	a	newgrounds
9841	0	a	I get that this game is supposed to be difficult, but I just find playing it too annoying to try to get any better. It honestly feels like it is just barely better than a Newgrounds flash game.  Pet peave: What do any of the items do??!! I should not have to keep wikipedia open to play a game. The learning curve should not include memorizing hundreds of items. Just put descriptions on the pause menu.   What I don't like:  Items. No descriptions. Both hands on keyboard. Uncomfortable. I would rather aim with the mouse. Bullet spread. Annoying.  Movement. Slippery, like I'm on ice. Lag.  Starting completely over. Not my taste.   What I like:  The atmosphere (graphics / music / etc). Has a good disturbing feel. The quantity of items. Too bad I have to constantly pause the game and check wiki.    
9842	0	a	Disgusting game, and a bit boring anyway. If you want to purchase this game, you are doing it at your own risk of wasting your money. PS: this is my first bad review and i think it will be the only one.
9843	0	a	Really bad
9844	0	a	Game is good, however it is built on flash, and that causes severe lag and stutter. Although game is really good, if u can bear with the lag that is constant, get it. if u dont want to, get rebirth.
9845	0	a	i like the storyline but i don't like the gameplay. it is slow and laggy. i reccomend rebirth. it runs at a faster rate and the first BOI chrashes a lot where the second one doesn't. i reccomend getting the second one before the first.
9846	0	a	Not a good game at all to me.
9847	0	a	What the ♥♥♥♥
9848	0	a	 A friend bought me this game, and as much as I've tried to enjoy it (and I am grateful they've took the time out to buy/give me something), I just couldn't. This must be the most disturbing, twisted, somewhat-gory, dark game I've had in my Library games list. I decided to take a stab at it anyway (pardon the pun), and before actually playing the game, I read the plot of it which disturbingly stuck in my mind for the rest of the time. At first, the gameplay was interesting; had to get used to the somewhat-different controls (arrows or the mouse used to shoot, and a, s, d, w to move around), and seeing what each room had in store. However, as you progress through the game, it gets too repetitive; you're basically doing the same actions/movement over and over, and just going from room to room on a flat floor. Similarly to what another reviewer said, I think I went into a doorway and some of my life/energy (whatever it's called) was knocked down a bit, and I'm not quite sure why. Nevertheless, I kept losing and dying anyway because the enemies seemed to have much more luck than I did with my flimsy items/weapons. This game is mainly all about luck too because sometimes the controls don't work properly, or it lags a bit, and boom, you've been attacked. Regarding that, if you die, you have to start all over again from the beginning; I wish there were save spots in this game version, but there isn't, which can get rather irritating, especially if you've gotten further than before. I don't know about you, but I'm usually not the type of person to get these kind of games. However, if you don't mind cartoon-gore and blood, hangings, suicide contemplations, rejection, bullying from peers, death/murder, child abuse, repetitive gameplay, the negativities of religion, and hideous-looking monsters, then this game is for you. Your character is basically a naked, tearful baby that cries its way through the game (until/unless you unlock more characters). 
9849	0	a	I don't know why I keep playing this game, I have afterbirth locked to 60 fps and this one is less than 20... I hope FLASH PLAYER dies in a campfire while I hit him with an axe.   P.D: I'm crazy and you Know IT
9850	0	a	This game is a huge letdown. I bought it after seeing videos of Rebirth and Afterbirth on YouTube, thinking it would be similar, but with a worse engine/platform and fewer items. Actually playing through the game, though, is a much worse experience than I expected.  Between 90 and 95% of my runs are bad because I can't find any good items, and most of the remainder are often screwed over by unfair rooms. For example, one of the rooms consists of a bunch of 1-character-wide 'bridges', and it often features a bunch of suicide bombers and other enemies that charge at you. They're impossible to kill before they get too close unless you have an incredibly overpowered build or flying.  Another grievance I have is that hitboxes are based on the shadows of projectiles, enemies, and your character. This makes it extremely difficult to dodge bullet hell areas, since avoiding the projectiles themselves often doesn't work.  These and many other things about the game make it not worth the money unless it's on a great sale. All in all, it's not a very fun game. It punishes you for what amounts to not winning the RNG lottery, and I don't think anyone would count that as good gameplay.
9851	0	a	I'm not sure why this game is so popular. I was sucked in by the hype, but it didn't grab me.
9852	0	a	♥♥♥♥ 
9853	0	a	crappy little flash game with some impossible to solve sections
9854	0	a	Would be great if the keyboard actually worked and it wasn't written in flash/
9855	0	a	I really want to like this game. First of all the graphics, sound and music are awesome. The enemies' designs are great and the atmosphere of the whole thing is really creepy good. But the gameplay is just letting me down, those controls. You move with wasd like normal, but then, you use the arrow keys to shoot, each one in a different direction. No. The game is difficult, it's meant to be difficult, but it feels like it's only difficult because the controls are clunky as hell. You don't have much health, and you'll be lucky to find any hearts hanging around to heal up. Most of the time the game comes down to luck, whether you'll get loads of enemies or nice items. I can see why people like this but it's pretty frustrating either having all the power or having none, and getting ♥♥♥♥ed up by the boss either way. Sad.
9856	0	a	Good game, when the game decide to not ♥♥♥♥ you in the ♥♥♥. If it wouldn't be for the crazy ♥♥♥ room with no space to move with mobs that 2 shot you from the other end of it and the fact that even if you are the best player in the world if you don't have good item you're ♥♥♥♥ed. The majority of the game is random and i'm okay with that, but it's VERY random, wich mean it does not look at what you have to defend yourself and put mobs wich can DESTROY YOU IN SECONDS.  Don't believe me? Try it out! You will stop playing in 10 minutes because you already died 5 time.
9857	0	a	The game is boring as ♥♥♥♥
9858	0	a	a truly piece of crap, i mean seriously, it stinks
9859	0	a	Massive frame drop issue. Barely unplayable.  Don't spend your money on this.  It's a ♥♥♥♥ing scam.
9860	0	a	Overrated. There is nothing particular new or enjoyable about the genre. Get Crypt of the Necrodancer knstead
9861	0	a	Buy rebirth instead.
9862	0	a	I want to like this game, but the design is random to the point of frustration. And not Dark Souls I died because I did something dumb frustration. No, with Binding of Isaac, you'll die because of bad random number generation and poor enemy/level combination.
9863	0	a	Pray to the RNG gods and hope for an item with Flying, basically. Every run hinges on a single roll of good RNG that you try to desperately cling to as you play, which is thematic but not fun.  I got way too frustrated with this game to care for its redeeming qualities. The story basically doesn't exist. It tries way too hard to be edgy in its themes and art style (Even though it does a somewhat good job at that), and is often just unfair in gameplay. Some more care put into balance and level design would make this a good game. It tries to be a Legend of Zelda style Rogue-like but ultimately I ask myself /why/ it tries to. Biblical adherence establishes a dark tone, but you could do that in a better way with an original story I feel. Good for certain YouTubers, or if you want to waste time, but nothing compelling or interesting to be found here overall.
9864	0	a	This Game Sucks. It was only 2 dollars, but it was a wasted 2 dollars.
9865	0	a	Disgusting game. Twisting everything we know. First of all - how about you kill your own mother, who turns out to be demon out of hell? Yeah, that's what this game is about...  DON'T PLAY THIS.
9866	0	a	I realise I am in the minority of not absolutely loving this game but I found it hard to get excited about this game. I'm probably not the ideal customer for this type of game anyway. I prefer games with a narrative, though obviously there are a ton of great games I enjoy that don't have that. But rogue-likes in general never have much of a story to tell.  The few hours I spend with Binding of Isaac made me feel like my fate was over-determined by chance. Sometimes I would find some money or a bomb early on and in those runs, things would go much smoother. In other runs, I'd find something less useful, and would die substantially sooner.  I know that death and re-trying is part of the appeal of Rogue-likes but there are other examples in the genre that made me feel more in control of my fate. I'm sure there are people out there who have mastered this game and can win no matter what starting condition.  I've never been the kind of person who really likes spending 40 or 50 hours on a single game, unlocking every achievement, mastering every nuance. I felt like it would take that kind of investment in Binding of Isaac to improve. After 2 hours of play, I hadn't really learned how to progress any further in the basement. I almost always died in approximately the same spots.  Clearly, a lot of people love this game, but it just didn't work for me.
9867	0	a	4/10  Pro: Fun story, design/art style and mechnaics   Con: In busy rooms there is a massive frame rate drop rendering the game unplayable.   I've heard this is a result of it being a flash game running solely on CPU, however I have a fairly powerful processor and still experience this frame rate drop, so I'm unsire if I'm missing somehting, Ive tried windowed mode low picture quality etc nothing helps. I've heard lots of similar complaints so almost deffinitely the designers fault, very dissapointing because when frame rate is normal it's a fun game.
9868	0	a	Can't recommend this version. Plays extremely choppy, not responsive at all.
9869	0	a	Wasn't what I expected and not really my cup of tea. I can't stand the art style either but it's probably a theme here that I'm missing. This game is very dark despite its cutesy appearence so I wouldn't recommend if you're into more happier things.
9870	0	a	I'm not very far. I just wanted to write a review... so far I don't like this game... at all.
9871	0	a	DONT BUY THIS GAME IT'S TERRIBLE ITS SO TERRIBLE THE WORST OF ALL TIME I CRY EVERYTIME DONT DO IT MAN 
9872	0	a	absolutely rubbish
9873	0	a	If you are wanting to get into the binding of isaac I recommend picking up rebirth instead of the original. Rebirth is practically the same as the original but with smoother gameplay and overall better experience. This game is good and fun but I find rebirth to be better and more enjoyable.
9874	0	a	This is not a negative review (I mean look at those hours). This is a fantastic game with replayability out the wazoo.   However : Dont buy this game. Instead buy the new one (Rebirth) instead. It includes every part of this game except the glitches, and adds an unbelievable amount of content. Plus it looks nicer.
9875	0	a	This game has a huge following. I don't know why. It's hard, it's indie and you start again when you die.
9876	0	a	I love this game. Have almost 200 hours in it. But don't buy this. Buy Rebirth. This game is laggy, poorly optimised and maybe a 10th as good as Rebirth. So go buy Rebirth and have some non-flash fun.
9877	0	a	origin story of all edgy people.   also a bad game.
9878	0	a	This game is so boring and the control just doesn't feel right. I have no idea why so many people like this game.
9879	0	a	This is a game I would rate M for Maybe Pros:  Cool visuals, awesome music Short but good story Some really fun and cool powerups Feels good to master Many different characters  Cons:  Too much rng! Some bad design flaws Items have useless descriptions  Although fewer cons, the randomness of this game just make it feel a bit lazyly designed. After you have mastered the game, it feels more often like the drops and what rooms appear decide the outcome of your run. Nowhere does this show as good as during some challenges and specific characters. The character who cannot gain red hearts can still get red heart drops. You can get tear powerups in challenges where you cannot use your tears.   This is a good game, but it still have a bit too much rng for me to give it a thumbs up.
9880	0	a	It wasn't on a mere whim that I chose to change my review from positive to negative after experiencing everything it has to offer.   After more than 30 hours with this game, it was already getting frustrating and repetitive to endure through so I left it. I came back to it years later thinking I wasn't good enough when I was younger and I could easily beat it now. But I was very wrong and on top of that, a hard mode was added which basically was a slap in the face to all the people that pushed themselves to master the game and earn every achievement only to find they now sit at 85% completion.  I do believe this game has fantastic music, aesthetics, mechanics and inspirations though. You can definitely see this game had thought put in but the end result is something that's not desirable in my position anymore. If you're like me, you don't have as much free time as the masochist gamers that enjoy roguelikes with RNG wasting over 50% of the time that you put into the game. This is why the roguelike genre almost died. Simply put, making your game artificially longer by making the player grind through everything they've already seen in a slightly different way isn't necessary in the modern era.  There's about 25 hours of pretty good content and novel experiences if you cut out the alternate (but pretty much the same) characters and hard mode, and it'd be fine if there were only that much gameplay. I think it might be better if the dungeon layout was fixed and the items were random, or if there was a checkpoint at the start of each floor, or if your stats let you dodge and fire without undue slowness. Perhaps even if the game didn't ramp up in difficulty after a few playthroughs, I would be willing to play again.  Lastly, there are no descriptions for many things in game so you'll have to have 5 wiki tabs open while you're playing.
9881	0	a	The second incarnation of this game has made it obsolete.
9882	0	a	You can´t remap any key and no pad support. 'Get the Remake for that'. Sorry, thats basics every game (and for sure such a high rated like this one) should have. I dont buy a Remake for 3x the $ just to get working control options!
9883	0	a	Only bought for soundtrack, obsolete with Rebirth and Afterbirth out.
9884	0	a	THIS GAME DOESN'T WORK I WANT A 75% REFUND ATLEAST
9885	0	a	The game depends too much on luck, the fact that you can just be screwed with what you get is bs and the lack of diagonal shooting is just bad. There is no reason to not be able to shoot diagonally and you end up just not being able to hit someone way too often because they not position in the main 4 directions for you. Could be fun with some adjustments.
9886	0	a	♥♥♥♥ this game dude.
9887	0	a	I'm just not that into roguelikes. This didn't hold me.
9888	0	a	Buy the new version please. This is out of date. Laggy as ♥♥♥♥, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics. It used to be worth it, but now you should just buy the new one.
9889	0	a	Lags on GTX 960. This videocard too old for this game?
9890	0	a	It is a good game but Rebirth is much better! and also bad graphics
9891	0	a	Whilst this game is a pure indie gem, this version is arguably invalid. Binding of Isaac:Rebirth has ALL of this game and the dlc, AS well as better controls, more content, better frames, and MORE dlc on top of that. This game isn'd at all bad in any way (except controls in flash, ugh) but Rebirth is a far better experince, buy that instead, its amazing.
9892	0	a	I guess i am just not the type who likes games like this, maybe because i am bad at it. Way too repetitive... 11/10 would creat the badge by trading other cards and not play this game again. If you have any questions how I gave any rating feel free to comment. Please keep in mind that this is my personal preferences:  Story: 7 (acctually read about it, pretty desent dungeon crawling story) Gameplay: 6 Voice Acting/Music: 3 Graphics: 7 Depth: 5 Flexibility: n/a Reward System: n/a  Total: 5.6/10
9893	0	a	I know this game is well loved, but I don't get it. The bad gameplay ruins the story progression. It's a zelda-like action RPG, but the unforgiving nature of its hardmode design coupled with weak controls = frustration. The game doesn't natively support gamepads, so if you want gamepad support you have to use a 3rd party tool to map keys to gamepad controls. Then you only have the cardinal directions.  Some attention to the controls and playability would have gone a long way. As it stands, it's just a frustrating mess.
9894	0	a	Interesting tech demo. Not a good game yet.
9895	0	a	Avoid this game. If you somehow find this game lurking in your library one day and have no idea where it came from... do not play this game. Rediculously luck based, everything is randomly generated, and the game is intended to make you rage more and more until you consider smashing things... Whatever you do, DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME. You will regret every second spent playing this after you have reached the final boss after countless attempts, to die to an impossible and completely unpredictable method of attack, with monsters and projectiles coming at you from every angle and no where to go to avoid them. You will die before completing a single playthrough infinitely. Well aquaintenced with this game's rage-qualities such as its unfair level of difficulty and luck, and familiar with its many tricks to making the player waste important resources for no reward in return, WHATSOEVER, I highly recommend for you to stay away from this game. And in the respect of other people, I sincerely hope you also can make them avoid this game as well, for no one should ever have to bear the frustration and rage that I have felt from playing this 'game'.
9896	0	a	What can I say, It's a game that when you close it down, the next time you run the game you have to start again! I don't particularly like that idea, I also don't enjoy the gameplay or graphics. First off, you run around throwing snowballs at mob and I think you have to use the arrow keys to move. Secondly, the game looks like someone just had a ♥♥♥♥ on you screen and drawn a man in it. However, the bosses and mobs are quite fun!
9897	0	a	Just awful. I don't understand why anyone would think this was fun.
9898	0	a	Er mah gerd, a downvote for a gud gaem!?! Yes, this game is ok, but very difficult and gor-ish. Lots of blood and restarts. If you get nailed by a boss, you are marked for RAGE. So not worth it.
9899	0	a	Soooooo. I don't really like this game, but I'm going to continue to play it because I don't like giving up on things and I haven't beaten it after an hour or so of play. This game is a flash-game quality product. It's barely worth the ~$2.50 I paid. You can get equal entertainment visiting the New Grounds site that is part of the credits. If you like simple games where you dodge projectiles, move and shoot using wsad &amp; the arrow keys respectively, this might be the cup of tea for you. For me, it is not. For just a few dollars though you can try it out and see if you like it or not. 7/14/12 (Steam Summer Sale)
9900	0	a	Looks to be a good game to sink hours into, but the control options are pathetic. If no rebindable keys, at least add controller support without having to download third party software...
9901	0	a	if its one thing I hate is a game that gets easier the longer you play it. Isaac starts out with a loose story about a crazy red state granny with a message from god to kill her son. you in some weird dillusion create these fantasy dungeons that are purely random to escape your fate. This is a big problem. when you need a key there arent any, when you need bombs, there arent any, when you need coin, nadda. sometimes the game is generous and gives you tons of cash but no store, lots of bombs with no place to use them(secret doors are hard to find), or compounding powerups that make you crazy powerful. Nothing is balanced. there is no story the random cuscenes are a tale of his life but are random too. Everything about this game screams FLASH. maybe these guys should stick to newgrounds.   4.5/10
9902	0	a	The Binding of Isaac has fun dungeon crawler elements, but much like Super Meatboy, it is way too punishing. At first, it was fun to play, but sooner than later, it became a quest to beat the game rather than enjoying it.  A part of me wants to get all the achievements and all the items and whatnot, but another part of me is just like: '♥♥♥♥ it'.  The Binding of Isaac; ♥♥♥♥ it.
9903	0	a	not something I could get into. It's not a bad game really but its not that good either
9904	0	a	BibleThump
9905	0	a	Do you like running in counterclockwise circles in what, for all intents and purposes, is the same room, fighting, for all intents and purposes, the same enemy, over and over? The label 'roguelike' is too often used to mask a boring, uninspired game and Issac is the classic example. Combat consists exclusively of running away and shooting behind you. Items are gimmicky and ultimately unhelpful. Boss fights are laughably easy. To top it all off, when I tried to enable my 360 controller, the options menu said 'Joy to key - google it!' My message to the developers? 'Game theory - GOOGLE IT!'  The saddest part is that certain elements of the game are actually quite good. I appreciate the randomly generated maps, the controls seem to be solid and glitch-free, and the music is well made and suits the mood. But without a solid game concept to apply these strengths to, it amounts to nothing more than masturbation. Issac is only slightly more appealing than one of the mounds of fecal matter that dot each level.
9906	0	a	I not Recommend this game is to hard and no Checkpoint!
9907	0	a	I want to recommend this, I really do. Good gameplay and kind of like a bloody kirby. But the problem is... really? A boss that has a lot of HP and no health restores at the fight or between the beginning and there? That is ridiculous. Also, this game is very dark. You're a child, who was going to be killed becuase he is 'not holy' by his mother. So his mother gets a knife and is about to kill the poor baby. But the baby finds a trap door and is now forced to kill demons with tears and the enemies kill Isaac with blood.  How messed up is that?
9908	0	a	Very interesting game with a huge variety of items and abilities to use, a jet-black dark sense of humor, and compelling roguelike mechanics. And yet none of this makes the gameplay any freaking good. With slippery physics, terrible hitboxes, and some poor design decisions in relation to character/enemy size and play space, the game becomes a chore to play. Perhaps you can push through the bad and get to the good this game has, but personally I wouldn't recommend spending the effort.
9909	0	a	An interesting platformer, but it's art style, difficulty, and just the overall game and concept just isn't for me.  4/10
9910	0	a	Sorry Isaac I just simply cant love ya.  The world is not just blood,s h1t,suffering and dust... Great idea anyway but not all of us.
9911	0	a	Boring and repetitive
9912	0	a	This game is so stupid. I died and I'm mad. This game is just like overpriced angry birds. Only buy if you enjoy black licorice.
9913	0	a	I hate this
9914	0	a	Meh.  Game is nice and polished, but has a bit too much of a flash game feeling. It's still pretty fun, and somehow a bit addictive despite the repetition and lack of depth. Room and boss difficulty varies wildly, making playthroughs very dependent on luck.  Would only recommend it if you can pick it up as part of a cheap bundle.
9915	0	a	I like rogue like games like FTL or Spelunky for their endless replayability and short playing time, but this one simply isn't very good in my opinion. The gameplay is that of an extremely simple top down shooter. You shoot at various creatures with the same 'weapon' (little blobs, probably tears?) and collect upgrades, most of which you won't even know what they're good for unless you look them up on a Wiki. Combined with a super high difficulty and the need to start from scratch every time you die it becomes boring very quickly. The only good I have to say about it is the unique atmosphere and story, which is morbid and funny at the same time.  One of the most overrated games I've played lately, but to each their own I guess.
9916	0	a	I really want to like this game. It's got great themes, an art style I dig, and it really is great, in some ways. I just cannot get into it. I find myself playing for ten minutes, getting bored with the one-dimensional combat system, and leaving. The themes and art get me to give it another try every so often, but I'm just not getting into it.  Dungeon crawlers don't need loads of excess mechanics for combat, inventory, etc. The simplicity isn't really a problem, and there's some replayability from the randomness. Something feels amiss. It's not terrible, but it's not very much fun, either, in my own opinion of course. I feel like games need to be praiseworthy for their concept and their execution both to really stand out among the throng, and while TBoI has good concept for theme, and good execution for gameplay and theme both, it lacks concept for gameplay credit from my perspective.  Games don't always need to do something new, but unless a game really blows you away or does something new, what's the point? I like games that either introduce me to new concepts, give me a new spin on something old, or just polishes something old to absolute perfection. I don't feel like TBoI really did any of these things, and so I don't think it's worth buying when there is a market absolutely saturated with great games to play.
9917	0	a	What a waste. You pay for a game hyped by everyone and what do you get? A laggy flash game which is basically a bad Zelda dungeon ripoff with some randomness thrown in. The most annoying thing is everything including the layout and items you find is totally random, which means some playthroughs are really easy and some forlorn only because of bad luck. You might as well waste your money on gambling. Also, with many items you don't know the effects, so everytime you find something you have to google it because exchanging a better item for a useless one might ruin the playthrough. The controls feel delayed and using the slow main 'weapon' is just a chore when every enemy takes many hits. Despite its randomness, the game gets boring really fast because at the core, it's just always the same.  The only good things are the music and how it mocks Christian fundamentalists.
9918	0	a	Lots of fun, but uses Flash.  Flash gives lots problems (and it probably does even if you are not aware of them), so I STROGLY recommend getting the Rebirth version once it's available.   It'll be more fun than the original, without any of the Flash shenanigans.
9919	0	a	This is a very good game but has some quality limitation because it using flash. The remake version should be better.
9920	0	a	Sadly, with native controller support, I could have really liked this game. Having a clumsy third party software solution really wasn't much of a solution.
9921	0	a	such a stupid game. no saves? give me a break. this game is unbalenced, uses random dungeons and boss order. so success is entirely random. expecting players to complete the entire game on one run is just silly. having rigid shooting so the player can't shoot diagonally removes any kind of skill requirement and reduces the player down to just spamming bullets in the rough direction of enemys. the hit detection is horrible, especially in the pin boss where you get hit if he is anywhere near you. This is a seriously overrated game 3/10, not worth playing.
9922	0	a	If you are atheist or agnostic, disregard this review. I'm not judging you or anyone who likes this game or even the people who made this game. It just makes me uncomfortable, and I wanted to give a heads-up to anyone else who might feel the same. &lt;3  This game is just ... awful. The one thing about this game that I don't despise is the soundtrack. Some may consider this game innovative, and others may consider it just plain disgusting. I bought this game before realizing that it was so utterly sacrilegious. Even if the controls on this game had been any good, and even if it had felt like anything more than a bad flash game, I couldn't give this a thumbs up and feel right about it. I feel absolutely disgusted to even have this in my game inventory. I just can't like a game that makes such a mockery of my religion. Some people will love this game; others will hate it, but I'm afraid that I'm going to have to give it a thumbs down. Again, I'm not judging anyone for liking this game; I'm just saying that, if you're like me, it will make you feel very uneasy. Due to the nature of my review, I won't be reading comments, by the way. I don't feel like reading a bunch of hate. Christian or not, I am human, y'know....
9923	0	a	The Binding of Isaac is a game that is incredibly short(about an hour long) and yet somehow so immediately repetitive. While the roguelike nature can make the game somewhat tense, but doesn't compensate for the boring level design and gameplay.
9924	0	a	I always heard this game get a lot of good 'word of mouth' but what the ♥♥♥♥ people? What is the appeal? Enemies can shoot in any direction and I can only shoot in 4 directions?
9925	0	a	Good game, however, lacks controller support (would be an amazing game with controller support. it actually tells you to google for a key-mapping software (yeah, google it!))
9926	0	a	Ain't worth $4.99! Its a simple ♥♥♥ game, I dont think its worth any of my cash.
9927	0	a	This little game is quite offensive to many different audiences.  I do not recommend this game with its bad and disgusting gameplay.
9928	0	a	my main problme with this game is that it is to dependant on luck, also it just dosen't make much sense, even for a video game. 4/10 kushala daoras
9929	0	a	Although I may not fully recommend this game,That is mainly for people who are just buying this, not as a whole.  This game is a fun action packed topdown video game, with many references to classic games such as the first Legend of zelda. Begginers will have a hard time if they have never played this before, as the shooting and walking controls, while useful at times, can be very frustrating, sometimes I feel there is either too much hearts when you don't need them, or too little when you do, but when you get things like chocolate milk, a charge based fire item, or other upgrades, it will seem you don't need the health when you blasting through rooms. All Of all give this game (of what little I've played so far) a 8/10  TL:DR  Pros: - lots of fun power ups, and the extra power-up DLC is cheap, so you get even more fun, for 6 or 7 bucks. -Bosses and normal mobs are hard, but balenced. - lot's of cool item rooms and reference rooms  Cons: - not much health to go around - faster enemies than you - Flies are evil in this game
9930	0	a	It was a dull game with disappointing controls. It was little more than an old flash game.
9931	0	a	If you enjoy twin-stick shooters with psuedo-random rooms, random unlocks, and permadeath written in Flash... well, you can still do better on any free game site. The Binding of Isaac is a terrible, grindy game that is only worthwhile if you value 'addictiveness' over substance. There's just not much actual gameplay to this game. It's shallow and dreadfully dull. The randomly generated rooms all look and play the same, and the enemies, while decent and actually fairly well designed, fall flat because of it. The unlocks, while adding a bit of depth to the game, don't add nearly enough to save this poorly executed attempt.   Just don't buy it, it's not worth it.
9932	0	a	Some good ideas in the game but... terrible controls (oh, really, no gamepad support ?) and high level of frustration ruins the game. Don't buy this overhyped crap unless you really want to pay someone who hates players.
9933	0	a	This game is hard and I hate it.
9934	0	a	Essentially, it's a time killer for casual players, a 2D top view shooter (you are shooting tears as your bullets). A rogue-like game in which you make your way through random dungeons (randomized rooms, items found, boss encounters). Not for those looking for gameplay depth or a story.  I'm not the target audience for this type of game, thus the poor reception.  If you buy it at all, wait till it goes on sale.
9935	0	a	Just look at all these hours people have clocked. Look at mine.  Think what all else you could be doing.
9936	0	a	Massively overrated. If you want to pay for a game that you should get for free online at some site thats trying to sell you porn subscriptions then feel free. As the idea of link from the orginal legend of zelda going through room upon room of beasts sent from hell to devour his soul SOUNDS cool it takes a bit away when your not a hero wit ha sword but a naked little boy whos been frequently beat by his mother. I would however highly recommend this to someone your annoyed with and trying to turn off from video games, the monoteny and pointlessness of the overall quest makes you question your life and realize that cleaning the kitchen is infintely more satifying.
9937	0	a	Do not buy this. A really poor Zelda clone. This should come as free for those that like disturbing games.
9938	0	a	A mediocre twin-stick shooter which you play with the keyboard, meaning you can only move/shoot up, down, left, and right. It's got a horrendous learning curve, but if you're into that, it's also got a lot of depth to it. (Much like Super Meat Boy in that regard.)  Graphics are crude, which is just laziness and not an excuse if you're an indie (too many beautifully-rendered indie games as counter-examples). The soundtrack is groovy though. Although based on Bible events, I'm reliably informed that the theology of this game is suspect.  Recommendation: Skip.
9939	0	a	Actually this game is quite enjoyable but it can literally drive you crazy if you can't handle it. It is not a recommended game because it makes me nervous, more nervous than I am.
9940	0	a	Aaah, Isaac you poor boy. This game is absolutely nuts in a genius, brilliant way! However it can get really laggy which could do with being fixed. Some of the bosses are also far to difficult/impossible, especially 'Mom'.  Also why make a DLC which could easily be just an update to the game, sorry developers but thats a bit bad.  The only reason I would not recommend the game is because of the impossible bosses and final boss.
9941	0	a	I tried swallowing a spoon and eating a pentagram irl
9942	0	a	this game sucks balls 0/10
9943	0	a	Really good game, keeps you entertained for quite some time, and you never know what you'll get the next dungeon! Edit: I lied, this game sucks.
9944	0	a	It's an arcade game, and I've learned that I don't have much of a taste for that style of game thanks to this one. It doesn't cater to my tastes, but I suppose that's just me. It's cheap, and it's your money. Check out the gameplay before you make a choice is what I'd suggest.
9945	0	a	Not my slice of cake. The style is excellent and if the dev made something that played different I would almost certainly enjoy it.
9946	0	a	it's okay if you like that sort of thing!!!  would play it on my phone, crap-top.......... sorry lap-top or tablet sat on a train, but not on my PC waste of horse power!!!
9947	0	a	Played once, it's garbage.
9948	0	a	Yes, this game can be fun. for about 10 mins as this game is EXTREMELY difficult. What's the point in a game that you can't enjoy because you're dying every 10 seconds ?
9949	0	a	It's a subpar twin stick-style shooter with a few RPG elements. If you want any controller support at all you must use joy2key. It even says it in the game. Lazy design, and lackluster gameplay that should have remained as a free flash game on Newgrounds.
9950	0	a	can't get the wrath of the lamb to work and it takes an act of congress to find support for it.
9951	0	a	timewaste
9952	0	a	+++DON'T BUY 'THE BINDING OF ISAAC', SPECIALLY 'WRATH OF THE LAMB'!+++ If you really wanna play this f*****g game, wait till the remake is finally available. I hope the upcoming remake fixes a lot of issues in this game, I'm gonna mention some of them here.  When I think about this game, the main words that come to my mind are: UNBALANCED, CHEAP, LAZY and BROKEN.  &gt; As it is a sandbox, everytime you start a new game, it's a new experience. That's cool, ok. The problem is that in most of the games generated, the challenge is very unfair. In some games you find a lotta rooms with the most annoying enemies ready to *ape your *ss and you really can't scape from them. That happens, for instance, when you are surrounded by those f*****g shooting flies, spiders, charging worms, menstruation shooting **ginas, hanged motherf*****s and you don't have enough room to dodge their attacks. Many times you hardly get (good) items, instead of getting power ups, you get f*****g 'power downs'! Not to mention that in some games you find the hardest bosses. Also, whenever you get or try to activate an item/power up, there is a damn laggy animation that renders you vulnerable to attacks. Differently from most of the games, you only get a split second invulnerable when you get hit, that makes it even worst by the fact that enemies can get you stuck and you can't pass through them. When you're about to die and managed to kill a boss but there is a bomb about to drop on your head, it's game over. That's all so CHEAP... &gt; However, in a minority of cases, it's all the other way around! You find the easiest enemies and bosses, you get the best items and power ups. And in a even minority of cases, the difficulty would be balanced. You gotta be very lucky to have a fair game. Those examples show you how UNBALANCED this damn game is. &gt; Ok, I understand that flash format imposes a lotta limitations for game development. For instance, it makes impossible to include a save feature, ok. However, there are no excuses for not including a few lives or continues, just one would be very helpful. There are tons of different power ups and items in the game, however, the game developer didn't bother adding descriptions for most of them (the worst is that this a**hole don't wanna do it for the upcoming remake). Item descriptions would be very helpful for not ruining even more the hard time that you may have playing this s***. I don't live for playing games, I only do it casually for having fun, I don't have time to study what all hundreds of stuff do in this game. Yesterday I was very lucky (for my surprise) for getting a balanced challenge and good stuff, however, it screwed up when I got the f*****g brimstone, which is a horrible 'power up'. If there was a little description of what that c*** does, I wouldn't have got that. Controls customization/setup? Awful, such a pain in the *ss! Those kind of of stuff pictures how LAZY this game was made. &gt; 'Wrath of the Lamb' adds more UNBALANCED, CHEAP and LAZY layers of s*** to this game. I really regret getting DLC expansion, I think I'd have a better time playing without it.  It's a shame that The Binding of Isaac actually has a great potential to be a very good and fun game, I gotta admit that I had a good time playing it a couple of times (when I was a little lucky). However, it is brutally ruined by all those issues. I'd only buy the remake of this game if all this c*** is fixed. I honestly tried hard to enjoy this game, but I can't take it anymore, I give up. If you are a masoquist or hardcore gamer that don't mind playing a BROKEN game, with enough time to waste studying all the stuff of this game, you're gonna enjoy it. Otherwise, you're not gonna have fun, it will only frustrate and p**s you off. Such a waste of money, I'm uninstalling this piece of s*** right now.
9953	0	a	WAS a great game. If you want to play Binding Of Isaac in all of it's glory, get The Binding Of Isaac Rebirth, wich is pretty much what this game should've been from the beginning.
9954	0	a	The Binding of Isaac is roguelike that has a ludicrous amount of variety and playthrough. It's fun game in that almost every playthrough of it will evolve differently and Isaac (or whoever else you choose to play as) will end up looking different. And since every playthrough is relatively short and you can literally start a playthrough in less than 10 seconds after pressing 'play', it's quite a good game to waste some time with.  However, the game is   so   unbalanced that it's basically like a game of hide and seek with a blind cripple: Sometimes you're the blind cripple and other times you're (more or less literally) Superman with X-ray vision; on one hand you can meet a superversion of a miniboss in the very first room you enter, and on the other, with a combination of two items, you can literally become invincible. And that there are so many items is mostly a good thing, but since there is no description for the item, you have to pause the game, enter your browser and google what the item does, and that tends to break the flow somewhat. The game uses Flash as an engine, and there is only so much you can do with Flash. For example, the maximum aviablable resolution is 1280x800, the graphic options are limited to high, medium or low, and the sound and music is either off or on. The game doesn't have controller support (other than asking you to google 'JoyToKey' (which is ♥♥♥♥)), which means that if you don't have a mechanical keyboard, you  will experience keyboard ghosting , which to me is a pretty big problem. Enemies hardly telegraph their attack, meaning the only way to avoid getting hit is to remember their pattern of attack, and sometimes you'll find yourself in a position where it impossible in every way to not get hit. Some enemies can jump across the entire room in a split second, leaving you with less than half a second to react and move. However, half the bosses I met could easily be defeated by standing in one place, shooting across the the room and only moving when the boss comes close to you, which I'm not sure I would consider fun. What I am sure I wouldn't consider fun is when find yourself facing a boss that you basically can't defeat at all, either because you lack an item that would make the fight 100 times easier, or you accidentally picked up an item that teleports you out of the room as soon as you take a single hit, or leaves you at 1 heart but 9 lives (and 1 heart every time you die, regardless of how many hearts you got on the previous life). And my final complaint about the game is the aesthetic: It's ♥♥♥♥ing gross. Seriously, there's poop and ♥♥♥♥ and blood all over. There's items like 'Mom's pad' or 'Sister Maggy' (which is a red, dead floating fetus that cries blood).  So yeah, a somewhat fun game that has too many flaws to be recommended in my opinion
9955	0	a	 A pretty cool game i think its randumb and every run will be unique i think so yes buy it its cheap, k?  Nevermind the remake came out already buy that ♥♥♥♥ instead lol
9956	0	a	Not the roguelike I was promised.
9957	0	a	If you remember the original Zelda (for NES), and the dungeons in that game, you've pretty much experienced everything this game has to offer minus a few really sadistic bosses and a plot line that appears to be designed to make you feel uncomfortable. I was really kind of surprised how much this game lifts from it's obvious inspiration, all the way to using bombs to blow up walls to access secret rooms.
9958	0	a	Under control options it says: 'Use Joy2Key.'   This is one of those games where, instead of patching-in basic functionality, they made a 'sequel' that is nearly identical except it that it works better.  Us suckers who got the original are just sucka's
9959	0	a	My brother bought this game a while back, and all of a sudden, I (his sister) cannot play it. I was recently playing it a couple hours ago. It is saying that the game is not purcheased and I need to purchase it again. Please fix this somehow as I'm sure my brother will not want to buy the game again!!! Ugh...
9960	0	a	Warning!: Wish someone would have told me this, i bought this version of Binding of Isaac and then i bought Binding of Issac: Rebirth. Thinkin it was the sequel to this game, but... Surprise!! they were NOT! :c (Its my fault for not doing a little bit of research, but now you know too!.)  I dont know if to recommend this version, dont get me wrong, the game is AMAZING (Even tho it was developed in Flash and has TONS of performance issues and FPS drops). Id say go buy: The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth. Instead, since its a 'rework/expansion' per say, with lots of improvements, better coding, more items, more chars.  This game is really good, its really fun to play it over and over again, the only reason i have 4hrs into the game is because i switched to Rebirth version once i discovered they were the same, but with lots of new content and WAAAY Better performance.   
9961	0	a	Here's the thing. I love this game... but I can't recommend it. I'm sorry. The fact that this game is a Flash port just makes it impossible to play due to it's lag. You'd be better off buying Rebirth, considering it isn't a Flash port (thus no lag) and there are loads more features added.
9962	0	a	Since there's a sequel, just get that. It has all the charm of this one in a better package.
9963	0	a	Buggy but not game breaking. You are meant to beat the game over and over but I got bored of it after beating it just a few times.
9964	0	a	To me, this game is the physical incarnation of frustration and therefore I can't recommend it to anyone; in my opinion games are supposed to be fun and I didn't have any playing this Flash game. The only features I like are the character designs, the music and the contrast between gore and deformed enemies on the one hand and the fact that everything is drawn in a cute, thick lined stile on the other. And that's about it.  In my opinion, the main issue in this game is balancing and how heavily it leans on sheer luck. Before you've unlocked any other characters, you will play as Isaac, who has three hearts for health. Most things that hurt you (such as touching a fly or getting hit by a blood drop) will take away half a heart, while some others (such as explosions from bombs) will take away an entire one. Initially, the only weapons against your enemies are your tear drop shooting eyes, which only shoot in four different directions, one direction at once. Many enemies will be capable at shooting blood drops in either more directions or multiple directions at once, will suddenly charge you, will be capable of jumping or flying over obstacles you have to walk around or a combination of these abilities. While shooting in four directions, you will find yourself more than once being unavoidably driven into a corner shooting enemies while in the end getting hit by something anyway. This is most prevalent in boss levels; many bosses spawn smaller enemies, giving you the choice to either kill the boss first so he will stop spawning more enemies that will trap you, or to kill the enemies so they can't trap you while the boss just keeps spawning more enemies. And just try to dodge enemies when you always slide a bit. Since everything tries to kill you, you'll heavily depend on the pick ups you can get and rooms you'll venture into (levels are randomly generated). And that's where bad luck will get you. Such as having keys but nothing unlockable to use them for, or having lots of locked items around but no keys to unlock them with. Or a huge amount of enemies and no hearts spawning to heal you. There are also numerous pick ups with no description whatsoever that can either increase or decrease your health and your abilities and rooms that will pain you upon entering and leaving with no guarantee there will be something good in them.  TL;DR: Everything tries to kill you and only if you're very lucky, the game will grant you something to either fight your enemies or improve your health, all while being limited to shooting in four directions.  If you're no masochist, please don't be misled by the fact that the user reviews are 'overwhelmingly positive'.
9965	0	a	How are people playing this? The controls are worse than I AM BREAD
9966	0	a	Cannot use a controller on the old version. 3/10 get the remake
9967	0	a	Nah. this game is subpar, it brings me back to the days I played on  kongregate.com  and flash games were the stuff! But.. those same flash games are better than this game. Pixel shooter? Ive seen so many flash games with the same combat system. Please If you have $100+ to spend im sure this is nothing so go ahead and spend money on a game that may be fun if you've never played this genre before. But if you have $5 and are looking for the best way to spend that $5, well turn around and go to some other game
9968	0	a	hate it i just hate it ever run i do i just find crap i hate it
9969	0	a	This game gave me fart aids
9970	0	a	lts funny to watch other peop;e
9971	0	a	This game will take an hour of your life and just say:''Hey you like to die right? It may just be that I don't get the fun of this game or it may be me just sucking but I just can't stand randomness. I try to like it but I just can't. For instance let's just take the random room generator, you can have a really good run (if the game gives you good items wich are also random may I add) and then the game decides to give you a really annoying room and you die and lose an hour of you life. This game is challenging but not in a good way, it's challenging in an unfair way. Randomness is not a good way to make something harder, it's just really annoying. The only thing I like about this game is the artstyle and the story. That's why I give this game a 5/10.  
9972	0	a	Twin-stick shooter controls without the use of, you know, two sticks on a controller? Yep. Repetitive, visually bland, and slows down with the controller emulator I use (I use Pinnacle, for reference). The developers actually list - in the options - using an emulator (I'm not going to name-drop here) to use a controller. I just use a different one. Months (a year?) later, they still haven't added this essential feature.  Don't bother, unless you like mouse/keyboard for your twin-stick games (or maybe if the Steam Controller makes the necessary bridge between mouse/keyboard and controller for this game to work right).
9973	0	a	Binding of Issac with Joy2Key - $5 Binding of Issac with Controller Support - $15  Wonderful idea!
9974	0	a	This game makes no sense. You die and have to start all over. I hate this
9975	0	a	Clunky and runs like crap, get Rebirth instead. The music is good though
9976	0	a	Too random to be fun. Any time you start to enjoy yourself you get cheesed in the next room. 'Rogue-like elements' is a poor excuse for unbalanced trash. Its a shame, the art style and some of the items lead you to think you are about to have fun. But this game is a time thief and it hates fun.
9977	0	a	This game is actually extremely fun, but there's no point in buying it because The Binding of Isaac Rebirth is better in literally every way. So yeah, pass on this one.
9978	0	a	I don't like this game. The theme is just way to crude with the poop everywhere. Don't really like the style. I like Zelda though, but this game does not have style that is similar.
9979	0	a	The game was good the first time I played it but I forgot about it for a while. Bout a year later when I went to play and reinstall it, the app kept crashing no matter what I did. Even confirming the content never worked nor did the app ever fix. Just so you know the app wouldnt open and then close: Steam would begin the startup and crash it. There would be no homepage for the game or music, just the annoying box that said the app crashed. When I would search online there would be no browser open to fix it. Either my computer is stupid as all hell or it is just a broken game.
9980	0	a	I do not like the idea of restarting from the beginning after you die. It becomes boring and lowers the replay value.
9981	0	a	Weird as hell.
9982	0	a	i can't get into this overrated game tbh. i mean there's a guy on twitch who just smokes marly reds and plays this game 12 hours a day when there's doom and ♥♥♥♥♥
9983	0	a	Bad game, runs in flash, lazy programming. At least they tried with the sequel.  You know they're desperate when they're selling the game for 39 pence
9984	0	a	This game has a nice atmosphere and twisted ''dark humor'', but has mediocre and monotonous gamplay without any feeling of progression...
9985	0	a	If you're not fond of really hard and badly controlled games, don't buy this game. Please don't.
9986	0	a	do not get this game  it has a really fun art style and story but you are essentially guessing a number out of then and seeing if youre right. a lot of items you get as a reward hurt you or downgrade your stats or just suck and make the game unwinable like charge shots.a major point of the game is replay value and if the success of a replay is based entirely of luck like with this game there's really no point.

9988	0	a	It's fun for a short while, but too simplistic and annoying to control.
9989	0	a	Watched Nilesy of the Yogscast and The Game Grumps play this game before buying it and trying to play it. Seems like it would be fun if the controls were just slightly more fine tuned and responsive. Good game but not my taste.  5/10 don't want to fight my mom again.
9990	0	a	This game is very fun to play for the first 10 hours. It then gets kind of boring because it basiclly repeates over and over. I do not recommend this game.
9991	0	a	Don't buy this game. It's amazing, but the remake is infinitely better. With hundreds of hours in the two games combined, I still have trouble coming back to this game after experiencing the godly bliss that is The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth.  Only buy this game if you're a hardcore fan, in which case you probably own it already.
9992	0	a	Literally the only reason I don't recommend this is because the remaster, The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is better and you should go buy it instead. This is a great game but Rebirth is better.
9993	0	a	This game really isn't worth the money spent on it. It gets extremely repetitive extremely quickly and the stmosphere isn't as shocking as it wants it to be. Admittingly, it was pretty fun when I first picked it up, but everything about it got old quickly. I'm just glad that I got this game as a gift and didn't waste my own money on it.
9994	0	a	its seems like i kan never get past anny of the bosses,,, EVER! THATS IT IM DONE. THANK YOU BUT NO THAKS ! my hart cant handle it anny more sorry maybe just not my type of game but annyway i'm allways losing
9995	0	a	Not worth the cash. The bad part of roguelikes without any of the good. Totally random, but you have no skills and there are no RPG elements.
9996	0	a	Pros: Interesting story fun power ups mutiple play though options and endings  Cons: hard as fudge die and restart the whole game no co op
9997	0	a	I seriously don´t see what is the big deal. It is pretty tame, and plays like a PS1 game.
9998	0	a	Amazing. But don't buy this, buy 'The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth.'
9999	0	a	Get TBOI Rebirth instead. The downside of creating the perfect remake, anything you can get here, there's a better one there.  The only reason to get this now is if you can't afford that additional $10. In which case, you probably shouldn't purchase games right now.
